Major League Baseball MLB is a professional baseball league and the highest level of organized baseball in the United States and Canada One of the big four major leagues MLB comprises teams divided equally between the National League NL and the American League AL with in the United States and in Canada Formed in and respectively the NL and AL cemented their cooperation with the National Agreement in making MLB the oldest major professional sports league in the world They remained legally separate entities until when they merged into a single organization led by the Commissioner of Baseball MLB is headquartered in Midtown Manhattan br Baseball s first all professional team the Cincinnati Red Stockings was founded in The first few decades of professional baseball saw rivalries between leagues and players often jumped from one team or league to another These practices were essentially ended by the National Agreement of in which AL and NL agreed to respect each other s player contracts including the contentious reserve clause br The period before was the dead ball era when home runs were rarely hit Professional baseball was rocked by the Black Sox Scandal a conspiracy to fix the World Series Baseball survived the scandal albeit with major changes in its governance as the relatively weak National Commission was replaced with a powerful Commissioner of Baseball with near unlimited authority over the sport br MLB rose in popularity in the decade following the Black Sox Scandal and unlike major leagues in other sports it endured the Great Depression and World War II without any of its teams folding Shortly after the war Jackie Robinson broke baseball s color barrier br Some moved to different cities in the s and s The AL and NL added eight clubs in the s two in two in and four in Player discontent with established labor practices especially the reserve clause led to the organization of the Major League Baseball Players Association to collectively bargain with the owners which in turn led to the introduction of free agency in baseball br Modern stadiums with artificial turf surfaces began to change the game in the s and s Home runs dominated the game during the s In the mid s media reports disclosed the use of anabolic steroids among MLB players a investigation produced the Mitchell Report which found that many players had used steroids and other performance enhancing substances including at least one player from each team br Each team plays games per season with Opening Day traditionally held during the first week of April Six teams in each league then advance to a four round postseason tournament in October culminating in the World Series a best of seven championship series between the two league champions first played in The New York Yankees have the most championships with The reigning champions are the Texas Rangers who defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks in the World Series br MLB is the second wealthiest professional sports league by revenue in the world after the National Football League NFL Baseball games are broadcast on television radio and the internet throughout North America and in several other countries MLB has the highest total season attendance of any sports league in the world in it drew more than million spectators br MLB also oversees Minor League Baseball which comprises lower tier teams affiliated with the major league clubs and the MLB Draft League a hybrid amateur professional showcase league MLB and the World Baseball Softball Confederation jointly manage the international World Baseball Classic tournament br br br Organizational structure br MLB is governed by the Major League Baseball Constitution This document has undergone several incarnations since its creation in Under the direction of the Commissioner of Baseball MLB hires and maintains the sport s umpiring crews and negotiates marketing labor and television contracts MLB maintains a unique controlling relationship over the sport including most aspects of Minor League Baseball This is due in large part to the U S Supreme Court ruling in Federal Baseball Club v National League which held that baseball is not interstate commerce and therefore not subject to federal antitrust law MLB is the only league that has such a status and has not faced any competition since this case This ruling has been weakened only slightly in subsequent years The weakened ruling granted more stability to the owners of teams and has resulted in values increasing at double digit rates There were several challenges to MLB s primacy in the sport with notable attempts to establish competing leagues occurring during the late s from to with the short lived Federal League and in with the aborted Continental League br The chief executive of MLB is the commissioner Rob Manfred The deputy commissioner of baseball administration and chief legal officer is Dan Halem There are seven other executives executive vice president and general counsel chief operations and strategy officer chief communications officer chief financial officer and senior advisor executive vice president and chief marketing officer chief revenue officer and chief baseball development officer br The multimedia branch of MLB is MLB Advanced Media which is based in New York City This branch oversees MLB com and each of the teams websites Its charter states that MLB Advanced Media holds editorial independence from the league but it is under the same ownership group and revenue sharing plan MLB Productions is a similarly structured wing of the league focusing on video and traditional broadcast media MLB also owns percent of MLB Network with the other percent split between several cable operators and satellite provider DirecTV It operates out of studios in Secaucus New Jersey and also has editorial independence from the league br br br League organization br In the weak National Commission created to manage relationships between the two leagues was replaced with the much more powerful Commissioner of Baseball who had the power to make decisions for all of professional baseball unilaterally From to the American and National Leagues fielded eight teams apiece br In the s MLB expansion added eight teams including the first non U S team the Montreal Expos Two teams the Seattle Mariners and the Toronto Blue Jays were also added in the s From through each league consisted of an East and West Division In the National League expanded with two teams the Florida Marlins and the Colorado Rockies to even up the number of teams in both leagues A third division the Central Division was formed in each league in Until the two leagues met on the field only during the World Series and the All Star Game Regular season interleague play was introduced in br In March two new franchises the Arizona Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Devil Rays now known as the Tampa Bay Rays were awarded by MLB which began play in This addition brought the total number of franchises to In early MLB decided to assign one new team to each league Tampa Bay joined the AL and Arizona joined the NL The original plan was to have an odd number of teams in each league per league with five in each division but in order for every team to be able to play daily this would have required interleague play to be scheduled throughout the entire season However it was unclear at the time if the interleague play would continue after the season as it had to be approved by the players union For this and other reasons it was decided that both leagues should continue to have an even number of teams and therefore one existing club would have to switch leagues The Milwaukee Brewers agreed in November to move from the AL to the NL thereby making the NL a team league At the same time the Detroit Tigers agreed to move from the AL East to the AL Central to replace Milwaukee with the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays joining the AL East Later when the Houston Astros changed ownership prior to the season the team moved from the NL Central to the AL West resulting in both leagues having three divisions of five teams each and allowing all teams to have a more balanced schedule Interleague play is now held throughout the season br In the AL and NL were dissolved as legal entities and MLB became a single overall league de jure similar to the National Football League NFL National Basketball Association NBA and National Hockey League NHL albeit with two components called leagues instead of conferences The same rules and regulations are used in both leagues with one former exception the AL operated under the designated hitter DH rule while the NL did not br In the National League NL used the designated hitter DH rule for the first time As part of the settlement of the Major League Baseball lockout this change was made permanent thus making the rules in the two leagues identical br br br Teams br br br br An asterisk denotes a relocation of a franchise See respective team articles for more information br br br History br br br Founding br In the s aided by soldiers playing the game in camp during the Civil War New York style baseball expanded into a national game and spawned baseball s first governing body the National Association of Base Ball Players NABBP The NABBP existed as an amateur league for years By more than clubs were members Most of the strongest clubs remained those based in the Northeastern United States For professional baseball s founding year MLB uses the year when the first professional team the Cincinnati Red Stockings was established br A schism developed between professional and amateur ballplayers after the founding of the Cincinnati club The NABBP split into an amateur organization and a professional organization The National Association of Professional Base Ball Players often known as the National Association NA was formed in Its amateur counterpart disappeared after only a few years The modern Chicago Cubs and Atlanta Braves franchises trace their histories back to the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players in the s br In the National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs later known as the National League or NL was established after the NA proved ineffective The league placed its emphasis on clubs rather than on players Clubs could now enforce player contracts preventing players from jumping to higher paying clubs Clubs were required to play the full schedule of games instead of forfeiting scheduled games when the club was no longer in the running for the league championship which happened frequently under the NA A concerted effort was made to curb gambling on games which was leaving the validity of results in doubt The first game in the NL on Saturday April at Jefferson Street Grounds in Philadelphia is often pointed to as the beginning of MLB br br The early years of the NL were tumultuous with threats from rival leagues and a rebellion by players against the hated reserve clause which restricted the free movement of players between clubs Teams came and went was the first season where the league s membership was the same as the preceding season s and only four franchises survived to see Competitor leagues formed regularly and also disbanded regularly The most successful was the American Association sometimes called the beer and whiskey league for its tolerance of the sale of alcoholic beverages to spectators For several years the NL and American Association champions met in a postseason championship series the first attempt at a World Series The two leagues merged in as a single team NL but the NL dropped four teams after the season This led to the formation of the American League in under AL president Ban Johnson and the resulting bidding war for players led to widespread contract breaking and legal disputes br The war between the AL and NL caused shock waves throughout the baseball world At a meeting at the Leland Hotel in Chicago in the other baseball leagues negotiated a plan to maintain their independence A new National Association was formed to oversee these minor leagues br After the NL AL and NA signed a new National Agreement which tied independent contracts to the reserve clause contracts The agreement also set up a formal classification system for minor leagues the forerunner of today s system that was refined by Branch Rickey br br br Other recognized leagues br Several other early defunct baseball leagues are considered major leagues and their statistics and records are included with those of the two modern major leagues In the Special Baseball Records Committee of Major League Baseball officially recognized six major leagues the National League American League American Association Union Association Players League and Federal League The status of the National Association as a major league has been a point of dispute among baseball researchers while its statistics are not recognized by Major League Baseball its statistics are included with those of other major leagues by some baseball reference websites such as Retrosheet Some researchers including Nate Silver dispute the major league status of the Union Association by pointing out that franchises came and went and that the St Louis club was deliberately stacked the St Louis club was owned by the league s president and it was the only club that was close to major league caliber br In December Major League Baseball announced its recognition of seven leagues within Negro league baseball as major leagues the first and second Negro National Leagues and the Eastern Colored League the American Negro League the East West League the Negro Southern League and the Negro American League In baseball reference website Baseball Reference com began to include statistics from those seven leagues into their major league statistics In May Major League Baseball announced that it was absorbing the available Negro Leagues numbers into the official historical record br br br Dead ball era br br The period between and is commonly referred to as the dead ball era Games of this era tended to be low scoring and were often dominated by pitchers such as Walter Johnson Cy Young Christy Mathewson Mordecai Brown and Grover Cleveland Alexander The term also accurately describes the condition of the baseball itself The baseball used American rather than the modern Australian wool yarn and was not wound as tightly affecting the distance that it would travel More significantly balls were kept in play until they were mangled soft and sometimes lopsided During this era a baseball cost three dollars equal to today in inflation adjusted USD and owners were reluctant to purchase new balls Fans were expected to throw back fouls and rare home runs Baseballs also became stained with tobacco juice grass and mud and sometimes the juice of licorice which some players would chew for the purpose of discoloring the ball br Also pitchers could manipulate the ball through the use of the spitball In use of this pitch was restricted to a few pitchers with a grandfather clause Additionally many ballparks had large dimensions such as the West Side Grounds of the Chicago Cubs which was feet m to the center field fence and the Huntington Avenue Grounds of the Boston Red Sox which was feet m to the center field fence thus home runs were rare and small ball tactics such as singles bunts stolen bases and the hit and run play dominated the strategies of the time Hitting methods like the Baltimore chop were used to increase the number of infield singles On a successful Baltimore chop the batter hits the ball forcefully into the ground causing it to bounce so high that the batter reaches first base before the ball can be fielded and thrown to the first baseman br The adoption of the foul strike rule in the NL in in the AL two years later quickly sent baseball from a high scoring game to one where scoring runs became a struggle Before this rule foul balls were not counted as strikes a batter could foul off any number of pitches with no strikes counted against him this gave an enormous advantage to the batter br After the World Series between the Chicago White Sox and Cincinnati Reds baseball was rocked by allegations of a game fixing scheme known as the Black Sox Scandal Eight players Shoeless Joe Jackson Eddie Cicotte Claude Lefty Williams George Buck Weaver Arnold Chick Gandil Fred McMullin Charles Swede Risberg and Oscar Happy Felsch intentionally lost the World Series in exchange for a ring worth in dollars Despite being acquitted all were permanently banned from Major League Baseball br br br Rise in popularity br Baseball s popularity increased in the s and s The season was notable for the death of Ray Chapman of the Cleveland Indians Chapman who was struck in the head by a pitch and died a few hours later became the only MLB player to die of an on field injury Both leagues quickly began to require the use of new white baseballs whenever a ball became scuffed or dirty helping bring the dead ball era to an end br The following year the New York Yankees made their first World Series appearance By the end of the s the team had appeared in World Series winning eight of them Yankees slugger Babe Ruth had set the single season home run record in hitting home runs breaking his own record of home runs br Afflicted by the Great Depression baseball s popularity had begun a downward turn in the early s By only two MLB teams turned a profit Attendance had fallen due at least in part to a federal amusement tax added to baseball ticket prices Baseball owners cut their rosters from men to and even the best players took pay cuts Team executives were innovative in their attempts to survive creating night games broadcasting games live by radio and rolling out promotions such as free admission for women Throughout the Great Depression no MLB teams moved or folded br br br World War II era br The onset of World War II created a shortage of professional baseball players as more than men left MLB teams to serve in the military Many of them played on service baseball teams that entertained military personnel in the US or in the Pacific MLB teams of this time largely consisted of young men older players and those with a military classification of F indicating mental physical or moral unsuitability for service Men like Pete Gray a one armed outfielder got the chance to advance to the major leagues However MLB rosters did not include any black players through the end of the war Black players many of whom served in the war were still restricted to playing Negro league baseball br Wartime blackout restrictions designed to keep outdoor lighting at low levels caused another problem for baseball These rules limited traveling and night games to the point that the season was nearly canceled On January MLB Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis wrote to U S President Franklin D Roosevelt pleading for the continuation of baseball during the war Roosevelt responded I honestly feel that it would be best for the country to keep baseball going There will be fewer people unemployed and everybody will work longer hours and harder than ever before And that means that they ought to have a chance for recreation and for taking their minds off their work even more than before br With the approval of President Roosevelt spring training began in with few repercussions The war interrupted the careers of stars including Stan Musial Bob Feller Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio but baseball clubs continued to field their teams br br br Breaking the color barrier br br Branch Rickey president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers began making efforts to introduce a black baseball player to the previously all white professional baseball leagues in the mid s He selected Jackie Robinson from a list of promising Negro league players After obtaining a commitment from Robinson to turn the other cheek to any racial antagonism directed at him Rickey agreed to sign him to a contract for a month In what was later referred to as The Noble Experiment Robinson was the first black baseball player in the International League since the s joining the Dodgers farm club the Montreal Royals for the season br The following year the Dodgers called up Robinson to the major leagues On April Robinson made his major league debut at Ebbets Field before a crowd of spectators including more than black patrons Black baseball fans began flocking to see the Dodgers when they came to town abandoning the Negro league teams that they had followed exclusively Robinson s promotion met a generally positive although mixed reception among newspaper writers and white major league players Manager Leo Durocher informed his team I don t care if he is yellow or black or has stripes like a fucking zebra I m his manager and I say he plays br After a strike threat by some players NL President Ford Frick and Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler let it be known that any striking players would be suspended Robinson received significant encouragement from several major league players including Dodgers teammate Pee Wee Reese who said You can hate a man for many reasons Color is not one of them That year Robinson won the inaugural Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award separate NL and AL Rookie of the Year honors were not awarded until br Less than three months later Larry Doby became the first African American to break the color barrier in the American League with the Cleveland Indians The next year a number of other black players entered the major leagues Satchel Paige was signed by the Indians and the Dodgers added star catcher Roy Campanella and Don Newcombe who was later the first winner of the Cy Young Award for his outstanding pitching br br br Women in baseball br br MLB banned the signing of women to contracts in but that ban was lifted in There have been no female MLB players br br br Relocation and expansion br br From to the major leagues consisted of two eight team leagues whose teams were located in ten cities all in the northeastern and midwestern United States New York City had three teams and Boston Chicago Philadelphia and St Louis each had two teams St Louis was the southernmost and westernmost city with a major league team The longest possible road trip from Boston to St Louis took about hours by railroad After a half century of stability starting in the s teams began to move out of cities with multiple teams into cities that had not had them before From to three teams moved to new cities the Boston Braves became the Milwaukee Braves the St Louis Browns became the Baltimore Orioles and the Philadelphia Athletics became the Kansas City Athletics br The Major League Baseball season began to turn Major League Baseball into a nationwide league Walter O Malley owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers and perhaps the most influential owner of baseball s early expansion era moved his team to Los Angeles marking the first major league franchise on the West Coast O Malley also helped persuade the rival New York Giants to move west to become the San Francisco Giants Giants owner Horace Stoneham had been contemplating a move to Minnesota amid slumping attendance at the aging Polo Grounds ballpark when O Malley invited him to meet San Francisco Mayor George Christopher in New York After Stoneham was persuaded to move to California Time magazine put O Malley on its cover MLB Commissioner Ford Frick had opposed the meeting but the dual moves proved successful for both franchises and for MLB Had the Dodgers moved out west alone the St Louis Cardinals mi km away would have been the closest NL team Instead the joint move made West Coast road trips economical for visiting teams The Dodgers set a single game MLB attendance record in their first home appearance with fans br In the first Washington Senators franchise moved to Minneapolis St Paul to become the Minnesota Twins Two new teams were added to the American League at the same time the Los Angeles Angels who soon moved from downtown L A to nearby Anaheim and a new Washington Senators franchise The NL added the Houston Astros and the New York Mets in The Astros known as the Colt s during their first three seasons became the first southern major league franchise since the Louisville Colonels folded in and the first franchise to be located along the Gulf Coast The Mets established a reputation for futility by going during their first season of play in the nation s media capital and by playing only a little better in subsequent campaigns but in their eighth season the Mets became the first of the s expansion teams to play in the postseason culminating in a World Series title over the heavily favored Baltimore Orioles br In the major leagues moved to the Deep South when the Braves moved to Atlanta In the Kansas City Athletics moved west to become the Oakland Athletics In the American and National Leagues both added two expansion franchises The American League added the Seattle Pilots who became the Milwaukee Brewers after one disastrous season in Seattle and the Kansas City Royals The NL added the first Canadian franchise the Montreal Expos as well as the San Diego Padres br In the second Washington Senators moved to the Dallas Fort Worth metroplex to become the Texas Rangers In baseball expanded again adding a second Canadian team the Toronto Blue Jays as well as the Seattle Mariners Subsequently no new teams were added until the s and no teams moved until br br br Pitching dominance and rule changes br br By the late s the balance between pitching and hitting had swung in favor of the pitchers In later nicknamed the year of the pitcher Boston Red Sox player Carl Yastrzemski won the American League batting title with an average of just the lowest in the history of Major League Baseball Detroit Tigers pitcher Denny McLain won games making him the only pitcher to win games in a season since Dizzy Dean in St Louis Cardinals starting pitcher Bob Gibson achieved an equally remarkable feat by allowing an ERA of just br Following these pitching performances in December the MLB Playing Rules Committee voted to reduce the strike zone from knees to shoulders to top of knees to armpits and lower the pitcher s mound from to inches beginning in the season br In the American League which had been suffering from much lower attendance than the National League sought to increase scoring even further by initiating the designated hitter DH rule br br br New stadiums and artificial surfaces br Throughout the s and s as baseball expanded NFL football had been surging in popularity making it economical for many of these cities to build multi purpose stadiums instead of single purpose baseball fields Because of climate and economic issues many of these facilities had playing surfaces made from artificial turf as well as the oval designs characteristic of stadiums designed to house both baseball and football This often resulted in baseball fields with relatively more foul territory than older stadiums These characteristics changed the nature of professional baseball putting a higher premium on speed and defense over home run hitting power since the fields were often too big for teams to expect to hit many home runs and foul balls hit in the air could more easily be caught for outs br Teams began to be built around pitching particularly their bullpens and speed on the basepaths Artificial surfaces meant balls traveled quicker and bounced higher so it became easier to hit ground balls in the hole between the corner and middle infielders Starting pitchers were no longer expected to throw complete games it was enough for a starter to pitch innings and turn the game over to the team s closer a position which grew in importance over these decades As stolen bases increased home run totals dropped After Willie Mays hit home runs in only one player George Foster reached that mark until the s br br br Scandals and a changing game br During the s baseball experienced a number of significant changes the game had not seen in years Home runs were on the decline throughout the decade with players hitting only home runs just times and no one hitting more than home runs in a season for the first time since the Dead ball era br The Major League Baseball strike from June until July forced the cancellation of total games and resulted in a split season format br In Pete Rose broke Ty Cobb s all time hits record with his nd hit and in Rose received a lifetime ban from baseball as a result of betting on baseball games while manager of the Cincinnati Reds Rose was the first person to receive a lifetime ban from baseball since also saw the Pittsburgh drug trials which involved players who were called to testify before a grand jury in Pittsburgh related to cocaine trafficking br The Major League Baseball strike from August to April caused the cancellation of over games and the forfeit of the entire postseason br br br Steroid era further expansion and near contraction br br Routinely in the late s and early s baseball players hit or home runs in a season a feat that was considered rare even in the s It later became apparent that at least some of this power surge was a result of players using steroids and other performance enhancing drugs br In the National League added the Florida Marlins in Miami and the Colorado Rockies in Denver In the Brewers switched leagues by joining the National League and two new teams were added the National League s Arizona Diamondbacks in Phoenix and the American League s Tampa Bay Devil Rays in Tampa Bay br After the season the team owners voted in favor of contraction Several MLB teams had been considered for elimination in early talks about contraction but the Montreal Expos and the Minnesota Twins were the two teams that came closest to folding under the plan Plans for MLB contraction were halted when the Twins landlord was awarded a court injunction that required the team to play its home games at their stadium MLB owners agreed to hold off on reducing the league s size until at least br The Montreal Expos became the first franchise in over three decades to move when they became the Washington Nationals in This move left Canada with just one team but it also returned baseball to Washington after a year absence This franchise shift like many previous ones involved baseball s return to a city that had been previously abandoned Not counting the short lived Federal League Montreal is the only city to host an MLB franchise since that as of December does not have a team br br br The modern game br In recent years with the advent of technologies such as Statcast and its use of Hawk Eye starting in as well as with advanced statistics as provided by sites such as FanGraphs and Baseball Savant MLB has evolved With the ability to see precise movements of pitchers and batters teams can assess the mechanics of a player and help them improve Statcast also provides some features such as tracking the paths of most batted balls tracking the speed of most batted balls and tracking the exit velocity of most batted balls Statcast has allowed for advanced defensive analytics that have not been possible before tracking of players due to how subjective fielding can be br The rate of teams using a defensive shift has gone up from in to in because advanced statistics support this as an effective way to stop hitters from getting hits Because the shift reduces the amount of balls in play that result in hits and MLB wishes to increase interest in baseball MLB announced in September that extreme infield defensive shifts would be banned starting in In order to be compliant there must be two fielders on each side of second base and those fielders must have both of their feet on the infield dirt at the time the pitch is thrown If this rule is not followed the choice of an automatic ball or the outcome of the play is given to the batting team br The game of baseball has also slowed down significantly due to an increased number of strikeouts and walks two outcomes that generally take many pitches to complete and an increased amount of time taken for a pitcher to pitch In it took an average of three hours and six minutes to complete a inning game a number which has steadily ticked up for years Along with the restrictions on defensive shifts MLB announced the introduction of a pitch clock for the season and beyond which is something that has been an experiment in MiLB for a few years The pitch clock starts at seconds By the time the clock reaches seconds the catcher must be in their crouch behind home plate When the clock reaches seconds the batter must be in the batter s box and be alert Before the second timer reaches seconds the pitcher must have started their motion to pitch If any of these deadlines are violated the count of the batter will be increased by one ball if the defending team violated the pitch clock or one strike if it is the offensive team who violated the pitch clock Additionally in order to prevent circumventing these rules pickoffs and step offs which reset the pitch clock are only allowed two times total per plate appearance and if a pitcher attempts a third pickoff and fails to get the runner out a balk will be called Similarly a batter is restricted to calling a timeout an action which resets the pitch clock just once per plate appearance br In Major League Baseball opened an investigation into allegations that members of the World Series champion Houston Astros stole signs from opposing teams using technology during the and seasons The Astros were found guilty in January and while no active players faced any repercussions due to an immunity agreement in exchange for testimony Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow and field manager A J Hinch were suspended for the entire season The Astros were fined the maximum allowable million and forfeited their first and second round picks in the and drafts The Boston Red Sox were also found guilty of stealing signs during the and seasons with the latter season ending in a World Series victory Red Sox manager Alex Cora was suspended for a year and the team was fined with the loss of a second round draft pick in the draft as a result br br br st century relocation and potential expansion br In November the Oakland Athletics relocation to Las Vegas was approved by MLB owners br As of early MLB has discussed preparations for another round of expansion and several investment groups are vying for an MLB franchise br br br Uniforms br br A baseball uniform is a type of uniform worn by baseball players and by some non playing personnel such as field managers and coaches It is worn to indicate the person s role in the game and through the use of logos colors and numbers to identify the teams and their players managers and coaches br Traditionally home uniforms display the team name on the front while away uniforms display the team s home location In modern times however exceptions to this pattern have become common with teams using their team name on both uniforms Most teams also have one or more alternate uniforms usually consisting of the primary or secondary team color on the vest instead of the usual white or gray In the past few decades throwback uniforms have become popular br The New York Knickerbockers were the first baseball team to use uniforms taking the field on April in pants made of blue wool white flannel shirts jerseys and straw hats Caps and other types of headgear have been a part of baseball uniforms from the beginning Baseball teams often wore full brimmed straw hats or no cap at all since there was no official rule regarding headgear Under the uniform rules players on the same team wore uniforms of different colors and patterns that indicated which position they played This rule was soon abandoned as impractical br In the late s Detroit and Washington of the National League and Brooklyn of the American Association were the first to wear striped uniforms By the end of the th century teams began the practice of having two different uniforms one for when they played at home in their own baseball stadium and a different one for when they played away on the road at the other team s ballpark It became common to wear white pants with a white color vest at home and gray pants with a gray or solid dark colored vest when away By both home and away uniforms were standard across the major leagues br In June MLB announced a long term deal with cryptocurrency exchange FTX which includes the FTX logo appearing on umpire uniforms during all games FTX is MLB s first ever umpire uniform patch partner On November FTX filed for Chapter bankruptcy protection MLB removed the FTX patches from umpires uniforms before the season br br br Season structure br br br Spring training br br Spring training is a series of practices and exhibition games preceding the start of the regular season Teams hold training camps in the states of Arizona and Florida where the early warm weather allows teams to practice and play without worrying about the late winter cold Spring training allows new players to compete for roster and position spots and gives existing team players practice time prior to competitive play The teams that hold spring training in Arizona are grouped into the Cactus League while teams that hold camp in Florida are known as the Grapefruit League br Spring training typically lasts almost two months starting in mid February and running until just before the season opening day traditionally the first week of April As pitchers benefit from a longer training period pitchers and catchers begin spring training several days before the rest of the team br br br Regular season br Each team plays games per season A team s schedule is typically organized into three game series sets of consecutive games against the same opponent with occasional two or four game series Postponed games or continuations of suspended games can result in an ad hoc one game or five game series All games of a series are usually hosted by the same team and multiple series are typically grouped together I e a team usually hosts several series in a row called a homestand and follows that by going on several road series in a row Teams generally play games five to seven days per week Most games are scheduled at night although teams will often play day games on Opening Day holidays and for the last game of a series to allow teams extra time to travel to their next opponent Sunday games are generally played during the afternoon allowing teams to travel to their next destination prior to a Monday night game br In the current three division structure each team plays games against each of its four divisional opponents It plays one home series and one away series amounting to six or seven games against the other teams in its league A team also plays game series with all the other teams in the other league alternating home teams each year Furthermore each team has an interleague natural rival in many cases its counterpart in the same metro area with which it plays two home games and two away games each year br With an odd number of teams in each league it is necessary to have two teams participate in interleague play for most days in the season except when two or more teams have a day off Each team plays interleague games throughout the season usually with just one interleague game per day but for one weekend in late May all teams will participate in an interleague series Before interleague play was structured differently there would be one weekend in mid May and another period consisting typically of the last two thirds of June in which all teams played interleague games save for two NL teams each day and no interleague games were scheduled outside those dates Before season long interleague play was not necessary because each league had an even number of teams In the Houston Astros moved to the American League so that each league would have teams Prior to the adoption of the universal designated hitter in whether the DH was in use depended on whether the home team was from the AL where the DH was used or the NL where it was not br Starting with the season the scheduling formula changed with each team playing at least one series against every other team every year Each team plays games against teams in the same division with one game and one game series at each park six games against teams within the same league but in other divisions with one game series at each park and one game series against teams in the other league alternating home teams each year except for each team s designated interleague rival which will continue to consist of two game series at each of the teams home parks br Beginning with the season teams compete for the six playoff berths in their respective leagues To secure a berth a team must either win its division or capture a wild card spot by having one of the three best records among the non winners in its entire league With the adoption of a third wild card the former practice of breaking ties with an additional regular season game known as game was dropped in favor of a tie breaker formula br br br All Star Game br br In early to mid July just after the midway point of the season the Major League Baseball All Star Game is held during a four day break from the regular season schedule The All Star Game features a team of players from the American League AL led by the manager of the previous AL World Series team and a team of players from the National League NL similarly managed in an exhibition game From to two games were held each season one was held in July and one was held in August The designated hitter rule was used in the All Star Game for the first time in Following games used a DH when the game was played in an AL ballpark Since the DH rule has been in effect regardless of venue br The first official All Star Game was held as part of the World s Fair in Chicago Illinois and was the idea of Arch Ward then sports editor for The Chicago Tribune Initially intended to be a one time event its great success resulted in making the game an annual one Ward s contribution was recognized by Major League Baseball in with the creation of the Arch Ward Trophy given to the All Star Game s Most Valuable Player each year In it was renamed the Commissioner s Trophy until when the name change was reversed In it was renamed the Ted Williams Most Valuable Player Award br Beginning in the eight position players in each team s starting lineup have been voted into the game by fans The fan voting was discontinued after a ballot box stuffing scandal in Cincinnati seven of the eight slots originally went to Reds players two of whom were subsequently removed from the lineup to make room for Willie Mays and Hank Aaron Fan voting was reinstated in and has continued ever since including internet voting in recent years br The contest in Milwaukee controversially ended in an inning tie when both managers ran out of pitchers In response starting in the league which wins the All Star game received home field advantage in the World Series the league champion hosted the first two games at its own
