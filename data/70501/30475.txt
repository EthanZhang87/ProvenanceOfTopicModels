Looks The book observed that Turner discovered his father had sheltered a substantial amount of taxable income over the years by personally lending it back to the company and discovered that the

radio stations In he sold his radio stations to buy a struggling television station in Atlanta UHF Channel WJRJ now WPCH At the time UHF stations did well only in markets without VHF stations like Fresno California or in markets with only one station on VHF Independent UHF stations were not ratings winners or that profitable even in larger markets but Turner concluded that this would change as people wanted more than several choices He changed the call sign to WTCG erroneously claimed to have stood for Watch This Channel Grow but in actuality stood for Turner Communications Group Initially the station ran old movies from prior decades along with theatrical cartoons and bygone sitcoms and drama programs As a better syndicated product fell off the VHF stations Turner would acquire it for

by Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn on January for his actions while pursuing the signing of free agent outfielder Gary Matthews from the San Francisco Giants Matthews signed a five year million
