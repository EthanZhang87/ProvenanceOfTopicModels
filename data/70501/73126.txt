Montreal Canadiens Toronto Maple Leafs Boston Bruins and New York Rangers Since the team has played their home games at the United Center which they share with the National Basketball Association s Chicago Bulls both teams previously played at the now demolished Chicago Stadium br The Blackhawks original owner was Frederic McLaughlin a hands on owner who fired many coaches during his ownership and led the team to win two Stanley Cup titles in and After McLaughlin s death in the team came under the ownership of the Norris family who acted as their landlord as owners of the Chicago Stadium and also owned stakes in several of the NHL teams At first the Norris ownership was as part of a syndicate fronted by longtime executive Bill Tobin and the team languished in favor of the Norris owned Detroit Red Wings After the senior James E Norris died in the Norris assets were spread among family members and James D Norris became the owner of the Blackhawks The younger Norris took an active interest in the team which won another Stanley Cup title under his ownership in After James D Norris died in the Wirtz family became owners of the franchise In the team came under the control of Rocky Wirtz who is credited with turning around the organization which had lost fan interest and competitiveness under Wirtz the Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup three times in and Rocky died in July and his son Danny Wirtz was named chairman of the Blackhawks br br br Franchise history br br br Founding br On May the NHL awarded an expansion franchise for Chicago to a syndicate headed by former football star Huntington Hardwick of Boston At the same meeting Hardwick arranged the purchase of the players of the Portland Rosebuds of the Western Hockey League for from WHL president Frank Patrick in a deal brokered by Boston Bruins owner Charles Adams However only a month later Hardwick s group sold out to Chicago coffee tycoon Frederic McLaughlin br McLaughlin had been a commander with the rd Machine Gun Battalion of the th Infantry Division during World War I This division was nicknamed the Blackhawk Division after Black Hawk a Native American of the Sauk nation who was a prominent figure in the history of Illinois McLaughlin named the new hockey team in honor of the military unit making it one of many sports team names using Native Americans as icons However unlike the military division the team s name was spelled in two words as Black Hawks until when the club officially became the Blackhawks based on the spelling found in the original franchise documents br The Black Hawks began play in the season along with its fellow expansion franchises the Detroit Cougars now the Detroit Red Wings and New York Rangers The team had to face immediate competition in Chicago from Eddie Livingstone s rival the Chicago Cardinals who played in the same building McLaughlin took a very active role in running the team despite having no background in the sport He hired Bill Tobin a former goaltender who had played in the Western League as his assistant but directed the team himself He was also very interested in promoting American players then very rare in professional hockey Several of them including Doc Romnes Taffy Abel Alex Levinsky Mike Karakas and Cully Dahlstrom become staples with the team and under McLaughlin the Black Hawks were the first NHL team with an all American born lineup br br br McLaughlin era br br The Black Hawks played their first game on November against the Toronto St Patricks at the Chicago Coliseum They won their first game in front of a crowd of over The Hawks first season was a moderate success as they finished the season in third place with a record of However they lost the first round playoff series to the Boston Bruins br Following the series McLaughlin fired head coach Pete Muldoon According to Jim Coleman sportswriter for the Toronto based Globe and Mail McLaughlin felt that the Hawks were good enough to finish first Muldoon disagreed and in a fit of pique McLaughlin fired him According to Coleman Muldoon responded by yelling Fire me Major and you ll never finish first I ll put a curse on this team that will hoodoo it until the end of time The Curse of Muldoon was born although Coleman admitted years after the fact that he had fabricated the whole incident and became one of the first widely known sports curses While the team would go on to win three Stanley Cups in its first years of existence it did so without ever having finished in first place either in a single or multi division format The Black Hawks proceeded to have the worst record in the league in winning only seven of games br br For the season the Black Hawks were originally slated to play in the newly built Chicago Stadium but due to construction delays and a dispute between McLaughlin and arena promoter Paddy Harmon they instead divided their time between the Coliseum the Detroit Olympia and the Peace Bridge Arena in Fort Erie Ontario before moving to Chicago Stadium the following season br By with goal scorer Johnny Gottselig Cy Wentworth on defense and Charlie Gardiner in goal the Hawks reached their first Stanley Cup Finals but fizzled in the final two games against the Montreal Canadiens They had another stellar season in but that did not translate into playoff success However two years later Gardiner led his team to victory by shutting out the Detroit Red Wings in the final game of the Stanley Cup Finals Mush March scored the winning goal in double overtime as the Hawks beat Detroit br In the Black Hawks had a record of almost missing the playoffs They stunned the Canadiens and New York Americans on overtime goals in the deciding games of both semi final series advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals against the Toronto Maple Leafs Black Hawks goaltender Mike Karakas was injured and could not play forcing a desperate Chicago team to pull minor leaguer Alfie Moore out of a Toronto bar and onto the ice Moore played one game and won it Toronto refused to let Moore play the next so Chicago used Paul Goodman in Game and lost However for the third and fourth games Karakas was fitted with a special skate to protect his injured toe and the team won both games It was too late for Toronto as the Hawks won their second championship As of the Black Hawks possess the poorest regular season record of any Stanley Cup champion br The Black Hawks next returned to the Finals in behind Doug Bentley s goals with Bentley s linemate Clint Smith leading the team in assists After upsetting the Red Wings in the semi finals they were promptly dispatched by the dominant Canadiens in four games br br br Norris era br After McLaughlin died in December his estate sold the team to a syndicate headed by longtime team president Bill Tobin However Tobin was only a puppet for James E Norris who owned the rival Red Wings Norris had also been the Black Hawks landlord since his purchase of the Chicago Stadium For the next eight years the Norris Tobin ownership as a rule paid almost no attention to the Black Hawks Nearly every trade made between Detroit and Chicago ended up being Red Wing heists As a result for the next several years the Black Hawks were the model of futility in the NHL Between and they only made the playoffs twice br In Norris eldest son James D Norris and Red Wings minority owner Arthur Wirtz the senior Norris original partner in buying the Red Wings years earlier took over the floundering club They guided it through financial reversals and rebuilt the team from there One of their first moves was to hire former Detroit coach and general manager Tommy Ivan as general manager br br In the late s the Hawks struck gold acquiring three young prospects forwards Bobby Hull and Stan Mikita and defenseman Pierre Pilote and obtaining both star goaltender Glenn Hall and veteran forward Ted Lindsay who had just had a career season with goals and assists from Detroit Hull Mikita Pilote and Hall became preeminent stars of the team and all four would eventually be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame br After two first round exits at the hands of the eventual champions from Montreal in and it was expected the Canadiens would once again defeat the Hawks when they met in the semi finals in A defensive plan that completely wore down Montreal s superstars worked however as Chicago won the series in six games They then bested the Wings to win their third Stanley Cup championship br br The Hawks made the Cup Finals twice more in the s losing to the Leafs in and the Canadiens in They remained a force to be reckoned with throughout the decade with Hull enjoying four goal seasons Mikita winning back to back scoring titles and MVP accolades Pilote winning three consecutive Norris Trophies and Hall being named the First or Second All Star goaltender eight out of nine seasons Hull and Mikita especially were widely regarded as the most feared one two punch in the league However despite a strong supporting cast which included Bill Hay Ken Wharram Phil Esposito Moose Vasko Doug Mohns and Pat Stapleton the Hawks never quite put it all together br In the last season of the six team NHL the Black Hawks finished first breaking the supposed Curse of Muldoon years after the death of Frederic McLaughlin However they lost in the semi finals to Toronto who went on to win their last Stanley Cup of the era Afterward Coleman who first printed the story of the curse in admitted that he made the story up to break a writer s block he had as a column deadline approached br br br Arthur Wirtz era br Before his death in one of James D Norris last moves in the NHL was to arrange an expansion franchise in St Louis where he owned the St Louis Arena Tobin died in a vice president of the team until his death Ownership now passed to Norris longtime partner Arthur Wirtz and his son Bill Wirtz The Wirtz Norris partnership dated over three decades Arthur Wirtz had been a minority partner in the syndicate the senior Norris put together to buy the Red Wings in br Goaltender Glenn Hall was drafted by the St Louis Blues expansion team for the season while Pierre Pilote was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for Jim Pappin in In the season despite Bobby Hull breaking his own previous record of goals in a season with the Black Hawks missed the playoffs for the first time since and the last time before br In the Black Hawks made a trade with the Boston Bruins that turned out to be one of the most one sided in the history of the sport Chicago sent young forwards Phil Esposito Ken Hodge and Fred Stanfield to Boston in exchange for Pit Martin Jack Norris and Gilles Marotte While Martin would star for the Hawks for many seasons Esposito Hodge and Stanfield would lead the Bruins to the top of the NHL for several years and capture two Stanley Cups In Boston Esposito set numerous scoring records en route to a career as one of the NHL s all time greats br br Nonetheless in the season life was made easier for the Black Hawks as in an attempt to better balance the divisions the expansion Buffalo Sabres and Vancouver Canucks were both placed in the East Division while the Hawks moved into the West Division The Hawks became the class of the West overnight rampaging to a record and an easy first place finish With second year goalie Tony Esposito Phil s younger brother and winner of the Calder Memorial Trophy for Rookie of the Year the previous season Hull his younger brother Dennis Mikita and sterling defensemen Stapleton Keith Magnuson and Bill White the Hawks reached the Stanley Cup Finals losing to the Canadiens br A critical blow to the franchise came in with the start of the World Hockey Association WHA Long dissatisfied with how little he was paid as the NHL s marquee star Hull jumped to the upstart Winnipeg Jets for a million dollar contract Former Philadelphia Flyers star Andre Lacroix joined him having received very little ice time during his single season with Chicago and the pair became two of the WHA s great stars However the Black Hawks repeated their appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals that year again losing to Montreal Stapleton also left for the WHA after that year depleting the team further br While the team led or was second in the West Division for four straight seasons for the rest of the s the Black Hawks made the playoffs each year winning seven division championships in the decade in all but were never a successful Stanley Cup contender losing straight playoff games at one point The team acquired legendary blueliner Bobby Orr from the Boston Bruins in but ill health forced him to sit out for most of the season and he eventually retired in having played only games for the Hawks Stan Mikita did the same the following year after playing for Chicago for years the third longest career for a single team in league history br By the Black Hawks squeaked into the playoffs as the fourth seed in the Norris Division at the time the top four teams in each division automatically made the playoffs and were one of the NHL s Cinderella teams that year Led by second year Denis Savard s goals and points and Doug Wilson s goals the Hawks stunned the Minnesota North Stars and St Louis Blues in the playoffs before losing to another surprise team the Vancouver Canucks who made the Stanley Cup Finals Chicago proved they were no fluke the next season also making the third round before losing to the eventual runner up Edmonton Oilers After an off year in the Hawks again faced a now fresh off a ring Edmonton offensive juggernaut of a team and lost in the third round in br br br Bill Wirtz era br In Arthur Wirtz died and the club came under the sole control of his son Bill Wirtz Although the Black Hawks continued to make the playoffs each season the club began a slow decline punctuated with an appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals br During the playoff series against Edmonton the Black Hawks and their fans started a tradition of cheering during the singing of The Star Spangled Banner br Prior to the season while going through the team s records someone discovered the team s original NHL contract and found that the team s name was printed as a compound word Blackhawks as opposed to two separate words Black Hawks which was the way most sources had been printing it for years and as the team had always officially listed it The name officially became Chicago Blackhawks from that point on br In the late s Chicago still made the playoffs on an annual basis but made early round exits each time In after three straight first round defeats and despite a fourth place finish in their division in the regular season Chicago made it to the Conference Final in the rookie seasons of both goalie Ed Belfour and center Jeremy Roenick However they would once again fail to make the Stanley Cup Finals losing to the eventual champions the Calgary Flames br The following season the Hawks did prove they were late round playoff material running away with the Norris Division title but yet again the third round continued to stymie them this time against the eventual champion Oilers despite s Soviet star goaltender Vladislav Tretiak coming to Chicago to become the Blackhawks goaltender coach br In Chicago was poised to fare even better in the playoffs winning the Presidents Trophy for best regular season record but the Minnesota North Stars stunned them in six games in the first round en route to an improbable Stanley Cup Finals appearance In the Blackhawks with Roenick scoring goals Steve Larmer scoring goals Chris Chelios acquired from Montreal two years earlier on defense and Belfour in goal finally reached the Final after years out of such status winning consecutive playoff games that year setting an NHL record in the process However they were swept four games to none by the Mario Lemieux led defending Stanley Cup champion the Pittsburgh Penguins In sweeping the Blackhawks the Penguins tied the record Chicago had set only days before Although the sweep indicated Pittsburgh s dominance in games won the individual games were contested closely Game saw the Blackhawks squander leads of and and would eventually be beaten after a Lemieux power play goal with nine seconds remaining in regulation The Blackhawks most lackluster match was game two losing A frustrating loss of followed in game three and a natural hat trick from Dirk Graham and stellar play from Dominik Hasek who showed indications of the goaltender he would later become could not secure a win in Game which ended in a final in favor of Pittsburgh The defending NBA champion Chicago Bulls were in their finals in but won their championship in six This was the only year the city of Chicago would host the NBA and NHL finals concurrently in the same year Blackhawks head coach Mike Keenan would see this again in New York when he coached the Rangers to their first Stanley Cup in years in br Belfour posted a win season in as the Hawks looked to go deep yet again and Chris Chelios accumulated career high penalty time with minutes in the box but St Louis stunned Chicago with a first round sweep to continue Chicago s playoff losing streak br br Although they finished near in the Blackhawks again qualified for the playoffs They were eliminated by eventual Western Conference finalist Toronto but broke their playoff losing streak at games with a game three win It was not enough however and the Blackhawks fell in six games The season was also the Blackhawks last at the Chicago Stadium as the team moved into the newly built United Center across the street for the lockout shortened season Bernie Nicholls and Joe Murphy both scored goals over games and Chicago once again made it to the Western Conference Final losing to the rival Detroit Red Wings Also in management fired Wayne Messmer popular singer of The Star Spangled Banner br Jeremy Roenick Ed Belfour and Chris Chelios were all traded away as the Blackhawks faltered through the late s until they missed the playoffs by five points in for the first time in years one season short of tying the Boston Bruins record for the longest such streak in North American professional sport history Chicago would also miss the playoffs for a second consecutive season in and missed the playoffs again in and br The new millennium started with disappointment for the Blackhawks ric Daze Alexei Zhamnov and Tony Amonte emerged as some of the team s leading stars by this time However aside from a quick first round exit in where they lost to the St Louis Blues in five games after winning Game of the series the Blackhawks were consistently out of the playoffs from the season until the season in most years finishing well out of contention despite finishing in third place in the Central Division six times Amonte left for the Phoenix Coyotes in the summer of During the season the Blackhawks finished third in the Central Division with points but would finish ninth in the Western Conference which would make them miss the playoffs by points br A somber note was struck in February when ESPN named the Blackhawks the worst franchise in professional sports Indeed the Blackhawks were viewed with much indifference by Chicagoans for much of the s and early s due to anger over several policies instituted by then owner Bill Wirtz who was derisively known as Dollar Bill For example Wirtz did not allow home games to be televised in the Chicago area claiming it was unfair to the team s season ticket holders He also raised ticket prices to an average of making them among the most expensive in the NHL The Chicago Wolves an American Hockey League AHL team based in Rosemont Illinois mocked the Blackhawks struggle by using the marketing slogan We Play Hockey the Old Fashioned Way We Actually Win br Following the lockout of the season new general manager Dale Tallon set about restructuring the team in the hopes of making a playoff run Tallon made several moves in the summer of most notably the signing of the Tampa Bay Lightning s Stanley Cup winning goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin and All Star defenseman Adrian Aucoin However injuries plagued Khabibulin and Aucoin among others and the Blackhawks again finished well out of the playoffs with a record next to last in the Western Conference and second worst in the NHL The Blackhawks reached another low point on May when they announced that popular TV radio play by play announcer Pat Foley would not

offered big money to many of the top free agents However they were denied only being able to acquire two backup goaltenders in Patrick Lalime and Sebastien Caron Chicago was one of the biggest buyers in the trade market acquiring a future franchise player in left winger Martin Havlat as well as center Bryan Smolinski from the Ottawa Senators in a three way trade that also involved the San Jose Sharks The Hawks dealt forward Mark Bell to the Sharks Michal Barinka and a second round draft pick to the Senators while Ottawa also received defenseman Tom Preissing and center Josh Hennessy from San Jose Havlat gave the Blackhawks the talented first line caliber game breaker they desperately needed The Havlat trade was soon followed by another major trade winger and key Blackhawk player Kyle Calder was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for grinding defensive center Michal Handzus The move caused a stir in Chicago as Calder had won an increase in his contract through arbitration which was accepted by the Hawks but rather than ink their leading scorer the team decided to address their need for a proven center by acquiring Handzus Injuries to both Havlat and Handzus hurt the Blackhawks and Smolinski was eventually traded at the trade deadline to the Vancouver Canucks On November Blackhawks general manager Dale Tallon fired head coach Trent Yawney and appointed assistant coach Denis Savard as the head coach Savard had been the assistant coach of the team since a year after he retired as one of the most popular and successful Blackhawks players of all time
