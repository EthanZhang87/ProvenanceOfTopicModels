The Original Six French six quipes originales are the teams that composed the National Hockey League NHL between and The six teams are the Boston Bruins Chicago Black Hawks Detroit Red Wings Montreal Canadiens New York Rangers and Toronto Maple Leafs After serving as the league s only teams for seasons they were joined by six new franchises in the NHL expansion br The Six are not the original teams of the NHL The Canadiens and Maple Leafs are the two members of this group that are charter members of the NHL However the Original Six are considered a set for having joined the league by and thus being the NHL s oldest active franchises br The Original Six have the most combined Stanley Cup titles among NHL franchises the Canadiens hold the most wins at The Maple Leafs who won the last Stanley Cup of the Original Six era are the only Original Six franchise to have not returned to the Stanley Cup Finals since the expansion br br br Teams br br br Background br br The NHL consisted of ten teams during the s but the league experienced a period of retrenchment during the Great Depression losing the Pittsburgh Pirates Philadelphia Quakers Ottawa Senators St Louis Eagles and Montreal Maroons in succession to financial pressures The New York Brooklyn Americans one of the league s original expansion franchises along with the Bruins and Maroons lasted longer but played as wards of the league from onward World War II and its own economic strains severely depleted the league s Canadian player base since Canada entered the war in September and many players left for military service The Americans suspended operations in the fall of which left the NHL with just six teams br Despite various outside efforts to initiate expansion after the war including attempted revivals of the Maroons and Americans franchises the league s membership remained at six teams for the next seasons This was the longest static period without expansion team moves or contraction in the history of the league and also featured the longest period without any team changing arenas The next longest streak from the expansion to Saint Paul Minnesota and Columbus Ohio to the move of the Atlanta Thrashers to Winnipeg is not even half as long only two other periods and lasted longer than seasons The seasons is also the second longest period without expansion team moves or contraction in North American sports history behind only Major League Baseball which saw only stadium changes between the move of the original Baltimore Orioles to New York in and the Boston Braves moving to Milwaukee in a span of fifty seasons br br br Criticisms br The Original Six era has been criticized for having a playoff format that was too easy since the top four teams in the regular season advanced to the playoffs At least the playoff system was too easy for the top three teams in the league Montreal Toronto and Detroit The standings were very static Montreal missed the playoffs only once between and in and Toronto missed the post season four times and Detroit missed three times which left the three remaining teams to compete for the final playoff berth Montreal won ten of the Stanley Cups awarded during the Original Six era Toronto won nine and Detroit won five Chicago won only one Stanley Cup during that era in and Boston and New York won no Cups br It was not a coincidence that two of the dominant teams were based in Canada and the third was based in an American city that borders Canada The league had a rule that gave each team exclusive rights to negotiate contracts with promising local players within miles km of its home ice A player who was not within the mile limit was free to field offers from any team Once a player agreed to an NHL sponsorship level contract the NHL club could assign him to its sponsored junior squad its sponsorship list br Since the Toronto and the Montreal metropolitan areas contained abundant hockey prospects that put them at a major recruiting advantage over Boston New York and Chicago which had very few such prospects in their territories Detroit had Southwestern Ontario as part of its territory and so it did not have the major advantage of the Canadian teams but it was better positioned than the other American ones br In practice all six teams recruited players from Canada by sponsoring minor league junior and amateur teams As a result the league was almost entirely composed of Canadians who had come up through the junior and minor pro leagues The league boasted a small amount of good American players during the s including the All Star goalkeepers Frank Brimsek and Mike Karakas defenceman John Mariucci and forward Cully Dahlstrom At the beginning of the Original Six era the Chicago Black Hawks were owned by Major Frederic McLaughlin a fiercely patriotic man who tried to stock his roster with as many American players as possible However he died in and his estate sold the team to a group controlled by the Norris family which also owned the Red Wings After that time the Black Hawks had only a few American born players just like the other American based teams The Canadian teams had very few The only American born Maple Leaf during the entire era was Gerry Foley who was born in Ware Massachusetts but grew up in Garson Ontario and played just four games for Toronto although he played two full seasons for the New York Rangers The Canadiens only American born skater was Norm Dussault a forward who was born in Springfield Massachusetts but grew up in Sherbrooke Quebec An American goalie John Aiken also played exactly half a game for the Habs on March he was a Boston Bruins team employee who filled in for his team s opponent as an emergency replacement when Jacques Plante was injured during the second period of a game at the Boston Garden The family of the Detroit born Charlie Burns moved to Toronto when he was a child he was a four year regular with Detroit and Boston from to br Very few all American developed NHL players emerged in the s and s Tommy Williams was the only US citizen to play regularly Both Williams and Mariucci complained about anti American bias and U S Olympic team stars John Mayasich and Bill Cleary turned down offers from NHL teams Although there were several European born players such as the Slovakian born Hall of Famer Stan Mikita who immigrated to Canada as children the only European born and trained player of the era was Sweden s Ulf Sterner who briefly played for the Rangers in The league s first black player Willie O Ree came up during that era he played for the Boston Bruins between and but turned out to be the only black player until the s br After World War II all six NHL owners consistently rejected any bids for expansion namely a bid for the American Hockey League s Cleveland Barons team in In the eyes of many observers the criteria for entry were changed every time with a desire to defeat any such bid The owners also reneged on promises to allow the extant but dormant Maroons and Americans franchises to reactivate br Those phenomena had the impact of limiting player movement and as a result the Original Six rosters were very static Until the lengthening of careers in the s only one year player in NHL history Larry Robinson started his career after and it is generally accepted that the weakest Calder Trophy winners rookies of the year of all time were selected in the s and the s br br br Corruption br The league tolerated monopolistic practices by the owners At one point for instance Red Wings owner James E Norris effectively owned the Black Hawks as well and was also the largest stockholder in the Rangers He also had significant influence over the Bruins by way of mortgages extended to the team to help keep it afloat during the Depression which led some critics to joke that NHL stood for Norris House League br The control of owners over their teams was absolute An example of this is the case of the bruising Red Wings forward Ted Lindsay who after agitating for a players union was sent to the last place Black Hawks A measure of the dominance of Detroit Montreal and Toronto in the era can be seen in that between the Bruins Stanley Cup wins in and every single Cup except for Chicago in was won by the Red Wings the Canadiens or the Maple Leafs and those three teams failed to make the playoffs only eight times combined in the era br Labour conditions for the players were also poor Moreover whenever players were sent to the minors they had their salaries cut and their relocation costs were not covered Players were signed as early as and they were bound to one of the teams which then directed their development br The pension plan was formed in The pension plan was exposed only in when it was found that a million surplus existed The stark labor conditions led to several players disputes including a antitrust action and attempted union formation as well as subsequent actions in the early s by the Toronto players Bob Baun and Carl Brewer which led to the formation of the NHL Players Association br br br End of era br br As the more conservative owners left the NHL a younger guard that was more receptive to expansion entered the league By when Rangers governor William M Jennings first introduced to his peers the idea of expanding the NHL Major League Baseball MLB and the National Football League NFL were adding teams and the American Football League was becoming an attractive alternative to the NFL Jennings proposed the NHL add two new teams on the American West Coast for the season and based his argument on concerns that the Western Hockey League intended to operate as a major league in the near future and possibly compete against the NHL for talent He also hoped that a West Coast presence would make the NHL truly national and improve the league s chances of returning to national television in the United States its broadcast deal with CBS had expired in While the governors did not agree to Jennings proposal the topic of expansion arose every time that the owners met from then on In the league decided to double in size by adding six teams and in February expansion franchises were awarded to Los Angeles Minnesota Philadelphia Pittsburgh St Louis and the San Francisco Oakland area The six new clubs would begin play in the season Thus with Toronto s six game victory over Montreal in the Stanley Cup Finals the Original Six era came to a close br The first dozen seasons to of the Expansion Era saw the continued dominance by Original Six teams including the Bobby Orr led Bruins in the early s and the Canadiens dynasty at the end of that decade The expansion teams by comparison were not as dominant during that same time period During those dozen seasons only one expansion team hoisted the Cup the Philadelphia Flyers in and and only one Stanley Cup Finals series featured two expansion teams the Flyers win over the Buffalo Sabres By the early s after further expansion a merger with the WHA and changes in conference division alignment and playoff structure expansion teams began reaching clear parity with the Original Six Indeed the Stanley Cup Finals between the Canadiens and Rangers would be the last Finals featuring any Original Six team until when the Canadiens claimed the Cup as well as the last all Original Six Finals until Chicago s win over Boston in that playoff season featured all of the Original Six teams for the first time since br With the exception of Toronto since the dawn of the Expansion Era every Original Six team has played in the Stanley Cup Finals at least times and won the Cup at least once the Maple Leafs have not competed in a Finals since winning in the longest active NHL championship drought The Montreal Canadiens have twice won the Cup by defeating other Original Six clubs in every series the playoffs in beating Detroit Toronto and Boston and beating Toronto Boston and New York Also the Pittsburgh Penguins are the only team to also win the Cup after beating three of the Original Six New York and Boston in the Wales Conference playoffs and Chicago in the finals Twice the Eastern Conference champion beat two Original Six teams before being defeated by another in the Stanley Cup Finals the Carolina Hurricanes in beat Montreal and Toronto lost to Detroit and the Philadelphia Flyers in beat Boston and Montreal lost to Chicago In the League moved the Red Wings to the Eastern Conference leaving Chicago as the only Original Six team in the West In the Tampa Bay Lightning became the first team to face only Original Six franchises in the four round playoff era beating Detroit Montreal and New York in the Eastern playoffs before falling in the Stanley Cup Finals to Chicago br The last active player from the Original Six era was Wayne Cashman who retired with the Boston Bruins in The final active player and official in any on ice capacity for the league was linesman John D Amico who retired at the end of the season br According to Forbes in five of the Original Six teams are the top five most valuable NHL clubs the Rangers at approximately billion the Canadiens at billion the Maple Leafs at billion the Blackhawks at million and the Bruins at million The Red Wings rank eighth at million br br br Head to head records br Records current as of June br
