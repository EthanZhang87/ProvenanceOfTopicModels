St John s is the capital and largest city of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador It is located on the eastern tip of the Avalon Peninsula on the island of Newfoundland The city spans km sq mi and is the easternmost city in North America excluding Greenland br Its name has been attributed to the belief that John Cabot sailed into the harbour on the Nativity of John the Baptist in although it is most likely a legend that came with British settlement A more realistic possibility is that a fishing village with the same name existed without a permanent settlement for most of the th century Indicated as S o Jo o on a Portuguese map from it is one of the oldest cities in North America It was officially incorporated as a city in With a metropolitan population of approximately as of February the St John s Metropolitan Area is Canada s th largest metropolitan area and the second largest Census Metropolitan Area CMA in Atlantic Canada after Halifax br The city has a rich history having played a role in the Seven Years War the American Revolutionary War and the War of Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi received the first transatlantic wireless signal in St John s Its history and culture have made it into an important tourist destination St John s was referred to as Baile She in Johnstown in the poetry of Donnchadh Ruadh Mac Conmara and among speakers of the Irish language in Newfoundland br br br History br br br Early history br St John s was used by fishermen setting up seasonal camps in the early s Sebastian Cabot declared in a handwritten Latin text in his original map that St John s earned its name when he and his father the Venetian explorer John Cabot in the service of England became the first Europeans to sail into the harbour on the morning of June per British and French historians in the feast day of Saint John the Baptist However the locations of Cabot s landfalls are disputed A series of expeditions to St John s by Portuguese from the Azores took place in the early th century and by French Spanish and Portuguese ships crossed the Atlantic annually to fish the waters off the Avalon Peninsula In the Basque Country it is a common belief the name of St John s was given by Basque fishermen because the bay of St John s is very similar to the Bay of Pasaia in the Basque Country where one of the fishing towns is called St John in Spanish San Juan and in Basque Donibane br The earliest record of the location appears as S o Jo o on a Portuguese map by Pedro Reinel in When the English mariner John Rut visited St John s in he found Norman Breton and Portuguese ships in the harbour On August Rut wrote a letter to King Henry on the findings of his voyage to North America this was the first known letter sent from North America St Jehan is shown on Nicolas Desliens s world map of and San Joham is found in Jo o Freire s Atlas of br On August an English Sea Dog Sir Humphrey Gilbert claimed the area as England s first overseas colony under Royal Charter of Queen Elizabeth I There was no permanent population however and Gilbert was lost at sea during his return voyage thereby ending any immediate plans for settlement br Bernard Drake s Newfoundland Expedition in landed at Saint John s re establishing England s claim on the area St John s became a base for his operations where his ships gathered supplies and fresh water This expedition virtually wiped out the Spanish and Portuguese fishing industries in the area and so set the stage for subsequent English and French influence in the region br By the fishermen of England s West Country controlled most of Newfoundland s east coast In William Payne called St John s the principal prime and chief lot in all the whole country br Sometime after the town of St John s was established as a permanent community Before this English fishermen were expressly forbidden by the English government at the urging of the West Country fishing industry to establish permanent settlements along the English controlled coast br The population grew slowly in the th century St John s was Newfoundland s largest settlement when English naval officers began to take censuses around The population grew in the summers with the arrival of migratory fishermen In fishing ships mostly from South Devon set up fishing rooms at St John s bringing hundreds of Irish men into the port to operate inshore fishing boats br The town s first significant defences were likely erected due to commercial interests following the temporary seizure of St John s by the Dutch admiral Michiel de Ruyter in June br The inhabitants fended off a second Dutch attack in when it was defended by Christopher Martin an English merchant captain Martin landed six cannons from his vessel the Elias Andrews and constructed an earthen breastwork and battery near Chain Rock commanding the Narrows leading into the harbour With only men the valiant Martin beat off an attack by three Dutch warships The English government planned to expand these fortifications Fort William in around but construction did not begin until after the French admiral Pierre Le Moyne d Iberville captured and destroyed the town in the Avalon Peninsula Campaign When English reinforcements arrived in late they found rubble where the town and fortifications had stood br br The French attacked St John s again in Siege of St John s and captured it in Battle of St John s devastating civilian structures with fire on each instance br The harbour remained fortified through most of the th and th centuries The final battle of the Seven Years War in North America known as the French and Indian War in the US was fought in in St John s Following a surprise capture of the town by the French early in the year the British responded and at the Battle of Signal Hill the French surrendered St John s to British forces under the command of Colonel William Amherst br In the late s Fort Amherst and Fort Waldegrave were built to defend the harbour entrance br br br The oldest European settlement in North America controversy br There has been some controversy regarding which European settlement is the oldest in North America As mentioned above while English fishermen had set up seasonal camps in St John s in the th century they were expressly forbidden by the English government at the urging of the West Country fishing industry to establish permanent settlements along the English controlled coast As a result the town of St John s was not established as a permanent community until after the s With respect to the oldest surviving permanent English settlements in North America it was preceded by Jamestown Virginia the Cuper s Cove colony at Cupids in Newfoundland St George s Bermuda and the Bristol s Hope colony at Harbour Grace in Newfoundland Each of these English settlements were far later than other European settlements in North America such as St Augustine Florida established by Spain in br br br Modern history present br On April the United Irish Uprising occurred when Irish soldiers who were part of the British garrison stationed in Newfoundland mutinied The mutineers who were suspected to be members of the Society of United Irishmen fled to the countryside after the mutiny failed and were apprehended in a matter of weeks and court martialled Of the mutineers captured were executed were let go while were sentenced to penal transportation br The th century saw major changes in Newfoundland population growth beginnings of government establishment of churches reinforcement of commercial ties with North America and development of the seal salmon and Grand Banks fisheries St John s population grew slowly Although it was primarily a fishing station it was also a garrison a centre of government and a commercial hub St John s served as a naval base during the American Revolutionary War and the War of br br Guglielmo Marconi received the first transatlantic wireless signal in St John s on December from his wireless station in Poldhu Cornwall St John s was the starting point for the first non stop transatlantic aircraft flight by Alcock and Brown in a modified Vickers Vimy IV bomber in June departing from Lester s Field in St John s and ending in a bog near Clifden Connemara Ireland In July the flight was duplicated by American aviator and adventurer Steve Fossett in a replica Vickers Vimy aircraft with St John s International Airport substituting for Lester s Field now an urban and residential part of the city br During the Second World War the harbour supported Royal Navy and Royal Canadian Navy ships that were engaged in anti submarine warfare It was the site of an American Army Air Force base Fort Pepperrell that was established as part of the Lend Lease Destroyers for Bases Agreement between the United Kingdom and United States The base included several US manned coast defence guns and a Canadian manned battery of two Lend Lease inch M guns was at Fort Cape Spear The base was transferred to Canadian control in and is now known as CFS St John s The Knights of Columbus Hostel fire in December saw military and civilian lives lost br St John s and the province as a whole was gravely affected in the s by the collapse of the northern cod fishery which had been the driving force of the provincial economy for hundreds of years After a decade of high unemployment rates and depopulation the city s proximity to the Hibernia Terra Nova and White Rose oil fields led to an economic boom that spurred population growth and commercial development As a result the St John s area now accounts for about half of the province s economic output br As of St John s contained National Historic Sites of Canada br br br Fires br St John s was destroyed by major fires in and when each time a large part of the city was destroyed The most famous was the Great Fire of br On February br br about eight o clock a fire broke out in a house in a part of the town in St John s in Newfoundland known by the name of the King s Beach and speedily communicated to the houses adjoining and burnt with so much fury that one hundred and twenty houses the homes of about a thousand men women and children were consumed before the conflagration was stayed br There were two citywide fires in known jointly as The Great Fire of Then in fire destroyed houses br There was a further major fire in which started at the shop of a cabinetmaker named Hamlin located on George Street off Queen Street when a glue pot boiled over The fire spread along Water and Duckworth Streets destroying all of the buildings in its path aided by the large quantities of seal oil that were stored in the merchants premises The fire was also aided by an attempt to blow up a house on Water Street which scattered burning embers across the city br The final major conflagration of the nineteenth century began on the afternoon of July atop Carter s Hill on Freshwater Road Initially the fire did not cause any widespread panic however a series of catastrophic coincidences caused the fire to spread and devour virtually all of the east end of the city including much of its major commercial area before being extinguished br br br Geography br St John s is along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean on the northeast of the Avalon Peninsula in southeast Newfoundland The city is North America s most easterly city excluding Greenland it is km mi closer to London England than it is to Edmonton Alberta It is also closer to all of Ireland than to Miami also on the east coast of North America The city is the largest in the province and the second largest in the Atlantic Provinces after Halifax Nova Scotia Its downtown area lies to the west and north of St John s Harbour and the rest of the city expands from the downtown to the north south east and west The city covers a total of km sq mi larger than Montreal but the majority of its area remains covered by undeveloped woods br Coniferous trees such as black spruce white spruce and balsam fir dominate the native vegetation The largest deciduous tree is white birch species of lesser stature include alder cherry and mountain ash Of introduced tree species sycamore maple is most abundant and Norway maple is common Blue spruce common horsechestnut European beech and littleleaf linden are among the other non native species grown br br br Climate br br St John s has a humid continental climate K ppen Dfb br with smaller seasonal variation than normal for the latitude which is due to Gulf Stream moderation br Mean temperatures range from C F in February to C F in August showing somewhat of a seasonal lag in the climate The city is also one of the areas of the country most prone to tropical cyclone activity as it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east where tropical storms and sometimes hurricanes travel from the United States The city is one of the rainiest in Canada outside of coastal British Columbia This is partly due to its propensity for tropical storm activity as well as moist Atlantic air frequently blowing ashore and creating precipitation br Of major Canadian cities St John s is the foggiest days and windiest km h mph average speed Precipitation is frequent and often heavy falling year round On average summer is the driest season with only occasional thunderstorm activity and the wettest months are from October to January with December the wettest single month with nearly mm in of precipitation on average This winter precipitation maximum is unusual for humid continental climates which typically have a late spring or early summer precipitation maximum for example most of the Midwestern United States Most heavy precipitation events in St John s are the product of intense mid latitude storms from the Northeastern United States and New England states and these are most common and intense from October to March bringing heavy precipitation commonly to mm to in of rainfall equivalent in a single storm and strong winds br In winter two or more types of precipitation rain freezing rain sleet and snow can fall from passage of a single storm Snowfall is heavy averaging approximately cm in per winter season However winter storms can bring changing precipitation types Heavy snow can turn into heavy rain melting the snow cover and possibly back to snow or ice perhaps briefly all in the same storm resulting in little or no net snow accumulation Snow cover in St John s is variable and especially early in the winter season may be slow to develop but can extend well into the spring months March April The St John s area is subject to freezing rain events called silver thaws the worst of which paralysed the city in April and April br On January St John s declared a state of emergency due to a snowstorm that brought an estimated cm in a one day snowfall record for St John s and hurricane force winds up to km h mph The following day the Canadian Army was called in to aid snow removal The state of emergency ended eight days later br The highest temperature ever recorded in St John s was C F on August The coldest temperature ever recorded was C F on February br br br Cityscape br br br St John s architecture has a distinct style different from the rest of Canada and its major buildings are remnants of its history as one of the first British colonial capitals Buildings took a variety of styles according to the means available to build them br Starting as a fishing outpost for European fishermen St John s consisted mostly of the homes of fishermen sheds storage shacks and wharves constructed out of wood Like many other cities of the time as the Industrial Revolution took hold and new methods and materials for construction were introduced the landscape changed as the city grew The Great Fire of destroyed most of the downtown core and most residential and other wood frame buildings date from this period br br Often compared to San Francisco due to the hilly terrain and steep maze of residential streets in St John s is typically painted in bright colours hence the nickname Jelly Bean Row for downtown row housing The city council has implemented strict heritage regulations in the downtown area including restrictions on the height of buildings These regulations have caused much controversy over the years With the city experiencing an economic boom a lack of hotel rooms and office space has seen proposals put forward that do not meet the current height regulations Heritage advocates argue the current regulations should be enforced while others believe the regulations should be relaxed to encourage economic development br To meet the need for more office space downtown without compromising the city s heritage the city council amended heritage regulations which originally restricted height to m ft in the area of land on Water Street between Bishop s Cove and Steer s Cove to create the Commercial Central Retail West Zone The new zone will allow for buildings of greater height A m ft storey office building which includes retail space and a parking garage was the first building to be approved in this

service which is supported by the federal provincial and municipal governments has been the key to the expansion of the city s labour force and to the stability of its economy which supports a sizeable retail service and business sector br With the collapse of the cod fishing industry in Newfoundland and Labrador in the s the role of the ocean is now tied to what lies beneath it oil and gas as opposed to what swims in or travels across it The city is the centre of the oil and gas industry in Eastern Canada and is one of World Energy Cities ExxonMobil Canada is headquartered in St John s
