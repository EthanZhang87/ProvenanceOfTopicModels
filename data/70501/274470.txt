The St Louis Eagles were a professional ice hockey team that played in the National Hockey League NHL Based in St Louis the Eagles played for only one year the NHL season br The team was founded in as the Ottawa Senators a successful independent team that joined the NHL as a charter member in From the mid s onward they endured financial strain caused in part by being in the NHL s smallest market The financial problems forced the Senators to suspend operations for the season Upon their return to play having sold their better players in an effort to raise funds the Senators finished in last place for two straight seasons and continued to lose money Following the repeat last place finishes the team decided that it could not survive in Ottawa and hoped to move to a bigger market br In an attempt to recoup losses and pay outstanding debts the Senators moved to St Louis as the Eagles However the team continued to lose money because of increased travel expenses and it was forced to sell players to other teams to meet its financial obligations br After the season the owners asked the NHL for permission to suspend operations for a second time This time the NHL refused the request Instead the league bought back the franchise halted its operations and dispersed its players among the remaining teams br br br History br br br The move from Ottawa br br The Ottawa Senators were founded in as an amateur club They began paying their players under the table in and turned openly professional in They were a charter member of the National Hockey League NHL in and won the Stanley Cup four times in the NHL s first decade and seven times prior to the league s formation including their time as the Silver Seven br However for the better part of their tenure in Ottawa the Senators played in the smallest market in the NHL The census listed only people in the city of Ottawa roughly one fifth the size of Toronto the league s second smallest market The team started having attendance problems when the NHL expanded to the United States in games against the new American teams did not draw well Despite winning what would be its last Stanley Cup in the team lost for the season The Senators asked the NHL for permission to suspend operations for the season in order to help eliminate debt The league granted the request During their suspended season Ottawa received for the use of its players while the NHL co signed a Bank of Montreal loan of for the franchise The Senators returned for the season and finished in last place They finished last again in season After the season the Ottawa Auditorium owners of the Senators announced that the team would be moving elsewhere for the next season due to losses of over the previous two seasons Auditorium officials said they needed to move the Senators to a larger city in order to protect the shareholders and pay off their debts br The Senators owners decided to move the franchise to St Louis Missouri and the transfer was approved by the league on May Thomas Franklin Ahearn resigned as president of the Ottawa Auditorium and Redmond Quain became president Quain transferred the players contracts and franchise operations to a new company called the Hockey Association of St Louis Inc Eddie Gerard was hired to coach the new team The club was renamed the Eagles inspired by the logo of the Anheuser Busch brewing company which was founded in St Louis The Senators name and logo remained in Ottawa and would be used by a senior amateur team until At the time St Louis was the seventh largest city in the United States with over inhabitants over seven times larger than Ottawa Despite this St Louis had been denied an NHL franchise in because travel to the Midwest was considered too expensive during the Great Depression br Even before the debut of the Eagles a problem had arisen for the new NHL club There was already a professional hockey team in the city the St Louis Flyers playing in the minor pro American Hockey Association AHA The owners of the Flyers claimed they had an agreement with the NHL which prevented it from settling west of the Mississippi They threatened to sue for in compensation as soon as the Eagles played their first game Following a visit from the AHA President the Flyers were asked not to go forward with the lawsuit The Flyers did not pursue further legal action and eventually changed their home arena br br br season br br At the time there were nine teams in the NHL divided into two divisions the Canadian and American Logically the Eagles should have been placed in the American Division with the Boston Bruins Chicago Black Hawks New York Rangers and Detroit Red Wings However the Eagles retained the Senators place in the Canadian Division alongside the Toronto Maple Leafs Montreal Canadiens Montreal Maroons and New York Americans The core of the Senators players returned and the team played their games in the St Louis Arena The arena was built in to host the National Dairy Show but had suffered financially In an ice hockey rink was set up to attract new business Once the Eagles began play the St Louis Arena gained the distinction of being the only NHL stadium with racially segregated seating br In their first game the Eagles succumbed to a late rally by the defending Stanley Cup champion Black Hawks losing They registered their first win in the next game winning over the Rangers Following the win the Eagles went on an eight game losing streak After the first games the Eagles posted a record placing them last in their division Gerard resigned as head coach and was replaced by George Buck Boucher the coach that Gerard himself had replaced after the franchise s last season in Ottawa br Under Boucher s coaching the team showed improvement posting a record in the first nine games However the early losing streak had already damaged the fan base Their inaugural game drew fans but attendance quickly diminished In early January the team cut ticket prices to the lowest in the league in an attempt to bring out fans By February the financial state of the team forced the Eagles to essentially sell leading goal scorer Syd Howe to the Detroit Red Wings Officially the trade broke down as such Detroit received Howe and Ralph Bowman in exchange for Teddy Graham and At the time it was considered a large sum of money Likewise Frank Finnigan was sold to the Maple Leafs The Eagles were unable to maintain the early success under Boucher and finished with the worst record in the league for the third year in a row with a record of With only goals scored they were the lowest scoring team in the league Only the Montreal Canadiens allowed more goals during the season surrendering to the Eagles br br br The end of the Eagles br br By season s end the Eagles ownership had lost due primarily to the cost of train travel In those days NHL teams traveled primarily by rail Due to being in the Canadian Division the Eagles had to make many trips to Montreal and Toronto An attempt to stabilize the franchise by selling off some of its players netted The owners had hoped to move again to save the franchise There was interest from Cleveland and also in a return to Ottawa but neither came to fruition br As a result the ownership again petitioned the NHL to allow them to suspend operations for a year This time the NHL refused and the Eagles were put up for sale After no credible offers surfaced the NHL bought the franchise and player contracts for and opted to play as an eight team league If the NHL ever resold the franchise proceeds were to go to the Ottawa Hockey Association br The NHL distributed the players under contract with St Louis through a dispersal draft Teams selected players in an order based on the previous season s standings Teams with the lowest point totals selected first The Chicago Black Hawks did not participate in the draft Eighteen of the players under contract were selected with the remaining players being placed in the minor leagues The players were distributed as follows br br New York Americans Forwards Pete Kelly Eddie Finnigan br Montreal Canadiens Goaltender Bill Beveridge Defenseman Irv

Joe Lamb Goaltender Bill Taugher br Boston Bruins Forward Bill Cowley Defenseman Teddy Graham br Toronto Maple Leafs Forwards Gerry Shannon Cliff Purpur Jim Dewey Defenseman Mickey Blake br No credible offers to purchase the dormant franchise ever surfaced As a result the Senators Eagles franchise never took the ice again and remain one of two NHL teams to fold after winning a Stanley Cup the other being the Maroons br In the Montreal Maroons attempted to move to St Louis They were denied by the NHL due to the high travel costs that plagued the Eagles The NHL returned to St Louis in when the league doubled in size from the Original Six The new team was named the Blues and they joined the Minnesota North Stars Los Angeles Kings Oakland Seals Philadelphia Flyers and Pittsburgh
