The NHL Winter Classic French La Classique hivernale de la LNH is an annual outdoor ice hockey game played during the National Hockey League s NHL regular season on or around New Year s Day It is generally held in a football or baseball stadium in the United States in an area with a resident NHL team though for most of the game s existence they are usually played in a baseball stadium to avoid scheduling and logistical conflicts with football stadiums during the National Football League regular season The Winter Classic is distinct from the league s two other series of outdoor games the NHL Heritage Classic and the NHL Stadium Series The first Winter Classic was held in at Ralph Wilson Stadium now Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park New York between the Buffalo Sabres and Pittsburgh Penguins Fifteen Winter Classics have been held as of January The most recent game was played during the NHL season at T Mobile Park with the Seattle Kraken defeating the Vegas Golden Knights br After the success of the Cold War at Michigan State University in and the Heritage Classic the NHL s first regular season outdoor game the league inaugurated the Winter Classic in It eventually caught on as

attendance record of The Winter Classic has been contested only in the United States while the Heritage Classic has been held exclusively in Canada The Winter Classic featured only American teams for its first five games until the Maple Leafs appearance in br Along with the NHL All Star Game the Winter Classic is considered one of the NHL s premier events with matchups generally booked to showcase the league s most popular teams and players the event garners the league its highest attendance and among its highest television ratings The event is typically promoted as a return to the sport s outdoor roots meant to evoke memories of pond hockey Its popularity has led to the scheduling of additional outdoor hockey games both in the NHL and other leagues worldwide In May the SportsBusiness Journal and SportsBusiness Daily named the Winter Classic its Sports Event of the Year the second time in five years the Classic has won that distinction br br br History br br The Winter Classic as a television event was presented by NBC Sports Executive VP Jon Miller He pitched the idea to the NHL in but they didn t find the concept workable In December Miller found an ally in then Executive VP Business Media John Collins who embraced the idea br The first Winter Classic was held January between the Buffalo Sabres and Pittsburgh Penguins at Ralph Wilson Stadium in Orchard Park New York The game had a then NHL record crowd of fans in attendance The success of the NHL Winter Classic led the NHL to schedule a second one for held at Wrigley Field in Chicago Illinois on January matching the Detroit Red Wings against the Chicago Blackhawks That game had the highest American television ratings of any hockey game in years br br Weather has proven to affect the game with the and classics being delayed due to rain and other weather Outdoor effects of wind and sun glare may give an unfair advantage to one team so the NHL sometimes modifies the third and overtime periods In this case play is stopped at the midway point and teams switch directions This option was exercised in and The and games also featured the teams switching ends halfway through the five minute overtime period for the same reason In and the games went into a shootout where both goaltenders alternated defending the same goal rather than the normal practice of defending opposite goals br The Winter Classic was made a part of the NHL schedule through at least January as part of the league s television contract initially with NBC and Versus then just NBC after Comcast the parent company of Versus bought NBC and merged Versus into the NBC Sports banner br The Winter Classic in Philadelphia was not played on New Year s Day as that fell on a Sunday in and conflicted with the NFL s final week of regular season games Instead following precedent set by college football s bowl games which move their games to Monday when January lands on Sunday and to prevent the risk of a weather delay pushing the game into the timeslot for NBC Sunday Night Football the game took place on January The game was played at Citizens Bank Park home of the Philadelphia Phillies Neighboring Lincoln Financial Field home of the Philadelphia Eagles was reportedly preferred but as the Eagles hosted a home game on January the NHL could not undertake the required week long renovations needed to construct the outdoor playing arena The New York Rangers defeated the Philadelphia Flyers br br The sixth Winter Classic was scheduled for Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor in with the Detroit Red Wings hosting the Toronto Maple Leafs in an Original Six matchup However the NHL lockout disrupted the season leading to the game s cancellation on November The matchup was rescheduled for the Winter Classic at the same venue with the same participants It was the first time a Canadian team participated in the Winter Classic An NHL record total of tickets were sold greater than the Guinness World Records certified world record attendance of at The Big Chill at the Big House also held at Michigan Stadium However on January an NHL source reported that the certified attendance based on tickets scanned at the venue fell short

Classic following on January The St Louis Blues defeated the Chicago Blackhawks by the score of scoring goals in the third period br To celebrate the tenth anniversary of the first Winter Classic the NHL announced on May that the Buffalo Sabres would take part in the game against the New York Rangers at Citi Field Due to a agreement with New York City and state tax laws that give their home arena Madison Square Garden tax exempt status the Rangers must not cease playing home games at MSG which is generally interpreted as meaning playing a home game at any other venue and thus Rangers hosted the game but played as the visiting team The arrangement gave the Sabres only games for the season in their home city of Buffalo while the Rangers played games not counting away games against the New York Islanders in New York City The NHL had used a similar policy for the Rangers in the Stadium Series and the NHL Premiere The game was played on January br br On November the NHL announced that the Chicago Blackhawks would host the Boston Bruins in the Winter Classic scheduled for January The game was played at Notre Dame Stadium in Notre Dame Indiana and was the first instance of a Winter

originally announced on January that the NHL Winter Classic would feature the Minnesota Wild at Target Field in Minneapolis Minnesota The league later confirmed the St Louis Blues as the opponent However due to the COVID pandemic delaying the conclusion of the season to September and postponing the start of the following season the event was moved to at its earliest With a temperature of F at puck drop the Winter Classic became the coldest outdoor game in NHL history as the Blues won br In the NHL ended its relationship with NBC and signed new agreements with ESPN and TNT As ESPN has a full slate of college bowl games on New Year s Day TNT will hold rights to the Winter Classic throughout the entire broadcast contract br On February the NHL announced that Fenway Park would be the site of the NHL Winter Classic As a result Fenway Park became the third outdoor stadium to host multiple outdoor games and the first to host two Winter Classics On April the Penguins were announced as the opponent with the game being held on January as January falls on Sunday The Bruins won the game br On January the day of the Winter Classic NHL commissioner Gary Bettman announced on the game s pregame show that the Seattle Kraken would host the edition of the Winter Classic at T Mobile Park playing against the Vegas Golden Knights This was the first Winter Classic to be held on the American West Coast and the first between Pacific Division opponents This was also be the first Winter Classic and the second NHL outdoor game to take place in a retractable roof stadium Due to Seattle s rainy climate that may affect ice conditions organizers planned on closing the T Mobile Park roof in case of heavy rainfall The game ended with the Kraken becoming the first team to earn a shutout in a Winter Classic defeating the Golden Knights br On February it was announced that the NHL Winter Classic will take place at Wrigley Field in Chicago with the Chicago Blackhawks facing the St Louis Blues Wrigley Field joined Fenway Park as the only two time hosts of a Winter Classic and it will also mark the first repeat matchup in a Winter Classic with the Blackhawks and Blues previously facing off at Busch Stadium in It was then announced that the game would take place on December which marked the first and only time two Winter Classics were held in one calendar year and the first Winter Classic to take place on New Year s Eve br br br Possible future sites br Due to the popularity of the event every NHL team has requested to participate in the Winter Classic either as the host or the visiting team While proposals have been made for nearly every outdoor National Football League NFL stadium to host with the end of the NFL season taking place at the same time of the Winter Classic followed by the NFL Playoffs starting the following week in order to host the game the stadium s NFL team would have to play a Thursday Night Football game in Week followed by an away game in Week to even consider the possibility of hosting as was the case for the game Stadiums with natural grass fields such as Acrisure Stadium have already ruled out this possibility as there would be no time to resod the field or correct any other field damage caused by the game The tight timeline would also rule out the ability for other support events such as alumni games or local college lower level hockey games as the rink would have to be de constructed immediately after the Winter Classic to ensure venue availability for NFL Playoff games br While some NCAA College Football stadiums are unavailable to host due to already existing bowl games most of these games are held in warmer weather climates opening up the possibility of the largest Big Ten Conference Stadiums such as Michigan Stadium which hosted in Ohio Stadium Beaver Stadium and other large stadiums such as Notre Dame Stadium which hosted in Most Major League Soccer soccer specific stadiums have seating capacities significantly lower than the other available facilities With Major League Baseball MLB in its offseason and with few other uses for its stadiums during winter more MLB stadiums have hosted than other type of venue and are expected to be contenders for hosting most future Winter Classics br Non sports venues like the National Mall or Central Park have also been proposed but present logistical

Winter Classic in Canada is not as high as it is in the United States On Canada s CBC Television network the Winter Classic has lower ratings than its weekly regular season telecasts Hockey Night in

in the Winter Classic and the Canadiens in the edition Nevertheless the Winter Classic continues to air on Canadian television but since the games are moved to Sportsnet In addition Sportsnet elected
