id: 900020
The NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement CBA is the basic contract between the National Hockey League NHL team owners and NHL commissioner and the NHL Players Association NHLPA designed to be arrived at through the typical labour management negotiations of collective bargaining On January an agreement was tentatively reached after a labour dispute cancelled regular season games of the season and was ratified by the league s Board of Governors on January as well as by the NHLPA membership three days later on January As originally signed the CBA was a year deal longest in NHL history expiring after the season On July the NHL and NHLPA announced the extension of the CBA through the NHL season br br br History br br br lockout br br The previous agreement was signed in following a lockout which shortened the NHL season to games a loss of games from what had originally been an game schedule None of the games scheduled for the segment of the season was ever played the lockout lasting until after the beginning of The collective bargaining agreement was initially to last for six seasons and be open to re negotiation in but was eventually extended to last until September one day after the World Cup of Hockey final in Toronto br br br lockout br br On the expiration date of the old agreement the NHL Board of Governors representing ownership met and unanimously decided that the NHL season would be delayed until a new collective bargaining agreement was in place The owners lockout of players began at a m on September the day most NHL training camps would have opened had the NHLPA and the NHL come to an agreement By November it became apparent that the entire season was in jeopardy and supposedly last ditch efforts were undertaken to avoid this but little if any progress was seen during the last few months of The general consensus of many sportswriters and other knowledgeable observers was that if the entire season were cancelled the owners would attempt to open training camps in September for the NHL season using replacement players who are either not members of the NHLPA or were willing to resign their memberships br On February the U S Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service called a meeting between the two sides to negotiate a new deal Three days later NHL commissioner Gary Bettman officially cancelled the season There was some hope that a season could have been salvaged as hockey legends Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux both now part owners of NHL teams brought the owners and players together for talks on February However the two sides failed to reach an agreement br Once the possibility of losing a second season to the dispute became real and the two sides realized that the dispute had alienated a large portion of the league s fan base the league and the NHLPA resumed negotiations again in June Many pundits thought that the two sides wished to come to an agreement in early July to coincide with the Canada Day July and United States Independence Day July holiday season While July passed without an agreement momentum for a settlement was clearly building with the two sides meeting daily between July and July Reportedly the July session lasted until a m local time UTC on July at which time talks recessed for five hours The sides announced a tentative agreement at p m Eastern Time UTC on the th br The most important provision of the new collective bargaining agreement was an overall salary cap for all NHL teams tied to league revenues The agreement also phased in a reduced age for free agency which would eventually give players unrestricted rights to negotiate with any team at age or after years of play in the NHL whichever came first br On September the NHL and NHLPA ratified an agreement to alter how the salary cap hit of long term contracts would be calculated The new salary cap accounting system would see two distinct changes First long term contracts remain valid but contracts that include years when a player aged or older will only have the portion of their salaries before they turn included in cap hit calculation Second if the average value of the three highest seasons is million or more then the value of years through will have a minimum cap charge of million br These changes came shortly after Ilya Kovalchuk s contract extension with the New Jersey Devils was voided due to cap circumvention Other long term contracts such as Marc Savard Roberto Luongo and Marian Hossa were grandfathered and their respective cap hits calculated under the old accounting system However any long term contracts signed on or after September would be subject to the new system br br br lockout br br The CBA expired on September The NHL season was the final year of the then current collective bargaining agreement as the NHL Players Association would no longer have the option to extend the current CBA The players association could not move the expiration date to June in order to avoid a repeat of the lockout that cancelled the season br Just after AM on January after approximately continuous hours of negotiating a tentative deal was reached on a new collective bargaining agreement to end the lockout It was ratified by the league s Board of Governors on January as well as by the NHLPA membership three days later on January The deal was also officially signed that day br br br Present status br Originally the CBA was on a ten year deal and would have expired on September The NHL and NHLPA had a choice to opt out of the CBA on September and September but they chose not to The NHL paused play in its season on March due to the COVID pandemic On July the NHL and NHLPA announced the extension of the CBA through the NHL season Various elements of the Return to Play plan were
