id: 3676471
The history of the National Hockey League begins with the end of its predecessor league the National Hockey Association NHA in After unsuccessfully attempting to resolve disputes with Eddie Livingstone owner of the Toronto Blueshirts executives of the three other NHA franchises suspended the NHA and formed the National Hockey League NHL replacing the Livingstone team with a temporary team in Toronto the Arenas The NHL s first quarter century saw the league compete against two rival major leagues the Pacific Coast Hockey Association and Western Canada Hockey League for players and the Stanley Cup The NHL first expanded into the United States in with the founding of the Boston Bruins and by consisted of ten teams in Ontario Quebec the Great Lakes region and the Northeastern United States At the same time the NHL emerged as the only major league and the sole competitor for the Stanley Cup in the NHL completed a deal with the Stanley Cup trustees to gain full control of the Cup The NHL s footprint spread across Canada as Foster Hewitt s radio broadcasts were heard coast to coast starting in br The Great Depression and World War II reduced the league to six teams later known as the Original Six by Maurice Richard became the first player to score goals in a season in and ten years later Richard was suspended for assaulting a linesman leading to the Richard Riot Gordie Howe made his debut in and retired seasons later as the NHL s all time leader in goals and points China Clipper Larry Kwong becomes the first non white player in the league breaking the NHL colour barrier in when he played for the New York Rangers Willie O Ree broke the NHL s black colour barrier when he suited up for the Bruins in In Jacques Plante became the first goaltender to regularly use a mask for protection br The Original Six era ended in when the NHL doubled in size by adding six new expansion teams The six existing teams were formed into the newly created East Division while the expansion teams were formed into the West Division The NHL continued to expand adding another six teams to total by This continued expansion was partially brought about by the NHL s attempts to compete with the World Hockey Association which operated from until and sought to compete with the NHL for markets and players Bobby Hull was the most famous player to defect to the rival league signing a million contract with the Winnipeg Jets The NHL became involved in international play in the mid s starting with the Summit Series in which pitted the top Canadian players of the NHL against the top players in the Soviet Union which was won by Canada with four wins three losses and a tie Eventually Soviet Bloc players streamed into the NHL with the fall of the Iron Curtain in br When the WHA ceased operations in the NHL absorbed four of the league s teams which brought the NHL to teams a figure that remained constant until the San Jose Sharks were added as an expansion franchise in Since then the league has grown from teams in to today as the NHL spread its footprint across the United States The league has withstood major labour conflicts in and the latter of which saw the entire NHL season canceled the first time in North American history that a league has canceled an entire season in a labour dispute Wayne Gretzky passed Gordie Howe as the NHL s all time leading scorer in when he scored his nd career goal Mario Lemieux overcame non Hodgkin lymphoma to finish his NHL career with over points and two Stanley Cup championships Increased use of defence focused systems helped cause scoring to fall in the late s leading some to argue that the NHL s talent pool had been diluted by s expansion In the NHL began awarding teams a single point for losing in overtime hoping to reduce the number of tie games after the lockout it eliminated the tie altogether introducing the shootout to ensure that each game has a winner br br br Background and founding br br The first attempts to regulate competitive ice hockey matches came in the late s Before then teams competed in tournaments and infrequent challenge contests that prevailed in the Canadian sports world at the time In four clubs from Montreal formed the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada AHAC and developed a structured schedule In Lord Stanley donated the Stanley Cup to be symbolic of the Canadian championship and appointed Philip Dansken Ross and Sheriff John Sweetland as its trustees It was awarded to the AHAC champion Montreal Hockey Club and thereafter awarded to the league champions or to any pre approved team that won it in a challenge In the International Hockey League IHL based around Lake Michigan was created as the first fully professional league which lasted for two seasons In recruiting players the IHL caused an Athletic War that drained amateur clubs of top players most noticeably in the Ontario Hockey Association OHA In the season the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association ECAHA was formed which mixed paid and amateur players in its rosters which led to the demise of the IHL Bidding wars for players led many ECAHA teams to lose money and it eventually folded on November As a result of the dissolution of the ECAHA two leagues were formed the Canadian Hockey Association CHA and the National Hockey Association NHA Since the NHA s owners were notable wealthy businessmen the CHA did not complete a season as the NHA easily recruited the top players and interest in the CHA teams faded By the rival Pacific Coast Hockey Association PCHA league was launched and the NHA champion would play off each season against the PCHA champion for the Stanley Cup ending the challenge era br The National Hockey League came into existence with the suspension of the NHA in After unsuccessfully resolving disputes with Eddie Livingstone owner of the Toronto Blueshirts executives of the three other NHA franchises the Montreal Canadiens Montreal Wanderers and Ottawa Senators suspended the NHA and formed the NHL replacing Livingstone s team with a temporary team in Toronto the Arenas While new the NHL was a continuation of the NHA The NHL adopted the NHA s constitution its rules playing with six men to a side rather than the then traditional seven and the NHA s split season schedule The owners originally intended the NHL to only operate for one season However the NHA was suspended permanently in and ceased to be an organisation in In the NHA championship trophy O Brien Cup was adopted as the championship trophy of the NHL br br br Founding br br br Early years br br One of the NHL s first superstars was the prolific goal scorer Joe Malone who scored goals in games in the NHL s first season of which five were netted on the NHL s opening night He also set the record for the most goals in a game that season with seven Six games into the season the Montreal Wanderers were forced to permanently withdraw from the league as a fire left them without an arena In the season the Montreal Canadiens faced the Seattle Metropolitans of the PCHA for the Stanley Cup amid the Spanish influenza pandemic The series was called off after five games when numerous players became ill one Joe Hall of the Canadiens died a few weeks later br br During the early s the NHL faced competition for players from two other major leagues the PCHA and the Western Canada Hockey League WCHL As a result ice hockey players were among the best paid athletes in North America By the mid s the NHL emerged as the sole major league in North America the PCHA and WCHL merged in only to disband two years later The Victoria Cougars are the last non NHL team to win the Stanley Cup having defeated the Canadiens in and lost to the Montreal Maroons in respectively The NHL continued to expand adding the Maroons and its first American team the Boston Bruins in getting up to teams by Defence dominated the NHL and in the season Canadiens goaltender George Hainsworth set what remains a league record with shutouts in games In response the NHL began to allow forward passing in the offensive zone which caused the offense to increase by approximately times to stem the tide the NHL introduced the offside rule which prevents offensive players from entering the opponent s zone before the puck crosses the blue line br Livingstone continued to press claims in court throughout the s going as far as the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London England In early the Toronto franchise was sold to Conn Smythe who renamed it to the Maple Leafs and successfully promised to win the Stanley Cup in five years He built the Maple Leaf Gardens which included radio broadcaster Foster Hewitt s famous broadcast booth affectionately referred to as a gondola On December Eddie Shore charged Ace Bailey causing a severe skull fracture following what Shore thought was a check from Bailey but was actually made by King Clancy Despite the grim prognosis newspapers printed his obituary Bailey survived but did not play another game The Maple Leafs hosted the Ace Bailey All Star Benefit Game which raised over for Bailey and his family br br br Great Depression br br While Conn Smythe was able to successfully build a new arena numerous other teams experienced financial difficulties With the folding of the Philadelphia Quakers originally the Pittsburgh Pirates and the St Louis Eagles originally the Ottawa Senators the NHL was reduced to eight teams starting in the season The Montreal Canadiens narrowly escaped a move to Cleveland Ohio before a syndicate of Montreal businessmen bought the team Montreal s financial troubles forced them to sell popular player Howie Morenz When Morenz scored against the Canadiens on the last day of the season Montreal fans voiced their opinion giving him a standing ovation Morenz was eventually re acquired by Montreal and on January Morenz s skate became caught in the ice during a play He suffered a broken leg in four places and died on March of a coronary embolism people filed past Morenz s casket at centre ice of the Montreal Forum to pay their last respects A benefit game held in November raised for Morenz s family as the NHL All Stars defeated the Montreal Canadiens br In the mid s Chicago Black Hawks owner and staunch American nationalist Frederic McLaughlin commanded his general manager to compile a team of only American players at the time Taffy Abel was the only American born player who was a regular player in the league With eight out of players Americans the Black Hawks won only of games In the playoffs however the Hawks upset the Canadiens New York Americans and the Maple Leafs to become the only team in NHL history to win the Stanley Cup despite a losing regular season record In the Stanley Cup Finals the heavily favoured Toronto Maple Leafs were facing an upset having fallen in the seven game series to the fifth place Detroit Red Wings Toronto rebounded and won the next four games to capture the Stanley Cup becoming the first of four teams in the NHL to come back from a series deficit and the only team to accomplish that in the Stanley Cup Finals br Prior to the season the Montreal Maroons folded due to financial difficulties while the New York Americans suffered a similar fate prior to the season With the league reduced to six teams the Original Six era began The league was nearly reduced to five teams before the following season as World War II had ravaged the rosters of many teams to such an extent that teams battled each other for players With only five returning players from the previous season New York Rangers general manager Lester Patrick suggested suspending his team s play for the duration of the war but was persuaded otherwise br br br Original Six br br br Post war period br br In February league President Frank Calder collapsed during a meeting dying shortly after Red Dutton agreed to take over as president after receiving assurances from the league that the Brooklyn franchise he had operated would resume play after the war When the other team owners reneged on this promise in Dutton resigned as league president With Dutton s recommendation Clarence Campbell was named president of the NHL in He remained in that role until his retirement in For the first years of his presidency the same six teams located in Boston Chicago Detroit Montreal New York and Toronto competed for the Stanley Cup and that period has been called the golden age of hockey The NHL featured increasingly intense rivalries coupled with rule innovations that opened up the game The first official All Star Game took place at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto on October to raise money for the newly created NHL Pension Society The NHL All Stars defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs and raised C for the pension fund br br The s Canadiens were led by the Punch line of Elmer Lach Toe Blake and Maurice Rocket Richard In Lach Richard and Blake finished first second and third in the NHL s scoring race with and points respectively It was Richard who became the focus of the media and fans as he attempted to score goals in a game season a feat no other player had accomplished in league history Richard scored his th goal in Boston at of the third period of Montreal s final game of the season On March Larry Kwong the China Clipper becomes the first non white player in the NHL breaking the colour barrier He suited up for the New York Rangers against the Montreal Canadiens at the Montreal Forum br In March Richard was suspended for the remainder of the season including the playoffs after he received a match penalty for slashing Boston s Hal Laycoe then punching a linesman who attempted to intervene The suspension touched off a wave of anger towards league president Clarence Campbell who was warned not to attend a scheduled game in Montreal after receiving numerous death threats mainly from French Canadians accusing him of anti French bias Campbell dismissed the warnings and attended the March game as planned His presence at the game was perceived by many fans as a provocation and he was booed and pelted with eggs and fruit An hour into the game a fan lobbed a tear gas bomb in Campbell s direction and firefighters decided to clear the building Fans leaving the game and a growing mob of angry demonstrators rioted outside of the Montreal Forum which became known as l affaire Richard or the Richard Riot Richard became the first player to score career goals on October He retired in as an eight time Stanley Cup champion as well as the NHL s all time leading scorer with goals br In the fall of Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe watched special television feeds of games in an attempt to determine whether it would be a suitable medium for broadcasting hockey games Television already had its detractors within the NHL especially in Campbell In even though only of Canadians owned a television set the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation CBC began televising games On November Hockey Night in Canada was first broadcast on television with Foster Hewitt calling the action between the Leafs and Bruins at Maple Leaf Gardens The broadcasts quickly became the highest rated show on Canadian television Campbell feared televised hockey would cause people to stop attending games in person but Smythe felt the opposite CBS first broadcast hockey games in the United States in the season as an experiment Amazed with the initial popularity of the broadcasts it inaugurated a game package of games the following year The NHL itself adapted to be viewer friendly In the league mandated that the ice surface be painted white to make the puck easier to see On January Willie O Ree joined the Bruins as an injury call up for a game in Montreal In doing so he became the first black player in the NHL br Clint Benedict was the first goaltender to wear facial protection donning it in to protect a broken nose He quickly abandoned his mask as its design interfered with his vision Twenty nine years later on November in a game against New York Rangers Jacques Plante made the goaltender mask a permanent fixture in hockey The first players union was formed February by Red Wings player Ted Lindsay who had sat on the board of the NHL s Pension Society since Lindsay and his fellow players were upset by the league s refusal to let them view the books related to the pension fund The league claimed that it could not contribute more than it did but the players on the Pension Committee suspected otherwise The idea quickly gained popularity and when the union s founding was announced publicly nearly every NHL player had signed up Led by Alan Eagleson the National Hockey League Players Association NHLPA was formed in and it quickly received acceptance from the owners br br br Dynasties br br The Original Six era was a period of dynasties The Toronto Maple Leafs won the Stanley Cup five times between and In the Stanley Cup Finals the Maple Leafs defeated the Canadiens four games to one in the only final in NHL history when all games were decided in overtime Beginning in the Red Wings won seven consecutive regular season titles a feat that no other team has accomplished During that time the Wings won four Stanley Cups It was during the Stanley Cup Finals that the Legend of the Octopus was created Brothers Pete and Jerry Cusimano brought a dead octopus to the Detroit Olympia for the fourth game of the finals They hoped that the octopus would inspire Detroit to an eighth game victory Detroit went on to defeat Montreal and the tradition was born The Red Wings faced the Canadiens in the Stanley Cup Finals in three consecutive seasons between and Detroit won the first two match ups but Montreal captured the Stanley Cup ending one dynasty and starting another The Canadiens won five consecutive championships between and a feat no other team has duplicated The Original Six era ended with the Stanley Cup Finals between the two time defending champion Canadiens and the Maple Leafs The Maple Leafs finished the era by winning the Cup four times between and their championship is the last Maple Leafs title to date The Chicago Blackhawks who won in are the only other team to win the Stanley Cup during this period br br br Expansion era br br br Expansion years br In Rangers governor William Jennings introduced to his peers the idea of expanding the league to the American West Coast by adding two new teams for the season While the governors did not agree to the proposal the topic of expansion came up every time the owners met from then on out In it was decided to expand by six teams doubling the size of the NHL In February the governors met and decided to award franchises to Los Angeles Minnesota Philadelphia Pittsburgh Oakland and St Louis The league rejected bids from Baltimore Buffalo and Vancouver In Canada there was widespread outrage over the denial of an expansion team to Vancouver in three years later the NHL awarded a franchise to Vancouver which formerly played in the Western Hockey League for the season along with the Buffalo Sabres br On January North Stars rookie Bill Masterton became the first and to date only player to die as a result of injuries suffered during an NHL game Early in a game against Oakland Masterton was checked hard by two players causing him to flip over backwards and land on his head Masterton was rushed to hospital with massive head injuries and died there two days later The National Hockey League Writers Association presented the league with the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy later in the season Following Masterton s death players slowly began wearing helmets and starting in the season the league mandated all players entering the league wear them br In the season third year defenceman Bobby Orr scored goals to set an NHL record for goals by a defenceman en route to winning his first of eight consecutive Norris Trophies as the league s top defenceman At the same time Orr s teammate Phil Esposito became the first player in league history to score points in a season finishing with points A gifted scorer Orr revolutionized defencemen s impact on the offensive part of the game as blue liners began to be judged on how well they created goals in addition to how well they prevented them Orr twice won the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL s leading scorer the only defenceman in NHL history to do so Chronic knee problems plagued Orr throughout his career he played seasons in the NHL before injuries forced his retirement in Orr finished with goals and points in games and he won the Hart Memorial Trophy as league Most Valuable Player thrice br For the NHL season two new teams the Buffalo Sabres and Vancouver Canucks made their debuts and were both put into the East Division The Chicago Black Hawks were moved to the West Division The Montreal Canadiens won the Stanley Cup by beating the Black Hawks in seven games in the finals br The s were associated with aggressive and often violent play Known as the Broad Street Bullies the Philadelphia Flyers are the most famous example of this mindset The Flyers established league records for penalty minutes Dave the Hammer Schultz total of in remains a league record They captured the Stanley Cup becoming the first expansion team to win the league championship br br br WHA competition and merger br br In the NHL faced competition from the newly formed World Hockey Association WHA The WHA lured many players away from the NHL The WHA s biggest coup was to lure Bobby Hull from the Black Hawks to play for the Winnipeg Jets He signed a million contract and lent instant credibility to the new league After Hull signed several other players quickly followed suit and the NHL suddenly found itself in a war for talent By the time the WHA season began players had switched from the NHL to the WHA The NHL also found itself competing with the WHA for markets Initially the league had no intention to expand past teams but the threat the WHA represented caused the league to change its plans The league hastily announced the creation of the New York Islanders and Atlanta Flames as expansion teams Following the season the NHL announced it was further expanding to teams for the season adding the Kansas City Scouts and Washington Capitals In just eight years the NHL had tripled in size to teams br By both leagues were dealing with serious financial problems The St Louis Blues were on the verge of bankruptcy Talk of a merger between the NHL and the WHA was growing In for the first time in four decades the NHL approved franchise relocations the Scouts moved after just two years in Kansas City to Denver to become the Colorado Rockies while the California Golden Seals became the Cleveland Barons Two years later after failed overtures about merging the Barons with Washington and Vancouver the Barons merged with the Minnesota North Stars reducing the NHL to teams for br br The move towards a merger picked up in when John Ziegler succeeded Clarence Campbell as NHL president The WHA folded following the season while the Edmonton Oilers Hartford Whalers Quebec Nordiques and Winnipeg Jets joined the NHL as expansion teams which brought the league up to teams until The merger brought Gordie Howe back to the NHL for one final season in during which he brought his NHL career total to goals and points It was also the last season for the Atlanta Flames The team averaged only fans in attendance and lost over million They were sold for a record million and relocated north to become the Calgary Flames in Two years later the Rockies were sold for million and left Denver to become the New Jersey Devils for the season br br br More dynasties br br Although the league expanded from six to teams dynasties still prevailed in the NHL The Montreal Canadiens won four consecutive Stanley Cups starting in In the New York Islanders won their first of four consecutive Stanley Cups The Islanders dominated both the regular season and the playoffs with the likes of Billy Smith Mike Bossy Denis Potvin and Bryan Trottier In Bossy became the first player to score goals in games since Maurice Richard accomplished that feat in br In the Edmonton Oilers had the best record The Oilers were led by Wayne Gretzky who remained with the Oilers when they joined the NHL in He scored points in and won the first of nine Hart Trophies as the NHL s most valuable player Over the next several seasons Gretzky established new highs in goals scored in a season with in the season in assists with in the and in total points with in Gretzky also set the record for scoring goals in the fewest games achieving the mark in games The Islanders and Oilers met in the Finals as New York swept Edmonton for their last Stanley Cup The following season the Oilers and Islanders met again in the playoffs The Oilers won the rematch in five games marking the start of another dynasty br Led by Gretzky and Mark Messier the Oilers won five Stanley Cup championships between and On August Oilers owner Peter Pocklington in financial trouble traded Gretzky to the Los Angeles Kings Gretzky s trade to the Kings popularized ice hockey in the United States With the Kings Gretzky broke Gordie Howe s record for the most career points Mario Lemieux led Pittsburgh to Stanley Cups in and A gifted forward he won six Art Ross Trophies as the league s leading scorer and he scored points in becoming the second highest single season point scorer behind Gretzky Lemieux s career was plagued by health issues including non Hodgkin lymphoma and he retired in In he returned and finished his NHL career in with more than points br br br Fall of the Iron Curtain br br The NHL became first involved in international play in the mid s starting with the Summit Series in which pitted the top Canadian players of the NHL against the top players in the Soviet Union With the eight game series tied at three wins apiece and a tie Paul Henderson scooped up a rebound and put it past Soviet goaltender Vladislav Tretiak with seconds left in the eighth and final game to score the series winning goal br While European born players were a part of the NHL since its founding it was still rare to see them in the NHL until although the WHA employed a number of them B rje Salming was the first European star in the NHL and Finns Jari Kurri and Esa Tikkanen helped lead the Oilers dynasty of the s The WHA opened the door and players slowly joined the NHL but those behind the Iron Curtain were restricted from following suit In Peter astn his wife and his brother Anton secretly fled Czechoslovakia with the aid of Nordiques owner Marcel Aubut The astn s defection made international headlines and contributed to the first wave of Europeans entrance into the NHL Hoping that they would one day be permitted to play in the NHL teams drafted Soviet players in the s in all by the draft however defection was the only way such players could play in the NHL Shortly before the end of the regular season Flames general manager Cliff Fletcher announced that he had reached an agreement with Soviet authorities that allowed Sergei Pryakhin to play in North America It was the first time a member of the Soviet national team was permitted to leave the Soviet Union Shortly after Soviet players began to flood into the NHL Teams anticipated that there would be an influx of Soviet players in the s as Soviets were selected in the NHL Entry Draft br br br present Modern era br br br Southward expansion br The team era ended in when the league revealed ambitious plans to double league revenues from million within a decade and bring the NHL to franchises during that period The NHL quickly announced three new teams The San Jose Sharks who began play in the season and the Ottawa Senators and Tampa Bay Lightning who followed a year later The Lightning made NHL history when goaltender Manon Rh aume played a period of an exhibition game September In doing so Rh aume became the first woman to play in an NHL game One year later the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and Florida Panthers began play as the NHL s th and th franchises respectively The two new franchises were granted as part of the NHL s attempts at regaining a network television presence by expanding throughout the American south The NHL s southward push continued in as the Minnesota North Stars moved to Dallas Texas to become the Dallas Stars br In the players were locked out by the owners because of a lack of a Collective Bargaining Agreement CBA The NHL lockout lasted days and resulted in the season s being shortened from a planned games to The owners insisted on a salary cap changes to free agency and arbitration in the hopes of limiting escalating salaries the union instead proposed a luxury tax system Just as the entire season seemed to be lost an th hour deal was agreed on The owners failed to achieve a full salary cap but the deal was initially hailed as a win for the owners The deal was not enough to save two teams in Canada s smallest NHL markets The revenue disparity between large and small market teams exacerbated by the falling value of the Canadian Dollar forced the Quebec Nordiques to move to Denver and become the Colorado Avalanche in the Winnipeg Jets relocated to Phoenix Arizona becoming the Coyotes the next year The Hartford Whalers followed moving to Greensboro NC and becoming the Carolina Hurricanes in The NHL continued its expansion into cities in the Southern United States In the Nashville Predators joined the league followed by the Atlanta Thrashers the following year To further market their players the NHL decided to have its players play in the Winter Olympics starting in at the Nagano Games In the league added two franchises boosting the total number to The NHL returned to Minnesota with the Wild and added the Blue Jackets in Columbus Ohio br br br lockout br br By the owners were claiming that player salaries had grown far faster than revenues and that the league as a whole lost over US million in As a result on September Gary Bettman announced that the owners again locked the players out before the start of the season On February Bettman announced the cancellation of the entire season As with the lockout the owners were again demanding a salary cap which the players were unwilling to consider until the season was on the verge of being lost The season s cancellation led to a revolt within the union NHLPA president Trevor Linden and senior director Ted Saskin took charge of negotiations from executive director Bob Goodenow By early July the two sides had agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement The deal featured a hard salary cap linked to a fixed percentage of league revenues and a rollback on salaries br br br st century br br Hoping to reduce the number of tie games during the regular season the NHL decided that beginning in the season in any game tied after regulation time both teams would be guaranteed one point while the team that won in overtime would earn a second point The Edmonton Oilers hosted the NHL s first regular season outdoor hockey game the Heritage Classic on November The game against the Canadiens was held at Commonwealth Stadium before a then record crowd of fans who endured temperatures as low as degrees Celsius degrees Fahrenheit In the season the NHL eliminated tie games as the shootout was introduced to decide all regular season games tied after the five minute overtime period The shootout was one of several rule changes made in as the league attempted to open the game up after the lockout One of the most controversial changes was the league s zero tolerance policy on obstruction penalties The league hoped that the game could be opened up if it cracked down on clutching and grabbing The tighter regulations have met with numerous complaints about the legitimacy of some calls that players are diving to draw penalties and that officials are not calling enough penalties The changes initially led to a sharp increase in scoring Teams combined to score goals per game in more than a full goal per game higher than in the season This represented the highest increase in offence since However scoring has rapidly declined since approaching pre lockout totals in br In the season rookies Alexander Ovechkin and Sidney Crosby began their careers In their first three seasons they each won both the Art Ross and Hart trophies Crosby in and Ovechkin in The success of the Heritage Classic led to the scheduling of more outdoor games The Sabres hosted the NHL Winter Classic on New Year s Day losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in a shootout before a crowd of at Ralph Wilson Stadium The second Winter Classic was held January at Wrigley Field in Chicago between the Blackhawks and Red Wings The third NHL Winter Classic was held in Fenway Park on January between the Boston Bruins and the Philadelphia Flyers The home team Bruins won br Two clubs still experienced financial problems however The Phoenix Coyotes eventually filed for bankruptcy in May The league then took control over the team later that year in order to stabilize the club s operations with the hopes of eventually reselling it to a new owner who would be committed to stay in the Phoenix market The league did not find a satisfactory buyer for the Coyotes until The financially struggling Atlanta Thrashers were eventually sold to True North Sports and Entertainment in who then relocated the team to Winnipeg a stark reversal of the league s Southward expansion more than a decade earlier br The NHL again entered lockout in cancelling the first games about of the season until at least December Just after am on January after approximately continuous hours of negotiating the NHL and the player s union reached a tentative deal on a new collective bargaining agreement to end the lockout The first games of the season were held on January In the league expanded again to Las Vegas Nevada with the Vegas Golden Knights In the league approved another expansion team in Seattle Washington the Seattle Kraken which began play in br On May the NHL declared that regular season which had been suspended after March would be prematurely terminated due to the COVID pandemic the league subsequently announced on July that the season would end with a team playoff tournament to be held behind closed doors in
