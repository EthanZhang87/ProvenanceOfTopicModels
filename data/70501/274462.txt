The New York Americans colloquially known as the Amerks were a professional ice hockey team based in New York City from to They were the third expansion team in the history of the National Hockey League NHL and the second to play in the United States The team never won the Stanley Cup but reached the semifinals twice While it was the first team in New York City it was eclipsed by the second the New York Rangers which arrived in under the ownership of the Amerks landlord Madison Square Garden The team operated as the Brooklyn Americans during the season before suspending operations in due to World War II and long standing financial difficulties The demise of the club marked the beginning of the NHL s Original Six era from to though the Amerks franchise was not formally canceled until br The team s overall regular season record was br br br Franchise history br br br Formation br br In Canadian sports promoter Thomas Duggan received options on three NHL franchises for the United States He sold one to Boston grocery magnate Charles Adams which became the Boston Bruins in Duggan then arranged with Tex Rickard to have a team in Madison Square Garden Rickard agreed but play was delayed until the new Garden was built in In April of that year Duggan and Bill Dwyer New York City s most celebrated prohibition bootlegger were awarded the franchise for New York Somewhat fortuitously given the shortage of players the Hamilton Tigers who had finished first the season before had been suspended from the league after they struck for higher pay However the suspensions were quietly lifted in the off season Soon afterward Dwyer duly bought the collective rights to the Tiger players for He gave the players healthy raises in some cases double their season s salaries Just before the season Dwyer announced the team would be known as the New York Americans Their original jerseys were covered with stars and stripes patterned after the American flag Although he acquired the Tigers players Dwyer did not acquire the franchise as it was expelled from the league As a result the NHL does not consider the Americans to be a continuation of the Tigers or for that matter of the Tigers predecessors the Quebec Bulldogs The Americans entered the league in the season along with the Pittsburgh Pirates The Americans and Pirates became the second and third American based teams in the NHL following Adams Boston Bruins who had begun play the previous season br br br NHL years br br The Americans played their first home game at the Garden losing to the Montreal Canadiens in front of people However success did not come easily for the Americans Despite icing essentially the same team that finished first the previous year they finished fifth overall in their first season with a record of However they were a success at the box office so much so that the following season Garden management landed a team of its own the New York Rangers A clause in the Amerks lease with the Garden required them to support any bid for the Garden to acquire an NHL franchise The Garden had promised Dwyer that it would never exercise that option and that the Amerks would be the only team in the arena However when the Garden opted to seek its own team after all the Amerks had little choice but to agree br The season saw the Americans continue to struggle finishing Part of the problem was that they were placed in the Canadian Division in defiance of all geographic reality resulting in a larger number of train trips to Montreal Toronto and Ottawa Meanwhile the Rangers won the American Division title The next season saw the Americans fall even further by finishing last in their division ninth overall with a record of while the Rangers captured the Stanley Cup in only their second year of existence The Americans were thus doomed to a long history as New York City s second team br The NHL season saw the Amerks sign star goaltender Roy Worters from the Pittsburgh Pirates He led the team to a record in that season good enough for second in the Canadian Division fourth overall Worters had a goals against average GAA becoming the first goaltender to win the Hart Trophy as the most valuable player in the league Standing on Worters shoulders the Americans made the playoffs for the first time but were unable to beat the Rangers in a total goals series The Rangers had extreme difficulty scoring against Worters but the futile Americans were equally unable to score against the Rangers The Rangers ended up winning the series in the second game in overtime br The following season saw the Americans plunge to fifth place in the division ninth overall with a record Worters followed up his stellar season with an atrocious goals against average Worters rebounded the next season with a goals against average That was good enough to give the Americans a winning record However they missed out on a playoff berth since the Montreal Maroons had two more wins which was the NHL s first tiebreaker for playoff seeding br The season saw some developments that changed the way the hockey was played In a game against the Bruins the Americans iced the puck times At that time there was no rule against icing Adams was so angry that he pressed to no avail for the NHL to make a rule against icing so the next time the two teams met the Bruins iced the puck times in a scoreless game It was not until a few years later that the NHL made a rule prohibiting icing but those two games were the catalyst for change br br The Americans lackluster on ice performance was not the only problem for the franchise With the end of Prohibition Dwyer was finding it difficult to make ends meet After the NHL season having missed the playoffs for the fifth straight year the Americans attempted a merger with the equally strapped Senators only to be turned down by the NHL Board of Governors During the season Dwyer decided to sell the team As fortunes had it the Americans made the playoffs for the first time in six years under player coach Red Dutton but bowed out in the second round against the Maple Leafs Even with this rebound no buyers came forward prompting Dwyer to abandon the team The league announced a takeover of the team for the next season Dwyer sued the NHL saying it had no authority to seize his team A settlement was reached whereby Dwyer could resume control provided he could pay off his debts by the end of the season However Dwyer could not do so and the NHL took full control of the franchise Despite the presence of Dutton who had retired as a player to become coach and general manager the team fared no better under the league s operation than before finishing last with a record of The only bright spot was Sweeney Schriner who led the league in scoring that year br The league asked Dutton to become operating head of the franchise for the season The Americans signed veterans Ching Johnson and Hap Day and acquired goalie Earl Robertson These new acquisitions greatly helped the team as they finished the season with a record and made the playoffs In the playoffs they beat the Rangers in three games but lost to the Chicago Black Hawks in three br br The Americans made the playoffs again in and seasons but were bounced in the first round each time Canada entered World War II in September and some of the team s Canadian players left for military service An even larger number of players entered the military in With a decimated roster the Americans missed the playoffs with a record of the worst in franchise history While the league s other teams were similarly hard hit Dutton was still bogged down by lingering debt from the Dwyer era This debt combined with the depletion of talent and wartime travel restrictions forced Dutton to sell off his best players for cash The Amerks were clearly living on borrowed time it was only a matter of when not if they would fold br br br Brooklyn Americans br At wit s end Dutton changed the team s name for the NHL season to the Brooklyn Americans He intended to move the team to Brooklyn but there was no arena in that borough suitable enough even for temporary use As result they continued to play their home games in Manhattan at Madison Square Garden while practicing in Brooklyn They barely survived the season finishing dead last for the second year in a row with a record of After the season the Amerks suspended operations for the war s duration In a group emerged willing to build a new arena in Brooklyn However in the NHL reneged on previous promises to reinstate the Amerks and canceled the franchise Although Dutton had every intention of returning the Amerks to the ice after World War II NHL records list the Amerks as having retired from the league in br br br Legacy br The NHL did not expand beyond its remaining six teams until the season Dutton blamed the owners of Madison Square Garden who also owned the Rangers for pressuring the NHL to not reinstate the Americans Dutton was so bitter that he purportedly swore the Rangers would never win a Stanley Cup again in his lifetime This curse became reality the Rangers did not win another Cup until seven years after his death br The last active New York Americans player was Pat Egan who retired in but played minor ice hockey until with Victoria Cougars of the Western Hockey League Egan returned to ice hockey in playing for the Jacksonville Rockets of the Eastern Hockey League playing only games as player head coach The last active Brooklyn Americans player was Ken Mosdell who retired in br The Americans team was the first team in professional sports history to have their surnames on the back of their uniform sweaters along with numbers br The New York metropolitan area did not have a second NHL team again until the establishment of the New York Islanders in nearby Uniondale on Long Island for the season While the Americans attempted to relocate to Brooklyn in their final years the Islanders did so playing at the Barclays Center from to although unlike the Americans they continued to be known as the New York Islanders br br br Season by season record br Note GP
