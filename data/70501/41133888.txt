The National Hockey League NHL first held a regular season outdoor ice hockey game in and since the league has scheduled at least one per year br The NHL primarily uses three brands for outdoor games the Heritage Classic Winter Classic and Stadium Series The Heritage Classic between the Edmonton Oilers and Montreal Canadiens was the first outdoor regular season game in NHL history The Heritage Classic has since been held infrequently in football stadiums in Canada featuring match ups solely between Canadian teams until the Buffalo Sabres make their appearance in the Heritage Classic The annual Winter Classic held on New Year s Day in football or baseball stadiums near NHL home markets the United States began with the game between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Buffalo Sabres The NHL then started the Stadium Series in for additional outdoor games in the United States The number of Stadium Series games has varied per season four in only one in two in and one per season since Both the Winter Classic and the Stadium series featured match ups solely between American teams until the Toronto Maple Leafs appearances in both the Winter Classic and the Stadium Series br To celebrate the NHL s year anniversary in the league scheduled two special outdoor games the NHL Centennial Classic between Detroit and Toronto on January through season to kick off the year and then the NHL

involved in said honorific matches constitute four of the league s Original Six members Then in due to the COVID pandemic the league held the NHL Outdoors at Lake Tahoe two outdoor games played without spectators br Prior to NHL teams had been involved in at least three outdoor exhibitions Two of these came in the s and were effectively informal scrimmages in the Detroit Red Wings visited Marquette Branch Prison and played a match against the prison inmates in a fenced off open air ice rink while in the Boston Bruins played a game against several local teams in Bay Roberts Newfoundland In neither case was a formal game structure maintained or score kept as the NHL teams hopelessly outmatched the hosts In the Los Angeles Kings and New York Rangers played a pre season game outside Caesars Palace in Las Vegas in the first officially sanctioned outdoor NHL contest br The NHL s outdoor series have proven wildly popular with fans and have led to numerous attendance records The Heritage Classic drew fans a league record that stood until fans in Buffalo set another NHL record in the inaugural Winter Classic in The Winter Classic between Toronto and the Detroit Red Wings drew fans the current NHL record br br br History br The first outdoor game on record to feature an NHL team was attempted on February The Detroit Red Wings played an exhibition game on an outdoor ice surface in F C degree weather against the Marquette Pirates an athletic club composed of inmates at Michigan s Marquette Branch Prison The game and the Pirates club was allegedly organized as a way for Red Wings manager Jack Adams to make good with two convicted mafia members incarcerated at the prison By the end of the first period alone the Red Wings had amassed an score against the prisoners score keeping was abandoned after that point and the rest of the game effectively became an informal scrimmage br Two years after the prison match the Boston Bruins went on a postseason barnstorm of Atlantic Canada in April which included a stop in Bay Roberts Newfoundland On April the Bruins played an exhibition game against teams from the Conception Bay North Hockey League on an outdoor artificial ice surface under similar rules to those of the prison match Four teams each played one period against the Bruins who dominated the game Only one goal was scored on Terry Sawchuk by the local teams br During their time at the Civic Arena the Pittsburgh Penguins could have theoretically hosted an outdoor NHL game due to the arena having a retractable roof The arena was originally built for the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera who only stayed at the arena until However the roof was always closed during hockey games with both the Penguins and their AHL predecessors the Pittsburgh Hornets whom the Penguins replaced upon the NHL expansion The roof was permanently closed after when the Penguins replaced the center scoreboard br The first outdoor game between two NHL teams and the first played to completion was an official pre season match up on September The game took place in the parking lot of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas and featured the Los Angeles Kings and the New York Rangers The process of keeping the ice cool in the desert heat required three times as much coolant as a standard NHL rink There were few problems despite temperatures that reached F C during the day and a game time temperature of F C During the contest grasshoppers began to jump onto the ice where they would freeze or drown in water used to maintain the ice and by the end of the second period the ice was littered with the bugs Nearly fans watched the Kings defeat the Rangers From to the Los Angeles Kings returned to Las Vegas to play an annual indoors preseason game as part of the Frozen Fury series In Las Vegas obtained its own NHL franchise and the fury series was moved to Salt Lake City Utah br The first regular season outdoor game in the history of the NHL took place on November at Edmonton s Commonwealth Stadium when the Edmonton Oilers played the Montreal Canadiens in the Heritage Classic The Oilers had suggested the idea of hosting an outdoor game as early as the mid s but the genesis of the event was the Cold War outdoor game played two years prior between Michigan State University and the University of Michigan br br In NBC Sports Executive VP Jon Miller then pitched the concept an annual outdoor game as a television event to the NHL but they didn t find the concept workable In December Miller found an ally in then league Executive VP Business Media John Collins who embraced the idea This led to the inaugural Winter Classic game on January with the Pittsburgh Penguins visiting the Buffalo Sabres at Ralph Wilson Stadium br On May the NHL announced that the Chicago Blackhawks would host the Pittsburgh Penguins at Soldier Field in Chicago on March as part of a new series of outdoor games called the NHL Stadium Series By the end of May the NHL had scheduled a record six outdoor NHL games for the season one Winter Classic one Heritage Classic and four Stadium Series games br In scheduling outdoor games in the New York metropolitan area that feature the New York Rangers first occurring during two of the four Stadium Series games and subsequently the Winter Classic the team has always been designated as the away team This is to maintain the property tax exempt status of the Rangers home arena Madison Square Garden MSG The tax exemption stipulates that it only applies if the Rangers do not cease playing home games at MSG generally interpreted as playing any home game outside of MSG By designating the Rangers as the away team and Buffalo as the home team in the Winter Classic at Citi Field in New York City it would save MSG from paying more than million in property taxes br Up until NHL s outdoor games were held exclusively in Canada and in the Midwest and Northeast United States That changed in the Stadium Series when the Los Angeles Kings became the first West Coast team to host a regular season outdoor game facing their in city rival Anaheim Ducks at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles on January The San Jose Sharks

Commissioner a game may be subject to temporary stoppages due to unplayable weather conditions The period and game format may then be modified to accommodate those conditions br If there are high

played it can then be declared a completed official game If the score is still tied however the teams will still hold a shootout whether at the same outdoor rink or at a different venue at a later date br The NHL Winter Classic was the first game to use hard whistle stoppages during the third period and overtime and to have the teams defend the same goal during the shootout br The NHL Winter
