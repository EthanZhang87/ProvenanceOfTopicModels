to attract quality on air talent including Paul Romanuk for the morning show and Jim Van Horne and Stephen Brunt for the afternoon drive slot Van Horne and Brunt represented roughly a investment in annual salaries br The Team performed poorly out of the gate garnering just of the male to market share compared to the Fan s share in the mornings and during the afternoon drive show which made it difficult to attach a cost to advertising or attracting advertisers Just one year after launch ratings showed little improvement with a share of the male to demographic Brunt stepped down as co host

question of integrity and ethics of the relay on Primetime Sports the conversation unfolded as follows br Brunt This is a commercial endeavor The torch relay God love it which is going to make people tear up and is a lovely thing and a way of including people in the Olympic process is sponsored And it is corporate and underwritten And spots were sold as part of the sponsorship package This is all part of the machinery of the Olympic Games br br You don t see an ethics problem asked Bob McCown br No Brunt said because nobody is telling me what to say or what to do br The issue quickly subsided
