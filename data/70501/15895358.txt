Calgary KAL gree is the largest city in the Canadian province of Alberta It is the largest metro area within the three Prairie provinces region As of the city proper had a population of and a metropolitan population of making it the third largest city and fifth largest metropolitan area in Canada br Calgary is situated at the confluence of the Bow River and the Elbow River in the southwest of the province in the transitional area between the Rocky Mountain Foothills and the Canadian Prairies about km mi east of the front ranges of the Canadian Rockies roughly km mi south of the provincial capital of Edmonton and approximately km mi north of the Canada United States border The city anchors the south end of the Statistics Canada defined urban area the Calgary Edmonton Corridor br Calgary s economy includes activity in the energy financial services film and television transportation and logistics technology manufacturing aerospace health and wellness retail and tourism sectors The Calgary Metropolitan Region is home to Canada s second largest number of corporate head offices among the country s largest corporations In Calgary had the largest number of millionaires per capita of any major Canadian city In Calgary was ranked alongside Z rich as the third most livable city in the world ranking first in Canada and in North America In it became the first Canadian city to host the Olympic Winter Games br br br Etymology br Calgary was named after Calgary Castle in Scottish Gaelic Caisteal Chalgairidh on the Isle of Mull in Scotland Colonel James Macleod the Commissioner of the North West Mounted Police had been a frequent summer guest there In shortly after returning to Canada he suggested its name for what became Fort Calgary The Scottish Gaelic placename Calgairidh in turn possibly originates from a compound of kald and gart Old Norse words meaning cold and garden If so the placename is likely a relic of Norse settler colonists who occupied the Inner Hebrides in the medieval period A competing etymology cites the Gaelic cala dh g rraidh which means enclosed meadow or pasture harbour or alternatively cala dh ghe rraidh meaning harbour pasture The first of these two possibilities arguably translatable as meadow harbour has some relevance to local geography the town of Calgary such as it is has a large meadow to its east and this meadow leads to Calgary beach br The name of the city serves as a shibboleth as residents correctly pronounce the name with two syllables KAL gree while others mistakenly pronounce it KAL g r ee br The Indigenous peoples of Southern Alberta refer to the Calgary area as elbow in reference to the sharp bend made by the Bow River and the Elbow River In some cases the area was named after the reeds that grew along the riverbanks reeds that had been used to fashion bows In the Blackfoot language Siksik the area is known as Mohk nstsis ak piyoyis meaning elbow many houses reflecting its strong settler presence The shorter form of the Blackfoot name Mohk nstsis simply meaning elbow is the popular Indigenous term for the Calgary area In the Nakoda or Stoney language the area is known as W ch spa Oyade or Wenchi Ispase both meaning elbow In the Cree language the area is known as ot skwanihk meaning at the elbow or ot skwunee meaning elbow In the Tsuut ina language Sarcee the area is known as Guts ists i older orthography Kootsis w meaning elbow In Kutenai language the city is referred to as aknuqtap ik In the Slavey language the area is known as Klincho tinay indihay meaning many horse town referring to the Calgary Stampede and the city s settler heritage br There have been several attempts to revive the Indigenous names of Calgary In response to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada local post secondary institutions adopted official acknowledgements of Indigenous territory using the Blackfoot name of the city Mohk nstsis In the Stoney Nakoda sent an application to the Government of Alberta to rename Calgary as Wichispa Oyade meaning elbow town however this was challenged by the Piikani Blackfoot br br br History br br br Early history br The Calgary area was inhabited by pre Clovis people whose presence traces back at least years The area has been inhabited by multiple First Nations the Niitsitapi Blackfoot Confederacy Siksika Kainai Piikani y rhe Nakoda the Tsuut ina peoples and M tis Nation Region As Mayor Naheed Nenshi said in There have always been people here In Biblical times there were people here For generations beyond number people have come here to this land drawn here by the water They come here to hunt and fish to trade to live to love to have great victories to taste bitter disappointment but above all to engage in that very human act of building community br In David Thompson a year old cartographer with the Hudson s Bay Company HBC spent the winter with a band of Piikani Nation encamped along the Bow River He was also a fur trader and surveyor and the first recorded European to visit the area John Glenn was the first documented European settler in the Calgary area in In spring three priests Lacombe Remus and Scollen built a small log cabin on the banks of the Elbow River br br In the fall of the site became a post of the North West Mounted Police NWMP now the Royal Canadian Mounted Police or RCMP The NWMP detachment was assigned to protect the western plains from US whisky traders and to protect the fur trade and Inspector phrem A Brisebois led fifty Mounties as part of F Troop north from Fort Macleod to establish the site The I G Baker Company of Fort Benton Montana was contracted to construct a suitable fort and after its completion the Baker company built a log store next to the fort The NWMP fort remained officially nameless until construction was complete although it had been referred to as The Mouth by people at Fort Macleod At Christmas dinner NWMP Inspector phrem A Brisebois christened the unnamed Fort Fort Brisebois a decision which caught the ire of his superiors Colonel James Macleod and Major Acheson Irvine Major Irvine cancelled the order by Brisebois and wrote Hewitt Bernard the then Deputy Minister of Justice in Ottawa describing the situation and suggesting the name Calgary put forward by Colonel Macleod Edward Blake at the time Minister of Justice agreed with the name and in the spring of Fort Calgary was officially established br In the First Nations ceded title to the Fort Calgary region through Treaty br In the federal government began to offer leases for cattle ranching in Alberta up to km acres for one cent per acre per year under the Dominion Lands Act which became a catalyst for immigration to the settlement The I G Baker Company drove the first herd of cattle to the region in the same year for the Cochrane area by order of Major James Walker br The Canadian Pacific Railway CPR reached the area in August and constructed a railway station on the CPR owned Section neighbouring the townsite across the Elbow River to the east on Section The difficulty in crossing the river and the CPR s efforts to persuade residents resulted in the core of the Calgary townsite moving onto Section with the fate of the old townsite sealed when the post office was anonymously moved across the icy Elbow River during the night The CPR subdivided Section and began selling lots surrounding the station for corner lots and for all others and pioneer Felix McHugh constructed the first private building on the site Earlier in the decade it was not expected that the railway would pass near Calgary instead the preferred route put forward by people concerned with the young nation s defence was passing near Edmonton and through the Yellowhead Pass However in CPR changed the plans preferring the direct route through the prairies by way of Kicking Horse Pass Along with the CPR August brought Calgary the first edition of the Calgary Herald published on the st under the title The Calgary Herald Mining and Ranche Advocate and General Advertiser by teacher Andrew M Armour and printer Thomas B Braden a weekly newspaper with a subscription price of per year br Over a century later the CPR headquarters moved to Calgary from Montreal in br Residents of the now eight year old settlement sought to form a local government of their own In the first weeks of James Reilly who was building the Royal Hotel east of the Elbow River circulated handbills announcing a public meeting on January at the Methodist Church At the full meeting Reilly advocated for a bridge across the Elbow River and a civic committee to watch over the interests of the public until Calgary could be incorporated The attendees were enthusiastic about the committee and on the next evening a vote was held to elect the seven members A total of candidates were nominated which equalled per cent of Calgary s male population Major James Walker received votes the most amongst the candidates the other six members were Dr Andrew Henderson George Clift King Thomas Swan George Murdoch J D Moulton and Captain John Stewart The civic committee met with Edgar Dewdney Lieutenant Governor of the North West Territories who happened to be in Calgary at the time to discuss an allowance for a school an increase from to grant for a bridge over the Elbow River incorporation as a town and representation for Calgary in the Legislative Council of the North West Territories The committee was successful in getting an additional for the bridge br In May Major Walker acting on instructions from the NWT Lieutenant governor organized a public meeting in the NWMP barracks room on the issue of getting a representative in the NWT Council Walker wrote the clerk of the Council that he was prepared to produce evidence that Calgary and environs an area of square miles held residents the requirement for having a Council member br A by election was held on June where James Davidson Geddes defeated James Kidd Oswald to become the Calgary electoral district representative on the st Council of the North West Territories br As for education Calgary moved quickly the Citizen s Committee raised on February and the first school opened for twelve children days later on February led by teacher John William Costello The private school was not enough for the needs of the town and following a petition by James Walker the Calgary Protestant Public School District No was formed by the Legislature on March br On November Lieutenant Governor Dewdney proclaimed the incorporation of The Town of Calgary Shortly after on December Calgarians went to the polls to elect their first mayor and four councillors The North West Municipal Ordinance of provided voting rights to any male British subject over years of age who owned at minimum of property Each elector was able to cast one vote for the mayor and up to four votes for the councillors plurality block voting George Murdoch won the mayoral race in a landslide victory with votes over E Redpath s while Simon Jackson Hogg Neville James Lindsay Joseph Henry Millward and Simon John Clarke were elected councillors The next morning the Council met for the first time at Beaudoin and Clarke s Saloon br Law and order remained top of mind in the frontier town in early Jack Campbell was appointed as a constable for the community and in early the Town Council passed By law Eleven creating the position of Chief Constable and assigning relevant duties a precursor to the Calgary Police Service The first chief constable John Jack S Ingram who had previously served as the first police chief in Winnipeg was empowered to arrest drunken and disorderly people stop all fast riding in town attend all fires and council meetings Calgary Town Council was eager to employ constables versus contracting the NWMP for town duty as the police force was seen as a money making proposition Constables received half of the fines from liquor cases meaning Chief Constable Ingram could easily pay his per month salary and the expense of a town jail br br br Turmoil in and and the Sandstone City br For the Town of Calgary turned out to be a success However two dark years lay ahead for the fledgling community The turmoil started in late when Councillor Clarke was arrested for threatening a plain clothes Mountie who entered his saloon to conduct a late night search When the officer failed to produce a search warrant Clarke chased him off the premises however the Mountie returned with reinforcements and arrested Clarke Clarke found himself before Stipendiary Magistrate Jeremiah Travis a proponent of the temperance movement who was appalled by the open traffic of liquor gambling and prostitution in Calgary despite prohibition in the North West Territories Travis view was accurate as the Royal Commission of Liquor Traffic of found liquor was sold openly both day and night during prohibition Travis associated Clarke with the troubles he saw in Calgary and found him guilty and sentenced Clarke to six months with hard labour Murdoch and the other members of Council were shocked and a public meeting was held at Boynton s Hall in which a decision was made to send a delegation to Ottawa to seek an overruling of Travis judgement by the Department of Justice The community quickly raised and Murdoch and a group of residents headed east The punishment of Clarke did not escape Hugh Cayley the editor of the Calgary Herald and Clerk of the District Court Cayley published articles critical of Travis and his judgment in which Travis responded by calling Cayley to court dismissing him from his position as Clerk ordering Cayley to apologize and pay a fine Cayley refused to pay the fine which Travis increased to and on January the day after the January Calgary town election Cayley was imprisoned by Travis br Murdoch returned to Calgary on December only a week before the election to find the town in disarray Shortly before the election G E Marsh brought a charge of corruption against Murdoch and council over irregularities in the voters list Travis found Murdoch and the councillors guilty disqualifying them from running in the election barring them from municipal office for two years and fining Murdoch and the councillors This was despite the fact Murdoch was visiting Eastern Canada while the alleged tampering was occurring Travis disqualification did not dissuade Calgary voters and Murdoch defeated his opponent James Reilly by a significant margin in early January to be re elected as mayor Travis accepted a petition from Reilly to unseat Murdoch and two of the elected councillors and declare Reilly the mayor of Calgary Both Murdoch and Reilly claimed to be the lawful mayor of the growingly disorganized Town of Calgary both holding council meetings and attempting to govern Word of the issues in Calgary reached the Minister of Justice John Sparrow David Thompson in Ottawa who ordered Justice Thomas Wardlaw Taylor of Winnipeg to conduct an inquiry into the Case of Jeremiah Travis The federal government acted before receiving Taylor s report Jeremiah Travis was suspended and the government waited for his official tenure to expire after which he was pensioned off Justice Taylor s report which was released in June found Travis had exceeded his authority and erred in his judgements br The Territorial Council called for a new municipal election to be held in Calgary on November George Clift King defeated his opponent John Lineham for the office of Mayor of Calgary br br Calgary had only a couple days peace following the November election before the Calgary Fire of destroyed much of the community s downtown Part of the slow response to the fire can be attributed to the absence of functioning local government during As neither George Murdoch or James Reilly was capable of effectively governing the town the newly ordered chemical engine for the recently organized Calgary Fire Department Calgary Hook Ladder and Bucket Corps was held in the CPR s storage yard due to lack of payment Members of the Calgary Fire Department broke into the CPR storage yard on the day of the fire to retrieve the engine In total fourteen buildings were destroyed with losses estimated at although no one was killed or injured br The new Town Council sprung into action drafting a bylaw requiring all large downtown buildings to be built with sandstone which was readily available nearby in the form of Paskapoo sandstone Following the fire several quarries were opened around the city by prominent local businessmen including Thomas Edworthy Wesley Fletcher Orr J G McCallum and William Oliver Prominent buildings built with sandstone following the fire include Knox Presbyterian Church Imperial Bank Building Calgary City Hall and Calgary Courthouse No br In February Donald Watson Davis who was running the I G Baker store in Calgary was elected MP for Alberta Provisional District A former whisky trader in southern Alberta he had turned his hand to building Fort Macleod and Fort Calgary The main other contender for the job Frank Oliver was a prominent Edmontonian so Davis s success was a sign that Calgary was surpassing Edmonton previously the main centre on the western Prairies br br br to br Calgary continued to expand when real estate speculation took hold of Calgary in Speculators began buying and building west of Centre Street and Calgary quickly began to sprawl west to the ire of property owners on the east side of town Property owners on both sides of Centre Street sought to bring development to their side of Calgary lost successfully by eastsider James Walker who convinced the Town Council to purchase land on the east side to build a stockyard guaranteeing meat packing and processing plants would be constructed on the east side By Calgary had reached present day Seventeenth Avenue east to the Elbow River and west to Eighth Street and the first federal census listed the boom town at inhabitants The economic conditions in Calgary began to deteriorate in as development in the downtown slowed the streetcar system started in was put on hold and smaller property owners began to sell br The first step in connecting the District of Alberta happened in Calgary on July as Minister of the Interior Edgar Dewdney turned the first sod for the Calgary and Edmonton Railway in front of two thousand residents The railway was completed in August Although its end of steel was on the south side of the river opposite Edmonton it immensely shortened travel time between the two communities Previously stagecoach passengers and mail could arrive in five days and animal pulled freight anywhere between two and three weeks the train was able to make the trip in only a few hours br Smallpox arrived in Calgary in June when a Chinese resident was found with the disease and by August nine people had contracted the disease with three deaths Calgarians placed the blame for the disease on the local Chinese population resulting in a riot on August Residents descended on the Town s Chinese owned laundries smashing windows and attempting to burn the structures to the ground The local police did not attempt to intervene Mayor Alexander Lucas had inexplicably left town during the riot and when he returned home he called the NWMP in to patrol Calgary for three weeks to prevent further riots br Finally on January Calgary was granted a charter by the nd North West Legislative Assembly officially titled Ordinance of the City of Calgary Charter elevated the frontier town to the status of a full fledged city Calgary became the first city in the North West Territories receiving its charter a decade before Edmonton and Regina The Calgary charter remained in force until it was repealed with the Cities Act in The charter came into effect in such a way as to prevent the regularly scheduled municipal election in December and recognizing the importance of the moment the entire Town Council resigned to ensure the new city could choose the first Calgary City Council Calgary s first municipal election as a city saw Wesley Fletcher Orr garner votes narrowly defeating his opponent William Henry Cushing s votes and Orr was named the first mayor of the City of Calgary br By late th century the Hudson s Bay Company HBC expanded into the interior and established posts along rivers that later developed into the modern cities of Winnipeg Calgary and Edmonton In the HBC established a sales shop in Calgary HBC also built the first of the grand original six department stores in Calgary in others that followed were Edmonton Vancouver Victoria Saskatoon and Winnipeg br In October the Village of Rouleauville was incorporated by French Catholic residents south of Calgary s city limits in what is now known as Mission The town did not remain independent for long and became the first incorporated municipality to be amalgamated into Calgary eight years later in br br br Turn of the th century br The turn of the century brought questions of provincehood the top of mind in Calgary On September Alberta was proclaimed a province with a provisional capital in Edmonton it would be left up to the Legislature to choose the permanent location One of the first decisions of the new Alberta Legislature was the capital and although William Henry Cushing advocated strongly for Calgary the resulting vote saw Edmonton win the capital Calgarians were disappointed on the city not being named the capital and focused their attention on the formation of the provincial university However the efforts by the community could not sway the government and the University of Alberta was founded in the City of Strathcona Premier Rutherford s home which was subsequently amalgamated into the City of Edmonton in Calgary was not to be left without higher education facilities as the provincial Normal School opened in the McDougall School building in In R B Bennett introduced a bill in the Alberta Legislature to incorporate the Calgary University however there was significant opposition to two degree granting institutions in such a small province A commission was appointed to evaluate the Calgary proposal which found the second university to be unnecessary however the commission did recommend the formation of the Provincial Institute of Technology and Art in Calgary SAIT which was formed later in br br Built up areas of Calgary between and were serviced by power and water the city continued a program of paving and sidewalk laying and with the CPR constructed a series of subways under the tracks to connect the town with streetcars The first three motor buses hit Calgary streets in and two years later the municipally owned street railway system fit with seven miles of track opened in Calgary The immediately popular street railway system reached passengers per month by The privately owned MacArthur Bridge precursor to the Centre Street Bridge over the Bow River opened in which provided for residential expansion north of the Bow River The early s saw real estate speculation hit Calgary once again with property prices rising significantly with growing municipal investment CPR s decision to construct a car shop at Ogden set to employ over people the projected arrival of the Grand Trunk Pacific and Canadian Northern Railways in the city and Calgary s growing reputation as a growing economic hub The period between and was the largest population growth period in the city s history expanding from to inhabitants in the five year period Several ambitious projects were started during this period including a new City Hall the Hudson s Bay Department Store the Grain Exchange Building and the Palliser Hotel this period also corresponded to the end of the Sandstone City era as steel frames and terracotta facades such as the Burns Building which were prevalent in other North American cities overtook the unique sandstone character of Calgary br br br Stampede City br br The growing City and enthusiastic residents were rewarded in with the federally funded Dominion Exhibition Seeking to take advantage of the opportunity to promote itself the city spent CA to build six new pavilions and a racetrack It held a lavish parade as well as rodeo horse racing and trick roping competitions as part of the event The exhibition was a success drawing people to the fairgrounds over seven days despite an economic recession that afflicted the city of Calgary had previously held a number of Agricultural exhibitions dating back to and recognizing the city s enthusiasm Guy Weadick an American trick roper who participated in the Dominion Exhibition as part of the Miller Brothers Ranch Real Wild West Show returned to Calgary in to host the first Calgary Stampede in the hopes of establishing an event that more accurately represented the wild west than the shows he was a part of He initially failed to sell civic leaders and the Calgary Industrial Exhibition on his plans but with the assistance of local livestock agent H C McMullen Weadick convinced businessmen Pat Burns George Lane A J McLean and A E Cross to put up to guarantee funding for the event The Big Four as they came to be known viewed the project as a final celebration of their life as cattlemen The city constructed a rodeo arena on the fairgrounds and over people attended the six day event in September to watch hundreds of cowboys from Western Canada the United States and Mexico compete for in prizes The event generated in revenue and was hailed as a success The Calgary Stampede has continued as a civic tradition for over years marketing itself as the greatest outdoor show on earth with Calgarians sporting western wear for days while attending the annual parade daily pancake breakfasts br br br Early oil and gas br While agriculture and railway activities were the dominant aspects of Calgary s early economy the Turner Valley Discovery Well blew South West of Calgary on May marked the beginning of the oil and gas age in Calgary Archibald Wayne Dingman and Calgary Petroleum Product s discovery was heralded as the biggest oil field in the British Empire at around million cubic metres and in a three week period an estimated oil companies sprang into existence Calgarians were enthusiastic to invest in new oil companies with many losing life savings during the short boom in hastily formed companies Outbreak of the First World War further dampened the oil craze as more men and resources left for Europe and agricultural prices for wheat and cattle increased Turner Valley s oil fields would boom again in and and by the Second World War the Turner Valley oilfield was producing more than per cent of the oil in Canada however the city would wait until for Leduc No to definitively shift Calgary to an oil and gas city While Edmonton would see significant population and economic growth with the Leduc discovery many corporate offices established in Calgary after Turner Valley refused to relocate north Consequently by Calgary had more millionaires than any other city in Canada and per capita more cars than any city in the world br br br Early politics s to s br Early th century Calgary served as a hotbed for political activity Historically Calgarians supported the provincial and federal conservative parties the opposite of the Liberal friendly City of Edmonton However Calgarians were sympathetic to the cause of workers and supported the development of labour organizations In the United Farmers of Alberta UFA formed in Edmonton through the merger of two earlier farm organizations as a non partisan lobbying organization to represent the interests of farmers The UFA eventually dropped its non partisan stance when it contested the provincial election It was elected to form the province s first non Liberal government By that time Calgary was using single transferable vote STV a form of proportional representation to elect its city councillors Calgary was the first city in Canada to adopt PR for its city elections Councillors were elected in one at large district Each voter cast just a single vote using a ranked transferable ballot The UFA government elected in changed the provincial election law so that Calgary could elect its MLAs through PR as well Calgary elected its MLAs through PR until and its councillors through PR until although mostly using instant runoff voting not STV in the s br Calgary endured a six year recession following the First World War The high unemployment rate from reduced manufacturing demand compounded with servicemen returning from Europe needing work created economic and social unrest By over men representing percent of the male workforce were officially unemployed Labour organizations began endorsing candidates for Calgary City Council in the late s and were quickly successful in electing sympathetic candidates to office including Mayor Samuel Hunter Adams in As well the Industrial Workers of the World and its sequel the One Big Union found much support among Calgary workers br The city s support of labour and agricultural groups made it a natural location for the founding meeting of the Co operative Commonwealth Federation precursor to the New Democratic Party The organizational meeting was held in Calgary on July with attendance exceeding people Pat Lenihan was elected to the Calgary City Council in in part due to the use of Proportional Representation in city elections He is the only Communist Party member elected to Calgary council He is the subject of the book Patrick Lenihan from Irish Rebel to Founder of Canadian Public Sector Unionism edited by Gilbert Levine Athabasca University Press br In Civic Government Association formed in opposition to the power of labour groups endorsing its own competing slate of candidates

Calgary Magazine exclaimed Welcome to Calgary Calgary almost specializes in newcomers br High rise buildings were erected during the economic boom and more office space opened in Calgary in than in New York City and Chicago combined The end of the oil boom is associated with the National Energy Program implemented by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau s government and the drop in world oil prices and the end of the construction boom in Calgary is associated with the completion of the Petro Canada Centre in The two tower granite Petro Canada Centre which some locals called Red Square alluding to the city s hostile view of the state owned petroleum company saw the larger storey west tower rise to m ft and become the largest building in Calgary for years and a smaller storey east tower rise m

secured CA million in funding from the federal and provincial governments while civic leaders including Mayor Ralph Klein crisscrossed the world attempting to woo International Olympic Committee IOC delegates Calgary was one of three finalists opposed by the Swedish community of Falun and Italian community of Cortina d Ampezzo On September the International Olympic Committee voted to give Calgary the right to host the Olympic Winter Games becoming the first Canadian host for the winter games br The Games five primary venues were all purpose built however at significant cost The Olympic Saddledome was the primary venue for ice hockey and figure skating Located at Stampede Park the facility was expected to cost million but cost overruns pushed the facility to nearly million The Olympic Oval was built on the campus of the University of Calgary It was the first fully enclosed metre speed skating venue in the world as it was necessary to protect against the possibility of either bitter cold temperatures or ice melting chinook winds Seven world and three Olympic records were broken during the Games resulting in the facility earning praise as the fastest ice on Earth Canada Olympic Park was built on the western outskirts of Calgary and hosted bobsled luge ski jumping and freestyle skiing It was the most expensive facility built for the games costing million br Despite Canada failing to earn a gold medal in the Games the events proved to be a major economic boom for the city which had fallen into its worst recession in years following the collapse of both
