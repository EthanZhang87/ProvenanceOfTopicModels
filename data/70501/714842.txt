title: Relocation of professional sports teams
id: 714842
Relocation of professional sports teams occurs when a team owner moves a team generally from one metropolitan area to another but occasionally between municipalities in the same conurbation The practice is most common in North America where a league franchise system is used and the teams are overwhelmingly privately owned Owners who move a team generally do so seeking better profits facilities fan support or a combination of these br br br North America br br Unlike most professional sport systems worldwide North America does not have comprehensive governing bodies whose authority extends from the amateur to the highest levels of a given sport North American sports generally do not operate a system of promotion and relegation in which poorly performing teams are replaced with teams that do well in lower level leagues br A city wishing to get a team in a major professional sports league can wait for the league to expand and award new franchises However such expansions are infrequent and generally limited to a narrow window in time Many current owners believe is the optimal size for a major league due to playoff structure and ease of scheduling As of each of the major leagues has or franchises The National Hockey League NHL has expanded to teams with the Vegas Golden Knights having become the league s st team in and the Seattle Kraken becoming the nd team in br In past decades aspiring owners whose overtures had been rejected by the established leagues would respond by forming a rival league in hopes that the existing major league would eventually agree to a merger the new league would attain major league status in its own right or the established league was compelled to expand The s American Football League AFL is perhaps the most recent example of a successful rival league having achieved each of the three goals listed above in reverse order However all major sports have had a rival league achieve at least some of these goals in the last half of the th century Baseball s proposed Continental League did not play a game but only because Major League Baseball MLB responded to the proposal by adding teams in some of the new league s proposed cities The American Basketball Association ABA and World Hockey Association WHA each succeeded in getting some of their franchises accepted into the established leagues which had both unsuccessfully attempted to cause their upstart rivals to fold outright by adding more teams br However the upstart leagues owed their success in large part to the reluctance of owners in the established leagues to devote the majority of their revenues to player salaries and also to sports leagues former reliance primarily on gate receipts for revenue Under those conditions an ambitious rival could often afford to lure away the sport s top players with promises of better pay in hopes of giving the new league immediate respect and credibility from fans Today however established leagues derive a large portion of their revenue from lucrative television contracts that would not be offered to an untested rival Also the activism of players unions has resulted in the established leagues paying a majority of their revenues to players thus the average salary in each of the big four leagues is now well in excess of million per season br Under present market and financial conditions any serious attempt to form a rival league in the early st century would likely require hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars in investment and initial losses and even if such resources were made available the upstart league s success would be far from guaranteed as evidenced by the failure of the WWF NBC backed XFL in and the UFL from to The current major leagues have established lucrative relationships with all of the major media outlets in the United States who subsidize the league s operations because their established fame ensures strong ratings the networks are far less willing to provide such coverage to an unproven upstart league often requiring the upstart league to pay the network for those leagues to be covered br Therefore as long as leagues choose not to expand and or reject a city s application the only realistic recourse is to convince the owner s of an existing team to move it or convince a prospective owner to purchase a team with the intent of moving it Owners usually move teams because of weak fan support or because the team organization is in debt and needs an adequate population for financial support or because another city offers a bigger local market or a more financially lucrative stadium arena deal Governments may offer lucrative deals to team owners to attract or retain a team For example to attract the NFL s Cleveland Browns in the state of Maryland agreed to build a new stadium in Baltimore and allow the team to use it rent free and keep all parking advertising and concession revenue This move proved so unpopular in Cleveland that the move was treated as the Baltimore Ravens being awarded an expansion franchise and the Browns name and their official lineage would remain in Cleveland for a reactivated team that rejoined the NFL three years later A little more than a decade earlier the Baltimore Colts left for Indianapolis NFL owners voted to give Colts owner Robert Irsay permission to move his franchise to the city of his choosing after no satisfactory stadium would be built br Moving sports teams is often controversial Opponents criticize owners for leaving behind faithful fans and governments for spending millions of dollars of tax money on attracting teams However since sports teams in the United States are generally treated like any other business under antitrust law there is little sports leagues can do to prevent teams from flocking to the highest bidders for instance the Los Angeles Rams filed suit when the other NFL owners initially blocked their move to St Louis which caused the NFL to back down and allow the move to proceed Major League Baseball unique among the major professional sports leagues has an exemption from antitrust laws won by a Supreme Court decision but nonetheless has allowed several teams to change cities Also recently courts denied the attempted move of the team then known as the Phoenix Coyotes by siding with the NHL which claimed that it had final authority over franchise moves br Newer sports leagues tend to have more transient franchises than more established major leagues but in the mid s several NFL and NHL teams moved to other cities and the threat of a move pushed cities with major league teams in any sport to build new stadiums and arenas using taxpayer money The trend continued in the s when three National Basketball Association NBA teams moved in a seven year span after there were no moves at all in the years before it Critics referred to the movement of teams to the highest bidding city as franchise free agency br br br Australia and New Zealand br br The two major professional sporting leagues in Australia are the Australian Football League AFL and National Rugby League NRL Both competitions were originally based in one city Melbourne and Sydney respectively and expanded to a national level and through that process there have been team moves mergers and closures in both leagues The clubs are owned by members not privately but the North American franchise model exists which means entry to the league is restricted The hybrid model has meant that the leading promoter of moving is the league itself trying to grow the football code by encouraging poorly performing clubs to move interstate br br br Europe br br In Europe moves are very rare because of the different relationship between clubs and their league in the European system of professional sports league organization The practice is considered anathema In most European sports teams can be relegated from their current league to a lower one or promoted to the one above br br br Latin America and the Caribbean br Team moves in Latin America occur very rarely for the established teams with established bases Smaller teams either small team from large agglomerations or provincial teams with little or no fan base frequently move in search of a larger market and or more affordable facilities as frequently there are only large complexes available with a necessity to groundshare with a larger club The practice is considered anathema br br br Brazil br The first move of a first division football team was in Gr mio Barueri
