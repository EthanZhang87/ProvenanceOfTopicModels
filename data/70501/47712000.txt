ultimately finished second in both the division and league despite being tied in points with the Colorado Avalanche the Avalanche had five more regulation wins than Vegas In first round of the playoffs Vegas was forced to a game seven for the third consecutive year after leading but defeated the Minnesota Wild thanks in part to a hat trick from trade deadline acquisition Mattias Janmark br

acquired star center Jack Eichel from the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for Alex Tuch Peyton Krebs and two draft picks During the course of the season the Golden Knights suffered a rash of injuries across the roster with a total of man games lost owing to this Ben Hutton Michael Amadio Adam Brooks and Derrick Pouliot were signed or claimed off waivers for depth while rookies such as Jake Leschyshyn Jonas Rondbjerg and Logan Thompson received significant playing time The trade deadline also witnessed a voided trade as an attempt to send Dadonov to the Anaheim Ducks fell through due to

December and January including a slump in the eight games prior to the All Star break The Golden Knights recovered after the break however despite a variety of injuries sidelining Thompson Hill and a returning Brossoit for varying periods the Golden Knights went on a tear through the final three months of the season finishing out In addition the team acquired forwards Ivan Barbashev and Teddy Blueger at the trade deadline for scoring depth as well as longtime Los Angeles Kings goaltender Jonathan Quick to address the multitude of goaltender injuries During this period the Golden Knights also became the first team to win four consecutive games with four different starting goaltenders as rookie Jiri Patera became the fifth goaltender to start for Vegas during the season After clinching a playoff berth on March Vegas defeated the Seattle Kraken in their final regular season game on April narrowly beating out the Edmonton Oilers for both the Pacific Division championship and first

the Stanley Cup Finals Vegas won the Finals in five games including a dominant victory in game to win their first Stanley Cup championship as well as Las Vegas first championship in any of the big North American sports leagues Jonathan Marchessault who led the team in playoff goals would win the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player during the playoffs Additionally the Golden Knights fulfilled the prediction of owner Bill Foley who had previously stated the franchise s goals were playoffs in three cup in six with the season being the franchise s sixth The Knights became the youngest team to win the Stanley Cup since the NHL s first major expansion in beating the previous record set by the Philadelphia Flyers who won the Cup in their seventh season br The Golden Knights

the season at the top of the Pacific Division going over their first twelve games with no regulation losses in October their seven game season opening win streak set the record for the longest season opening winning streak of any defending champion surpassing the record of five previously set by the Edmonton Oilers and Ottawa Senators br The team again faltered in the months afterward though with another rash of injuries between November and February resulting in the NHL debuts of Lukas Cormier Mason Morelli and first round pick Brendan Brisson January also saw the Golden Knights compete in the NHL Winter Classic on New Year s Day facing off against Seattle at T Mobile Park in their second outdoor game Vegas ultimately lost becoming the first team to be shut out in the Winter Classic

name Golden Knights br br br Mascot br br The Golden Knights mascot is a Gila monster named Chance He was unveiled at the team s second home game on October The team opted against using a knight for a
