The Eastern Conference French Conf rence de l Est is one of two conferences in the National Hockey League NHL used to divide teams Its counterpart is the Western Conference br br br History br Originally named the Prince of Wales Conference it was created in when the NHL realigned its teams into two conferences and four divisions Because the new conferences and divisions had little to do with North American geography geographical references were removed br The Prince of Wales Trophy dates back to when it was donated to the League by the Prince of Wales who later became King Edward VIII and then the Duke of Windsor It was originally given to the NHL s playoff champion Until the Stanley Cup was presented to the winner of a post season playoff between the NHL and Western Hockey League champions Since the Stanley Cup has gone to the NHL s playoff champion During the years when the NHL had no divisions i e to the Prince of Wales Trophy was presented to the League s regular season champion analogous to today s Presidents Trophy From to the Trophy went to the American Division regular season champion from to it was presented to the East Division regular season champion and from to it was presented to the Wales Conference regular season champion br The conferences and divisions were re aligned for the to better reflect the geographical locations of the teams but the existing names were retained with the Wales Conference becoming the conference primarily for the NHL s eastern teams The names of conferences and divisions were changed for the season to reflect their geographic locations Then new NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman made the change to help non hockey fans better understand the game as the National Basketball Association NBA National Football League NFL and Major League Baseball MLB all use geographic based names for their divisions However the trophy awarded to the conference champion the Prince of Wales Trophy retains some connection to the heritage of the League In following the NHL lockout Bettman changed the Eastern Conference logo along with the Western Conference and NHL logos to its current format br Along with the Western Conference the Eastern Conference was temporarily abolished for the NHL season after the COVID pandemic in North America forced a realignment of the League to preclude the need for teams to regularly cross the Canada United States border For the three Canadian teams competed in the newly formed North Division while six Metropolitan Division teams and two American teams from the Atlantic Division formed a re constituted East Division The five remaining American teams from the Eastern Conference teams joined the Central Division These changes have been reversed for the season br br br Divisions br The Wales Conference originally consisted of the Adams Division and the Norris Division The realignment moved the Norris Division to the Clarence Campbell Conference and added that Conference s Patrick Division instead When the names of conferences and divisions were changed in the Eastern Conference s divisions became the Atlantic and Northeast Realignment in added a third division the Southeast Another realignment in reorganized the Eastern Conference into two eight team divisions the Atlantic Division name retained but was reassigned to what had been the Northeast Division while the old Atlantic Division was renamed the Metropolitan Division the Southeast Division was dissolved With this realignment all teams in the Eastern Time Zone are situated within the Eastern Conference br br br Champions and playoffs br br The NHL s playoff system has changed over the years Prior to the NHL had a unique playoff system relative to the NFL NBA and MLB Playoff teams were seeded regardless of conference affiliation As a result two teams from the same conference could meet in the Stanley Cup Finals as happened in and Under this system the Wales Conference champion and therefore the winner of the Prince of Wales Trophy was the team that finished with the best regular season record in the conference br Ever since the introduction of the Conference finals in the Prince of Wales Trophy has been presented to the Wales Eastern Conference playoff champions br In the playoff system introduced in the top four teams in each division made the playoffs The first round winners met in the Division finals and the division final winners met in the conference finals In this format the division standings tended to be somewhat static though not quite as static as in the Campbell Conference In the Adams Division the Boston Bruins and Montreal Canadiens never missed the playoffs in this format while the Buffalo Sabres only missed twice In the Patrick Division the Washington Capitals only missed the playoffs once the New York Rangers twice the New York Islanders three times and the Philadelphia Flyers four In both cases this usually left the other two teams to contend for the final playoff spot This format also raised the possibility of the strongest teams in the regular season being forced to meet in the first or second round rather than the conference finals br From to the top eight teams in each conference made the playoffs with the division winners being guaranteed the top seeds top two from to and top three from to and home ice in the first round regardless of record br A new playoff format was introduced as part of the realignment Under the new post season system that was first used during the Stanley Cup playoffs the top three teams in each division make the playoffs with two open wild cards spots in each conference for a total of eight playoff teams from each conference br br br
