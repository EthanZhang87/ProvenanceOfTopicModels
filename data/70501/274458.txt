Yellow Jackets of the United States Amateur Hockey Association The Yellow Jackets under manager Roy Schooley and coach Dick Carroll won back to back USAHA championships in the league s last two seasons and The players on this team formed the core of a newly professional Pittsburgh club that was granted a franchise by the National Hockey League on November Pittsburgh s admission to the NHL came after Eddie Livingstone the former owner of the Toronto Shamrocks and the Toronto Blueshirts of the National Hockey Association saw Pittsburgh as a possible member for a proposed rival league to the NHL Pittsburgh had in the s been the first metropolitan area to professionalize the game of ice hockey In order to thwart the new league the President of the NHL Frank Calder negotiated to put a franchise in Pittsburgh which became the seventh team to join the NHL as well as the league s third US based team The team took the name Pittsburgh Pirates after receiving permission from Barney Dreyfuss the owner of the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team br The Pirates were assigned to what would later be called the NHL s American Division with the Boston Bruins and the New York Americans These two franchises were the only other American teams in the NHL at the time Duquesne Garden located in the city s Oakland neighborhood served as the team s home arena Duquesne Garden president Henry Townsend was the club s president and owner The Pirates dubbed the Mighty Steel City Sextet in the Pittsburgh Press were mostly leftovers from the former Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets Ten former Yellow Jacket players would play for the Pirates br br br The inaugural season br The Pirates began play during the NHL season On November Thanksgiving night the Pirates defeated the Boston Bruins on the road in their very first NHL game which was held at Boston Arena Defenseman and captain Lionel Conacher scored Pittsburgh s first ever NHL goal Conacher beat Boston goaltender Charles Stewart at the mark of the second period to tie the game at Pirates left winger Harold Darragh notched Pittsburgh s first game winning goal into the third period while Pittsburgh goaltender Roy Worters stopped of shots to record the first NHL win in franchise and city history br Two nights later on November the Pirates stunned the Montreal Canadiens defeating them The loss to the Pirates marked the final game for legendary Canadiens goaltender Georges Vezina Vezina started the game with severe chest pains and left the game during the first intermission with a high fever He died four months later from tuberculosis Meanwhile the first NHL game ever played in Pittsburgh was on December in which fans paid each to see the p m faceoff at Duquesne Garden The Pirates lost to the New York Americans in overtime Conacher scored the lone goal for Pittsburgh at of the second period br In games the Pirates posted an impressive record for third best in the league With a winning percentage that first season would arguably be the team s best During the playoffs the Pirates faced the Montreal Maroons in a two game series to be decided on total goals scored The Pirates lost the series six goals to four after a defeat at Duquesne Garden and a tie at Montreal The Maroons would go on to win the Stanley Cup Finals br br br br In the next season the Pirates missed the playoffs after finishing in fourth place Their third season saw the team post a record and earn a playoff spot This playoff series would be based on a two game total goal series format In the playoffs the Pirates were defeated by the New York Rangers The Pirates lost in game and won game but could not overcome New York s lead in goals This marked the second time the team lost in the first round to the eventual Stanley Cup winner It would also turn out to be the last playoff game in the Pirates history br br br Decline br In October brothers Horace and Edward Townsend who had inherited ownership of the club from their late father Henry Townsend sold the team The ostensible purchaser was fight promoter and ex lightweight boxing champion Benny Leonard although the money for the purchase is suspected to have come from early Prohibition gangster and bootlegger Bill Dwyer owner of the New York Americans who may have hid his involvement with the Pittsburgh club to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest The sale of the team did not lead to an improvement on the ice for the Pirates The team s coach Odie Cleghorn left the team at the end of the season to become a referee Frank Fredrickson was then named the team s coach The team s uniforms also changed as the Pirates color scheme became blue and gold in and then orange and black in br The season was their fifth season in the NHL and their last in Pittsburgh The season saw the Pirates achieve their worst win loss record with record With the Wall Street Crash of followed by the Great Depression the owners found themselves in financial difficulties Attendance for games was down and the owners tried selling off their star players in order to make ends meet The team was in debt by the end of their final season It also needed replacement for the Duquesne Garden It had been built in and had once been one of the finest arenas in the country However it had not aged well and by was well behind the times With only permanent seats and standing room for it was by far the smallest arena in the NHL making it difficult for the Pirates to break even br br br Relocation br On October at the NHL Board of Governors meeting Leonard moved the team across Pennsylvania to Philadelphia and renamed them the Philadelphia Quakers However Leonard s intention was to return the team to Pittsburgh as soon as a new arena was built Thirteen players from the Pirates were transferred to the Quakers after the Pittsburgh franchise relocated These players were Cliff Barton Harold Darragh Herb Drury Gord Frasier Jim Jarvis Gerry Lowrey Rennison Manners Johnny McKinnon Hib Milks Joe Miller Rodger Smith and Tex White Frank Fredrickson was also transferred to the Quakers but he was released by Philadelphia two days later The Quakers posted a poor record in the season The team then received permission from the NHL on September to temporally cease operations as they sought a new permanent arena located in either Pittsburgh or Philadelphia br Meanwhile the poor economy was taking a toll on the entire league The Great Depression devastated the NHL as four teams were forced to fold leaving behind just six teams When a new Pittsburgh arena failed to materialize Leonard surrendered his franchise in As it turned out a new arena in Pittsburgh would not be built until the Pittsburgh Civic Arena opened in The NHL would play with six teams for years before deciding to expand The expansion in brought the Pittsburgh Penguins to the NHL and the city of Pittsburgh and the orange and black uniformed Philadelphia Flyers to Philadelphia br The last remaining active member of the Pittsburgh Pirates was Cliff Barton who played his final NHL game in the season where he won the Stanley Cup as a member of the New York Rangers br br br Historic firsts br The Pittsburgh Pirates have left their mark in the NHL record books and NHL history with many firsts and other notable achievements br br Odie Cleghorn the Pirates coach and occasional player for the first four seasons was the first NHL coach to change his players on the fly This article from the December Pittsburgh Press describes how Cleghorn would change the forward line halfway through each period with another set of attackers who would play for six or eight minutes The first line would then come back on to finish the period The defencemen were not changed br Cleghorn was also the first coach to use three set forward lines which was a huge change from the standard which was to simply leave the best players out for as long as possible br The Pirates set an NHL record in salaries by signing defenceman Lionel Conacher to a three year deal worth a year Conacher was later named Canada s athlete of the half century br On December the Pirates and the New York Americans combined for what still stands as the NHL record for most shots in one game The two teams combined for shots in a New York win Roy Worters made saves for the Pirates and Jake Forbes made saves for the Americans br br br Logos and uniforms br The Pirates were one of the first teams in Pittsburgh to use the black gold color scheme basing their colors around the Flag of Pittsburgh s colors They were predated in that regard by their own predecessor the Yellow Jackets as well as the Pittsburgh Filipinos and Pittsburgh Pirates baseball teams Decades after the team folded the colors have become the team colors of all three of Pittsburgh s major sports teams However during the team s existence they would be the only team in the city with the colors as the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team like all other baseball teams at the time had a more patriotic red white and blue color scheme and wouldn t permanently adopt black gold until Meanwhile the NFL s Pittsburgh Steelers would not exist until three years after the team left town and two years after the franchise folded altogether br The Pirates would later have a connection with Pittsburgh s next NHL franchise the Pittsburgh Penguins In January the Boston Bruins protested to the NHL over the Penguins proposed change in team colors from blue in light and dark shades and white to black and gold colors present on the Penguins logo The Penguins used the Pirates as an example of an NHL team other than the Bruins that used the black gold color scheme in addition black and gold was not even the Bruins original color scheme as they wore brown and gold the colors of Bruins founder Charles Adams First National grocery stores until The NHL allowed the Penguins to change their colors as a result of the Pirates using these colors br The Pirates wore bright yellow wool jerseys with black trim stripes with a P on the front of their jerseys during the season The team used the Pittsburgh s city crest emblems from older police jackets on the uniform sleeves The first year jerseys appear to have been inherited from the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets old jerseys The Pirates featured new jerseys in that were gold with blue striping The word Pirates written in arched blocked lettering The city crest on the sleeves was replaced with a P br In the Pirates switched to black and orange uniforms for their fifth and final season The wool jerseys featured a chain knit logo of a pirate face with an eye patch and hat with skull and cross bones The jersey featured double striping on the sleeves and a diagonal background behind the crest The orange and black remained when the Pirates moved across the state to become the Quakers Philadelphia s first NHL team adopting script lettering like the original Pirates uniforms When the Philadelphia Flyers joined the NHL in they adopted the orange and black colors first worn by the Pirates and Quakers br br br Personnel br br br Owners br Henry
