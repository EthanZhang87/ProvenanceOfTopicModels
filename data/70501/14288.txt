Hamilton now stands from the Mississaugas in Treaty also known as the Between the Lakes Purchase The Crown granted the Loyalists lands from this purchase to encourage settlement in the region These new settlers were soon followed by many more Americans attracted by the availability of inexpensive arable land At the same time large numbers of Iroquois who had allied with Britain arrived from the

shores of the bay were difficult to reach or see because they were hidden by a thick almost impenetrable mass of trees and undergrowth br George Hamilton a settler and local politician established a town site in the northern portion of Barton Township in He kept several east west roads which were originally Indian trails but the north south streets were on a regular grid pattern Streets were designated East or West if they crossed James Street or Highway Streets were designated North or South if they crossed King Street or Highway The townsite s design likely conceived in was commonplace George Hamilton employed a grid street pattern used in most towns in Upper Canada and throughout the American frontier The eighty original lots had frontages of fifty feet each lot faced a broad street and backed onto a twelve foot lane It took at least a decade to sell all the original lots but the construction of the Burlington Canal in and a new court house in encouraged Hamilton to add more blocks around At this time he included a market square in an effort to draw commercial activity onto his lands but the town s natural growth occurred to the north of Hamilton s plot br The

through testing by McMaster University near many of Hamilton s waterfalls sometimes exceeding the provincial limits for recreational water use by as much as times The storm sewers in upstream neighbourhoods carry polluted runoff from streets and parking lots as well as occasional raw sewage from sanitary lines that were improperly connected to the storm sewers instead of the separate
