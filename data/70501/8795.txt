groups sought a team for Detroit During a subsequent meeting on May the league approved a franchise to the Townsend Seyburn group of Detroit and named Charles A Hughes as governor WHL owners Frank and Lester Patrick made a deal to sell the league s players to the NHL and cease league operations The new Detroit franchise purchased the players of the WHL s Victoria Cougars who had won the Stanley Cup in and had made the Finals the previous winter to play for the team The new Detroit franchise also adopted the Cougars nickname in honor of the folded franchise br Since no arena in Detroit was ready at the time the Cougars played their first season at the Border Cities Arena in Windsor Ontario For the season the Cougars moved into the new Detroit Olympia which would be their home rink until

unsuccessful bids to buy an NHL team purchase the Falcons Norris first act was to rename the team earlier in the century Norris had been a member of the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association MAAA a multi sport club whose winged wheel emblem derived from its cycling roots and whose hockey team won the first Stanley Cup in Norris decided that a red version of the MAAA Winged Wheelers logo would be perfect for a team playing in the Motor City and on October the club was renamed the Detroit Red Wings Norris also placed coach Jack Adams on a one year probation for the NHL season Adams managed to pass his probationary period by leading the Red Wings to their first ever playoff series victory over the Montreal Maroons The team then lost in the semi finals to the New York Rangers br In the Red Wings made the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time with John Sorrell scoring goals over games and Larry Aurie leading the team in scoring However the Chicago Black Hawks defeated the Red Wings in

and assists in his first season and would not reach his prime for a few more years It was also the last season as head coach for Adams who stepped down after the season to concentrate on his duties as general manager and was succeeded by minor league coach Tommy Ivan By his second season Howe was paired with Sid Abel and Ted Lindsay to form what would become one of the great lines in NHL history

the ice Habs defenseman Doug Harvey tried to gain control of the wobbly puck with his glove but instead redirected it past Montreal goalie Gerry McNeil The repeat of the series the season after was closely contested as all seven games were won by the home team with Detroit taking the seventh game Montreal was sorely lacking its all star Maurice Richard who was suspended after hitting a linesman
