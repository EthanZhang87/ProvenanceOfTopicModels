South Carolina KARR LY n is a state in the coastal Southeastern region of the United States It borders North Carolina to the north the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast and Georgia to the southwest across the Savannah River Along with North Carolina it makes up the Carolinas region of the East Coast South Carolina is the th largest and rd most populous U S state with a recorded population of according to the census In its GDP was billion South Carolina is composed of counties The capital is Columbia with a population of in while its most populous city is Charleston with a population of The Greenville Spartanburg Anderson SC Combined Statistical Area is the most populous combined metropolitan area in the state with an estimated population of br South Carolina was named in honor of King Charles I of England who first formed the English colony with Carolus being Latin for Charles In the Province of South Carolina was formed One of the original Thirteen Colonies South Carolina became a royal colony in During the American Revolutionary War South Carolina was the site of major activity among the American colonies with more than battles and skirmishes fought within the state South Carolina became the eighth state to ratify the U S Constitution on May A slave state it was the first state to vote in favor of secession from the Union on December After the American Civil War it was readmitted to the Union on July br During the early to mid th century the state started to see economic progress as many textile mills and factories were built across the state The civil rights movement of the mid th century helped end segregation and legal discrimination policies within the state Economic diversification in South Carolina continued to pick up speed during and in the ensuing decades after World War II In the early st century South Carolina s economy is based on industries such as aerospace agribusiness automotive manufacturing and tourism br Within South Carolina from east to west are three main geographic regions the Atlantic coastal plain the Piedmont and the Blue Ridge Mountains in the northwestern corner of Upstate South Carolina South Carolina has primarily a humid subtropical climate with hot humid summers and mild winters Areas in the Upstate have a subtropical highland climate Along South Carolina s eastern coastal plain are many salt marshes and estuaries South Carolina s southeastern Lowcountry contains portions of the Sea Islands a chain of barrier islands along the Atlantic Ocean br br br History br br br Precolonial period br br There is evidence of human activities in the area dating to about years ago At the time Europeans arrived marking the end Pre Columbian era around there were many separate Native American tribes the largest being the Cherokee and the Catawba with a total population being up to br Up the rivers of the eastern coastal plain lived about a dozen tribes of Siouan background Along the Savannah River were the Apalachee Yuchi and the Yamasee Further west were the Cherokee and along the Catawba River the Catawba These tribes were village dwellers relying on agriculture as their primary food source The Cherokee lived in wattle and daub houses made with wood and clay roofed with wood or thatched grass br About a dozen or more separate small tribes summered on the coast harvesting oysters and fish and cultivating corn peas and beans Travelling inland as much as miles km mostly by canoe they wintered on the coastal plain hunting deer and gathering nuts and fruit The names of these tribes survive in place names like Edisto Island Kiawah Island and the Ashepoo River br br br Exploration br br The Spanish were the first Europeans in the area From June to July they explored the land around Winyah Bay On October they founded San Miguel de Gualdape near present day Georgetown South Carolina It was the first European settlement in what is now the contiguous United States Established with five hundred settlers it was abandoned eight months later by one hundred and fifty survivors In Hernando de Soto explored the region and the main town of Cofitachequi where he captured the queen of the Maskoki Muscogee and the Chelaque Cherokee who had welcomed him br In French Huguenots established a settlement at what is now the Charlesfort Santa Elena archaeological site on Parris Island Many of these settlers preferred a natural life far from civilization and the atrocities of the Wars of Religion The garrison lacked supplies however and the soldiers as in the France Antarctique soon ran away The French returned two years later but settled in present day Florida rather than South Carolina br br br Colonization br br Sixty years later in the King of England Charles I established the Province of Carolina an area covering what is now South and North Carolina Georgia and Tennessee In Charles II granted the land to eight Lords Proprietors in return for their financial and political assistance in restoring him to the throne in Anthony Ashley Cooper one of the Lord Proprietors planned the Grand Model for the Province of Carolina and wrote the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina which laid the basis for the future colony His utopia was inspired by John Locke an English philosopher and physician widely regarded as one of the most influential of Enlightenment thinkers and commonly known as the Father of Liberalism br The Carolina slave trade which included both trading and direct raids by colonists was the largest among the British colonies in North America Between and between and captive Native Americans were exported from South Carolina more than the number of Africans imported to the colonies of the future United States during the same period Additional enslaved Native Americans were exported from South Carolina to other U S colonies The historian Alan Gallay says the trade in Indian slaves was at the center of the English empire s development in the American South The trade in Indian slaves was the most important factor affecting the South in the period to br In the s English planters from Barbados established themselves near what is now Charleston Settlers from all over Europe built rice plantations in the South Carolina Lowcountry east of the Atlantic Seaboard fall line Plantation labor was done by African slaves who formed the majority of the population by Another cash crop was the indigo plant a plant source of blue dye developed by Eliza Lucas br Meanwhile Upstate South Carolina west of the Fall Line was settled by small farmers and traders who displaced Native American tribes westward Colonists overthrew the proprietors rule seeking more direct representation In the former Province of Carolina split into North and South Carolina In South Carolina was officially made a royal colony br South Carolina prospered from the fertility of the lowcountry and the harbors such as at Charleston It allowed religious toleration encouraging settlement and trade in deerskin lumber and beef thrived Rice cultivation was developed on a large scale on the back of slave labor br By the second half of the s South Carolina was one of the richest of the Thirteen Colonies br br br The American Revolution br br On March the colony adopted the Constitution of South Carolina electing John Rutledge as the state s first president In February South Carolina became the first state to ratify the Articles of Confederation the initial governing document of the United States and in May South Carolina ratified the United States Constitution becoming the eighth state to enter the union br During the American Revolutionary War about a third of combat action took place in South Carolina more than any other state Inhabitants of the state endured being invaded by British forces and an ongoing civil war between loyalists and partisans that devastated the backcountry It is estimated slaves of those in South Carolina fled migrated or died during the war br br br Antebellum br br America s first census in put the state s population at nearly By the census the population had increased per cent to nearly of which were slaves At that time South Carolina had the largest population of Jews in the sixteen states of the United States mostly based in Savannah and Charleston the latter being the country s fifth largest city br In the Antebellum period before the Civil War the state s economy and population grew Cotton became an important crop after the invention of the cotton gin While nominally democratic from until wealthy male landowners were in control of South Carolina For example a man was not eligible to sit in the State House of Representatives unless he possessed an estate of acres of land and Negroes or at least pounds sterling br Columbia the new state capital was founded in the center of the state and the State Legislature first met there in The town grew after it was connected to Charleston by the Santee Canal in one of the first canals in the United States br As dissatisfaction of the planters ruling class with the federal government grew in the s John C Calhoun became a leading proponent of states rights limited government nullification of the U S Constitution and free trade In the Ordinance of Nullification declared federal tariff laws unconstitutional and not to be enforced in the state leading to the Nullification Crisis The federal Force Bill was enacted to use whatever military force necessary to enforce federal law in the state bringing South Carolina back into line br br An House Report from the Committee on Military Affairs noted that Before the commencement of the war with Great Britain and for a long time afterwards the State of South Carolina was almost destitute of any of the means of military protection excepting as such could be furnished by her own resources In the harbor of Charleston alone were there any forts and these were in so feeble a condition that at a period when a British squadron was engaged in sounding the depth of water off the bar and its commander apparently meditating an attack upon the forts the quantity of gunpowder in the harbor belonging to the United States was not more than sufficient to have enabled the garrison to fire a single round br In the United States presidential election of voting was sharply divided with the South voting for the Southern Democrats and the North for Abraham Lincoln s Republican Party Lincoln was anti slavery did not acknowledge the right to secession and would not yield federal property in Southern states Southern secessionists believed Lincoln s election meant long term doom for their slavery based agrarian economy and social system br Lincoln was elected president on November The state House of Representatives three days later passed the Resolution to Call the Election of Abraham Lincoln as U S President a Hostile Act and within weeks South Carolina became the first state to secede br br br Civil War br br On April Confederate batteries began shelling the Union Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor and the American Civil War began In November of that year the Union attacked Port Royal Sound and soon occupied Beaufort County and the neighboring Sea Islands For the rest of the war this area served as a Union base and staging point for other operations Whites abandoned their plantations leaving behind about ten thousand enslaved people Several Northern charities partnered with the federal government to help these people run the cotton farms themselves under the Port Royal Experiment Workers were paid by the pound harvested and thus became the first enslaved people freed by the Union forces to earn wages br Although the state was not a major battleground the war ruined the state s economy More than soldiers from South Carolina served in the war with the state losing an estimated troops Though no regiments of Southern Unionists were formed in South Carolina due to a smaller unionist presence the Upstate region of the state would be a haven for Confederate Army deserters and resisters as they used the Upstate topography and traditional community relations to resist service in the Confederate ranks At the end of the war in early the troops of General William Tecumseh Sherman marched across the state devastating plantations and most of Columbia South Carolina would be readmitted to the Union on July br br br Reconstruction br br In Texas vs White the Supreme Court ruled the ordinances of secession including that of South Carolina were invalid and thus those states had never left the Union However South Carolina did not regain representation in Congress until that date br Until the presidential election South Carolina s legislature not the voters chose the state s electors for the presidential election South Carolina was the last state to choose its electors in this manner During Reconstruction South Carolina maintained a majority black government which lasted until approximately when Democrats and former Confederates committed voter fraud to regain power On October President Ulysses S Grant suspended habeas corpus in nine South Carolina counties under the authority of the Ku Klux Klan Act Led by Grant s Attorney General Amos T Akerman hundreds of Klansmen were arrested while Klansmen fled the state This was done to suppress Klan violence against African American and white voters in the South In the mid to late s white Democrats used paramilitary groups such as the Red Shirts to intimidate and terrorize black voters They regained political control of the state under conservative white Redeemers and pro business Bourbon Democrats In the federal government withdrew its troops as part of the Compromise of that ended Reconstruction br br br Populist and agrarian movements br The state became a hotbed of racial and economic tensions during the Populist and Agrarian movements of the s A Republican Populist biracial coalition took power away from White Democrats temporarily To prevent that from happening again Democrats gained passage of a new constitution in which effectively disenfranchised almost all blacks and many poor whites by new requirements for poll taxes residency and literacy tests that dramatically reduced the voter rolls By only black voters remained on the voter registration rolls although they constituted a majority of the state s population The census demonstrated the extent of disenfranchisement the African American citizens comprised more than of the state s population but they were essentially without any political representation in the Jim Crow society br The constitution overturned local representative government reducing the role of the counties to agents of state government effectively ruled by the General Assembly through the legislative delegations for each county As each county had one state senator that person had considerable power The counties lacked representative government until home rule was passed in br Governor Pitchfork Ben Tillman a Populist led the effort to disenfranchise the blacks and poor whites although he controlled Democratic state politics from the s to with a base among poor white farmers During the constitutional convention in he supported another man s proposal that the state adopt a one drop rule as well as prohibit marriage between whites and anyone with any known African ancestry br Some members of the convention realized prominent white families with some African ancestry could be affected by such legislation In terms similar to a debate in Virginia in on a similar proposal which was dropped George Dionysius Tillman said in opposition br br If the law is made as it now stands respectable families in Aiken Barnwell Colleton and Orangeburg will be denied the right to intermarry among people with whom they are now associated and identified At least one hundred families would be affected to my knowledge They have sent good soldiers to the Confederate Army and are now landowners and taxpayers Those men served creditably and it would be unjust and disgraceful to embarrass them in this way It is a scientific fact that there is not one full blooded Caucasian on the floor of this convention Every member has in him a certain mixture of colored blood The pure blooded white has needed and received a certain infusion of darker blood to give him readiness and purpose It would be a cruel injustice and the source of endless litigation of scandal horror feud and bloodshed to undertake to annul or forbid marriage for a remote perhaps obsolete trace of Negro blood The doors would be open to scandal malice and greed to statements on the witness stand that the father or grandfather or grandmother had said that A or B had Negro blood in their veins Any man who is half a man would be ready to blow up half the world with dynamite to prevent or avenge attacks upon the honor of his mother in the legitimacy or purity of the blood of his father br The state postponed such a one drop law for years Virginian legislators adopted a one drop law in forgetting that their state had many people of mixed ancestry among those who identified as white br br br th century br br Early in the th century South Carolina developed a thriving textile industry The state also converted its main agricultural base from cotton to more profitable crops It would attract large military bases during World War I through its majority Democratic congressional delegation part of the one party Solid South following disfranchisement of blacks br In the late th century South Carolina would implement Jim Crow laws which enforced racial segregation policies until the s During the early to mid part of the th century millions of African Americans left South Carolina and other southern states for jobs opportunities and relative freedom in U S cities outside the former Confederate states In total from to million blacks left the South in the Great Migration By South Carolina had a white majority population for the first time since South Carolina was one of several states that initially rejected the Nineteenth Amendment giving women the right to vote The South Carolina legislature later ratified the amendment on July br br The struggle of the civil rights movement took place in South Carolina as they did in other Southern states and elsewhere within the country South Carolina would experience a much less violent movement than other Deep South states This tranquil transition from a Jim Crow society occurred because the state s white and black leaders were willing to accept slow change rather than being utterly unwilling to accept change at all Other South Carolina political figures like Sen Strom Thurmond on the other hand were among the nation s most radical and effective opponents of social equality and integration br During the mid to late th century South Carolina started to see economic progress first in the textile industry and then in manufacturing Tourism also started to form into a major industry within the state during the th century especially in areas such as Myrtle Beach and Charleston br br br st century br br As the st century progresses South Carolina has attracted new business by having a corporate income tax rate no state property tax no local income tax no inventory tax no sales tax on manufacturing equipment industrial power or materials for finished products no wholesale tax and no unitary tax on worldwide profits br South Carolina was one of the first states to stop paying for early elective deliveries of babies under either Medicaid and private insurance The term early elective is defined as a labor induction or Cesarean section between and weeks The change was intended to result in healthier babies and fewer costs for the state of South Carolina br On November South Carolina became the th state to legalize same sex marriages when a federal court ordered the change br As of South Carolina had one of the lowest percentages among all states of women in state legislature at only five states had a lower percentage the national average is with the highest percentage being in Nevada at br br br Geography br br br Regions br The state can be divided into three natural geographic areas which then can be subdivided into five distinct cultural regions The natural environment is divided from east to west by the Atlantic coastal plain the Piedmont and the Blue Ridge Mountains Culturally the coastal plain is split into the Lowcountry and the Pee Dee region While the upper Piedmont region is referred to as the Piedmont and the lower Piedmont region is referred to as the Midlands The area surrounding the Blue Ridge Mountains is known as the Upstate The Atlantic Coastal Plain makes up two thirds of the state Its eastern border is the Sea Islands a chain of tidal and barrier islands The border between the lowcountry and the upcountry is defined by the Atlantic Seaboard fall line which marks the limit of navigable rivers br Altogether the state has a total area of square miles km of which square miles km is land and square miles km is water br br br Atlantic Coastal Plain br br The Atlantic Coastal plain consists of sediments and sedimentary rocks that range in age from Cretaceous to Present The terrain is relatively flat and the soil is composed predominantly of sand silt and clay Areas with better drainage make excellent farmland though some land is swampy An unusual feature of the coastal plain is a large number of low relief topographic depressions named Carolina bays The bays tend to be oval lining up in a northwest to southeast orientation The eastern portion of the coastal plain contains many salt marshes and estuaries as well as natural ports such as Georgetown and Charleston The natural areas of the coastal plain are part of the Middle Atlantic coastal forests ecoregion br The Sandhills or Carolina Sandhills is a mi km wide region within the Atlantic Coastal Plain province along the inland margin of this province The Carolina Sandhills are interpreted as eolian wind blown sand sheets and dunes that were mobilized episodically from approximately to years ago Most of the published luminescence ages from the sand are coincident with the last glaciation a time when the southeastern United States was characterized by colder air temperatures and stronger winds br br br Piedmont br Much of Piedmont consists of Paleozoic metamorphic and igneous rocks and the landscape has relatively low relief Due to the changing economics of farming much of the land is now reforested in loblolly pine for the lumber industry These forests are part of the Southeastern mixed forests ecoregion At the southeastern edge of Piedmont is the fall line where rivers drop to the coastal plain The fall line was an important early source of water power Mills built to this resource encouraged the growth of several cities including the capital Columbia The larger rivers are navigable up to the fall line providing a trade route for mill towns br The northwestern part of Piedmont is also known as the Foothills The Cherokee Parkway is a scenic driving route through this area This is where Table Rock State Park is located br br br Blue Ridge br br The Blue Ridge consists primarily of Precambrian metamorphic rocks and the landscape has relatively high relief The Blue Ridge Region contains an escarpment of the Blue Ridge Mountains that continues into North Carolina and Georgia as part of the southern Appalachian Mountains Sassafras Mountain South Carolina s highest point at feet m is in this area Also in this area is Caesars Head State Park The environment here is that of the Appalachian Blue Ridge forests ecoregion The Chattooga River on the border between South Carolina and Georgia is a favorite whitewater rafting destination br br br Lakes br br South Carolina has several major lakes covering over square miles

Jocassee acres km br Lake Bowen acres km br br br Earthquakes br br South Carolina is the most seismically active state on the East Coast Between July and July there were recorded earthquakes in South Carolina six of which exceeded a magnitude In and most of which were concentrated in Kershaw County and the coastal area of Charleston The Charleston area demonstrates the greatest frequency of earthquakes in South Carolina South Carolina averages earthquakes a year below magnitude FEMA The Charleston earthquake of was the largest quake ever to hit the eastern United States The magnitude earthquake killed people and destroyed much of the city Faults in this region are difficult to study at the surface due to thick sedimentation on top of them Many of the ancient faults are within plates rather than along plate boundaries br br br Climate br br South Carolina has a humid subtropical climate K ppen climate classification Cfa although high elevation areas in the Upstate area have fewer subtropical characteristics than areas on the Atlantic coastline In the summer South Carolina is hot and humid with daytime temperatures averaging between F C in most of the state and overnight lows averaging F C on the coast and from F C inland Winter temperatures are much less uniform in South Carolina Coastal areas of the state have very mild winters with high temperatures approaching an average of F C and overnight lows around F C Inland the average January overnight low is around F C in Columbia and temperatures well below freezing in the Upstate While precipitation is abundant the entire year in almost the entire state the coast tends to have a slightly wetter summer while inland the spring and autumn transitions tend to be the wettest periods and winter the driest season with November being the driest month The highest recorded temperature is F C in Johnston and Columbia on June and the lowest recorded temperature is F C at Caesars Head on January br Snowfall in South Carolina is minimal in the lower elevation areas south and east of Columbia It is not uncommon for areas along the southernmost coast to not receive measurable snowfall for several years In the Piedmont and Foothills especially along and north of Interstate measurable snowfall occurs one to three times in most years Annual average total amounts range from to inches The Blue Ridge Escarpment receives the most average total measurable snowfall amounts range from to inches br South Carolina averages around days of thunderstorm activity a year This is less than some of the states further south and it is slightly less vulnerable to tornadoes than the states which border on the Gulf of Mexico Some notable tornadoes have struck South Carolina and the state averages around tornadoes annually Hail is common with many of the thunderstorms in the state as there is often a marked contrast in temperature of warmer ground conditions compared to the cold air aloft br br br Hurricanes and tropical cyclones br br The state is occasionally affected by tropical cyclones This is an annual concern during hurricane season which lasts from June to November The peak time of vulnerability for the southeast Atlantic coast is from early August to early October during the Cape Verde hurricane season Memorable hurricanes to hit South Carolina include Hazel Hugo and Florence br br br

tracts of old and mature second growth cypress and tupelo forest The uplands are home to longleaf pine shortleaf pine and mixed hardwood forests The Longleaf Pine are an important part of South Carolina s coastal ecosystem They improve soil water and air quality while providing a habitat for deer and songbirds These forests are endangered by logging for agriculture and development br Oysters are a critical part of South Carolina s coastal ecology They serve a dual function filtering the water and forming reefs that provide a habitat for small fish and crabs Oysters are imperiled by overharvesting because young oysters need older oysters to latch on to as they age South Carolina is home to many shorebirds including various sandpipers and ibises The state serves as a stopover site for birds migrating farther south and a wintering ground for birds that do not fly as far south br br br Major cities br br br Statistical areas br br The following tables show the major metropolitan
