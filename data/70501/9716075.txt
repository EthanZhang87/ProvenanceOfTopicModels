minutes later to extend the Ranger lead to Atlanta s Eric Belanger tallied a power play goal in the first period s final minute to make the score at first intermission The Rangers held a two goal lead two other times through the remainder of the game but Atlanta cut the deficit back to one on both occasions with their final tally coming from former Ranger Pascal Dupuis early in the third period

nearly ten years it was also the first time the Rangers won Game of a playoff series since the Eastern Conference Semi finals against the Washington Capitals In addition the four goals scored by New York in Game matched their four game offensive output against the New Jersey Devils from the year prior br Atlanta switched goaltenders for Game giving the nod to Johan Hedberg over Kari Lehtonen The Rangers would strike first again this time on a fluke goal credited to Sean Avery Avery dumped the puck into the offensive zone from the red line causing Hedberg to leave the crease in order to play the puck behind the net The puck caromed off the boards in a peculiar manner and ended up in the net After the bizarre goal the game settled into a goaltending duel between Hedberg and Lundqvist Atlanta would tie the game five minutes into the third period on a goal by Ilya Kovalchuk The Rangers however would prevail winning on a Brendan Shanahan goal with four minutes to play br Up in the series the Rangers returned home for Game and the Atlanta Thrashers returned to Kari Lehtonen in net The switch did not work as the Rangers struck seconds into the game and would not let up from there Jaromir Jagr tied an NHL record with three assists in the first period as Michael Nylander scored twice and Marek Malik added another to give New York a lead after one Rookie Ryan Callahan scored twice in the second period the first two playoff goals of his career Brendan Shanahan added a power play goal midway through the third period and Nylander completed the hat trick seven minutes later

Hedberg in Game and struck first to take their first lead of the series with a Keith Tkachuk goal in the first period The Rangers would respond just over a minute later with Michal Rozsival s second power play goal of the series to make the score after one period Atlanta would take the lead for a second time in the second period on a goal by Greg de Vries but the Rangers would counter again this time with a Brendan Shanahan goal to tie the game at after two periods Early in the third period Matt Cullen would score the eventual game winner driving a rolling puck from the point off the crossbar The puck bounced straight down and at first glance never crossed the goal line After a five minute video review the puck was clearly shown to have crossed the line in its entirety while on edge and the goal counted Jaromir Jagr added an empty net goal late in the period to seal a win and a series sweep The sweep was only the third sweep of a seven game playoff series in franchise history the other sweeps came against the Chicago Blackhawks in and the New York Islanders in br br br Eastern Conference Semi finals vs Buffalo Sabres br After sweeping Atlanta in the first round the Rangers next opponent was the Eastern Conference s top seed and the regular season Presidents Trophy winner the Buffalo Sabres The Sabres had been a powerful offensive team in the regular season scoring goals in the games more than the second place team in that department the Ottawa Senators with The Sabres had four players score over goals during the season led by Thomas Vanek with in his sophomore campaign br The series did not start well for the Rangers in western New York Despite playing a scoreless first period the key development in the first twenty minutes was a knee injury suffered by Ranger defenseman Michal Rozsival Rozsival would see the ice for two shifts in the second period but could not stay in the game As a result the Rangers were forced to play the remainder of the game with five defensemen a recipe for disaster against a team as talented offensively as the Sabres Indeed the result was a disaster for New York as the Sabres struck for three goals in four minutes two coming from the aforementioned Vanek and Buffalo led after two The Rangers finally beat Ryan Miller halfway through the third period to cut the deficit to thanks to a Marcel Hossa tally but it would not be enough Three minutes later Jason Pominville was awarded a goal on the first of several controversial video reviews in the series the controversy in this case coming from the appearance that Pominville had punched the puck into the net Brendan Shanahan scored a power play goal late for the Rangers to make it but Drew Stafford hit the empty net to seal a Sabre victory in Game br The tide turned slightly for the Rangers in Game but the result would not The Rangers scored first this time around on a Martin Straka power play goal midway through the first but Brian Campbell and the Sabres responded with a goal on the man advantage seconds later to even the game at one Late in the second period the Rangers scored again on the power play this time with Paul Mara getting the tally to take a lead at second intermission Things would unravel for the Rangers in the third as an errant Marek Malik pass was intercepted before exiting the defensive zone and Chris Drury converted the play into the equalizer goal seconds into the period Buffalo carried the momentum from there and Thomas Vanek netted the eventual game winner after a scramble in front at of the third The Sabres hung on to win and take a lead into the series br The series shifted to New York City and Madison Square Garden for Game with the Rangers in desperate need of a victory For the second time in three games in the series the game remained scoreless after one period of play however the Rangers struck early in the second shortly after a power play opportunity had expired Marek Malik kept the puck in at the blue line and Jaromir Jagr fired a shot that Ryan Miller stopped and thought he had covered Unfortunately for the Sabres the puck slipped behind him and Jagr followed up on the play by putting the loose puck in for his first goal of the series giving the Rangers the lead A few minutes later after driving hard to the net Karel Rachunek appeared to have given the Rangers a lead when the puck deflected off his skate and past Miller into the open net After a second controversial video review the officials determined that Rachunek had kicked the puck into the net negating the goal Said Rangers Head Coach Tom Renney after the game it has to be a distinct kicking motion If that s distinct then we re all in trouble In the third Buffalo would even the score with a power play goal by co captain Daniel Briere with under eight minutes to play in regulation forcing overtime Buffalo nearly buried the game in the first overtime session minutes in while shorthanded but Derek Roy s shot rang off the post behind Rangers netminder Henrik Lundqvist and out In double overtime it was Rozsival who would be the hero for New York scoring on a drive from the point that deflected off the iron and in behind Ryan Miller ending the game after of extra time The win came years to the day that Pete Stemkowski scored a triple overtime winner at the Garden to beat the Chicago Blackhawks in br Two days later the Rangers looked to even up the series on home ice taking momentum from their double overtime Game victory Game started similarly after a scoreless first period Jaromir Jagr scored a goal early in the first minute of the second period to give the Rangers a lead The Rangers would extend their lead to midway through the third period thanks to a power play goal from Brendan Shanahan Buffalo would cut their deficit back to one goal just seconds later on a goal by Ales Kotalik Buffalo attacked hard for the game s final ten minutes but Lundqvist kept the Rangers up by a goal The Sabres outshot the Rangers in the game s final frame With seconds to play in regulation Lundqvist was caught out of the net after misplaying the puck behind his own net as Buffalo charged for the equalizer The puck came to Daniel Briere at the side of the net but Lundqvist came across and made a right pad save at the goal line with seconds to play The play would go to another controversial video review and while many analysts believe that the puck logically would have crossed the goal line resulting in a goal there was no video angle available to conclusively prove that point The ruling was no goal and the Rangers hung on for their second straight victory to even the series as it went back to Buffalo br After an even first period in Game resulted in no scoring the momentum swung heavily in the Sabres favor Buffalo outshot New York in the second period but both goaltenders were a wall in net and the game remained scoreless through two In the third Buffalo had the advantage in shots once more but it was New York that struck first as Martin Straka scored to put the Rangers on top with to play in regulation The Rangers looked like they were about to steal Game but Chris Drury scored with seconds remaining in the game to force overtime Coincidentally the Rangers had been burned for a game tying goal with exactly seconds on the clock in the past specifically in Game of the Eastern Conference Finals when Valeri Zelepukin beat Mike Richter to force overtime While the Rangers had won that game in double overtime on a Stephane Matteau wrap around in this case the Sabres would ride their momentum and win four minutes into overtime on a power play goal by Maxim Afinogenov who had been a healthy scratch the game before br Down in the series the Rangers headed back to New York for Game carrying a nine game winning streak at Madison Square Garden For the fifth straight game in the series the Rangers drew first blood on a Michael Nylander backhand shot With the score Rangers in the second period Buffalo started a heavy offensive onslaught into the second Dmitri Kalinin scored on a shot that changed directions on Lundqvist after forward Nigel Dawes attempted to block the shot Buffalo took the lead just over a minute later on a Jason Pominville goal The Rangers would respond quickly thanks to a power play goal by Paul Mara to tie the score at but the Sabres were not done Jochen Hecht and Chris Drury would add goals to give Buffalo a lead after two periods During the regular season and playoffs to that point the Sabres had a record when leading by two goals after two periods but the Rangers would challenge that early Jaromir Jagr scored on the power play five minutes into the third to cut the deficit to but Hecht would net his second of the game ten minutes later on a tip in in front to extend Buffalo s lead back to two goals With to play Michael Nylander would score his second of the game on the power play to cut it to one goal again but the
