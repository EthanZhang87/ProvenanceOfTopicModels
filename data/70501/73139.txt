The Sharks origins began with the San Francisco Seals of the Western Hockey League WHL when they were awarded an expansion franchise for San Francisco on April to former Vancouver Canucks owner Coleman Coley Hall on the condition that an ice surface is installed in the Cow Palace The Seals won three WHL championships and renamed to the California Seals in playing their games at the Oakland Coliseum Arena br The following season the California Golden Seals joined the NHL played their seasons from to who were neither successful on the ice nor at the box office Gordon and George Gund III became minority owners of the Seals in and were instrumental in their move to Cleveland in and a merger with the Minnesota North Stars which they purchased that year They had long wanted to bring hockey back to the Bay Area and asked the NHL for permission to move the North Stars there in the late s but the league vetoed the proposed move Meanwhile a group led by former Hartford Whalers owner Howard Baldwin was pushing the NHL to bring a team to San Jose where a new arena was being built Eventually the League struck a compromise the Gunds would sell their share of the North Stars to Baldwin s group with the Gunds receiving an expansion team in the Bay Area to begin play in the season and being allowed to take a certain number of players from the North Stars to their new club In return the North Stars would be allowed to participate as an equal partner in an expansion draft with the new Bay Area team On May the Gunds officially sold their share of the North Stars to Baldwin and were awarded a new team for the Bay Area based in San Jose The owners paid to the league an expansion fee of US million and the new franchise was approved on May br Over potential names were submitted by mail for the new team While the first place finisher was Blades the Gunds were concerned about the name s potentially negative association with weapons and went with the runner up Sharks The name was said to have been inspired by the large number of sharks living in the Pacific Ocean Seven varieties live there and one area of water near the Bay Area is known as the red triangle hence the triangle in the team s logo because of its shark population br Matt Levine the team s first marketing head said of the new name Sharks are relentless determined swift agile bright and fearless We plan to build an organization that has all those qualities br br br Cow Palace years br br For their first two seasons the Sharks played at the Cow Palace in Daly City just outside San Francisco a facility the NHL and the Seals had rejected in Pat Falloon was their first draft choice and led the team in points during their first season The team was placed in the Campbell Conference s Smythe Division George Kingston was their first head coach during their first two seasons Though the roster consisted primarily of NHL journeymen minor leaguers and rookies the Sharks had at least one notable player when they acquired year veteran and former Norris Trophy winning defenseman Doug Wilson from the Chicago Blackhawks on September Wilson was named the team s first captain and All Star representative in the inaugural season However the Sharks first two seasons saw the typical struggles for an expansion team The losses in is an NHL record and they also suffered a game losing streak while winning just games and earning a mere points in the standings Kingston was fired following the end of the season br Despite the Sharks futility in the standings the team led the NHL s merchandise sales with million accounting for of the NHL s total and behind only National Basketball Association champions Chicago Bulls among all North American leagues Several team firsts happened

second round Ray Whitney scored a goal in double overtime of Game of the Conference Quarter finals against the Calgary Flames Key Sharks players included goaltender Arturs Irbe defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh and forwards Igor Larionov and Sergei Makarov Despite their success against Calgary round two would prove to be a disaster for the Sharks when they lost in a four game sweep to Detroit in a rematch of the previous year without even holding a single lead in all four games However the season also saw the only rainout in the history of the NHL when the Guadalupe River flooded its banks in March making it impossible for anyone to get into the San Jose Arena for a game between the Sharks and the Detroit Red Wings br In the Sharks finished last in the Pacific Division and failed to make the playoffs The team also underwent major changes during the season they traded Ozolinsh and Larionov and Irbe who had suffered an off ice injury was released at the end of the season The team began rebuilding acquiring forward Owen Nolan from the Colorado Avalanche as well as several other players Constantine was fired midway through the season and replaced by interim coach Jim Wiley br br br

standing would help them draft Patrick Marleau in the NHL Entry Draft The Sharks returned to the playoffs in with goaltender Mike Vernon whom they acquired from the Red Wings and new head coach Darryl Sutter For the next two years the Sharks made the playoffs yet never advanced past the first round In San Jose acquired former Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens star Vincent Damphousse San

traded to Boston Bryan Marchment went to Colorado and American Hockey League AHL star Shawn Heins and forward Matt Bradley were moved to the Pittsburgh Penguins The Sharks acquired Alyn McCauley and Wayne Primeau during this season Reportedly due to having just acquired the team as well as the team s bad start the ownership group wanted general manager Dean Lombardi to move high priced players on the roster Lombardi failed to do so and consequently lost his job During that debacle year for San Jose there were some bright spots Jim Fahey led all rookie defensemen in the NHL in points despite playing in only games br Lombardi s tenure with the team ended with his dismissal on March Doug Wilson was named to the role on May br br br Doug Wilson era br br br Resurgence br The season under new general manager Doug Wilson and head coach Ron Wilson saw another turnaround for the team resulting in the team s best season to that point An injection of youth with players like Christian Ehrhoff and out of college signing Tom Preissing and the influx of energy from Alexander Korolyuk jump started San Jose Doug Wilson acquired Nils Ekman and a line of Ekman McCauley and Korolyuk provided

season slowly dropping to last place in the Pacific Division The team lost Alexander Korolyuk After a ten game losing streak the Sharks traded Brad Stuart Wayne Primeau and Marco Sturm to the Boston

youngest team in average age as well as the biggest team in average weight and they raced out to a start the best in franchise history A concern made by fans and members of the media was the lack of a left winger to play on a line with the duo of Thornton and Cheechoo Wilson seemingly addressed this issue by acquiring year old goal scorer Mark Bell from the Chicago Blackhawks Despite scoring a goal in his first two games with San Jose Bell was widely considered a flop in San Jose Off ice issues including being cited for drunk driving and an alleged hit and run contributed to his on ice play By the end of the season Bell was consistently either a healthy scratch or a fourth liner br br Two significant trades were made at the trade deadline for defenseman Craig Rivet and winger Bill Guerin

Conference Semi finals Game required four overtime periods and was the longest game in the team s history This was the Sharks third playoff loss to Dallas br The Ron Wilson era officially came to an end on May when the Sharks fired him citing San Jose s disappointing second round losses in the previous three seasons Wilson ended his tenure in San Jose with wins losses ties and losses in overtime or in the shootout in regular season games and a record in postseason games He moved on to be hired as head coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs along with assistant coaches who were also two former

were eliminated by the eighth seeded Anaheim Ducks in six games in the first round of the playoffs The team was heavily criticized for once again failing to succeed in the postseason General manager Doug Wilson promised the team would undergo significant changes in the off season br br In the off season Wilson held to his word with many major moves The first was Christian Ehrhoff and Brad Lukowich to the Vancouver Canucks It was widely believed that San Jose made this trade so it could free up salary cap space to make a second trade Milan Michalek and Jonathan Cheechoo were sent to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for Dany Heatley and a draft pick Assistant coach Todd Richards left and was replaced by Matt Shaw Aside from the trades several contracts were not renewed including those of Mike Grier Marcel Goc Tomas Plihal and Alexei Semenov br San Jose also signed forward Scott Nichol and added grit to the team by signing Joe Callahan Jed Ortmeyer and Manny Malhotra plus Benn Ferriero Jeremy Roenick and Claude Lemieux both announced their retirements from the NHL Another major move by San Jose was stripping Patrick Marleau of the captaincy and assigning it to the newly re signed Rob Blake One reason for the move was that Marleau was named captain by Wilson and McLellan wanted to name his own Dan Boyle and Joe Thornton were named the alternates On February San Jose acquired Niclas Wallin from the Carolina Hurricanes On February San Jose traded Jody Shelley to the New York Rangers for a draft pick br The Sharks finished the regular season leading the Western

the previous postseason s second round Just like the year prior the Sharks won the first three games of the series and lost the fourth but instead of replicating the previous year s success in Game the Sharks dropped two more games as the Red Wings became the eighth team in NHL history to force a Game after losing the first three games of a series However they would not become the fourth team in history to pull off the comeback as the Sharks prevailed with the game winning goal scored by former captain Patrick Marleau who had endured media criticism from former teammate and now NBC Sports

playoff meeting with the Vancouver Canucks San Jose dropped the first two games of the series at Rogers Arena in Vancouver but rebounded with a victory thanks to two first period goals by Marleau in Game However they lost the fourth game of the series and eventually were eliminated from the playoffs after a Game in Vancouver that featured a game tying goal by the Canucks Ryan Kesler with seconds remaining in the third period as well as a quirky bounce off a side stanchion that allowed Kevin Bieksa to score the overtime goal that advanced Vancouver to their third Stanley Cup Finals and left

Setoguchi the Sharks first round pick Charlie Coyle and a first round pick in the NHL Entry Draft to the Minnesota Wild for All Star defenseman Brent Burns and a second round pick in the Draft This came after Setoguchi had signed a three year million contract extension with the Sharks The Sharks continued their off season retool by orchestrating a second transaction with the Wild shipping Dany Heatley to Minnesota in exchange for Martin Havlat both to relieve cap space as Heatley was slated to carry a cap hit million greater than Havlat s for the duration of their respective contracts and to acquire a player in Havlat with a history of playoff production at the expense of Heatley whose postseason numbers with the Sharks had been far less than stellar the forward had managed to score just five goals in playoff games in two years with San Jose br The Sharks finished the season with a record good for points and the seventh seed in the Stanley Cup playoffs However after winning Game of their first round series with the St Louis Blues in overtime they lost the final four games of the series marking the second time they lost in the Quarter finals under Todd McLellan Despite the
