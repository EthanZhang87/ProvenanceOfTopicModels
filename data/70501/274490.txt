The Hamilton Tigers were a professional ice hockey team based in Hamilton Ontario that competed in the National Hockey League NHL from to The Tigers were formed by the sale of the Quebec Bulldogs NHL franchise to Hamilton interests After years of struggling the franchise finished first in the league in the NHL season but a players strike before the playoffs resulted in the franchise s dissolution The players contracts were sold to New York City interests to stock the expansion New York Americans A namesake amateur team existed prior to and during the NHL team s existence and a minor league professional team named the Hamilton Tigers existed from to br br br Franchise history br The origins of the team go back to the old Quebec Hockey Club team that started play in Originally an amateur team it turned professional in Quebec was a charter member of the NHL in however due to financial difficulties and the NHA NHL dispute the franchise was dormant until the season when it was operated by the Quebec Athletic Club That season proved to be a dismal one despite the presence of Joe Malone the club finished with only four wins in games br After the season the NHL took back the Quebec franchise and sold the team to the Abso Pure Ice Company of Hamilton Ontario The club was moved to Hamilton for the season and renamed the Hamilton Tigers This was done to prevent the startup of a rival league that was trying to land a club in Hamilton Hamilton was the fifth largest city in the country and third largest in Central Canada with a population of and therefore was considered a vital market Percy Thompson a part owner and manager of the Barton Street Arena became manager of the team The team became known as the Tigers a nickname used by a multitude of sports teams in the city Contemporary newspaper coverage often referred to the senior team of the same name in the OHA as the Tigers while the NHL team would either be nameless or simply referred to as professionals br The move to Hamilton did not improve the team s record Despite earning a shutout in their first game the first team ever to do so with a win over the Montreal Canadiens on December the Tigers were as noncompetitive as the Bulldogs As a result the NHL ordered the other three teams to supply players to the Tigers Receiving quality players from the other teams was not enough to keep Hamilton out of the league cellar with wins losses and no ties in games Malone kept out of the first four games for business reasons scored goals in games br The next three seasons were just as dreadful as the first The Tigers finished dead last every year making a total of straight last place finishes counting the one season as the Bulldogs During these years the Tigers attempted a rebuilding phase to bring the team up to par After the NHL season they hired Art Ross as their new coach and made several player changes even trading superstar Malone to the Montreal Canadiens for Bert Corbeau and Edmond Bouchard The fans were outraged at seeing Malone leave but were vindicated when he scored a single goal in his lone season with the Canadiens br Prior to the season the NHL held its governors meeting at the Royal Connaught Hotel on King Street the same location where visiting teams routinely stayed when playing the Tigers br After four years of futility things started to come together in the NHL season with Percy LeSueur as the new head coach Four players were acquired from the Sudbury Wolves of the NOHA brothers Red and Shorty Green Alex McKinnon and Charlie Langlois who all contributed to a team high of nine wins in games br br br Players revolt br br With yet another new head coach Jimmy Gardner the Hamilton Tigers roared off to an impressive start in the NHL season Only halfway through the season they had more wins than any other season in their NHL history The team slumped somewhat in the second half of the season but still managed to finish first overall with a record of wins losses and tie just ahead of the Toronto St Patricks It looked like the franchise would have a chance at winning the Stanley Cup for the first time since winning it as the Bulldogs over a decade prior in br But it was not to be During the rail travel back to Hamilton after the season s final game the Tigers players went to their general manager Percy Thompson and demanded pay for the six extra games they played that season or they would not play in the playoffs The NHL had increased the number of games played that year from to but the players didn t receive an increase in pay The Tigers management stating that the players contracts stated that the players were under contract from December to March regardless of the number of games refused to pay the money and passed the issue to the NHL Thus began the first players strike in NHL history br NHL President Frank Calder warned the players that if they sat out the final they would be suspended and replaced in the final by fourth place Ottawa At the same time Calder ordered that the players back pay be held The impasse continued while second place Toronto and third place Montreal played their semi final ending with Montreal winning on March On March after consulting with Tigers management Calder declared the Canadiens league champions and fined the Tigers players The Canadiens then went on to play the Victoria Cougars for the Stanley Cup but lost That marked the last time that an NHL team had lost the Stanley Cup to a rival league br br br Takeover by New York br Thomas Duggan of Montreal owner of the Mount Royal Arena held two options for expansion teams in the United States He sold the first of the two to Boston grocery magnate Charles Adams who used it to start the Boston Bruins He sold the second to a New York bootlegger named Big Bill Dwyer for a team to play in New York At the NHL league meeting of April Dwyer was granted an expansion franchise for New York br Although Dwyer wished to purchase the Hamilton players for a little while it seemed that Hamilton might remain in the NHL as Abso Pure talked about building a new arena The arena was not built and Dwyer bought the rights to the Tigers players from Thompson for Although Dwyer was ostensibly the owner of the Americans due to his underworld ties he was not publicly named by the NHL at the meeting announcing the team Instead Colonel Hammond of Madison Square Garden Duggan and former Ottawa manager Tommy Gorman were announced as the officers The new team was for a time known as the New York Hamilton Tigers by the time it reached training camp but this was changed to the New York Americans A Hamilton franchise was still considered to play in the NHL for the season with a preliminary schedule including such a team but nothing came of it br The last active Tigers player was Billy Burch who retired in br br br Other Hamilton Tigers ice hockey teams br br br The OHA Tigers br At the time the city had another Tigers hockey club fielding teams in the Ontario Hockey Association the senior team playing in the OHA Senior A League The senior Tigers wore the same black and gold colours as the NHL Tigers and were just as
