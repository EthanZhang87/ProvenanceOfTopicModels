The season structure of the National Hockey League NHL is divided into the pre season regular season and the Stanley Cup playoffs In the pre season which is generally held during the last two weeks of September each team plays several not for the record exhibition games In the regular season which generally runs from early October through early April teams play games which determine their standings The three highest placed teams in each division and two wild card teams per conference enter the playoff elimination tournament to determine the Stanley Cup champion br br br Pre season br The NHL pre season is generally held during the last two weeks of September Each team plays roughly six to eight exhibition games These games allow coaches to evaluate their teams new players to try out for roster and position spots and established players to practice prior to competitive play Teams may also have split squad games in which parts of a team s roster play separate games br Several pre season games may be held at neutral sites Since in Canada and in the U S Kraft Heinz has sponsored the Kraft Hockeyville contests in which communities compete for the opportunity to host a pre season game Kraft Hockeyville would be discontinued in the U S following the edition Several pre season games held at international sites have also been scheduled including games between an NHL team and a club from another league overseas br br br Regular season br br Since the season each team in the NHL plays regular season games each of home and road In all games are scheduled of them inter conference br For the season the NHL regular season formula was adjusted to account for the addition of the Seattle Kraken Each team plays either three or four games against the other teams in its division a total of games as well as playing all non divisional teams in their own conference three times games The remaining games of the season are inter conference play games allowing every team in the league to play every other team twice The schedule is structured so that every NHL team plays in every arena at least once per season which also include regular season games played outside North America and games played in outdoor stadiums br Each team has a mandatory bye week near the midpoint of the season during which no regular season games take place The NHL All Star Game and its accompanying festivities typically occur during the bye week From to every four years in lieu of an All Star break there was a break for the Winter Olympic Games However the NHL prohibited players from participation in the Olympics and the Olympics br The league also schedules a three day Christmas break since when no regular season games are played on either Christmas Eve and Christmas Day Games are not played on December unless it falls on a Saturday in which case no games would be played on December The NHL also has a holiday roster freeze between December and in which in most cases players cannot be traded waived or sent to the minor leagues br On the day of the Super Bowl second Sunday of February the league avoids scheduling any games that night and will either have a blank slate that day or have a few afternoon games usually starting no later than p m EST br Two points are awarded for a win including in overtime or shootout one point for a loss in overtime or shootout and no points for a loss in regulation time If however a team pulls their goaltender for an extra attacker during overtime and gives up an empty net goal the point normally awarded for losing in overtime is forfeited Pulling a goaltender in overtime was occasionally attempted in certain situations prior to the NHL lockout near the end of a season if earning a single point in overtime would have been worthless for playoff qualification purposes but with the introduction of the shootout it has not been attempted as often br br br Stanley Cup playoffs br br At the end of the regular season sixteen teams qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs an elimination tournament consisting of three rounds of best of seven series to determine which team from each conference will advance to the final round dubbed the Stanley Cup Finals The top three teams in each division earn automatic berths six teams per conference and the next two teams in the conference earn wild card spots The First Round pits the top ranked team in the conference against the lower ranked wild card and the other division winner against the higher ranked wild card The second and third place teams in each division play each other The top ranked team in a division along with its wild card opponent and the second and third ranked teams of the same division comprise a group or bracket during the First Round and the two winners will meet in the Second Round The Western Conference Pacific vs Central divisional bracket winners and Eastern Conference Atlantic vs Metropolitan divisional bracket winners Finals will determine who faces off in the Stanley Cup Finals br Any ties in the standings are broken using the following protocols br br The fewest games played only used during the season as all teams will have played games once the regular season is over br The greater number of regulation wins only used since the NHL season reflected by the RW statistic br The greater number of regulation and overtime wins excluding shootouts used since the NHL season reflected by the ROW statistic br The greater number of total wins including shootouts br The greater number of points earned in games between the tied clubs br If two clubs are tied and have not played an equal number of home games against each other the points earned and available in the first game played in the city of the club that had the greater number of home games in games between the two are not included br If more than two clubs are tied the higher percentage of available points earned in games among those clubs and not including any odd games are used to determine the standing The odd games are identical to those mentioned in the previous paragraph that is the first game in the city of the club that has had more home games in games between each club in the tie Note that because of this procedure if two teams in the multi team tie also applicable in a two team tie have only played once against each other the points earned in that game are not included br The greater differential between goals for and goals against during the entire regular season br The greater number of goals scored used since NHL season reflected by the GF statistic br If two clubs are still tied on non shootout wins points earned between the tied clubs and regular season goal differential a one game playoff is played under Stanley Cup playoff rules br For the first two rounds the higher seeded team has home ice advantage regardless of point record Thereafter it goes to whoever has the better regular season record no matter the seeding The team with home ice advantage hosts Games and while the opponent hosts Games and Games are played if necessary br br br See also br List of NHL playoff series br National Hockey League rivalries br
