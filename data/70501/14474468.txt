There are many traditions and anecdotes associated with the Stanley Cup The Stanley Cup is the championship trophy of the National Hockey League NHL the major professional ice hockey league in Canada and the United States It is commonly referred to as simply The Cup The Holy Grail or facetiously chiefly by sportswriters as Lord Stanley s Mug br Unlike the trophies awarded by the other three major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada a new Stanley Cup is not made annually the champions keep the Cup until a new champion is crowned It is also one of only two trophies in professional North American sports which has the name of the winning players coaches management and club staff engraved upon it the other being the CFL s Grey Cup br It is at the centre of several legends and superstitions Many of these anecdotes involve the Stanley Cup being mistreated in some way It is the most travelled championship trophy in the world br br br Traditions br br br Drinking

list entitled Perks of Winning the Stanley Cup which happened after the New York Rangers won the cup in number one was My friend you can t drink beer out of a Nobel Prize br br br On ice presentation br Another tradition is the on ice presentation of the Cup by the NHL commissioner to the captain of the winning team after the series winning victory and the subsequent carrying of the trophy around the rink by each member of the victorious club This differs from the championship trophy ceremonies in the other three major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada where the commissioners of Major League Baseball National Basketball Association and National Football League instead present the Commissioner s Trophy Larry O Brien Championship Trophy and Vince Lombardi Trophy respectively to the owners of the winning team The on ice presentation of the Cup is typically preceded by the presentation of the Conn Smythe Trophy in contrast to the other three leagues who usually present the World Series MVP NBA Finals MVP and Super Bowl MVP awards respectively after their championship trophy br Possibly the first time that the Cup was awarded on the ice was to the Toronto Maple Leafs and the practice became an annual tradition in the s br br br Captain hoisting the cup br Ted Lindsay of the Cup champion Detroit Red Wings became the first player Sid Abel was captain of Red Wings in upon receiving the Cup to skate around with it slightly raised for the crowd Since then it has been a tradition to have the captain of the winning team take a lap around the ice first with the trophy hoisted above his head the hoisting of the Cup above their heads is sometimes credited to Frank Mahovlich of the Toronto Maple Leafs who was photographed doing so after the Stanley Cup Finals There are a few exceptions br br br br In what would be Wayne Gretzky s final Cup win and final game as a member of the Edmonton Oilers he gathered his teammates coaches trainers and others from the Oilers organization to join at centre ice for an impromptu team photo with the trophy This tradition has been continued by every subsequent Stanley Cup champion br br br br The championship was won by the Montreal Canadiens As Gary Bettman presented the Cup to Canadiens captain Guy Carbonneau Carbonneau waved to Denis Savard to come join him Savard who had played seasons for the Chicago Blackhawks before being traded to Montreal in the Blackhawks had since been to the Stanley Cup Finals in had not played in the Cup Finals in his career Carbonneau let Savard hoist the Cup in his place br br br br The championship was won by the defending champions Detroit Red Wings The previous year several days after their first Stanley Cup in years Vladimir Konstantinov had been paralyzed in an automobile accident that also paralyzed team masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov As Bettman gave the cup to Red Wings captain Steve Yzerman he hoisted it before putting it on Konstantinov s lap and helping him parade with the trophy br br br br The championship was won by the Colorado Avalanche Until requesting a trade on March Ray Bourque had played his entire career with the Boston Bruins The seventh game of the Finals was the last of Bourque s year NHL career Though Bourque reached the Stanley Cup Finals twice with the Bruins in and the Bruins fell both times to the Edmonton Oilers and Bourque had never been on a Cup winning team until joining the Avalanche When captain Joe Sakic received the trophy he did not hoist it but instead immediately handed it to Bourque for him to hoist Sakic then followed Bourque in hoisting the trophy br br br Touching the Cup br Another tradition or rather superstition that is prevalent among today s NHL players is that no player should touch the Cup itself until his team has rightfully won the Cup Adding to this superstition is some players choice to neither touch nor hoist the conference trophies Clarence S Campbell Bowl and Prince of Wales Trophy when these series have been won the players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship trophy and only it should be hoisted br New York Islanders captain Denis Potvin hoisted the Wales Trophy during the and playoffs en route to the club successfully defending the Cup each time sweeping the Vancouver Canucks in and the Edmonton Oilers in During the Islanders first two runs to the Cup no conference championship trophy was presented during the playoffs instead the Wales Trophy and the Campbell Bowl were awarded to the teams with the best regular season records in the respective conferences the Islanders won the Campbell Bowl in br However in Stephane Matteau then of the New York Rangers admitted that he tapped the Wales Trophy with his stick s blade before the overtime period in game seven of the Eastern Conference Final Matteau subsequently scored the game winning goal in double overtime against the New Jersey Devils Following the game Mark Messier the captain of the Rangers picked up and raised the Wales Trophy after it was awarded to the team After winning the Western Conference Vancouver Canucks captain Trevor Linden lifted the Campbell trophy The Rangers prevailed over the Canucks in a seven game series to win the Cup br Scott Stevens and Martin Brodeur hoisted the Wales trophy as well in after the New Jersey Devils came back from a series deficit to defeat the Philadelphia Flyers in seven games the Devils would go on to defeat the Dallas Stars who touched but did not lift the Campbell Bowl in the Stanley Cup Finals Stevens also lifted the Wales trophy en route to the Devils and Stanley Cup wins In the Carolina Hurricanes hoisted the Wales Trophy after they won their conference title the Hurricanes lost their Finals series with the Detroit Red Wings four games to one Steve Yzerman captain of the Red Wings during their and Stanley Cup victories picked up the Campbell Bowl prior to that year s Cup Finals br br The superstition held true in as Jarome Iginla of the Calgary Flames grabbed the Campbell Bowl but Dave Andreychuk of the Tampa Bay Lightning refused to touch the Wales Trophy the Lightning won the Stanley Cup in seven games In Daniel Alfredsson and Wade Redden of the Ottawa Senators touched and picked up the Wales Trophy respectively but Anaheim Ducks captain Scott Niedermayer never came close to the Campbell Bowl the Ducks won the Stanley Cup in five games br In neither the Pittsburgh Penguins Sidney Crosby nor the Red Wings Nicklas Lidstrom touched their respective conference trophies the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup that year The following year however Crosby decided to touch the Wales Trophy and the Penguins went on to win the Stanley Cup They did the same thing again in winning the and Stanley Cups conversely the San Jose Sharks Joe Pavelski stayed true to the general tradition and did not touch the Campbell Bowl Pittsburgh then went on to defeat San Jose in six games to win the Cup The same occurred to the Nashville Predators when captain Mike Fisher refused to touch the Campbell Bowl one year later One possible reason for Crosby lifting the trophy is that the Penguins have had good luck winning the Stanley Cup after lifting the Wales trophy this was evident when Mario Lemieux lifted the Wales en route to the Penguins and Cup wins br In Philadelphia Flyers captain Mike Richards picked up the Wales Trophy while Chicago Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews did not touch the Campbell Bowl The Blackhawks went on to defeat the Flyers in six games for the Stanley Cup Subsequently between and none of the Stanley Cup finalists touched either the Campbell or the Wales trophies The Los Angeles Kings after defeating the Phoenix Coyotes in five games went so far as leaving the Campbell Bowl in Phoenix Instead Tim Leiweke President and CEO of Anschutz Entertainment Group the parent of the LA Kings drove the trophy in his car trunk from Phoenix to Los Angeles and showed it to the fans that waited at LAX Airport to show their support to their Stanley Cup finalists who went on to win the Stanley Cup This was in marked contrast to when the Kings had defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs in seven games to reach their first Cup Finals where Wayne Gretzky and the team celebrated with the Campbell Bowl and during the Finals the trophy was unveiled before the start of game three the Kings lost the series in five games including three overtime losses br In both conference champions the Vegas Golden Knights and Washington Capitals picked up the Campbell Bowl and Prince of Wales Trophy respectively marking the first time since both conference championship trophies were skated Deryk Engelland accepted the Campbell Bowl for the Golden Knights becoming the first player to pick up the trophy on the ice since Iginla years earlier Capitals superstar Alexander Ovechkin skated the Prince of Wales Trophy with his teammates then won the Conn Smythe Trophy after leading Washington to the Stanley Cup its first championship in franchise history The Golden Knights reversed course in after captain Mark Stone refused to touch the Campbell Bowl they eventually won the Stanley Cup that year br In neither Boston Bruins captain Zdeno Ch ra nor St Louis Blues captain Alex Pietrangelo touched their respective conference trophies This was the first time since that neither conference championship trophy was hoisted br In Lightning captain Steven Stamkos followed Andreychuk s example from by refusing to touch the Prince of Wales Trophy However the Lightning lost to the Blackhawks in the Cup Finals so when the team won their third Eastern Conference championship five seasons later Stamkos changed course and touched the trophy Stamkos likewise touched the Wales trophy again in and The Lightning defied superstition by winning both the and Stanley Cup br The Dallas Stars had previously touched the Campbell Bowl in and with Derian Hatcher as the captain in the former season the Stars won the Cup But when the Stars won again in captain Jamie Benn refused to touch the trophy Similarly the Montreal Canadiens captain Guy Carbonneau had hoisted the Wales Trophy in and went on to win the Cup but when they won the semifinal round in captain Shea Weber refused to touch the Campbell Bowl In both cases the Stars and Canadiens lost in the Cup Finals to the Lightning br The Colorado Avalanche led by then captain Joe Sakic had previously touched the Campbell Bowl en route to their and Cup wins So when the team won the Campbell again in captain Gabriel Landeskog elected to touch the Campbell Bowl The Avalanche ended up winning the Stanley Cup that year defeating the two time defending champion Lightning br The Florida Panthers touched the Prince of Wales Trophy the first two times they won it In captain Brian Skrudland hoisted the trophy in the same year the Avalanche touched the Campbell Bowl In captain Aaron Ekblad followed suit and touched the trophy as well However the Panthers lost the Stanley Cup Finals both times After the Panthers won the Prince of Wales Trophy again in captain Aleksander Barkov and his teammates refused to touch the trophy they would finally win their first Stanley Cup that year br During the s dynasty years with Wayne Gretzky the Edmonton Oilers touched the Campbell Bowl each time they won it and went on to win the Stanley Cup in five of six occasions However when the Oilers clinched the Western Conference title in captain Jason Smith refused to touch the Campbell Bowl they eventually lost to the Hurricanes in the Stanley Cup Finals whose captain Rod Brind Amour also refused to touch the Wales Trophy After the Oilers won the Campbell Bowl in captain Connor McDavid stuck to recent trends and refused to hoist the trophy Like in however the Oilers lost in the Stanley Cup Finals br Five of the last six Stanley Cup champions from the Eastern Conference have picked up the Prince of Wales Trophy The exception was the Bruins captained by Ch ra br br br Win today and we walk together forever br This quote written by Hockey Hall of Fame Philadelphia Flyers coach Fred Shero on the chalkboard in the team s locker
