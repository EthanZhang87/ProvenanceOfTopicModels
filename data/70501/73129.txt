The Edmonton Oilers are a professional ice hockey team based in Edmonton The Oilers compete in the National Hockey League NHL as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference They play their home games at Rogers Place which opened in Kris Knoblauch is the head coach as of November and Ken Holland was named general manager on May The Oilers are one of two NHL franchises based in Alberta the other being the Calgary Flames Their proximity has led to a fierce rivalry known as the Battle of Alberta br The Oilers were founded in by W D Wild Bill Hunter and Dr Chuck Allard and played its first season in as one of the twelve founding franchises of the major professional World Hockey Association WHA They were intended to be one of two WHA Alberta teams and the Calgary Broncos However when the Broncos relocated and became the Cleveland Crusaders before the WHA s first season began the team was named the Alberta Oilers They were renamed the Edmonton Oilers the following year and subsequently joined the NHL in as one of four franchises absorbed through the NHL WHA merger br After joining the NHL the Oilers went on to win the Stanley Cup on five occasions and Along with the Pittsburgh Penguins they are tied for the most championships won by any team since the NHL WHA merger as well as the most won by any team that joined the league in or after Among all NHL teams only the Montreal Canadiens have won the Stanley Cup more times since the league s expansion The Oilers also won six straight division titles from through Notably however the Oilers have not won a division title since a drought that includes their most recent two Stanley Cup wins and is the longest division title drought in all of the North American major professional sports For their overall success in the s and early s the Oilers team of this era has been honoured with dynasty status by the Hockey Hall of Fame br The Oilers began to struggle after coming up short in the Stanley Cup Finals missing the playoffs for the subsequent ten seasons The Oilers have made nineteen first round selections in the NHL Entry Draft since ten within the first ten picks overall six within the first four picks and four the first overall selections With those first overall picks Edmonton selected Taylor Hall Ryan Nugent Hopkins Nail Yakupov and Connor McDavid of these Nugent Hopkins and McDavid remained with the team helping them reach the Stanley Cup Finals only for them to lose to the Florida Panthers br br br History br br br WHA years br On November the Edmonton Oilers became of the founding WHA franchises The original owners were Wild Bill Hunter and partner Dr Charles A Chuck Allard father of Vancouver lawyer Peter Allard who a decade later also brought the SCTV sketch comedy TV series to Edmonton Hunter also owned the Edmonton Oil Kings a junior hockey franchise and founded the Canadian Major Junior Hockey League now known as the Western Hockey League WHL Hunter s efforts to bring major professional hockey to Edmonton via an expansion NHL franchise had been rebuffed by the NHL So he looked to the upstart WHA instead It was Hunter who chose the Oilers name for the new WHA franchise This was a name that had previously been used as a nickname for the Edmonton Oil Kings in the s and s Hunter also served as head coach during and seasons br After the newly founded Calgary Broncos folded before the commencement of the inaugural WHA season the Oilers were renamed the Alberta Oilers as it was planned to split their home games between Edmonton and Calgary Possibly for financial reasons or to allow for a less complicated return of the WHA to Calgary though the team ultimately played all of its home games in the Edmonton Gardens and changed its name back to the Edmonton Oilers the following year They won the first game in WHA history over the Ottawa Nationals br The Oilers drew fans with players such as defenceman and team captain Al Hamilton goaltender Dave Dryden and forwards Blair MacDonald and Bill Flett However a relatively little noticed move in had an important impact on the history of the franchise That year journeyman forward Glen Sather was acquired by the Oilers It turned out to be his final season as a player and he was named player coach late in the season moving to the bench full time after the season Sather was the coach or general manager of the Oilers for the next years br Although the Oilers on ice performance for most of the WHA s history was mediocre they remained well supported and financially stable by WHA standards In Hunter and Allard sold the franchise to Vancouver real estate tycoon Nelson Skalbania who later became notorious for flipping property both real and franchised Skalbania soon made local businessman Peter Pocklington a full partner then sold his shares to him the following year The team s fortunes improved dramatically in when Pocklington acquired underage player Wayne Gretzky as well as goaltender Eddie Mio and forward Peter Driscoll for cash from Skalbania s recently folded Indianapolis Racers br His first year of WHA experience prevented Gretzky from being an official NHL rookie his first and only WHA season saw the Oilers finish first in the WHA standings posting a league best record However Edmonton failed to win the championship as they fell to the Winnipeg Jets in the Avco World Trophy Final Dave Semenko of the Oilers scored the last goal in WHA history in the third period of the final game which they lost br The Oilers joined the NHL for along with fellow WHA teams Hartford Whalers Quebec Nordiques and the Jets following a merger agreement between the two leagues Of these four teams only Edmonton has avoided relocation and renaming the Nordiques became the Colorado Avalanche in the Jets became the Phoenix Coyotes in and the Whalers became the Carolina Hurricanes in br br br Entry into the NHL br br The Oilers lost most of the players from when the NHL held a reclamation draft of players who had bolted to the upstart league as they were allowed to protect two goaltenders and two skaters Originally Gretzky was not eligible to be protected under the rules of the time he normally would have been placed in the Entry Draft pool However Pocklington had signed him to a year personal services contract in and Pocklington used the contract to force the NHL to admit the Oilers and allow the Oilers to keep Gretzky br Upon joining the NHL the Oilers were placed in the Campbell Conference s Smythe Division They were mediocre during the regular season in their first two seasons finishing sixteenth and fourteenth respectively However because of the NHL teams made the playoffs at the time the Oilers were still able to get their young players experience in the playoffs they made the playoffs for their first years in the NHL They won only one playoff series in their first three NHL seasons though upsetting the Montreal Canadiens in Gretzky set new NHL records in for assists and points Also they still had great draft positions This allowed the Oilers to put together a young talented experienced team quickly Within three years Sather and chief scout Barry Fraser had drafted several players who would have an important role in the team s success including Mark Messier Glenn Anderson Jari Kurri Paul Coffey Kevin Lowe Grant Fuhr and Andy Moog br The Oilers improved in finishing second overall Grant Fuhr emerged as the starting goaltender and he set a rookie record by going undefeated in straight games However Gretzky stole the show by setting the single season record for goals with and becoming the first player in NHL history to score points with Gretzky s accomplishments helped the Oilers become the first team to score goals in a season a feat they accomplished for five straight years However they were upset by the Los Angeles Kings in five games Game of this series the Miracle on Manchester saw the Oilers take a lead into the third period only to lose in overtime br In the Oilers finished third overall in the NHL They advanced all the way to the Stanley Cup Finals losing only once in the process before getting swept by defending Stanley Cup champion New York Islanders During this season Gretzky Messier Anderson and Kurri all topped points with Coffey not far behind at After the season Lee Fogolin resigned as captain of the Oilers picking Gretzky as his successor br br br Dynasty years br br In the Oilers finished first overall in the NHL winning a franchise record games and earning points points ahead of the second place Islanders They were the first team to feature three players with goals Gretzky Kurri and Anderson Gretzky started strong by scoring at least a point in the first games of the season Paul Coffey became the second defenceman ever to score forty goals in a season with forty exactly The team scored a total of goals as a team an NHL record The Oilers were so determined to win the Stanley Cup that they hired Roger Neilson as a video analyst They started the playoffs strongly by sweeping the Winnipeg Jets in the Smythe Division semifinals They faced a tougher test in the Calgary Flames but they defeated them in seven games in the division finals They then swept the Minnesota North Stars in the conference finals to earn a rematch with the Islanders in the Stanley Cup Finals The Oilers split the first two games in Long Island but then won three in a row in Edmonton to become the first former WHA team to win the Stanley Cup After the series Mark Messier was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP br The following season the Oilers finished second overall in the NHL with wins and points Gretzky led the NHL in goals with and Kurri was close behind with a career high Gretzky also became the youngest player in NHL history to score one thousand points In the playoffs the Oilers swept the Kings in the opening round and Jets in round two They won the first two games of the Campbell Conference Finals against the Chicago Blackhawks but lost the next two before winning the final two and returning to the Stanley Cup Finals Edmonton lost the first game to Philadelphia but

playoff year In addition Jari Kurri tied Reggie Leach s record for most goals in a playoff year with However Gretzky won the Conn Smythe Trophy after setting the record for most points in a playoff year The Oilers were voted as the greatest NHL team of all time during the league s centennial celebrations in br br Despite off season legal issues the Oilers were again the top team in the NHL during the season with wins and points They won the inaugural Presidents Trophy the trophy given to the team with the best regular season record Gretzky Kurri and Anderson each scored goals again Kurri led the NHL in goals with finishing with points Paul Coffey set a new record for most goals in a season by a defenceman and just missed setting a new record for points by a defenceman with Bobby Orr scored in Gretzky also set records for assists and points However the Oilers failed to win their third straight Stanley Cup as the Calgary Flames defeated them in seven games in the second round In the third period of a tie during Game Steve Smith a rookie for the Oilers accidentally sent the puck into his own net on his birthday This goal stood as the series winning goal br The season saw the Oilers capture their second straight Presidents Trophy with wins and points Gretzky and Kurri were first and second in the NHL point scoring race while Messier was fourth Edmonton returned to the Stanley Cup Finals and faced the same opponent as they had in the Philadelphia Flyers The Oilers took a three games to one lead in the series However strong goaltending by Flyers rookie Ron Hextall forced a Game which the Oilers won In the post game celebration Gretzky immediately passed the Stanley Cup to Steve Smith vindicated after his costly miscue the previous season Hextall won the Conn Smythe Trophy br The Oilers began losing star players in Paul Coffey sat out the first games of the season before getting traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins Andy Moog also failed to report he was tired of being the backup goalie Moog played for the Canadian Olympic team in the Winter Olympics before getting traded to the Boston Bruins for Bill Ranford Despite the changes the Oilers placed third

Boston are counted in the NHL record books Gretzky won the Conn Smythe Trophy after leading the playoffs in scoring with points After the Cup clinching game Gretzky implored his teammates coaches trainers and others from the Oilers organization to join at centre ice for an impromptu team photo with the Stanley Cup This started a tradition since continued by every subsequent Stanley Cup champion After the season Fuhr was awarded the Vezina Trophy as the NHL s top goaltender br br br After Gretzky br br In a surprising and shocking trade Gretzky along with enforcer Marty McSorley and centre Mike Krushelnyski were traded to the Los Angeles Kings on August In exchange the Oilers received US million young star Jimmy Carson first round draft choice Martin Gelinas and the Kings first round draft picks in and The trade occurred because Pocklington did not want to risk Gretzky leaving Edmonton without getting anything in return Gretzky had converted his chance at free agency and refused which ultimately led to the trade None of this was public knowledge at the time However the Oilers and their fans were still upset Nelson Riis the New Democratic Party leader in Canada s House of Commons went so far as to ask the government to block the trade Several of the Oilers considered launching a team wide strike and even considered demanding that Pocklington sell the team br The loss of Gretzky had an immediate impact in as the Oilers were only able to finish in third place in their division Mark Messier was chosen to succeed Gretzky as captain Coincidentally the Oilers first round playoff opponent was Gretzky s Los Angeles Kings Edmonton took a commanding series lead but Gretzky and the Kings fought back to win the series winning Game in Los Angeles It was the first time since that the Oilers had been eliminated from the playoffs in the first round br The Oilers underwent more changes during the season John Muckler replaced Sather who remained general manager and became the Oilers president as head coach of the team During training camp Grant Fuhr came down with a severe case of appendicitis He missed the first ten games of the season and when he returned he suffered a shoulder injury that eventually sidelined him for the remainder of the season This marked the emergence of Bill Ranford as a starter Four games into the season Jimmy Carson decided the pressure of playing in Edmonton was too intense and he was traded to Detroit with Kevin McClelland in exchange for Petr Klima Adam Graves Joe Murphy and Jeff Sharples The Oilers improved on their previous season finishing with wins and points good for fifth place overall in the NHL Messier had goals and assists for points good for second in the NHL scoring race behind only Gretzky br In the first round the Oilers faced the Winnipeg Jets Trailing the series and trailing Game by an identical score the Oilers rallied to win the next three and take the series In the division final the Oilers met Los Angeles for the second straight season Edmonton swept the series outscoring the Kings The Oilers then met the Chicago Blackhawks in the Campbell Conference Final and fell behind in the series However the Oilers won the next three games to earn a rematch of the Stanley Cup Finals with Boston The series is remembered for Game still the longest Stanley Cup Finals game played in the modern NHL Despite being soundly outshot by the Bruins the Oilers won the game when Klima benched for much of the game and thus the only player on either team who was not exhausted scored at of the third overtime The Oilers defeated the Bruins in five games and won their first Cup without Gretzky For his superlative goaltending Bill Ranford won the Conn Smythe Trophy br br br Decline in success br The Oilers lost another important player before the season as Jari Kurri chose to play the entire season with Devils Milano Grant Fuhr was suspended for games for drug abuse The season itself was not great for the Oilers who finished with wins and points in third place in the Smythe Division In the playoffs the Oilers met the Flames in the opening round winning a thrilling series in seven games led by seven goals by Esa Tikkanen Despite injuries suffered in the series with Calgary they next defeated the Los Angeles Kings in six games However their success did not continue into the Conference Final as they lost in five games to the Minnesota North Stars br The final star players from the Oilers left before the season Fuhr and Glenn Anderson were traded to Toronto Steve Smith was traded to Chicago and Kurri was traded to Philadelphia Charlie Huddy was claimed by Minnesota in the expansion draft and Mark Messier was traded to the New York Rangers a day after the season began The Oilers even lost their head coach as John Muckler left to become head coach and general manager of the Buffalo Sabres Ted Green replaced Muckler as head coach and Kevin Lowe succeeded Messier as captain br Despite the number of changes the Oilers produced a comparable season to finishing third in the Smythe Division with wins and points In the first round of the playoffs the Oilers again met the Los Angeles Kings Again for the third time since the Gretzky trade the Oilers defeated the Kings In the next round the Oilers defeated the Vancouver Canucks in six games to return to the Campbell Conference Final for the third straight season this time facing the Chicago Blackhawks However the Oilers unexpected run in the playoffs came to a crashing halt as the Blackhawks dominated every game and swept the series br The departures of the stars from the s exposed serious deficiencies in the Oilers development system They had done a poor job of drafting during the dynasty years and the younger players had not had enough time to develop before the core of the s dynasty left the team This did not become apparent for a few years as noted above the Oilers still had enough heft to make the conference finals two years in a row However it was obvious that they were nowhere near being the powerhouse that had dominated the league in the previous half decade In they missed the playoffs for the first time as an NHL team They did not return to the postseason for four years despite the emergence of young centremen Doug Weight and Jason Arnott In the season the Oilers were placed into the Western Conference s Pacific Division br br br Return to the playoffs and seventh Cup Finals appearance br In the Oilers made the playoffs for the first time in five years thanks to stellar goaltending by Curtis Joseph In the first round they upset the Dallas Stars who had compiled the league s second best record in a seven game series The Oilers won game seven on a goal by Todd Marchant in overtime However the Oilers surprise playoff run failed to continue as the Colorado Avalanche defeated them in the next round In Joseph led the Oilers to another first round upset After Colorado took a series lead the Oilers held them scoreless for eight straight periods en route to winning the series in seven games Dallas and Edmonton met again in the second round but this time the Stars were the victors The Oilers made the playoffs in four of the next six years but they were defeated after the first round every time br br Despite their success over the past two seasons the Oilers were in trouble off the ice Owner Peter Pocklington had explored moving the Oilers to Minnesota during the s In Pocklington almost made a deal to sell the team to Leslie Alexander the owner of the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association NBA who would have moved the team to Houston Texas On March hours before the deadline to keep the team in Edmonton the Edmonton Investors Group agreed to pay million to buy the club The EIG were spearheaded by Cal Nichols who committed to retaining NHL hockey in Edmonton The deal was finalized on May and thus prevented them from being the third Canadian team to move in the s and the fourth former WHA team to move in successive years Quebec had moved in Winnipeg in and Hartford in The Oilers received support from the NHL for this very reason In the season the Oilers joined the Western Conference s Northwest Division br On November the Oilers hosted the Heritage Classic the first regular season outdoor hockey game in the NHL s history and part of the celebrations of the Oilers th season in the NHL They were defeated by the Montreal Canadiens in front of more than fans an NHL attendance record at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton The Oilers failed to make the playoffs in the season br The Oilers struggled with their small market status for several years but after the wiped out season they were aided by a Collective Bargaining Agreement CBA between the NHL owners and players This included a league wide salary cap that essentially forced all teams to conform to a budget as the Oilers had been doing for years A more reasonable conversion rate of Canadian dollar revenues to US dollar payroll in the new millennium also helped the Oilers to return to profitability Because of this Edmonton was able to acquire Chris Pronger former winner of the Hart and Norris Trophies and Michael Peca two time Frank J Selke Trophy winner before the season br br The team suffered from inconsistency during the first few months of the regular season especially in goal and offence Goaltenders Ty Conklin and Jussi Markkanen were unreliable in net and Peca also struggled with offence However in season acquisitions such as defencemen Jaroslav Spacek and Dick Tarnstrom goaltender Dwayne Roloson and left winger Sergei Samsonov helped Edmonton finish the season with points and clinch the final playoff spot in the Western Conference over Vancouver br In the first round of the playoffs the Oilers played the Detroit Red Wings winners of the Presidents Trophy Despite Detroit s much better regular season record the Oilers pulled off a six game upset for their first playoff series win since Edmonton then met the San Jose Sharks in the Conference Semifinals After trailing the series two games to none the team won the next four and became the first eighth seeded team to reach a Conference Final since the NHL changed the playoff format in There the Oilers beat the sixth seeded Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in five games claiming the Clarence S Campbell Bowl for a seventh time br In the Stanley Cup Finals Edmonton met the Carolina Hurricanes During Game the Oilers blew a lead lost Dwayne Roloson for the series after he suffered a knee injury and ultimately lost when Carolina s captain Rod Brind Amour scored the winning goal in the final minute after backup goalie Ty Conklin misplayed the puck From that game forward the Oilers used Jussi Markkanen in net Despite trailing the series and the Oilers forced a Game with a win in Game a Fernando Pisani short handed overtime winner in Game and a shutout for Markkanen in Game However the Oilers could not complete the comeback as the Hurricanes won Game to capture their first ever Stanley Cup br br br Collapse and year playoff drought br br In the off season many Oilers left the team Four days after their loss to the Hurricanes Chris Pronger surprisingly issued a trade request for personal reasons Pronger was subsequently traded to the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for Joffrey Lupul Ladislav Smid and three draft picks Several Oilers left via free agency and during the season long time Oiler Ryan Smyth was traded to the New York Islanders for Ryan O Marra Robert Nilsson and a first round pick in the NHL Entry Draft used to select Alex Plante However the Oilers were able to re sign Dwayne Roloson and Fernando Pisani Having lost so many players the Oilers posted a record in their worst record since the season and eventually finished in th place in the Western Conference Throughout the season the Oilers lost various players to injury and illness at one point they had players out of the lineup and had to rely on emergency call ups to fill their roster br In the Oilers had a record after the first half of the season They improved in the second half of the year however going in games for a final record of Nonetheless this was not enough to qualify for the playoffs as the Oilers finished three points out in ninth place During the

promotion of Kevin Lowe to the role of president of hockey operations and was replaced by Steve Tambellini br The season saw the Oilers finish with a record of but that was only good enough for th in the West However one bright spot during the season was Oilers goaltender Dwayne Roloson as he became the oldest goaltender to play NHL games in one season After the season the Oilers fired head coach Craig MacTavish and hired Pat Quinn as his replacement br Roloson left via free agency at the end of the season and the Oilers replaced him in goal with Nikolai Khabibulin The Oilers also worked out a trade with the Ottawa Senators for star right wing Dany Heatley which would have seen Dustin Penner Ladislav Smid and Andrew Cogliano go the other way but Heatley refused a trade to Edmonton and was later acquired by San Jose br Following the season Tom Renney replaced Quinn as the Oilers head coach The one advantage to such a bad season was that the Oilers were able to make the first pick in the NHL Entry Draft The Oilers selected two time Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy winner Taylor Hall from the Windsor Spitfires with their pick They used the off season to begin the rebuild of the club around their young talent Patrick O Sullivan was traded to the Phoenix Coyotes in exchange for Jim Vandermeer Robert Nilsson was bought out of his contract and Oilers captain Ethan Moreau was placed

with the Anaheim Ducks to acquire Andy Sutton for Kurtis Foster Sheldon Souray who played the entire season in the American Hockey League AHL with the Hershey Bears was bought out of the last year of

renew the contract of head coach Tom Renney The following month Edmonton selected Nail Yakupov as the first overall pick at the NHL Entry Draft A week later Ralph Krueger was named as the Oilers new

Oilers and general manager Holland announced that they had mutually decided to part ways br br br Team information br br br Jerseys br The original logo was designed by James Harvey a graphic designer working for an Albertan public relations firm called Francis Williams Johnson and Payne LTD The design featured the now traditional colours of blue and orange but reversed from their more familiar appearance in later seasons orange being the dominant colour and blue used for the trimming For the first few games of the season player names were not displayed on the uniform rather the word ALBERTA was written in that space About halfway through the season though the player names made their appearance since the Oilers had played exclusively in Edmonton These jerseys also featured the player numbers high on the shoulders rather than on the upper sleeve as is standard br In the season the jersey was changed to a blue base with orange trim The logo that appeared on programs and promotional material remained the same However the logo that appeared on the home jersey had a white oil drop on a dark orange field with the team name written in deep blue The away jersey featured an orange printed logo br When the team joined the NHL in the alternate logos were discarded giving the jersey its most famous form However the logo appeared slightly differently on a few vintages of the jersey Minor changes were also made to the numbering lettering and collar in their first few NHL campaigns From to Nike provided the Oilers sweaters br br The essential design remained untouched until when the team colours were changed to midnight blue and copper with red trim Other changes made to the jersey at that point were the removal of the shoulder bar and cuffs from the away jersey and the addition of the Rigger alternate logo to the jersey s shoulders A year later the shoulder bars were removed from the home jersey as well and the Oilers sweater design then remained stable until br In the Oilers introduced their first alternate third sweater Designed by then minority owner Todd McFarlane and his production studio the new uniforms were a radical departure from previous Oilers designs The original Oilers logo was completely absent along with copper and red midnight blue was complemented with two shades of silver grey and the primary logo was a flying set of gears with an oil drop on top Elements of the logo paid tribute to the five Stanley Cup titles and team captains to that point A silver shield bearing OILERS above a variation of the oil drop gear adorned the shoulders The jersey s sleeve numbers are located inside the white sleeve stripe br During the Heritage Classic the Oilers donned their s white uniform albeit paired with the then current navy pants br In with the NHL s switch to Reebok Edge jerseys the Oilers kept their team colours but changed the style of their jerseys Most notable about the Edge jerseys were the removal of the waistline stripes in favour of vertical piping and the sleeve stripes only appearing on the inside of the elbow panels The Rigger was retired along with the McFarlane third jersey and its associated logos In the Oilers introduced a new alternate jersey that closely resembled the blue and orange away jersey of the dynasty era For the season this jersey became the Oilers main home jersey as blue and orange became the primary team colours once again The old midnight blue and copper jersey became their alternate On June the Oilers presented their new white road jerseys at the NHL Entry Draft when they selected Ryan Nugent Hopkins first overall The midnight blue jersey remained as the third jersey before being dropped altogether in br For the season the team introduced a new alternate jersey inspired by their original WHA design with orange as a primary colour This design immediately became popular with the fanbase and Oilers home games were soon flooded with fans wearing the orange jerseys calling it the Surge of Orange in response to the Calgary Flames C of Red and Winnipeg Jets Whiteout traditions The Oilers also wore the alternate orange jerseys in the Heritage Classic br With the switch to Adidas jerseys in the season the orange jersey became the Oilers home design but with a few alterations the s era template was retained while midnight blue returned as an accent colour br To commemorate the franchise s th anniversary in the NHL the Oilers wore their classic s blue jerseys for four home games in against original Smythe Division rivals Los Angeles Kings Calgary Flames Winnipeg Jets and Vancouver Canucks Before the season the Oilers unveiled a new midnight blue alternate jersey with minimal striping and lack of white elements The Oilers wore their midnight blue alternates at home playoff games during the and Stanley Cup playoffs br In the season the Oilers released a Reverse Retro alternate uniform reviving the s white jersey but with the orange and blue switching places save for the team s crest br Beginning with the season the Oilers brought back the s blue and white jerseys while retaining the alternate midnight blue jerseys The Oilers also unveiled a second Reverse Retro uniform during the season using the alternate but with orange replacing silver in the trim as well as making the oil drop orange to match the drop in the standard logo br For the team s appearance in the Heritage Classic the Oilers wore specially designed uniforms The blue based design featured an enlarged oil drop surrounding a blue number the full team name in blue letters at the bottom in a white ribbon and orange and cream stripes The back of the uniform featured cream letters with orange accents Brown pants and gloves were worn to evoke hockey equipment of the early th century The design was inspired by Team Canada s Winter Olympics gold medal winning team represented by the Edmonton Mercurys br br br Anthem singer br From to Paul Lorieau was the Oilers anthem singer Since the Oilers anthem singer has been Robert Clark an opera singer from Sherwood Park When the Oilers compete in the playoffs Clark has sung the anthems from within the crowd Before singing the anthems public address announcer Al Stafford introduces him as The singing voice of your Edmonton Oilers br br br Mascot br br The Oilers mascot is a Canadian lynx named Hunter who was unveiled on September The choice of the Canadian lynx was because their largest place of habitat in terms of population is Alberta It was also because it was the largest vote overall The name
