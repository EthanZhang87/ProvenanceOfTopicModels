investors Their goal was to build a new entertainment and sports venue in downtown Winnipeg to help revive the city s downtown area and possibly one day bring an NHL franchise back to Winnipeg following the departure of the original Winnipeg Jets franchise to Phoenix Arizona in Ownership of the Moose was transferred to TNSE in br The seat MTS Centre later Bell MTS Place and now the Canada Life Centre was completed in fall and became the new home of the Moose replacing the Winnipeg Arena The Centre was built at a cost of million on land acquired from Osmington Incorporated a real estate firm owned by Toronto billionaire David Thomson In exchange for the land Osmington took a minority share in TNSE Chipman and Thomson through their respective holding companies now have complete ownership of TNSE br In summer TNSE opened the MTS Iceplex an arena and training complex located on the western edge of Winnipeg br TNSE realized its goal of landing an NHL franchise in May when it purchased the struggling Atlanta Thrashers subsequently relocating the club to Winnipeg and renaming it the Winnipeg Jets As a result the Moose were relocated to St John s Newfoundland and Labrador for the season and rebranded as the St John s IceCaps and became the top minor league affiliate of the Jets Although the IceCaps were successful both on and off the ice TNSE opted to return the club back to Winnipeg for the season The second incarnation of the Manitoba Moose now share the MTS Centre with their NHL parent club and are one of only two AHL teams to have this arrangement br and will be the only one after the San Jose Barracuda move to TechCU Arena for the season br br br Bringing the NHL back to Winnipeg br br In January Mark Chipman was invited to meet with NHL executives including commissioner Gary Bettman in New York to make a presentation about bringing an NHL team to Winnipeg either through expansion or relocation TNSE was not alone the NHL also met with interested parties from Houston Kansas City Seattle and Las Vegas but were most impressed by the presentation from the Winnipeg group Both Vegas and Seattle eventually got expansion teams in later years with the former getting the Golden Knights in and the latter in with the Kraken br In Bettman approached Chipman about the possibility of taking over the struggling Phoenix Coyotes The Coyotes were on the verge of declaring bankruptcy and were purchased by the league out of bankruptcy court later that year In October Chipman made a second presentation to the league about relocating a team to Winnipeg The Coyotes ownership issue remained unresolved in May As the league was not prepared to cover the team s losses for another season the league executive reached a tentative agreement to sell the Coyotes to TNSE allowing them to relocate the franchise back to Winnipeg This was intended as a back up plan as the league s first choice was to keep the team in Arizona With no other investors in place the league asked the City of Glendale to cover the Coyotes losses for the season Facing a tight deadline city council voted in favor of the deal rather than risk losing the primary tenant of their arena According to Chipman TNSE came within ten minutes of acquiring the Coyotes br After a failed bid to sell the team to Matthew Hulziser the NHL and TNSE resumed their negotiations in spring of Glendale city council decided to cover the team s losses for another year so TNSE shifted their focus on another opportunity to acquire the Atlanta Thrashers from the Atlanta Spirit group On the morning of May the sale was finalized and announced at a press conference held at the MTS Centre The sale and relocation of the team to Winnipeg was approved by the NHL Board of Governors on June Mark Chipman confirmed that the team would be known as the Jets at the NHL Entry Draft on June The Jets played their inaugural game on October in front of a sold out crowd at the MTS Centre losing against the Montreal Canadiens br Although the Jets did not qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs in their first season the team was very successful off the ice It was widely believed that the Jets playing in the league s smallest market would require assistance through the NHL s revenue sharing program to be financially viable However the team s revenues in exceeded expectations to the extent that they did not qualify According to Forbes NHL financial report the Jets generated million US in revenue during their inaugural season th best in the league and posted operating income of million According
