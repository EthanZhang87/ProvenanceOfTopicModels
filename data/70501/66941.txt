The Philadelphia Flyers are a professional ice hockey team based in Philadelphia The Flyers compete in the National Hockey League NHL as a member of the Metropolitan Division in the Eastern Conference The team plays its home games in Wells Fargo Center in the South Philadelphia Sports Complex an indoor arena they share with the Philadelphia ers of the National Basketball Association NBA and the Philadelphia Wings of the National Lacrosse League NLL Part of the NHL expansion the Flyers are the first of the expansion teams in the post Original Six era to win the Stanley Cup victorious in and again in br The Flyers all time points percentage of as of the NHL season is the fourth best in the NHL behind only the Vegas Golden Knights Montreal Canadiens and Boston Bruins Additionally the Flyers have the most appearances in the conference finals of all expansion teams appearances winning and they are second behind the St Louis Blues for the most playoff appearances out of all expansion teams out of seasons br The Flyers have played their home games on Broad Street since their inception first at the Spectrum from until and then at the Wells Fargo Center since The Flyers have had rivalries with several teams over the years Historically their biggest adversaries have been the New York Rangers with an intense rivalry stretching back to the s They have also waged lengthy campaigns against the New York Islanders in the s and s the Boston Bruins in the s and s the Washington Capitals since their days in the Patrick Division as well as the New Jersey Devils with whom they traded the Atlantic Division title every season between and and with their cross state rivals the Pittsburgh Penguins which is considered by many to be the best rivalry in the league br br br History br br br NHL in Philadelphia before br br Prior to Philadelphia had only iced a team in the NHL in the season when the financially struggling Pittsburgh Pirates relocated in as the Philadelphia Quakers playing at The Arena at th and Market Streets The club garbed in orange and black like today s Flyers was coached by J Cooper Smeaton who was to be elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame years later for his far more notable role as an NHL referee Among the young Quakers skaters in was another future Hall of Famer in year old rookie center Syd Howe The Quakers only claim to fame was to establish a single season NHL record for futility which has stood ever since by compiling a dismal record of still the fewest games ever won in a season by an NHL club The Quakers quietly suspended operations after that single dreadful campaign to again leave the Can Am League s Philadelphia Arrows as Philadelphia s lone hockey team The Quakers dormant NHL franchise was finally canceled by the league in br In a group led by Montreal and Philadelphia sportsman Len Peto announced plans to put another NHL team in Philadelphia to build a million rink to seat where the Phillies former ballpark stood at Broad and Huntingdon Streets and to acquire the franchise of the old Montreal Maroons The latter was held by the Canadian Arena Company owner of the Montreal Canadiens However Peto s group was unable to raise funding for the new arena project by the league imposed deadline and the NHL cancelled the Maroons franchise br While attending a basketball game on November at the Boston Garden Ed Snider the then vice president of the Philadelphia Eagles observed a crowd of Boston Bruins fans lining up to purchase tickets to see a last place ice hockey team He began making plans for a new arena upon hearing the NHL was looking to expand due to fears of a competing league taking hold on the West Coast and the desire for a new television contract in the United States Snider made his proposal to the league which chose the Philadelphia group including Snider Bill Putnam Jerome Schiff and Philadelphia Eagles owner Jerry Wolman over the Baltimore group br On April Putnam announced that there was going to be a name the team contest Details of the contest were released on July Snider s sister Phyllis thought that a name that fits well with Philadelphia was Flyers Instead of going through with the naming contest Ed Snider took his sister s advice The team name was announced on August br br br Early years br br The new teams were hampered by restrictive rules that kept all major talent with the Original Six teams In the NHL Expansion Draft most of the players available were either aging veterans or career minor leaguers before expansion occurred Among the Flyers selections were Bernie Parent Doug Favell Bill Sutherland Ed Van Impe Joe Watson Lou Angotti Leon Rochefort and Gary Dornhoefer Having purchased the minor league Quebec Aces the team had a distinctly francophone flavor in its early years with Parent Rochefort Andre Lacroix Serge Bernier Jean Guy Gendron Simon Nolet and Rosaire Paiement among others Beginning play in the Philadelphia Flyers made their debut on October losing on the road to the California Seals They won their first game a week later defeating the St Louis Blues on the road The Flyers made their home debut in front of a crowd of shutting out their intrastate rivals the Pittsburgh Penguins on October Lou Angotti was named the first captain in Flyers history while Rochefort was the Flyers top goal scorer after netting a total of goals With all six expansion teams grouped into the same division the Flyers were able to win the division with a sub record despite being forced to play their last seven home games on the road due to a storm blowing parts of the Spectrum s roof off However playoff success did not come so quickly as the Flyers were upset by St Louis in a first round seven game series br Angotti left the team in the off season being replaced by Van Impe as team captain Led by Van Impe and the team leading goals of Andre Lacroix the Flyers struggled during their sophomore season by finishing games under Despite their poor regular season showing in they made the playoffs They again lost to St Louis this time being dispatched in a four game sweep Not wanting his team to be physically outmatched again majority owner Ed Snider instructed general manager Bud Poile to acquire bigger tougher players While head coach Keith Allen soon after replaced Poile as general manager this mandate eventually led to one of the most feared teams to ever take the ice in the NHL The keystone of those teams was acquired when the Flyers took a chance on a year old diabetic from Flin Flon Manitoba Bobby Clarke with their second draft pick th overall in the NHL Amateur Draft Keeping to Snider s mandate the team also drafted future enforcer Dave Schultz nd overall br br By the time training camp came around it was clear that Clarke was the team s best player and he quickly became a fan favorite His goals and assists in his rookie season earned him a trip to the NHL All Star Game Despite his arrival the team struggled in recording only wins the fewest in franchise history and set the NHL team record for most ties in a season They lost the tiebreaker for the final playoff spot to the Oakland Seals missing the playoffs for the first time br On December the Flyers introduced what became one of the team s best known traditions playing a recording of Kate Smith singing God Bless America instead of The Star Spangled Banner before important games The perception was that the team was more successful on these occasions so the tradition grew The move was initially done by Flyers Promotion Director Lou Scheinfeld as a way to defray national tensions at the time of the Vietnam War Scheinfeld noticed that people regularly left their seats and walked around during the anthem but showed more respect and often sang along to God Bless America As of the close of the season the Flyers have a record of when God Bless America was sung prior to Flyers home games br In the Flyers had bounced back from the previous season and returned to the playoffs but were swept by the Chicago Blackhawks in the first round Even though the team had improved their record in his second season behind the bench head coach Vic Stasiuk was replaced by Fred Shero in the off season The team was involved in a three way trade that sent Bernie Parent to the Toronto Maple Leafs while receiving Rick MacLeish from the Boston Bruins br br br Broad Street Bullies br The team began to shift to a more aggressive style of play while also dominating on offense during this time Bobby Clarke continued to progress as he led the team in scoring in and became the first Flyer to win an NHL award the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for perseverance sportsmanship and dedication to hockey However in the season s final game the Flyers needed a win or a tie against the second year Buffalo Sabres to beat out Pittsburgh for the final playoff spot The score was tied late in the game but with just four seconds on the clock former Flyer Gerry Meehan took a shot from just inside the blue line that eluded Flyers goaltender Doug Favell The Flyers lost the head to head tiebreaker to Pittsburgh and missed the playoffs br br As it turned out it was the last time the Flyers missed the playoffs for years In the season the Flyers got rid of the mediocre expansion team label and instead became the intimidating Broad Street Bullies a nickname coined by Jack Chevalier and Pete Cafone of the Philadelphia Bulletin on January after a brawling victory over the Atlanta Flames that led Chevalier to write in his game account The image of the fightin Flyers spreading gradually around the NHL and people are dreaming up wild nicknames They re the Mean Machine the Bullies of Broad Street and Freddy s Philistines Cafone wrote the accompanying headline Broad Street Bullies Muscle Atlanta That same month Clarke was the youngest player at that time in NHL history to be named team captain replacing Ed Van Impe Rick MacLeish became the first Flyer to score goals in a season and the Flyers recorded their first winning season br An overtime goal by Gary Dornhoefer in Game turned the tide of their first round series with the Minnesota North Stars in the Flyers favor as the Flyers got their first playoff series win in six games However they were outmatched in the semi finals by the Montreal Canadiens losing in five games After the season Clarke became the first expansion team player to be awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL s most valuable player br br br Stanley Cup champions br Goaltender Bernie Parent returned to the franchise in the off season and the Flyers proved that the expansion teams could challenge the Original Six in The Bullies continued their rough and tumble ways led by Dave Schultz s penalty minutes and reached the top of the West Division with a record of The return of Parent proved to be of great benefit as he established himself as one of if not the best goaltender in the league after winning games a record which stood for years Since the Flyers along with Chicago allowed the fewest goals in the league Parent also shared the Vezina Trophy with Chicago s Tony Esposito br Come playoff time the Flyers swept the Atlanta Flames in four games in the first round In the Semi finals the Flyers faced the New York Rangers The series which saw the home team win every game went seven games Fortunately for the Flyers they had home ice advantage as they advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals by winning Game and in the process made history by becoming the first expansion team to win a playoff series over an Original Six team br br Their opponent Bobby Orr and the Boston Bruins took Game in Boston but Bobby Clarke scored an overtime goal in Game to even the series The Flyers then won Games and at home to take a series lead though Boston won Game to stave off elimination That set the stage for Game at the Spectrum Kate Smith appeared in person before Game to sing her rendition of God Bless America even miming a knockout punch after her performance The Flyers picked up the lead early when Rick MacLeish scored a first period goal Late in the game Orr hauled down Clarke on a breakaway a penalty which assured the Flyers of victory Time expired as the Flyers brought the Stanley Cup to Philadelphia for the first time Parent having shutout Boston in Game won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs br br br Stanley Cup champions br Under the season Dave Schultz topped his mark from the previous season by setting an NHL record for penalty minutes with Clarke s efforts earned him his second Hart Trophy and Parent was the lone recipient of the Vezina Trophy The Flyers as a team improved their record slightly with a mark of the best record in the NHL After a first round bye the Flyers easily swept the Toronto Maple Leafs and were presented with another New York area team in the semi finals the New York Islanders The Flyers looked to be headed toward another sweep after winning the first three games However the Islanders fought back by winning the next three games setting up a deciding seventh game The Flyers were finally able to shut the door on the Islanders winning Game br Facing Buffalo in the Stanley Cup Finals the Flyers won the first two games at home Game played in Buffalo went down in hockey lore as The Fog Game due to an unusual May heatwave in Buffalo that forced parts of the game to be played in heavy fog as Buffalo s arena lacked air conditioning The Flyers lost Games and but won Game at home in dominating fashion On the road for Game Bob Kelly scored the decisive goal and Parent pitched another shutout a playoff record fifth shutout as the Flyers repeated as Stanley Cup champions Parent also repeated as the playoff MVP winning a second consecutive Conn Smythe Trophy br br The highlight of the season had no bearing on the season standings On January at the Spectrum the Flyers as part of the Super Series played a memorable exhibition game against the Soviet Union s dominant Central Red Army team As the Bullies had put intimidation to good use the past three years the Flyers rugged style of play led the Soviets to leave the ice midway through the first period protesting a hit on Valeri Kharlamov whom Clarke had slashed on the ankle in the famous Summit Series by Ed Van Impe After some delay the Soviets returned after they were warned that they would lose their salary for the entire series The Flyers went on to win the game rather easily and were the only team to defeat the Red Army outright in the series After that win the Spectrum became known as the most intimidating building to play in and has the most intimidating fans Head coach Fred Shero proclaimed Yes we are world champions If they had won they would have been world champions We beat the hell out of a machine br The Flyers recorded the best record in team history points wise with a record of and set the record for most consecutive home wins in regulation The LCB line featuring Reggie Leach at right wing Bobby Clarke at center and Bill Barber at left wing set an NHL record for goals by a single line with Leach Clarke Barber Clarke on his way to a third Hart Trophy set a club record for points in one season with Heading into the playoffs the Flyers squeaked past Toronto in seven games and defeated Boston in five games with Game featuring a five goal outburst by Leach the Riverton Rifle to head to a third straight appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals However the Flyers did not come close to a third straight championship without an injured Bernie Parent as they ran into an up and coming dynasty in Montreal and were swept in four straight games Despite the loss Leach was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy for scoring a record goals in playoff games br Dethroned the heyday of the Broad Street Bullies began to come to an end as prior to the season tough guy Dave Schultz was traded to the Los Angeles Kings Despite a slight drop off in performance the Flyers dominated the Patrick Division with what proved to be their fourth straight division title After disposing of Toronto in six games the Flyers found themselves in the Semi finals for the fifth consecutive season Pitted against Boston the Flyers lost Games and at home in overtime and did not return home as they were swept in four straight games The Flyers lost their hold on the Patrick Division in and settled for second place After sweeping the Colorado Rockies in two games in the preliminary round the Flyers moved on to beat Buffalo in five games They then faced Boston in the semi finals for the second consecutive season and lost again this time in five games Following the season the Flyers were stunned when head coach Shero left to become general manager and head coach of the New York Rangers As compensation for Shero the Flyers received the Rangers first round draft pick in br br Bob McCammon who had just coached the Flyers first year American Hockey League AHL Maine Mariners farm club to a Calder Cup title replaced Fred Shero behind the bench After a slow start in the Flyers switched McCammon with Pat Quinn Shero s previous assistant coach who had replaced McCammon with the Mariners Adding to the problems Bernie Parent suffered a career ending eye injury The Flyers rallied under Quinn and finished in second place Matched up against the Vancouver Canucks in the preliminary round the Flyers won the series in three games The Flyers season came to an end against Fred Shero s Rangers in a five game quarterfinal loss br The Flyers began the season with a somewhat controversial move by naming Clarke a playing assistant coach and giving the captaincy to Mel Bridgman While Clarke was against this initially he accepted his new role The Flyers went undefeated for a North American professional sports record straight games before losing to the Minnesota North Stars a record that still stands to this day The streak started after the team was on October and ended on January In doing so the Flyers wrapped up the Patrick Division title with games to spare and the first overall seed in the playoffs Their regular season success continued into the playoffs as the Flyers swept a young Wayne Gretzky and his Edmonton Oilers in the first round then went on to get revenge against Fred The Fog Shero and his Rangers by beating them in five before disposing of Minnesota in five to lock up a berth in the Stanley Cup Finals Facing the Islanders for the Cup the Flyers ultimately lost in six games on Bob Nystrom s overtime Stanley Cup winning goal The result of the series was marred by controversy as the Islanders were offside on the play that resulted in their second goal but the call was not made Linesman Leon Stickle admitted after the game that he had blown the call After a tough five game preliminary round series win against the Quebec Nordiques the team s season came to an end as they lost in the quarterfinals to the Calgary Flames in seven games br br br New generation takes over br Soon the last of the Broad Street Bullies guard moved on Gone were the likes of Leach MacLeish Dupont Kelly Jimmy Watson and finally Barber and Clarke in and taking their spots over the next few seasons were young talent such as Brian Propp Tim Kerr Dave Poulin Pelle Lindbergh and Mark Howe who upon arrival instantly became the Flyers top defenseman for the next decade br br Over the next three seasons the team would suffer early playoff exits and manage to win only one playoff game during that span They were eliminated two years in a row in and by the New York Rangers and then were swept by the Washington Capitals in Following the loss to Washington Bobby Clarke retired from play and was named vice president and general manager of the team Mike Keenan a relative unknown at the time was hired in to coach the team and named second year player Dave Poulin team captain br Behind the goaltending of Pelle Lindbergh who led the NHL with wins and was the first European to win the Vezina Trophy the Flyers won a franchise record games best in the NHL during the season The Flyers rolled through the playoffs by sweeping the Rangers in three games defeating the Islanders in five and beating Quebec in six to return to the Stanley Cup Finals Though they defeated the defending Stanley Cup champion Oilers in Game by a score of at home Edmonton won the next four games in a row and the series br A month into the season Pelle Lindbergh was killed in a car accident The team rallied and showed perseverance by garnering the best record in the Wales Conference and matching their win total from the previous year Tim Kerr scored goals and the defense pairing of Howe and Brad McCrimmon led the League in plus minus a and a respectively Bob Froese filled in admirably in net for Lindbergh being named a second Team All Star and sharing the William M Jennings Trophy with teammate Darren Jensen Despite their regular season success an emotionally exhausted Flyers team lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Rangers in five games br During the season the Flyers were rejuvenated by the ascension of year old goaltender Ron Hextall In his rookie season he became the third Flyers goaltender to win the Vezina Trophy joining Parent and Lindbergh With Hextall providing the critical stops at crucial times the Flyers captured a third straight Patrick Division title and were able to gain revenge on the Rangers by beating them in six games in the division semifinals as well as surviving a tough seven game test from a gritty Islanders club in the division finals The Flyers then defeated the defending Stanley Cup champion Canadiens in a fiery six game series notable for a famous bench clearing brawl during the Game warmup to win the Wales Conference and return to the Stanley Cup Finals As was the case two seasons prior the Flyers became decimated by injuries the most significant of which was losing Kerr for the remainder of the playoffs After falling behind three games to one in the Stanley Cup Finals the Flyers rallied from a two goal deficit on the road in Game to extend the series then won Game at home with another late game comeback However they could not overcome the odds a third time and eventually succumbed to the Oilers in Game Hextall was voted playoff MVP the second time a Flyer won the Conn Smythe Trophy despite being on the losing team the other being another Manitoban Reggie Leach in br br The Flyers stumbled in finishing third in the Patrick Division after a first place finish the previous three years Hextall became the first NHL goaltender to score a goal by firing the puck into an empty net in a December game against Boston In their first round playoff series with Washington the Flyers blew a series lead as Washington forced a Game They then blew a lead in Game as Washington won in overtime It was because of this playoff collapse that Iron Mike was fired Paul Holmgren was named Keenan s replacement the first time a former Flyer was named the club s head coach br Despite finishing at the mark in the Flyers made the playoffs for the th consecutive season Facing first place Washington in the first round the Flyers pulled off the upset in six games Ron Hextall managed to score another empty net goal in the waning moments of Game becoming the first NHL goalie to score a goal in the playoffs The Flyers then defeated Pittsburgh in seven games to make the Wales Conference Finals before bowing out to Montreal in six games br The season got off to a bad start for the Flyers and continued to get worse Hextall missed all but eight games due to suspension for attacking Chris Chelios at the end of the Montreal playoff series the previous spring contract holdout issues and injury Holmgren replaced Dave Poulin as captain in December with Ron Sutter which led to Poulin s and later that season Brian Propp s trade to Boston As a result the Flyers missed the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time since Bobby Clarke having been with the Flyers organization since he was drafted in was fired and replaced as general manager by Russ Farwell br Ron Hextall continued to be hampered by injuries during the season He only played in games and as a result the Flyers missed the playoffs for the second consecutive year finishing fifth in the Division and three points short of a playoff spot after a late season collapse br br br Rebuilding years br br Prior to the season the Flyers acquired Rod Brind Amour from St Louis Brind Amour led the Flyers in goals assists and points in his first season with the club With Ron Sutter gone to St Louis in the Brind Amour trade Rick Tocchet was named team captain As the Flyers continued to flounder Paul Holmgren was fired midway through the season and replaced by Bill Dineen father of Flyer Kevin Dineen On February the Flyers and Pittsburgh made a major five player deal which featured Tocchet who never grew comfortably into the role of captain heading to Pittsburgh and Mark Recchi coming to Philadelphia Recchi recorded points in his first games as a Flyer but the team missed the playoffs for the third consecutive year due in large part to an awful road record With Tocchet traded the Flyers remained without a captain until Kevin Dineen was named to the post in and instead went with three alternate captains br In June the Flyers persuaded Bobby Clarke to return to the team as senior vice president after Jay Snider won the hard fought arbitration battle for first overall pick Eric Lindros against the Rangers It was determined that Quebec had made a deal with the Flyers before making a deal with the Rangers In order to acquire Lindros rights the Flyers parted with six players trading Steve Duchesne Peter Forsberg Ron Hextall Kerry Huffman Mike Ricci Chris Simon a first round draft pick Jocelyn Thibault a first round draft pick Nolan Baumgartner and million to Quebec While Lindros became a preeminent star in Philadelphia the trade proved heavily lopsided in favor of the Nordiques soon to become the Colorado Avalanche providing the core of their two Stanley Cup teams and an unprecedented eight straight division championships with Forsberg becoming a franchise player br The trio of Lindros Recchi and Brent Fedyk formed the Crazy Eights line in Lindros first two years in the NHL the eights being the player s jersey numbers and respectively In Recchi set the franchise record for points in a season with goals and assists and Lindros scored goals in games After struggling early the Flyers made a run at the playoffs but came four points short of the last spot Head coach Bill Dineen was fired at the season s end while Clarke left town again to become general manager of the expansion Florida Panthers br For Terry Simpson was hired as the new head coach in hopes of returning the Flyers to the playoffs after four consecutive off years Mark Recchi recorded points goals and assists and Lindros goals and assists while Mikael Renberg set a Flyers rookie record with points Offense was generated yet the Flyers still failed to clinch a playoff berth again falling four points short of the final playoff spot Jay Snider stepped down as president forcing his father Ed Snider to take over day to day operations br br br Return to contention br The elder Snider had decided he had seen enough of Farwell as general manager and began courting Bobby Clarke to leave his general manager post with Florida to return to Philadelphia Farwell s last move as general manager was firing Simpson after a lackluster performance Clarke returned to the general manager position prior to the lockout shortened season and immediately began putting his stamp on the team New head coach Terry Murray replaced Kevin Dineen as team captain with Lindros prior to the start of training camp In order to shore up the defense Ron Hextall was re acquired from the Islanders and high scoring winger Recchi was traded to Montreal for Eric Desjardins Gilbert Dionne and John LeClair early in the abbreviated season br br br Legion of Doom br The Flyers initially struggled out of the gate going only through their first games while being outscored Lindros and LeClair then teamed with Renberg to form the Legion of Doom line a mix of scoring talent and physical intimidation In their games including the victory on February against the New Jersey Devils the Flyers went and outscored their opponents en route Lindros tied Jaromir Jagr for the regular season scoring lead though Jagr won the Art Ross Trophy with more goals and captured the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league s MVP The playoff drought came to an end as the Flyers won their first division title in eight years and clinched the second seed in the Eastern Conference After dispatching Buffalo in five and sweeping the defending Stanley Cup champion Rangers the Flyers were upset in the Eastern Conference Finals to the eventual Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils in six games br Lindros eclipsed the point mark for the first time in gathering points and LeClair scored goals as the Flyers repeated as Atlantic Division champs and clinched the top seed in the East Facing the eighth seeded Tampa Bay Lightning the Flyers dropped two of the first three games They rallied by winning three straight games to win the series After taking two of the first three games against the Florida Panthers in the second round the Flyers were defeated in overtime in Game and double overtime in Game An upstart Florida club with stellar goaltending from John Vanbiesbrouck ended the Flyers season in Game br br The Flyers said goodbye to the Spectrum and prepared to open a new arena the CoreStates Center for the next season The season started off slowly as Lindros missed games but LeClair still managed to score goals for the second consecutive year while the mid season acquisition of defenseman Paul Coffey gave the Flyers a veteran presence Despite finishing just one point shy of a third straight Atlantic Division title the Flyers blitzed their way through the first three rounds of the playoffs dominating Pittsburgh Buffalo and the Rangers all in five games apiece to win the Eastern Conference championship and clinch a berth in the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since Despite having home ice advantage the Flyers were swept in four straight games by the Detroit Red Wings The goaltending tandem of Hextall and Garth Snow fared poorly in the Finals as both conceded soft goals and Murray s strategy of alternating starters in goal was criticized After Game which was a loss Murray blasted his team in a closed door meeting and then described to the media that the Flyers were in a choking situation a remark which angered his players and likely cost Murray his job as his contract was not renewed In July Mikael Renberg was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for Chris Gratton thus splitting up the famed Legion of Doom line The trio of Lindros LeClair and Renberg scored a combined total of points in regular season games br The man picked to replace Murray as coach Wayne Cashman was deemed ill suited for the job as the Flyers played inconsistently throughout the season With games to go in the season Roger Neilson took over as coach while Cashman was retained as an assistant John LeClair was able to score at least goals for the third consecutive year netting the first time for an American born player and goaltender Sean Burke was acquired at the trade deadline Burke proved ineffective in net as the Flyers were eliminated in the first round by Buffalo in five games br In the off season the Flyers went looking for a new goaltender Burke was let go and Hextall was about to enter his final season as a backup They chose to sign former Panther John Vanbiesbrouck as the starting goaltender The season was marred by a life threatening injury sustained by Eric Lindros on April Fools Day during a game against the Nashville Predators a season ending injury later diagnosed as a collapsed lung Up until that point Lindros was having an MVP type season with goals and assists in games Without Lindros the Flyers had trouble scoring in the playoffs even after having re acquired Mark Recchi at the trade deadline Although Vanbiesbrouck allowed goals to Joseph s allowed the Flyers lost their first round series with Toronto in six games br The season was one of the most tumultuous seasons in franchise history and the tumult actually started three months prior to the start of the regular season In the span of a few days in July longtime broadcaster Gene Hart died due to illness and defenseman Dmitri Tertyshny coming off his rookie season was fatally injured in a freak boating accident Head coach Roger Neilson was diagnosed with bone cancer forcing him to step aside in February to undergo treatment so assistant coach Craig Ramsay took over as interim coach for the rest of the season Neilson later recovered but was informed that he would not return In January longtime Flyer and fan favorite Rod Brind Amour was traded to the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for Keith Primeau with the intention of acquiring a big center to complement Lindros Meanwhile the strife between Flyers management particularly Clarke and Lindros continued to worsen Less than a month after Ramsay took over Lindros suffered his second concussion of the season He played several games after the initial hit and afterwards criticized the team s training staff for failing to initially diagnose the concussion after it happened It was after this that the Flyers organization decided to strip Lindros of the captaincy on March and name defenseman Eric Desjardins the team s captain br br With Lindros out indefinitely the Flyers rallied to overcome the distractions and a point deficit in the standings to win the Atlantic Division and the top seed in the East on the last day of the regular season They easily defeated their first round opponent Buffalo in five games Primeau s goal in the fifth overtime of Game against the team s second round opponent Pittsburgh turned that series in the Flyers favor as they won in six games coming back from a series deficit After dropping Game to New Jersey in the Eastern Conference Finals the Flyers won three straight games to take a series lead However New Jersey won game In Game Lindros returned to the lineup for the first time since March in another losing effort Early in Game Lindros was handed another concussion and leaving the Philadelphia crowd deflated after being on the receiving end of a controversial hit by Scott Stevens Without him the Flyers lost the decisive game It was the second time in franchise history the team lost a series after being up Lindros never again wore a Flyers uniform as he sat out the following season awaiting a trade br Craig Ramsay was named the permanent head coach as Neilson was not asked to return for the which became a matter of some controversy Ramsay lasted only until December when he was replaced by former Flyer great Bill Barber Brian Boucher who as a rookie backstopped the Flyers playoff run the previous season could not duplicate his performance and lost the starting goaltending job to Roman Cechmanek a former star in the Czech Republic The performance of Cechmanek worthy of a Vezina nomination along with Bill Barber winning the Jack Adams Award as head coach of the year helped the Flyers stay afloat but they lost in the first round of the playoffs to Buffalo in six games br In the off season the Flyers re vamped their lineup by signing Jeremy Roenick and finally trading Eric Lindros to the Rangers for Kim Johnsson Jan Hlavac Pavel Brendl and a third round draft pick Stefan Ruzicka Desjardins stepped down as team captain eight games into the season and was replaced by Primeau The Flyers began with high expectations and with Roenick leading the team in scoring the Flyers finished with an Atlantic Division title The power play was one of the NHL s worst however so Adam Oates the third leading point producer in the League at the time was acquired from Washington at the NHL trade deadline However it was of no benefit as the Flyers could not muster much offense scoring only two goals in their five game first round playoff loss to the Ottawa Senators It turned out there was much discontent in the locker room as Bill Barber was fired The Flyers hired a proven winner when they turned to former Dallas Stars and Stanley Cup winning head coach Ken Hitchcock br br In Roman Cechmanek had a goals against average GAA and the Flyers acquired Sami Kapanen and Tony Amonte prior to the trade deadline however they fell one point short of a second straight Atlantic Division title Consequently the Flyers endured a long brutal seven game first round match up with Toronto that featured three multiple overtime games all in Toronto After winning Game the Flyers fought Ottawa in the second round with equal vigor as they split the first four games of the series with Cechmanek earning shutouts in both wins His inconsistency showed through however as he allowed ten goals in the final two games and Ottawa advanced in six games He was later traded to Los Angeles for a second round draft pick during the off season despite having the second best GAA in the League over his three years in Philadelphia br Free agent goaltender Jeff Hackett was signed from Boston to replace Cechmanek and challenge backup Robert Esche for the starter s spot in but he was forced to retire in February due to vertigo During the course of the season serious injuries suffered by both Roenick broken jaw and Primeau concussion in February forced the Flyers to trade for Chicago s Alexei Zhamnov who filled in well and kept the Flyers afloat On March the Flyers set an NHL record in a game against Ottawa where they set a combined record of penalty minutes in a single game Esche entrenched himself as starter and remained in that position even after the Flyers re acquired Sean Burke from the Phoenix Coyotes as the Flyers clinched the Atlantic Division title over New Jersey on the last day of the season Though solid in net Esche s performance was trumped by the play of captain Keith Primeau in the playoffs Primeau led the Flyers past the defending Stanley Cup champion Devils in five Toronto in six on their way to the Eastern Conference Finals and a match up with Tampa Bay Despite winning Game on the late game heroics of Primeau and winger Simon Gagne the Flyers came up short once again losing Game in Tampa br br br From highs to lows br With the NHL preparing for looming labor unrest the Flyers let their leading scorer Mark Recchi leave for Pittsburgh during the off season Unsure about the future the Flyers were unsure about his worth The NHL lockout forced the cancellation of the NHL season The Flyers were one of the more active teams once the NHL lockout came to an end Replacing the high profile names of Amonte LeClair and Roenick were superstar Peter Forsberg along with defensemen Derian Hatcher and Mike Rathje as well as several players from the Calder Cup winning Philadelphia Phantoms When all was said and done the team had experienced a turnover of nearly two thirds of the roster br The Flyers began the NHL season with lofty expectations Despite being hampered by injuries prior to and during the season the Flyers lived up to those expectations in the first half of the season reaching the top of the league standings in January while simultaneously holding a point lead in the Atlantic Division The Deuces Wild line of Forsberg Gagne and Mike Knuble recorded and points respectively while Gagne with Forsberg feeding him scored a career high of goals However the injuries began to accumulate and take their toll the most crippling of which was Keith Primeau s season ending concussion Derian Hatcher served as interim captain for the remainder of the season The Flyers had been first in the league prior to the Olympic break where an injury to Forsberg occurred All told the Flyers were third in the NHL with man games lost to injury tops amongst playoff teams The second half of the regular season was defined by a record hovering around sending the Flyers on a steady slide in the standings The Flyers fell short of an Atlantic Division title finishing second by tie breaker to New Jersey drawing the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference and a first round match up with fourth seeded Buffalo The Flyers lost the series in six games br br The Flyers th anniversary season turned out to be the worst in franchise history The Flyers traded Michal Handzus to Chicago lost Kim Johnsson to free agency and Eric Desjardins and team captain Keith Primeau retired in the off season Peter Forsberg replaced Primeau as team captain but a chronic foot injury developing in last season s Olympics had him in and out of the lineup throughout the season and limited his effectiveness Eight games into the regular season and with a record of general manager Bobby Clarke resigned and head coach Ken Hitchcock was fired Assistant coach John Stevens replaced Hitchcock and assistant general manager Paul Holmgren took on Clarke s responsibilities on an interim basis br The changes did little to improve the Flyers fortunes in as setting franchise records for futility became the norm They had several multiple game losing streaks including a franchise

for two separate incidents A start in October and a January run had the Flyers near the top of both the Division and Conference standings However a disastrous ten game losing streak in February reminiscent of such a streak the previous season nearly derailed the Flyers year An run in March coupled with two huge wins over New Jersey and Pittsburgh over the final weekend of the regular season put the Flyers back in the playoffs as the sixth seed setting up a first round matchup with Washington After taking a three game to one lead over the Capitals Washington then won Games and to force a

regular season and playoffs with a knee injury and Steve Downie was traded to Tampa Bay with Steve Eminger whom they had previously acquired in a trade with Washington prior to the season for defenseman Matt Carle Two pleasant surprises were the emergence of rookie center Claude Giroux and defenseman Luca Sbisa who was drafted by the Flyers in June with the th overall pick acquired from

last day of the regular season the Flyers slipped to the fifth seed and lost home ice advantage in their first round series with Pittsburgh Pittsburgh dominated the Flyers in Game and despite a better effort by the Flyers in Game Pittsburgh came to Philadelphia with a series lead The Flyers were the better team in Games and but Pittsburgh gained a split in Philadelphia and took a series lead After a decisive win in Game the Flyers jumped out to a lead in Game but promptly fell victim to the inconsistencies that plagued the team all season and gave up five unanswered goals in a season ending

however costing the Flyers Joffrey Lupul Luca Sbisa and the Flyers first round draft picks in both and The season began in earnest though it soon unraveled with mediocre play that cost head coach John Stevens his job in December Peter Laviolette was hired as his replacement in order to reinstitute accountability and restore success to the Flyers though the results were not immediate the Flyers suffered a stretch immediately following his arrival Injuries took a major toll on the Flyers with Blair Betts Daniel Briere Jeff Carter Simon Gagne and Kimmo Timonen all missing significant numbers of games though no position was nearly affected as much with injuries as goaltending Emery suffered a hip injury in December played sporadically afterwards and ultimately underwent season ending surgery Boucher suffered a hand injury shortly thereafter which allowed journeyman goaltender Michael Leighton to step in and make an immediate impact Leighton went in his first ten starts including a tough overtime loss in the Winter Classic to Boston at Fenway Park on New Year s Day However Leighton was forced out of the line up in March with a high ankle sprain necessitating Boucher s return as starter All told seven different goaltenders suited up for the Flyers at various points throughout the year Mediocre play down the stretch forced the Flyers into a do or die shootout with the Rangers in the final game of the regular season Boucher stopped final shooter Olli Jokinen to clinch the seventh seed in the East and a first round matchup with New Jersey br Boucher and the Flyers consistently outplayed Martin Brodeur and New Jersey and pulled off the upset in five games However the victory was costly as Carter suffered a broken foot and Gagne a broken toe in Game while Ian

found themselves in a series deficit Gagne returned in Game and scored in overtime to force a Game which the Flyers won convincingly Boucher suffered MCL sprains during the game in both knees which

Sox in as the only sports teams to win a playoff series after trailing br In the Eastern Conference Finals the Flyers had home ice advantage as they faced eighth seeded Montreal Leighton became the first Flyers netminder to record three shutouts in a series and Carter and Laperriere returned to the lineup as the Flyers won the Eastern Conference Championship in five games advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since to face the Chicago Blackhawks Dropping two close games in Chicago the Flyers returned home to win Game in overtime and Game to even the series A convincing win by Chicago in Game however put the Flyers one game away from elimination A late Scott Hartnell goal in Game forced overtime but Patrick Kane scored just over four minutes into overtime to

Flyers led both the Atlantic Division and Eastern Conference for the majority of the season and challenged Vancouver for the overall NHL lead Kris Versteeg was brought in from Toronto to add additional offense for the stretch drive and playoffs However lackluster play throughout March and April coupled with a broken hand suffered by Chris Pronger in late February that ended his regular season cost the Flyers the top seed in the East during the last week of the regular season although the Flyers hung on to win their first Atlantic Division title since and clinched the second seed in the East br The Flyers drew Buffalo in the first round Bobrovsky played well in a Game loss but was replaced in Game by Boucher who held on for a Flyers win Boucher played well in a Game win and a Game loss but was replaced himself in a favor of Leighton during a bad first period in Game which Buffalo won in overtime Pronger returned to the lineup and Leighton started Game but was replaced by Boucher after a poor first period though nonetheless the Flyers went on to win in overtime and forced a Game which Boucher started The Flyers dominated Buffalo and became the first team to win a playoff series starting three different goaltenders since The Flyers then drew a rematch with the Boston Bruins in the second round Boston dominated the Flyers in Game where Boucher was again replaced this time by Bobrovsky Pronger again left the lineup with an undisclosed injury while Boston won Game in overtime and again dominated the Flyers in Game to take a series lead Bobrovsky started Game but there was no comeback like in their previous meeting as Boston completed the sweep The Flyers tied an NHL record with seven playoff in game goalie changes and were the only NHL team not to record a shutout in either the regular season or playoffs br Flyers general manager Paul Holmgren made two franchise altering trades within the span of an hour on June trading Mike Richards to the Los

up for the Flyers during the season with the play of Couturier Schenn and Matt Read standing out impressively br The Flyers drew Pittsburgh in the first round of the playoffs a series in which the two teams combined for an NHL record goals in the first four games and a total of penalty minutes in an intense fight filled series The Flyers pulled off the upset in six games against a heavily favored Pittsburgh team In the second round against New Jersey the Flyers were heavily favored to win the series but the Flyers run and gun style of play was stymied by the Devils forechecking and defense and
