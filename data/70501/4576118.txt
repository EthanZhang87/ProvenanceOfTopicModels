The Western Conference French Conf rence de l Ouest is one of two conferences in the National Hockey League NHL used to divide teams Its counterpart is the Eastern Conference br br br History br Originally named the Clarence Campbell Conference or Campbell Conference for short it was created in when the NHL realigned its teams into two conferences and four divisions Because the new conferences and divisions had little to do with North American geography geographical references were removed The conferences and divisions were re aligned in to better reflect the geographical locations of the teams but the existing names were retained with the Campbell Conference becoming the conference for the NHL s westernmost teams br The names of conferences and divisions were changed in to reflect their geographic locations Then new NHL commissioner Gary Bettman made the change to help non hockey fans better understand the game as the National Basketball Association National Football League and Major League Baseball all use geographic based names for their conferences and divisions However the trophy awarded to the conference champion the Clarence S Campbell Bowl retains some connection to the heritage of the league In following the lockout the league changed the Western Conference logo along with the Eastern Conference and NHL logos to its current form br Along with the Eastern Conference the Western Conference was temporarily abolished for the NHL season after the COVID pandemic forced a realignment of the League to preclude the need for teams to regularly cross the Canada United States border For the four Canadian teams competed in the newly formed North Division while the five remaining Pacific Division teams from the U S along with three American teams from the Central Division formed a re constituted West Division The other three remaining Central Division teams stayed in that Division and were joined by five American teams from the Eastern Conference These changes have been reversed for the season br br br Divisions br The Campbell Conference originally consisted of the Patrick Division and the Smythe Division The realignment moved the Patrick Division to the Prince of Wales Conference and added that conference s Norris Division instead When the names of conferences and divisions were changed in the Western Conference s divisions became the Central and Pacific Realignment in added a third division the Northwest br The Northwest Division was dissolved in Its American teams and Winnipeg joined the Central while the rest of the Canadian teams returned to the Pacific With this realignment the Central Division is based almost entirely in the Central Time Zone the only exception being the Colorado Avalanche who are in the Mountain Time Zone and the Pacific Division is based entirely within the Mountain and Pacific Time Zones br On June the NHL awarded Las Vegas an expansion team that began play in and thus brought the total of Western Conference teams to The NHL awarded a franchise to the city of Seattle on December The Seattle Kraken began playing in the season increasing the Western Conference to teams and the Arizona Coyotes moved to the Central Division from the Pacific Division to balance out the conference In the Coyotes suspended operations and a new team in Utah replaced them In the event the Coyotes build a new stadium suitable for NHL play by the Arizona Coyotes would essentially return to the Western Conference creating a new team NHL in the process Conversely should they fail to establish a new suitable arena for play by then the teams with Utah taking Arizona s place will stand as is and the Coyotes franchise will likely fold br br br Champions and playoffs br br The NHL s playoff system has changed over the years Prior to the NHL had a unique playoff system compared to the NFL NBA and MLB Playoff teams were seeded regardless of conference As a result two teams from the same conference could meet in the Stanley Cup Finals as happened in and Under this system the Campbell Conference champion and therefore the winner of the Clarence S Campbell Bowl was the team that finished with the best regular season record in the conference br Ever since the introduction of the Conference finals in the Campbell Bowl has been presented to the Campbell Western Conference playoff champions br In the playoff system introduced in the top four teams in each division made the playoffs The first round winners met in the Division finals and the division final winners met in the conference finals In this format the division standings tended to be very static In the Norris Division for example the Chicago Blackhawks and St Louis Blues never missed the postseason under this format while the Minnesota North Stars only missed three times In the Smythe Division the Calgary Flames and the Edmonton Oilers missed the playoffs only once and the original Winnipeg Jets twice In both cases this usually left the other two teams to fight it out for the last playoff spot In most years this format resulted in the strongest teams during the regular season being forced to meet in the first or second round rather than the conference finals For instance in Winnipeg finished with the fourth best record in the entire league only to be forced to meet fifth best Calgary in the first round before losing to second best Edmonton in the division finals br From to the top eight teams in each conference made the playoffs with the division winners being guaranteed the top seeds top two from to top three from to and home ice in the first round regardless of record Unique between and a series involving a Central Division team and a Pacific Division team was a rotation instead of the normal format with the higher seeded team having the option of starting play at home or on the road br A new playoff format was introduced as part of the realignment Under the new postseason system that was first used during the Stanley Cup playoffs the top three teams in each division make the playoffs with wild cards in each conference for a total of playoff teams from each conference br br br
