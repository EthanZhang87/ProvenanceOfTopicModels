the Atlantic Ocean the state s eastern border with South Carolina runs up the Savannah River northwest to its origin at the confluence of the Tugaloo and Seneca Rivers It then continues up the Tugaloo originally Tugalo and into the Chattooga River its most significant tributary These bounds were decided in the Treaty of Beaufort and tested in the U S Supreme Court in the two Georgia v South Carolina cases in and br The border then takes a sharp turn around the tip of Rabun County at latitude N though from this point it diverges slightly south due to inaccuracies in the original survey conducted in This northern border was originally the Georgia and North Carolina border all the way to the Mississippi River until Tennessee was divided from North Carolina and the Yazoo companies induced the legislature of Georgia to pass an act approved by the governor in to sell the greater part of Georgia s territory presently comprising Alabama and Mississippi br The state s western border runs in a straight line south southeastward from a point southwest of Chattanooga to meet the Chattahoochee River near West Point It continues downriver to the point where it joins the Flint River the confluence of the two forming Florida s Apalachicola River the southern border goes almost due east and very slightly south in a straight line to the St Mary s River which then forms the remainder of the boundary back to the ocean br The water boundaries are still set to be the original thalweg of the rivers Since then several have been inundated by lakes created by dams including the Apalachicola Chattahoochee Flint point now under Lake Seminole br An survey erroneously placed Georgia s border with Tennessee one mile km south of the intended location of the th parallel north State legislators

the North Georgia mountains receives moderate to heavy precipitation which varies from inches mm in central Georgia to approximately inches mm around the northeast part of the state The degree to which the weather of a certain region of Georgia is subtropical depends on the latitude its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico and the elevation The latter factor is felt chiefly in the

a recent example being Hurricane Michael as well as hurricanes that come close to the Georgia coastline brushing the coast on their way north without ever making landfall Hurricane Matthew of and Hurricane Dorian of did just that br br Due to anthropogenic climate change the climate of Georgia is warming This is already causing major disruption for example from sea level rise Georgia is more

every incorporated town is legally a city Georgia does not provide for townships or independent cities though there have been bills proposed in the Legislature to provide for townships it does allow consolidated city county governments by local referendum All of Georgia s second tier cities except Savannah have now formed consolidated city county governments by referendum Columbus in Athens Augusta and Macon Augusta and Athens have excluded one or more small incorporated towns within their consolidated boundaries Columbus and Macon eventually absorbed all smaller incorporated entities within their consolidated boundaries The small town of Cusseta adopted a consolidated city county government after it merged with unincorporated Chattahoochee County in Three years later in the town of Georgetown consolidated with the rest of Quitman County br There is no true metropolitan government in Georgia though the Atlanta Regional Commission ARC and Georgia Regional Transportation Authority do provide some services and the ARC must approve all major land development projects in the Atlanta metropolitan area br br br Elections br br Georgia voted Republican in six consecutive presidential elections from to a streak that was broken when the state went for Democratic candidate Joe Biden in br Until Georgia s state government had the longest unbroken record of single party dominance by the Democratic Party of any state in the Union This record was established largely due to the disenfranchisement of most blacks and many poor whites by the state in its constitution and laws in the early th century Some elements such as requiring payment of poll taxes and passing literacy tests prevented blacks from registering to vote their exclusion from the political system lasted into the s and reduced the Republican Party to a non competitive status in the early th century br White Democrats regained power after Reconstruction due in part to the efforts of some using intimidation and violence but this method came into disrepute In shortly before Georgia adopted a disfranchising constitutional amendment in blacks comprised of the state s population br The whites dealt with this problem of potential political power by the amendment which in practice disenfranchised blacks and poor whites nearly half of the state population It required that any male at least years of age wanting to register to vote must also be of good character and able to pass a test on citizenship be able to read and write provisions of the U S and Georgia constitutions or own at least forty acres of land or in property Any Georgian who had fought in any war from the American Revolution through the Spanish American War was exempted from these additional qualifications More importantly any Georgian descended from a veteran of any of these wars also was exempted Because by many white Georgia males were grandsons of veterans or owned the required property the exemption and the property requirement basically allowed only well to do whites to vote The qualifications of good character citizenship knowledge literacy all determined subjectively by white registrars and property ownership were used to disqualify most blacks and poor whites preventing them from registering to vote The voter rolls dropped dramatically In the early th century Progressives promoted electoral reform and reducing the power of ward bosses to clean up politics Their additional rules such as the eight box law continued to effectively close out people who were illiterate White one party rule was solidified br For more than years from to Georgians nominated and elected only white Democratic governors and white Democrats held the majority of seats in the General Assembly Most of the Democrats elected throughout these years were Southern Democrats who were fiscally and socially conservative by national standards This voting pattern continued after the segregationist period br Legal segregation was ended by passage of federal legislation in the s According to the census the proportion of Georgia s population that was African American was hundreds of thousands of blacks had left the state in the Great Migration to the North and Midwest New white residents arrived through migration and immigration Following support from the national Democratic Party for the civil rights movement and especially civil rights legislation of and most African American voters as well as other minority voters have largely supported the Democratic Party in Georgia br In incumbent moderate Democratic Governor Roy Barnes was defeated by Republican Sonny Perdue a state legislator and former Democrat While Democrats retained control of the State House they lost their majority in the Senate when four Democrats switched parties They lost the House in the election Republicans then controlled all three partisan elements of the state government br Even before the state had become increasingly supportive of Republicans in Presidential elections It has supported a Democrat for president only four times since In and native son Jimmy Carter carried the state in the former Arkansas governor Bill Clinton narrowly won the state and in Joe Biden narrowly carried the state Generally Republicans were strongest in the predominantly white suburban especially the Atlanta suburbs and rural portions of the state Many of these areas were represented by conservative Democrats in the state legislature well into the st century One of the most conservative of these was U S Congressman Larry McDonald former head of the John Birch Society who died when the Soviet Union shot down KAL near Sakhalin Island Democratic candidates have tended to win a higher percentage of the vote in the areas where black voters are most numerous as well as in the cities among liberal urban populations especially Atlanta and Athens and the central and southwestern portion of the state br The ascendancy of the Republican Party in Georgia and in the South in general resulted in Georgia U S House of Representatives member Newt Gingrich being elected as Speaker of the House following the election of a Republican majority in the House in Gingrich served as Speaker until when he resigned in the aftermath of the loss of House seats held by members of the GOP Gingrich mounted an unsuccessful bid for president in the election but withdrew after winning only the South Carolina and Georgia primaries br In Democrat Jim Martin ran against incumbent Republican Senator Saxby Chambliss Chambliss failed to acquire the necessary percent of votes due to a Libertarian Party candidate receiving the remainder of votes In the runoff election held on December Chambliss became the second Georgia Republican to be reelected to the U S Senate br In the elections the governorship remained under control by a Republican by votes against a Democrat Stacey Abrams Republicans lost eight seats in the Georgia House of Representatives winning while Democrats gained ten winning Republicans lost two seats in the Georgia Senate winning seats while Democrats gained two seats winning and five Democrat U S Representatives were elected with Republicans winning nine seats one winning with just votes over the Democratic challenger and one seat being lost br In the three presidential elections up to and including the Republican candidate has won Georgia by approximately five to eight points over the Democratic nominee at least once for each election being narrower than margins recorded in some states that have flipped within that timeframe such as Michigan Ohio and Wisconsin This trend led to the state narrowly electing Democrat Joe Biden for president in and it coming to be regarded as a swing state br In a study Georgia was ranked as th on the Cost of Voting Index with only Texas ranking higher In Georgia swung substantially back to the right towards Republicans with incumbent Republican Governor Brian Kemp winning reelection by over Democrat Stacey Abrams with a raw vote margin of over votes in the Georgia gubernatorial election The largest amount since the early s and every other Republican statewide getting elected by a margin of victory br br br Politics br br During the s and s Georgia made significant changes in civil rights and governance As in many other states its legislature had not reapportioned congressional districts according to population from to after the census Problems of malapportionment in the state legislature where rural districts had outsize power in relation to urban districts such as Atlanta s were corrected after the U S Supreme Court ruling in Wesberry v Sanders The court ruled that congressional districts had to be reapportioned to have essentially equal populations br A related case Reynolds v Sims required state legislatures to end their use of geographical districts or counties in favor of one man one vote that is districts based upon approximately equal populations to be reviewed and changed as necessary after each census These changes resulted in residents of Atlanta and other urban areas gaining political power in Georgia in proportion to their populations From the mid s the voting electorate increased after African Americans rights to vote were enforced under civil rights law br Economic growth through this period was dominated by Atlanta and its region It was a bedrock of the emerging New South From the late th century Atlanta attracted headquarters and relocated workers of national companies becoming more diverse liberal and cosmopolitan than many areas of the state br In the st century many conservative Democrats including former U S Senator and governor Zell Miller decided to support Republicans The state s then socially conservative bent resulted in wide support for measures such as restrictions on abortion In a state constitutional amendment banning same sex marriages was approved by of voters However after the United States Supreme Court issued its ruling in Obergefell v Hodges all Georgia counties came into full compliance recognizing the rights of same sex couples to marry in the state br In presidential elections Georgia voted solely Democratic in every election from to In it was one of only a handful of states to vote for Republican Barry Goldwater over Democrat Lyndon B Johnson In it did not vote for either of the two parties but rather the American Independent Party and its nominee Alabama Governor George Wallace In the state returned to Republicans as part of a landslide victory for Richard Nixon In and it voted for Democrat and former Georgia governor Jimmy Carter The state returned to Republicans in and before going Democratic once again in For every election between that year and Georgia voted heavily Republican in line with many of its neighbors in the Deep South In it voted Democratic for the first time in years aiding Joe Biden in his defeat of incumbent Republican Donald Trump br Prior to Republicans in state federal and congressional races had seen decreasing margins of victory and many election forecasts had ranked Georgia as a toss up state or with Biden as a very narrow favorite Concurrent with the presidential election were two elections for both of Georgia s United States Senate seats one of which being a special election due to the resignation of Senator Johnny Isakson and the other being regularly scheduled After no candidate in either race received a majority of the vote both went to January run offs which Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock won Ossoff is the state s first Jewish senator and Warnock is the state s first Black senator Biden s Ossoff s and Warnock s wins were attributed to the rapid diversification of the suburbs of Atlanta and increased turnout of younger African American voters particularly around the suburbs of Atlanta and in Savannah Georgia br br br Parks and
