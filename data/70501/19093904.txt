id: 19093904
The National Hockey League NHL endured a tumultuous period of history between and It grew from teams at the start of this period to at the end as the league expanded across the United States Repeated labour conflicts interrupted play in and the second lockout caused the entire NHL season to be canceled the first time in North American history that a sports league has canceled an entire season in a labour dispute Nine franchises were added between and comprising the San Jose Sharks Ottawa Senators Tampa Bay Lightning Florida Panthers Mighty Ducks of Anaheim Nashville Predators Atlanta Thrashers Columbus Blue Jackets and the Minnesota Wild In addition to expansion teams five franchises have relocated during this time the Minnesota North Stars became the Dallas Stars the Quebec Nordiques became the Colorado Avalanche the Winnipeg Jets became the Phoenix Coyotes the Hartford Whalers became the Carolina Hurricanes and the Atlanta Thrashers became the second franchise known as the Winnipeg Jets br In the Montreal Canadiens celebrated the Stanley Cup s th anniversary with their th championship They remain the last Canadian team to capture the trophy The New York Rangers broke the Curse of winning their first title in years The renaissance of the Original Six would continue as the Detroit Red Wings Stanley Cup winners in and Chicago Blackhawks winners in and and Boston Bruins winners in broke lengthy Cup droughts of and seasons respectively Meanwhile the NHL s southern expansion often maligned by Canadians and fans in the Northeastern United States led to first time championships by the Dallas Stars in and the Tampa Bay Lightning Carolina Hurricanes and Anaheim Ducks in the s decade followed by the Los Angeles Kings in the s br Manon Rh aume became the first female player in the NHL when she suited up for the Lightning in a pre season game Wayne Gretzky passed Gordie Howe as the NHL s all time leading scorer in when he scored his nd career goal Mario Lemieux overcame Hodgkin s lymphoma to finish his NHL career with more than points and two championships and now owns the Pittsburgh Penguins This era saw the emergence of two superstars with Sidney Crosby and Alexander Ovechkin re energizing the Capitals Penguins rivalry br The Canada Cup gave way to the World Cup of Hockey in while NHL players first competed in the Winter Olympics To promote itself worldwide the NHL played regular season games in Japan in and throughout Europe since The league played its first outdoor regular season game between the Canadiens and the host Edmonton Oilers in and which led to the creation of three series of outdoor games the Heritage Classic Winter Classic and Stadium Series br Increased use of defence focused systems contributed to decreased scoring in the late s leading some to argue that the NHL s talent pool had been diluted by the expansion plan The league has attempted several times to alter its rules to increase scoring It began awarding teams a single point for losing in overtime in hoping to reduce the number of tie games In ties were eliminated altogether as the penalty shootout was introduced to ensure that all games have a winner br br br Background br br As the s began players were uneasy with the closeness between National Hockey League Players Association NHLPA executive director Alan Eagleson and the teams owners As a result Eagleson stepped down in December and was replaced by Bob Goodenow Four years later the Federal Bureau of Investigation indicted Eagleson on charges of racketeering fraud embezzlement kickbacks and obstruction of justice over allegations that he stole millions of dollars from the NHLPA Eagleson pleaded guilty in in a plea bargain and was fined US million and sentenced to months in prison He subsequently resigned from the Hockey Hall of Fame br Four months after replacing Eagleson Goodenow and the NHLPA launched the first NHL strike on April It lasted ten days and resulted in the players receiving larger playoff bonuses increased control over the licensing of their likenesses and improved rights to free agency all canceled games were also rescheduled It also led the owners to dismiss league president John Ziegler and replace him on an interim basis with Gil Stein Goodenow called the strike a major moment stating I don t think the owners took the players seriously and it wasn t until the strike that they understood the players were serious As part of the deal the league also agreed to have each team play two games per season for the following two years in neutral site locations partially to help gauge markets for potential expansion br Desiring a fresh start the owners replaced Stein with Gary Bettman in February Formerly a senior vice president of the National Basketball Association Bettman replaced the position of president with that of commissioner He was given the task of selling the game to the American market ending labor unrest completing expansion plans and modernizing the league br br br Expansion br br The Tampa Bay Lightning and Ottawa Senators joined the league in as part of the owners plan to expand the NHL to teams within a decade The Lightning made NHL history when goaltender Manon Rh aume played a period of an exhibition game for them on September Rh aume became the first woman to play in an NHL game She also became the first woman to sign a professional hockey contract doing so with the Lightning s farm team the Atlanta Knights One year later the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and Florida Panthers began play as the NHL s th and th franchises They were established as part of the NHL s attempt to regain a U S network television presence by expanding into southern North America The league expected that bringing in Blockbuster Video s Wayne Huizenga to own the Panthers and The Walt Disney Company to own the Mighty Ducks would raise its profile The NHL s southward push continued in when the Minnesota North Stars moved to Dallas Texas to become the Dallas Stars br The NHL celebrated the th anniversary of the Stanley Cup in That year s finals featured Patrick Roy and the Montreal Canadiens against Wayne Gretzky and the Los Angeles Kings After losing the first game the Canadiens rallied from a late deficit to win game two in overtime after the Kings Marty McSorley was penalized for using an illegal stick Montreal scored on the power play sending the game into overtime Montreal won games three and four in overtime en route to winning the series in five games The Canadiens won an NHL record ten consecutive overtime games in the playoffs br The New York Rangers ended their Curse of after years by winning the Stanley Cup in seven games over the Vancouver Canucks The Rangers championship was the last hurrah for the great Edmonton Oilers dynasty of the s as there were seven ex Oilers on the team including Mark Messier who became the first and to this date the only player to win Stanley Cups as the captain for two franchises having captained the Oilers to the last of their five Stanley Cups in The Rangers victory also resulted in the first Russian names to be engraved on the Stanley Cup Alexei Kovalev Alexander Karpovtsev Sergei Nemchinov and Sergei Zubov The global audience of million in countries that watched the Rangers victory included a huge European audience including those watching across the former Soviet Union This Stanley Cup win was the highest rated single CBC Sports program in history to that point a distinction that now belongs to the men s ice hockey gold medal game between Canada and the United States at the Winter Olympics when Canada won its first Olympic ice hockey gold medal since the Winter Olympics CBC commentator Bob Cole who called both games said that game seven was one of his most memorable TV games br br br lockout br br Four months later the players were locked out by the owners due to the lack of a Collective Bargaining Agreement CBA The NHL lockout lasted days and resulted in the season s being shortened from a planned games to The owners wanted to control salary growth and insisted on a salary cap changes to free agency and salary arbitration The union instead proposed a luxury tax system that would penalize teams that spent above a set figure on player salaries The negotiations were at times bitter as defenceman Chris Chelios famously issued a veiled threat against Bettman suggesting that he should be worried about his family and his well being because some crazed fans or even a player might take matters into their own hands and figure they get Bettman out of the way br The lockout entered its fourth month in January and approached a deadline that would have canceled the season when the two sides agreed to an th hour deal The owners failed to achieve a full salary cap but the union agreed to a cap on rookie contracts changes to the arbitration system and restrictive rules for free agency that would not grant a player the unrestricted right to choose where he played until age The deal was initially seen as a victory for the owners br The agreement was not enough to save two teams in Canada s smallest NHL markets The revenue disparity between large and small market teams exacerbated by the falling value of the Canadian dollar led the Winnipeg Jets to relocate to Phoenix Arizona in becoming the Coyotes one year after the Quebec Nordiques moved to Denver Colorado to become the Colorado Avalanche Hoping to prevent other teams from leaving Canada and citing the cost of doing business in American dollars while taking revenue in Canadian dollars the NHL set up a currency assistance plan to support the remaining small market Canadian teams in The Hartford Whalers became the third former World Hockey Association team to relocate in moving to Raleigh North Carolina to become the Carolina Hurricanes br br br Dead puck era br Following the lockout the NHL entered a prolonged period of offensive decline Throughout the s goals were scored per game on average That figure had dropped below six goals per game by the season and to by There have been many arguments put forth as to what caused this decline A common claim is that the drop in offence was due to dilution of talent caused by s expansion a position former player Brett Hull endorsed Increased use of the neutral zone trap and similar defensive systems were also blamed The New Jersey Devils have often been criticized for popularizing the trap using it to win the Stanley Cup in This period has been called the dead puck era The Devils along with the Detroit Red Wings and Colorado Avalanche largely dominated the dead puck era winning a combined eight championships in nine years while also sweeping their series opponents in the Stanley Cup Finals in and br The Canada Cup gave way to the World Cup of Hockey in an NHL sanctioned eight team international tournament featuring the top professionals in the world The inaugural tournament saw the United States upset the favored Canadians in a three game final That same year the Avalanche won their first Stanley Cup in their first season in Denver sweeping the Florida Panthers One year later the Detroit Red Wings ended a year drought capturing their first Stanley Cup since The team s celebration was cut short as defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov and team masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov were seriously injured when their limousine crashed six days following the victory The Red Wings dedicated the season to the two Upon repeating as champions in they brought Konstantinov who had suffered severe brain damage in the crash out in a wheelchair to celebrate with the team on the ice br br The NHL added four expansion teams to increase the total number of clubs to Continuing its expansion into the southern United States the Nashville Predators joined the league in followed by the Atlanta Thrashers in The Minnesota Wild and Columbus Blue Jackets then began play in br On April Wayne Gretzky played his final NHL game retiring as the league s all time scoring leader and holding NHL records His number was retired league wide the following season The usual three year waiting period between a player s retirement and his induction into the Hockey Hall of Fame was waived and he was inducted in br For marketing reasons the NHL agreed to participate in the Winter Olympics starting in NHL players first competed at the Nagano Games Led by goaltender Dominik Ha ek the tournament was won by the Czech Republic Hasek who finished the tournament with a goals against average GAA and a save percentage over six games was the leading goaltender of the s His run of consecutive Vezina Trophies from to was interrupted only once in by Jim Carey of the Washington Capitals Hasek won another Vezina Trophy in and two consecutive Lester B Pearson and Hart Trophies in and br The Panthers trip to the Stanley Cup Finals in began a trend in which southern based teams frequently appeared in the championship round The Dallas Stars won the Stanley Cup over the Buffalo Sabres in controversial fashion Brett Hull scored the Cup winning goal in overtime of game six despite arguments that his foot was in the goal crease which under the rules at the time would have disallowed the goal The Stars returned to the finals in falling to the New Jersey Devils who then lost to the Colorado Avalanche in The Hurricanes first played in the finals in losing to the Red Wings while the Mighty Ducks reached the final in falling to the Devils In the Tampa Bay Lightning defeated the Calgary Flames to win the Cup The Lightning win in was seen as the end to the Devils Avalanche Red Wings Stanley Cup era as all three teams won a combined eight Stanley Cups between and The only team other than these to win the Stanley Cup between those years was the Dallas Stars in br The Edmonton Oilers hosted the NHL s first regular season outdoor hockey game the Heritage Classic on November The game against the Canadiens was held at Commonwealth Stadium before a then record crowd of fans who endured temperatures as low as C F br br br Mario Lemieux br br When they selected him as the first overall draft pick in the Pittsburgh Penguins hoped that Mario Lemieux would improve the team s fortunes on the ice and increase interest in the team in the Pittsburgh market Lemieux who had scored goals in his final season of junior hockey recorded his first NHL goal in his first game on his first career shot against the Boston Bruins On December Lemieux scored five goals one in each of the five different ways possible even strength on the power play short handed on a penalty shot and into an empty net a feat no player in league history has duplicated br Injuries and illness plagued Lemieux throughout his career He played only regular season games in after surgery to repair a herniated disc in his back but returned in time to score points in the playoffs in leading the Penguins to their first Stanley Cup Lemieux continued to struggle with back trouble the next season though he still won the scoring title and his second consecutive playoff MVP award in leading the Penguins to their second championship in In he was diagnosed with cancer Lemieux endured radiation treatments in days to treat non Hodgkin lymphoma Only hours after his final treatment Lemieux returned to the Penguins scoring a goal in his first game back A second surgery on his back cost Lemieux most of the season and the entire campaign As a result of his injuries Lemieux retired in He was immediately inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame the three year waiting period was waived by the Hall br Inspired by his son Austin s desire to see him play Lemieux returned to the NHL in earning an assist on a Jaromir Jagr goal seconds into his return and scoring one himself in the second period He also became the first player owner in NHL history he had bought the Penguins in the summer of to save them from bankruptcy Lemieux finished the season with goals and points in games Lemieux continued to battle injuries missing the majority of the first half of the season however he returned to action in time to captain Team Canada to its first gold medal in years at the Winter Olympics Injuries again forced his retirement as Lemieux finally ended his career on January with goals and points in games Despite his injuries Lemieux is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in NHL history Hall of Famer Bobby Orr said that Lemieux was the most skilled player he had ever seen while Mike Gartner said that if he had remained healthy Lemieux would have scored goals br br br lockout br br By the owners were claiming that player salaries had grown much faster than revenues and that the league as a whole lost over US million in Upon the expiry of the collective bargaining agreement CBA Gary Bettman announced that the players were again locked out to start the season As with the lockout the owners were demanding a salary cap which the players were unwilling to consider until the season was on the verge of being lost The players for their part offered a salary rollback to keep the free market system that was already in place On February after a series of last minute offers failed Bettman announced the cancellation of the entire season making the NHL the first major North American league to cancel an entire season because of a labor stoppage br The season s cancellation led union president Trevor Linden and senior director Ted Saskin to take charge of negotiations from executive director Bob Goodenow By early July the two sides had agreed to a new CBA The deal featured a hard salary cap linked to a fixed percentage of league revenues a rollback on salaries and unrestricted free agency beginning after seven years of service br The loss of the season led the NHL to institute a special lottery to determine the order of the draft as there were no standings to base a drafting order from The Pittsburgh Penguins won the lottery and selected Sidney Crosby a highly prized prospect whose arrival to the NHL had been greatly anticipated Crosby and the Washington Capitals Alex Ovechkin the first overall pick were expected to become the faces of the NHL as the league entered a new era Ovechkin was named the Calder Memorial Trophy winner as rookie of the year in while Crosby s presence helped Pittsburgh s attendance increase by over fans per game br br br Shootout era br br br Debut of Crosby and Ovechkin br br In the season Ovechkin and Crosby began their careers In their first three seasons they each won both the Art Ross and Hart trophies Crosby captured both in and Ovechkin in The Stanley Cup Finals was the first time that franchises that originally played in the World Hockey Association WHA met in the Stanley Cup Finals as the Oilers lost a seven game series to the Hurricanes The following season the Senators lost the finals in five games to the Ducks The three year streak of Canadian teams in the finals was halted in the season when the Red Wings defeated the Penguins for their fourth Stanley Cup in years br br br Penguins Blackhawks and Kings dominate br The introduction of the salary cap in encouraged parity in the NHL making it harder for teams to compete for the Stanley Cup every year Nevertheless three franchises emerged to win Stanley Cups each during this period During the decade from to the Chicago Blackhawks Los Angeles Kings and Pittsburgh Penguins combined for eight Stanley Cup wins At least one of the three teams or the Boston Bruins appeared in every Stanley Cup Finals in that time frame but only faced one another once in when the Blackhawks defeated the Bruins in six games br The Pittsburgh Penguins lost to the Red Wings for the Stanley Cup but returned in for a rematch with the defending champions The Penguins would return the favor capturing their third Stanley Cup championship in Game Seven Seven years later in the Penguins won their fourth Cup at the expense of the Sharks then repeated the feat in against the Predators becoming the first back to back champion since the Red Wings Led by homegrown players Sidney Crosby Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang the Penguins emerged from the brink of bankruptcy to become an NHL powerhouse reaching the playoffs every year from to br The Chicago Blackhawks also had its share of struggles to begin the s but the team s fortunes soon changed after drafting Jonathan Toews third overall in and Patrick Kane first overall in The duo of Toews and Kane helped the Blackhawks end a year Cup drought in by defeating the Flyers in six games It was then followed by two more Stanley Cup victories first in against the Bruins and then in against the Lightning br The Los Angeles Kings had struggles to begin with until they hired Daryl Sutter in the middle of the season Afterward the Kings made the Cup final in and won the Stanley Cup against the Devils which was the first championship as a franchise It was then followed by another Stanley Cup victory in against the Rangers br The only other team to reach the Stanley Cup Finals more than once between and was the Boston Bruins The Bruins reached the Cup Finals twice winning in and losing in The Bruins triumph was its first since br br br Going outdoors br The success of the Heritage Classic led the NHL to schedule more outdoor games The Sabres hosted the NHL Winter Classic on New Year s Day losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in a shootout before a crowd of at Ralph Wilson Stadium The second Winter Classic was held January at Wrigley Field in Chicago between the Blackhawks and Red Wings On January at Fenway Park in Boston the third Winter Classic was held with the Bruins defeating the Philadelphia Flyers in overtime The following year the Winter Classic was held at Pittsburgh s Heinz Field with the Washington Capitals beating the Penguins and on January January of that year was a Sunday the New York Rangers defeated the Flyers at Philadelphia s Citizens Bank Park The pinnacle of the Winter Classic s popularity took place on January when the Maple Leafs defeated the Red Wings in a shootout behind a record crowd of spectators at Michigan Stadium Since its debut the Winter Classic became an annual New Year s Day tradition for the NHL regularly playing in front of sellout crowds and record viewers on television br Its Canadian counterpart the Heritage Classic continues to take place albeit infrequently After the Oilers successful staging of the event in the Heritage Classic was held in three Western Canadian cities The game took place in Calgary s McMahon Stadium and it involved the Canadiens and Flames Three years later the Heritage Classic was held at Vancouver s BC Place and it featured the Senators and Canucks The Heritage Classic was played in Winnipeg s Investors Group Field with the Oilers and Jets taking part br In the season the NHL introduced the Stadium Series which promoted outdoor hockey to warm weather and non traditional markets Two of the first five Stadium Series games were held in Los Angeles Dodger Stadium and Santa Clara s Levi s Stadium both of which involved the Kings against their in city rival Ducks and their in state rival Sharks br Overall NHL outdoor games have taken place since br br br NHL Premiere Challenge and Olympic participation br Intending to promote the game worldwide the league sent the San Jose Sharks and Calgary Flames to begin the season with two games in Tokyo Japan Since the NHL has been sending teams to Europe to start each season The Los Angeles Kings met the Ducks at the O Arena in London England to start the season A year later four teams were sent to Prague Czech Republic and Stockholm Sweden One of those teams the Rangers also participated in the inaugural Victoria Cup defeating the Kontinental Hockey League s Metallurg Magnitogorsk in a single game Another four teams opened the season in Stockholm and Helsinki Finland br In Vancouver hosted the Winter Olympics the first time an NHL city has hosted the event since the league began participating The NHL s participation in future games remains in doubt as it had expressed a desire not to participate in the games in Sochi Russia However the NHL players did ultimately participate in those games The players strongly favour continued participation in the Olympics br Due to the Olympics the Canucks underwent the longest road trip in NHL history with games over six weeks from January to March to allow General Motors Place to be used for ice hockey during the Winter Games It marked the first time that an NHL sized rink was used during the Winter Olympics GM Place was Canada Hockey Place during the games as the IOC prohibits advertising including corporate sponsorship within Olympic venues br The NHL revived the World Cup of Hockey tournament in twelve years after its most recent tournament br br br Coyotes bankruptcy and Thrashers relocation br Despite these successes after the lockout a couple of teams still had financial difficulties The Phoenix Coyotes eventually filed for bankruptcy in May after incurring several hundred million dollars of losses The league then took control over the team later that year in order to stabilize the club s operations with the hopes of eventually reselling it to a new owner who would be committed to stay in the Phoenix market Meanwhile the City of Glendale Arizona home of the team s Jobing com Arena financially kept the team afloat paying US million to the NHL to cover the club s losses for the season and another million for the season The league eventually sold the team in to Renaissance Sports Entertainment RS E a group of Canadian investors br After also suffering financial losses and ownership struggles the Atlanta Thrashers were eventually sold to True North Sports and Entertainment in who then relocated the team to Winnipeg a stark reversal of the league s attempts to expand into the southern United States Initially replacing the Thrashers in the Eastern Conference s Southeast Division as part of a realignment to four divisions the Jets were moved to the Western Conference s Central Division before the season The Detroit Red Wings and Columbus Blue Jackets were then assigned to the Eastern Conference s Atlantic and Metropolitan divisions respectively br br br lockout br br The NHL again entered lockout in cancelling the first games about of the season until at least December Just after am on January after approximately continuous hours of negotiating the NHL and the player s union reached a tentative deal on a new collective bargaining agreement to end the lockout The first games of the season were held on January br br br Rules and innovations br br Hoping to reduce the number of tie games during the regular season the NHL decided that beginning in the season in any game tied after regulation time both teams would be guaranteed one point while the team that won in overtime would earn a second point The theory was that rather than playing conservatively to earn a point for a tie teams would press for the extra point for the overtime win In the season the NHL eliminated tie games altogether as the shootout was introduced to decide all regular season games tied after the five minute overtime period The shootout has proven controversial critics have called it a gimmick and expressed fierce opposition to any suggestion of using it to decide playoff games though the league has not pushed for this to happen It has also been argued that teams are playing it safe taking no chances in regulation in order to bring the game to overtime where they are each guaranteed a point The shootout also has many supporters among them Phoenix head coach Dave Tippett who stated that many fans enjoy it br The shootout was one of several rule changes made in as the league attempted to increase offence following the lockout The two line pass rule was eliminated allowing teams to pass from their defensive zone to anywhere in the neutral zone Previously such passes could only be made to their own half of the neutral zone The rule was intended to encourage long breakout passes and create more breakaways Teams that commit an icing infraction are no longer allowed to make a line change before a faceoff and goaltenders are now prohibited from playing the puck in the end zone corners behind the goal line They are allowed to play the puck directly behind the net within the trapezoid marked by diagonal lines from the goal line to the end boards br One of the most controversial changes was the league s zero tolerance policy on obstruction penalties The league hoped that the game could be opened up if it cracked down on clutching and grabbing The tighter regulations have met with complaints about the legitimacy of some calls that players are diving to draw penalties and that officials are not calling enough penalties br The changes initially led to a sharp increase in scoring Teams combined to score goals per game in more than a goal per game higher than in the season This represented the highest single season increase in offence since However scoring has rapidly declined since approaching pre lockout totals in the season br Other rule changes that were implemented include the hybrid icing rule coach s challenges for offside and goaltender interference prior to a goal and three on three overtime periods br br br Timeline br br br See also br History of the National Hockey League
