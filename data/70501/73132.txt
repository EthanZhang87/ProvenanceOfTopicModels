being down in a series In the process the Wild became the first team in playoff history to capture a seven game series twice after facing elimination during Game br When the season started the Wild were short handed with both Pascal Dupuis and Gaborik holding out After struggling in the first month the Wild finally got their two young star left wingers signed but both struggled to get back into game shape as the Wild struggled through much of November In a deep hole the Wild did not make it to the playoffs despite finishing the season strong with wins in five of their last six games as they finished last in the competitive Northwest Division with a record of Along the way the Wild began to gear up for the future trading away several of their older players who were a part of the franchise

home ice advantage However Minnesota came up short being eliminated in six games by the Avalanche br During the off season the Wild re acquired Andrew Brunette from Colorado and traded for defenseman Marek Zidlicky The Wild also signed free agents Antti Miettinen and Owen Nolan to multi year deals There seemed to be a stigma about Jacques Lemaire s defensive system that caused a number of top free agents to avoid the Wild br Despite winning the Northwest Division the previous season the Wild fell to ninth place in the Western Conference in missing the playoffs Much of this was in part due to a lack of scoring and overall team offense and the injuries to star forward Marian Gaborik who only played games Jacques Lemaire head coach of the Wild since the team s inception in the season resigned at season s end General manager Doug Risebrough was later fired leading to a nearly complete turnover in the Wild s coaching and hockey management staff br br br Chuck Fletcher era br br br Mikko

over the Colorado Avalanche on April After finishing in eighth place in the Western Conference the Wild lost in five games to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks in the first round of the playoffs br The relocation and rebranding of the Atlanta Thrashers as the new Winnipeg Jets in meant Winnipeg was once again Minnesota s second closest geographical rival after Chicago and led the NHL to reconsider its divisional alignment Even before the NHL s return to Winnipeg Wild management had lobbied repeatedly for a move out of the Northwest Division where they were the only Central Time Zone team Among the alignments considered was having the Jets replace the Avalanche in the Northwest but Wild management strongly objected to this alignment as it would have left them as the only American team in their division Following protracted negotiations both amongst the owners and with the National Hockey League Players Association in the NHL collapsed its six divisions into four and dissolved the Northwest Division Consequently the Wild moved into the Central Division along with the Jets and Avalanche the Canadian teams from the Northwest moved back to the Pacific Division The Wild now share their division with not only the Blackhawks but also the Dallas Stars the Wild s predecessors in Minnesota and the St Louis Blues another major rival of the North Stars during the

Blues in the first round of the playoffs in six games In the second round the Wild were eliminated in a four game series sweep by Chicago Following the loss forward Matt Cooke said Our expectations inside this room were a lot higher than a second round series br In the Wild set a franchise record with the best win record in the first games of the season Immediately afterward they went into a skid losing the next of games culminating in the firing of head coach Mike Yeo Under new interim head coach John Torchetti the team snapped the losing streak but remained streaky throughout the rest

Kaprizov era present br On May Paul Fenton was hired as the third general manager in franchise history During the season the Wild struggled to keep up in the ultra competitive Central Division as they had in previous seasons Despite a renaissance year from Parise many key players like Eric Staal and Jason Zucker regressed offensively from the season prior Many reported that there was dysfunction in

goaltender Cam Talbot to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for Filip Gustavsson five days after signing Fleury to a new two year contract Despite a second consecutive goal season from Kaprizov the Wild

contract shortly before the playoffs began They were eliminated in six games marking their eighth consecutive playoff series loss br The Wild re signed Gustavsson in the offseason but did not make any
