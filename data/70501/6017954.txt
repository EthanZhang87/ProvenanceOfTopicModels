The Colorado Rockies were a professional ice hockey team in the National Hockey League NHL that played in Denver from to They were founded as the Kansas City Scouts an expansion team that began play in the NHL in the season The Scouts moved from Kansas City Missouri to Denver for the season After six seasons in Denver the franchise moved to East Rutherford New Jersey for the season and was renamed the New Jersey Devils Denver went without an NHL team until the Quebec Nordiques relocated to become the Colorado Avalanche following the season The Rockies name itself would be applied to Denver s Major League Baseball expansion team that began play in br br br Franchise history br Ivan Mullenix owner of the Central Hockey League s Denver Spurs had been awarded a conditional NHL franchise for the season With McNichols Sports Arena already completed by he looked to enter the NHL a year early and the league attempted to broker an arrangement by which he would acquire the struggling California Golden Seals and move them to Denver in lieu of an expansion team At the same time the Pittsburgh Penguins would be sold to a Seattle based group that had also won a conditional franchise for that city br The proposed arrangement fell through however and with the continuing franchise difficulties the NHL called off the expansion The Spurs then elected to move to the World Hockey Association WHA for the season but Denver fans did not consider the WHA a major league and stayed away in droves By December rumors that the NHL was preparing to move either the Seals or Kansas City Scouts to Denver led Mullenix to conclude he could not survive in the city Out of desperation he moved the Spurs to Ottawa almost halfway through the season However the renamed Ottawa Civics lasted only two weeks before folding br Meanwhile the Scouts were on the verge of collapse despite having entered the NHL only two years earlier Although they suffered through a win season in they still fared better on the ice over their first two years than their expansion cousins the Washington Capitals However Capitals owner Abe Pollin was far better financed than the member consortium that owned the Scouts and had the patience to handle the typical struggles of an expansion team Additionally the Scouts were hobbled by an economic downturn in the Midwest Facing almost million in debt the Scouts owners decided to sell the franchise after a season ticket drive sold only tickets A Denver based group headed by Jack Vickers purchased the Scouts and moved them to Denver renaming them the Colorado Rockies The team remained in the Smythe Division of the Campbell Conference and retained the Scouts colors of blue red and gold as they were the same colors used on the Colorado state flag br br br Continued struggles br br Despite a new name and a new city the team s situation did not improve significantly In their six seasons of existence the Rockies made the Stanley Cup playoffs only once in Even then they finished with the sixth worst record in the league games under However the Smythe Division was so weak that year that the Rockies finished second behind the Chicago Black Hawks the only team in the division with a record This allowed them to edge out the Vancouver Canucks for the last playoff spot by only two points in those days the division runners up were guaranteed a playoff spot The Rockies went down rather meekly in the first round losing to the Philadelphia Flyers in a two game sweep They never came close to the mark during their six years in Denver and the season was the only one in which they even came close to a playoff berth br The Rockies did have some star players for a short time Barry Beck set a record in his rookie year for goals by a rookie defenseman and Hall of Fame right winger Lanny McDonald was picked up in a trade with Toronto In addition they at various times had such players as Chico Resch Wilf Paiement Rene Robert Rob Ramage and Bobby Schmautz However the team suffered a constant lack of overall depth and trades tended to sacrifice quality for quantity Plagued by instability the Rockies had seven coaches in four years none lasting more than one full season and ownership changed hands twice in four years Attendance was fairly respectable considering that the team was barely competitive on the ice and unstable off it br br br Under Don Cherry br One of the few bright spots in the franchise s history came during the season when the flamboyant Don Cherry a former Jack Adams Award winner was named head coach after being fired by the Boston Bruins Under Cherry the Rockies adopted the motto Come to the fights and watch a Rockies game break out The phrase was plastered on billboards all over Denver in the season br As he later admitted Cherry s outspokenness and feuding with Rockies general manager Ray Miron did not endear him to the front office While Cherry was adept at motivating the players goaltending was still the team s weakness as Miron refused to replace Hardy Astrom whom Cherry dubbed The Swedish Sieve Cherry recalled one game where his players had gotten ten shots on goal without scoring but Astrom then conceded a goal from the opponent s first shot and so was pulled from net br The Rockies finished with points tied for the worst record in the league In their final game which was held at home Cherry s team defeated the Penguins As it was already known that Cherry would not return the next season he wore a cowboy hat and cowboy boots for what would be his last NHL game After the final buzzer sounded his players formed two lines for him raising their sticks to form an arch for Cherry to walk under while acknowledging the cheers of the crowd br br br Move to New Jersey br The failure of Vickers petroleum business left him unable to pay the lease at McNichols Arena in The deal was unfavorable from the beginning as the Rockies never received any revenue from parking concessions or advertising Vickers sold the Rockies on July of that year to Arthur Imperatore Sr whose intention was to keep the franchise in Denver temporarily before moving it to the new arena at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in New Jersey which was under construction and expected to be completed by His imposition of the team s eventual transfer alienated many fans Before he could complete the move however Imperatore sold the Rockies to Buffalo based cable television magnate Peter Gilbert the NHL Board of Governors unanimously approved the sale on February At the time the NHL seemed to be committed to keeping a team in Denver Gilbert had promised not to move the team and league president John Ziegler said that he wanted to make the Rockies a model franchise br Finally in after a failed bid by an Ottawa based ownership group intent on moving the Rockies to the Canadian capital the franchise was sold in May to New Jersey shipping tycoon John McMullen who also owned Major League Baseball s Houston Astros He announced that he had big plans for the franchise but they involved making the long awaited move to New Jersey The team was relocated for the season and renamed the New Jersey Devils br br br Legacy br The last active NHL player who had played for the Rockies was Joe Cirella who retired from the NHL following the NHL season and played his final professional season for the K lner Haie in Germany in In that season incidentally Colorado saw the NHL return to Denver after years when the Quebec Nordiques moved to the city and became known as the Colorado Avalanche Additionally Rockies draft pick Bruce Driver played in the NHL until but did not join the team until a year after their move to New Jersey br Two other former Rockies Paul Gagne and Rich Chernomaz played until in the Swiss and German leagues respectively br The Stanley Cup Finals pitted the teams that have called Colorado home past and present in their histories against each other The Avalanche defeated the Devils in seven games br The Rockies are credited as being the first team to use the Gary Glitter song Rock and Roll Part at a sporting event The team played it after every goal scored by a Rockies player Other NHL teams picked up on this practice as did teams in other leagues In recent years however Glitter s child sex offenses caused teams to distance themselves from the song br The Rockies original logo a mountain peak with the silhouette of the flag of Colorado served as inspiration for the Avalanche s secondary logo on their current third jerseys which were first unveiled in the season The C on the aforementioned logo was also emblazoned on the primary jersey s shoulders as well The logo was also used on the jersey of the Avalanche for the Stadium Series br In the season both the Colorado Avalanche and the New Jersey Devils wore Reverse Retro uniforms featuring the Rockies red gold and blue palette br br br Season by season record br Note GP Games played W Wins L Losses T
