and digital editions would be revived by rehiring some of the editorial staff br In May Sports Illustrated failed to deliver a print copy of the publication for the month to its subscribers for the first time in the magazine s year history according to the New York Post s Josh Kosman May br br br History br br br Establishment br There were two previous magazines named Sports Illustrated before the current magazine was launched on August In Stuart Scheftel created Sports Illustrated with a target market of sportsmen He published the magazine monthly from to The magazine focused on golf tennis and skiing with articles on the major sports He then sold the name to Dell Publications which released Sports Illustrated in and this version lasted six issues before closing Dell s version focused on major sports baseball basketball boxing and competed on magazine racks against Sports and other monthly sports magazines During the s these magazines were monthly which prevented them from cover current events There was no large base general weekly sports magazine with a national following on actual active events It was then that Time patriarch Henry Luce began considering whether his company should attempt to fill that gap At the time many believed sports was beneath the attention of serious journalism and did not think sports news could fill a weekly magazine especially during the winter A number of advisers to Luce including Life magazine s Ernest Havemann tried to kill the idea but Luce who was not a sports fan decided the time was right br Luce and editors of the planned magazine met in at Pine Lakes Country Club the oldest golf course in Myrtle Beach South Carolina The course s pro shop has a plaque mentioning the meetings and the plaque also states that the first issue was given to the course It is on display there Myrtle Beach Area Golf Course Owners Association executive director Tracy Conner credits the magazine with making Myrtle Beach a golf destination br Many at Time Life scoffed at Luce s idea in his Pulitzer Prize winning biography Luce and His Empire W A Swanberg wrote that the company s intellectuals dubbed the proposed magazine Muscle Jockstrap and Sweat Socks Launched on August it was not profitable and would not be for years and not particularly well run at first but Luce s timing was good The popularity of spectator sports in the United States was about to explode and that popularity came to be driven largely by three things economic prosperity television and Sports Illustrated br The early issues of the magazine seemed caught between two opposing views of its audience Much of the subject matter was directed at upper class activities such as yachting polo and safaris but upscale would be advertisers were unconvinced that sports fans were a significant part of their market br br br Color printing br In offset printing began This allowed the color pages of the magazine to be printed overnight not only producing crisper and brighter images but also finally enabling the editors to merge the best color with the latest news By the magazine was printing pages of fast color a year in SI became the first American full color newsweekly An intense rivalry developed between photographers particularly Walter Iooss and Neil Leifer to get a decisive cover shot that would be on newsstands and in mailboxes only a few days later br In the late s and early s during Gil Rogin s term as Managing Editor the feature stories of Frank Deford became the magazine s anchor Bonus pieces on Pete Rozelle Woody Hayes Bear Bryant Howard Cosell and others became some of the most quoted sources about these figures and Deford established a reputation as one of the best writers of the time br br br Expansion of sports coverage br After more than a decade of steady losses the magazine s fortunes finally turned around in the s when Andre Laguerre became its managing editor A European correspondent for Time Inc who later became chief of the Time Life news bureaux in Paris and London for a time he ran both simultaneously Laguerre attracted Henry Luce s attention in with his singular coverage of the Winter Olympic Games in Cortina d Ampezzo Italy which became the core of SI s coverage of those games In May Luce brought Laguerre to New York to become the assistant managing editor of the magazine He was named managing editor in and he more than doubled the circulation by instituting a system of departmental editors redesigning the internal format and inaugurating the unprecedented use in a news magazine of full color photographic coverage of the week s sports events He was also one of the first to sense the rise of national interest in professional football br Laguerre also instituted the innovative concept of one long story at the end of every issue which he called the bonus piece These well written in depth articles helped to distinguish Sports Illustrated from other sports publications and helped launch the careers of such legendary writers as Frank Deford who in March wrote of Laguerre He smoked cigars and drank Scotch and made the sun move across the heavens His genius as an editor was that he made you want to please him but he wanted you to do that by writing in your own distinct way br Laguerre is also credited with the conception and creation of the annual Swimsuit Issue which quickly became and remains the most popular issue each year br In co owned property HBO Cannon Video had inked a pact to produce video versions of the magazine for on the sell through market running just minutes on the tape br In Time Inc merged with Warner Communications to form the media conglomerate Time Warner In Time Inc was spun off from Time Warner br br br Sale to Authentic Brands Group Maven br In the magazine was sold to Meredith Corporation by means of its acquisition of parent company Time Inc Meredith however planned to sell Sports Illustrated due to not aligning with its lifestyle properties Authentic Brands Group announced its intent to acquire Sports Illustrated for million the next year stating that it would leverage its brand and other assets for new opportunities that stay close to the DNA and the heritage of the brand Upon the announcement Meredith would enter into a licensing agreement to continue as publisher of the Sports Illustrated editorial operations for at

CEO The company had backed a bid by Junior Bridgeman to acquire SI In preparation for the closure of the sale to ABG and Maven The Wall Street Journal reported that there would be Sports Illustrated

sports writer Pat Forde In January it announced an editorial partnership with The Hockey News focusing on syndication of NHL related coverage In it announced a similar partnership with Morning Read for golf coverage with its website being merged into that of Sports Illustrated It also partnered with iHeartMedia to distribute and co produce podcasts br In September Maven now known as The Arena

Issue in and resort hotels in Orlando and Punta Cana In September it delved deeper into the resort world through a new partnership with Travel Leisure br On November Futurism published an article alleging that Sports Illustrated was publishing AI generated articles credited to authors who were also AI generated the latter practice apparently extended to their profile photos which the website alleged were sourced from online marketplaces selling such photos After Futurism reached out to The Arena Group the magazine purportedly removed some of the implicated writers and republished their articles under other AI generated authors with notes disclaiming its staff s involvement In response to the report a spokesperson for Sports Illustrated claimed that the affected articles were product reviews written without the involvement of AI by AdVon Commerce a third party company who they claimed used pseudonyms to protect author privacy and had already severed ties with meanwhile writers and editors at the magazine sharply criticized the alleged practices br On January The Arena Group missed a million quarterly licensing payment to Authentic Brands Group Two weeks later on January
