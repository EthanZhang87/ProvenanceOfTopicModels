be based in the United States Adams first act as owner was to hire Art Ross a former star player and innovator as general manager br Ross came up with Bruins for a team nickname a name for brown bears

the Bruins won the first ever NHL game played in the United States hosting the Montreal Maroons at Boston Arena with Smokey Harris scoring the first ever Bruins goal spurring the Bruins to a win This would be one of the few high points of the season as the Bruins lost their next games and only managed a record finishing in last place in its first season The Bruins played three more seasons at the Arena after which they became the main tenant of Boston Garden br The Bruins improved in their second season to a winning record which originally held the record for the biggest single season improvement in NHL history and is now third However they missed out on the third and final playoff berth by one point to the expansion Pittsburgh Pirates br In their third season Ross took advantage of the collapse of the Western Hockey League WHL to purchase several western stars including the team s first great star defenseman Eddie Shore With the Bruins he would go on to become one of the greatest players in NHL history Boston qualified for the then expanded playoffs by a comfortable margin In their first ever playoff run the Bruins reached the Stanley Cup Finals where they lost to the Ottawa Senators in the first Stanley Cup Finals to be between exclusively NHL teams The cup winning game for the Senators would see Bruin Billy Coutu attack the referee earning him a ban from the NHL

Bobby Bauer and left winger Woody Dumart br In the season Shore was traded to the struggling New York Americans for his final NHL season In the Bruins won their third Stanley Cup after losing only eight games and finishing first in the regular season It was their last Stanley Cup for years World War II affected the Bruins more than most teams Brimsek and the Krauts all enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force following the Cup win and lost the most productive years of their careers at war Cowley assisted by veteran player Clapper and Busher Jackson became the team s remaining star br br br Original Six era br The NHL had by been reduced for the next years to the six teams that would come to be called the Original Six br In Bruins Herb Cain set the then NHL record for points in a season with However the Bruins did not make the playoffs that season br The stars returned from World War II for the season and Clapper led the team back to the Stanley Cup Finals as player coach He retired as a player after the next season becoming the first player to play twenty NHL seasons Brimsek proved to be not as good as he was before the war and after the Bruins lost in the first playoff round three straight years After Brimsek was traded to the Blackhawks the only remaining quality young player was forward Johnny Peirson br During the season the original form of the spoked B logo with a small number to the left of the capital B signifying the calendar year in the th century in which the Bruins team first played and a similarly small to the right of the B appeared on their home uniforms The following season the logo was modified into the basic spoked B form that was to be used thereafter br br The s began with Charles Adams son Weston facing financial trouble He was forced to accept a buyout offer from Walter A Brown the owner of the Boston Celtics and the Garden in Although there were some instances of success such as making the Stanley Cup Finals in and only to lose

difficult reconstruction period in the early to mid s br br br Expansion and the Big Bad Bruins br Weston Adams repurchased the Bruins in after Brown s death Adams signed future superstar defenseman Bobby Orr who entered the league in Orr was that season s winner of the Calder Memorial Trophy for Rookie of the Year and named to the second NHL All Star Team Despite Orr s stellar rookie season the Bruins would miss the playoffs br The next season Boston made the playoffs for the first of straight seasons an all time record The Bruins then obtained forwards Phil Esposito Ken Hodge and Fred Stanfield from Chicago in a deal celebrated as one of the most one sided in hockey history Hodge and Stanfield became key elements of the Bruins success and Esposito who centered a line with Hodge and Wayne Cashman became the league s top goal scorer and the first NHL player to break the point mark setting many goal and point scoring records With other stars like forwards Bucyk John McKenzie Derek Sanderson and Hodge defenders like Dallas Smith and goaltender Gerry Cheevers the Big Bad Bruins became one of the league s top teams from the late s into the s br In a year Stanley Cup drought came to an end in Boston as the Bruins defeated the St Louis Blues in four games in the Final Orr scored the game winning goal in overtime to clinch the Stanley Cup The same season was Orr s most awarded the third of eight consecutive years he won the James Norris Memorial Trophy as the top defenseman in the NHL and he won the Art Ross Trophy the Conn Smythe Trophy and the Hart Memorial Trophy the only player to ever win four major awards in the same season br While Sinden temporarily retired from ice hockey before the season to enter business he was replaced by ex Bruins and Canadiens defenseman Tom Johnson the Bruins set dozens of offensive scoring records they had seven of the league s top ten scorers a feat not achieved before or since set the record for wins in a season and in a league that had never seen a point scorer before the season the Bruins had four that year All four Orr Esposito Bucyk and Hodge were named First Team All Stars Boston were favored to repeat as Cup champions but lost to the Canadiens and rookie goaltender Ken Dryden in seven games br While the Bruins were not quite as dominant the next season Esposito and Orr were once again one two in the scoring standings and Boston regained the Stanley Cup by defeating the New York Rangers in six games in the Finals br The season saw upheaval for the Bruins Former head coach Sinden became the general

three series two games to one br Continuing with Sinden s rebuilding of the team the Bruins traded Esposito and Carol Vadnais for Brad Park Jean Ratelle and Joe Zanussi to the Rangers The Bruins made the semifinals again losing to the Flyers before losing Orr as a free agent to Chicago in the off season br Cheevers returned in and the Bruins got past the Flyers in the semifinals but were swept by the Canadiens in the Stanley Cup Finals The story repeated itself in with a balanced attack that saw Boston have players with goal seasons still the NHL record as the Bruins made the Final once more but lost in six games to Montreal After that series John Bucyk retired holding virtually every Bruins career longevity and scoring mark to that time br The semifinal series against the Canadiens proved to be Cherry s undoing In the deciding seventh game the Bruins up by a goal were called for having too many men on the ice in the late stages of the third period Montreal tied the game on the ensuing power play and won in overtime Cherry was dismissed as head coach thereafter br br br Ray Bourque era br The season saw a new head coach Fred Creighton and also included a trade of goaltender Ron Grahame to the Los Angeles Kings for a first round pick which was used to select Ray Bourque one of the greatest defensemen of all time and the face of the Bruins for over two decades The Bruins made the playoffs every year through the s behind stars such as Park Bourque and Rick Middleton and had the league s best record in behind a Vezina Trophy winning season from ex Flyer goaltender Pete
