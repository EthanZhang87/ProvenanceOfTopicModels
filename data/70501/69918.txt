The Buffalo Sabres are a professional ice hockey team based in Buffalo New York The Sabres compete in the National Hockey League NHL as a member of the Atlantic Division in the Eastern Conference The team was established in along with the Vancouver Canucks when the league expanded to teams The Sabres have played their home games at KeyBank Center since having previously played at the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium since their inception The Sabres are owned by Terry Pegula who purchased the club in from Tom Golisano br The team has twice advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals losing to the Philadelphia Flyers in and to the Dallas Stars in The Sabres along with the Canucks are the oldest active NHL franchises to have never won the Stanley Cup The Sabres have the longest active playoff drought in the NHL and professional sports at seasons which stands as an NHL record br br br History br br br Early years and the French Connection br The Sabres along with the Vancouver Canucks joined the NHL in the season Their first owners were Seymour H Knox III and Northrup Knox scions of a family long prominent in Western New York and grandsons of the co founders of the Woolworth s variety store chain along with Robert O Swados a Buffalo attorney On the team s inaugural board of directors were Robert E Rich Jr later the owner of the Buffalo Bisons minor league baseball team and George W Strawbridge Jr an heir to the Campbell Soup Company fortune Buffalo had a history of professional hockey immediately prior to the Sabres establishment the Buffalo Bisons were a pillar of the American Hockey League AHL having existed since and before that another Bisons hockey team played from to winning the Calder Cup in their final season br Wanting a name other than bison a generic stock name used by Buffalo sports teams for decades the Knoxes commissioned a name the team contest With names like Mugwumps Buzzing Bees and Flying Zeppelins being entered the winning choice Sabres was chosen because Seymour Knox felt a sabre was a weapon carried by a leader and could be effective on both offense and defense The Knoxes tried twice before to get an NHL team first when the NHL expanded in and again when they attempted to purchase the Oakland Seals with the intent of moving them to Buffalo Their first attempt was thwarted when Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney persuaded his horse racing friends James and Bruce Norris to select Pittsburgh over Buffalo while the second attempt was due to the NHL not wanting an expansion market to give up on a team so soon nor isolate the Los Angeles Kings the only NHL team other than the Seals west of St Louis at the time from the rest of the NHL entirely At the time of their creation the Sabres exercised their option to create their own AHL farm team the Cincinnati Swords Former Toronto Maple Leafs general manager and head coach Punch Imlach was hired in the same capacity with the Sabres br The year the Sabres debuted was an important year for major league sports in Buffalo In addition to the Sabres debut the Buffalo Bills officially joined the National Football League and the National Basketball Association s Buffalo Braves also began to play sharing Memorial Auditorium with the Sabres The city of Buffalo went from having no teams in the established major professional sports leagues to three in one off season a situation that proved to be unsustainable Between the Braves and the Sabres the Sabres would prove to be by far the more successful of the two Paul Snyder the nouveau riche Braves owner publicly feuded with the old money Knoxes and the local college basketball scene eventually losing those feuds and being forced to sell his team in Subsequent owners of the Braves in a series of convoluted transactions tied to the ABA NBA merger moved the team out of Buffalo br When the Sabres debuted as an expansion team they took the ice to Aram Khachaturian s Armenian war dance Sabre Dance The music has been associated with the team as an unofficial anthem ever since It is often played between periods and after goals br The consensus was that the first pick in the NHL Amateur Draft would be junior phenomenon Gilbert Perreault Either the Sabres or the Canucks would get the first pick to be determined with the spin of a wheel of fortune Perreault was available to the Sabres and Canucks as this was the first year the Montreal Canadiens did not have a priority right to draft Quebec born junior players br The Canucks were allocated numbers on the wheel while the Sabres had When league president Clarence Campbell spun the wheel he initially thought the pointer landed on one While Campbell was congratulating the Vancouver delegation Imlach asked Campbell to check again As it turned out the pointer was on effectively handing Perreault to the Sabres Perreault scored goals in his rookie season of at the time a record for most goals scored by a NHL rookie and he received the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL s rookie of the year Despite Perreault s play the Sabres finished well out of playoff contention br br In the team s second season rookie Rick Martin drafted fifth overall by Buffalo in and Rene Robert acquired in a late season trade from the Pittsburgh Penguins joined Perreault and would become one of the league s top forward lines in the s Martin broke Perreault s record at once with rookie goals They were nicknamed The French Connection after the movie of the same name and in homage to their French Canadian roots The Sabres made the playoffs for the first time in just the team s third year in the league but lost in the quarterfinals in six games to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Montreal Canadiens br After a subpar year in that saw them miss the playoffs as well as aging defenseman Tim Horton s death in a DUI induced car accident the Sabres tied for the best record in the NHL in the regular season Buffalo advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in team history to play against the rough Philadelphia Flyers who had been recently nicknamed the Broad Street Bullies a series which included the legendary Fog Game Game of the series Due to unusual heat in Buffalo in May and the lack of air conditioning in the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium parts of the game were played in heavy fog that made players officials and the puck invisible to many spectators During a face off and through the fog Sabres center Jim Lorentz spotted a bat flying across the rink swung at it with his stick killing it It was the only time that any player killed an animal during an NHL game The Sabres won that game thanks to Rene Robert s goal in overtime However Philadelphia would wind up taking the Stanley Cup in six games winning the series br The French Connection joined by goal scorer Danny Gare continued to score prolifically for the Sabres in but the team lost in the quarterfinals to the New York Islanders The Sabres had success through the late s behind Gare and the French Connection Perreault Martin and Robert but they were unable to return to the Finals despite a Wales Conference championship in and being the first team to beat the Soviet Olympic Team when they toured the United States The French Connection era ended with Robert s trade to the Colorado Rockies in and Martin s trade to the Los Angeles Kings in by which time Martin s career was essentially finished as the result of a devastating knee injury in All three players have had their sweater numbers and respectively retired and a statue erected in their honor at KeyBank Center in br br br Adams Northeast Division rivalries br br In the NHL realigned its conferences and adopted an intra divisional playoff format for the first two rounds It was the beginning of an era in which the Sabres would finish in the middle of the Adams Division standings with regularity and then face the near certainty of having to get past either the Boston Bruins or Canadiens to make it to the conference finals Aside from first round victories over Montreal in and Boston in the era saw the Sabres lose to division rivals Boston the Quebec Nordiques and Montreal in the Adams Division semi finals first round a combined eight times and miss the playoffs altogether in and only third and fourth times out of the playoffs in franchise history Perrault reached the goal mark in the season and retired after playing games in years after joining the Sabres as their first draft pick br The Sabres drafted Pierre Turgeon with the first pick in the NHL Entry Draft and he quickly made an impact with the team During his rookie season in he helped the Sabres reach the playoffs for the first time in three years He was joined in by Alexander Mogilny who with the help of Sabres officials became the first Soviet player to defect to the NHL and cleared the way for all other Russian players to follow In the season the Sabres would improve to finish with points third best in the NHL but the playoff futility continued with a first round loss to Montreal The Sabres traded Turgeon to the New York Islanders in as part of a blockbuster seven player trade that brought Pat LaFontaine to Buffalo br In goaltender Dominik Hasek joined the team in a trade from the Chicago Blackhawks In the playoffs the Sabres upset the Bruins in a four game sweep in the Adams Division semi finals their first playoff series victory in ten years Brad May s series winning goal in overtime of Game in Buffalo was made famous by Rick Jeanneret s May Day call However the eventual Stanley Cup champion Montreal Canadiens swept the Sabres in the division final with the Sabres losing all four games by a score the last three games in overtime br With the NHL adopting a conference playoff format for the season the Sabres faced the New Jersey Devils in the Eastern Conference playoffs first round Despite Hasek winning a quadruple overtime goaltending duel with the Devils Martin Brodeur in Game the Sabres longest game ever which went into quadruple overtime Buffalo would lose the series in seven games Another first round playoff loss to the Philadelphia Flyers in the lockout shortened season was followed by a fifth place finish in the Northeast Division in as the team missed the playoffs for the first time in nine years It was the first season under head coach Ted Nolan and the last for the Sabres at Buffalo Memorial Auditorium Nolan brought an exciting brand of hockey to Buffalo During his coaching tenure Buffalo was referred to as the hardest working team in hockey This season also featured the debut of walk on veteran Randy Burridge who earned a spot on the roster after he attended training camp on a try out basis He scored goals that season and was second in team scoring to Pat LaFontaine Burridge also earned the Tim Horton Award for being the unsung hero and was voted team Most Valuable Player br The final game in Memorial Auditorium was played on April a victory over the Hartford Whalers Sabres principal owner Seymour Knox died a month later on May br br br The black and red era br br Ted Nolan and the Sabres rebounded in their first at Marine Midland Arena by winning their first division title in years with Nolan winning the Jack Adams Award as the NHL s top coach Dominik Hasek winning both the Hart and Vezina Trophies the first goaltender to do so since Montreal s Jacques Plante in Michael Peca taking home the Frank J Selke Trophy as the best defensive forward in the NHL and general manager John Muckler honored as Executive of the Year br However the regular season success was overshadowed by what had taken place during the playoffs Tensions between Nolan and Hasek had been high for most of the season After being scored upon in Game of the first round against the Ottawa Senators Hasek left the game forcing backup Steve Shields to step in Hasek claimed he felt his knee pop and the team doctor pronounced him day to day The Buffalo News columnist Jim Kelley wrote a column that night for the next day s newspaper that detailed the day s events which irked Hasek After the Senators won Game Hasek came out of the Sabres training room and attacked Kelley tearing his shirt Despite the fact Hasek issued an apology things went downhill after the incident Shields starred as the Sabres rallied to win the series against Ottawa But before the next series against the Philadelphia Flyers the NHL announced Hasek had been suspended for three games with the Sabres informing the NHL Hasek was healthy Hasek most likely would not have been suspended had he not been cleared to play Set to return in Game with the Sabres down by three games to none Hasek told the Sabres coaching staff he felt a twinge in his knee and left the ice after the pre game skate Shields turned in another season saving performance as Buffalo staved off elimination with a win in overtime Again before Game Hasek declared himself unfit to play and Buffalo lost and the series br Team president Larry Quinn fired general manager John Muckler who had a noted feud with Nolan Hasek who supported Muckler openly told reporters at the NHL Awards Ceremony he did not respect Nolan placing new general manager Darcy Regier in a tough position He offered Nolan just a one year contract for a reported Nolan refused on the grounds his previous contract was for two years Regier then pulled the contract off the table and did not offer another one ending Nolan s tenure as Sabres coach Nolan was offered several jobs from the Tampa Bay Lightning and New York Islanders which he turned down and was out of the NHL until June when he was named coach of the Islanders Former Sabres captain Lindy Ruff was hired as head coach on July agreeing to a three year contract The Sabres organization after having their most successful season in nearly two decades had fired both the reigning NHL Executive of the Year Muckler and Coach of the Year Nolan br br br New owners and return to the Finals br During the season the Sabres which had lost million over the previous three seasons and nearly missed payroll in December were sold by Northrop Knox to John Rigas owner of Adelphia Communications Shortly thereafter Quinn was dismissed and replaced by John Rigas son Timothy Rigas Behind Hasek left winger Miroslav Satan who led the team in scoring right winger Donald Audette center Michael Peca and several role playing journeymen including Matthew Barnaby the Sabres reached the Eastern Conference Finals that season but lost to the Washington Capitals in six games br br In Miroslav Satan scored goals The Sabres would add centers Stu Barnes from the Pittsburgh Penguins and Joe Juneau from the Capitals Michal Grosek had the best season of his career and the team finally returned to the Stanley Cup Finals this time against the Presidents Trophy winner the Dallas Stars In Game Stars winger Brett Hull s triple overtime goal ended the series and the Stars were awarded the Cup In it was illegal to score a goal if an offensive player s skate entered the crease before the puck did However NHL officials maintained that Hull s two shots in the goal mouth constituted a single possession of the puck since the puck deflected off Hasek The rule was changed for the following season allowing players to be inside the goaltender s crease as long as they do not interfere with the goaltender br The next year was a disappointing season The team struggled in the regular season due to injuries to Hasek as well as other tired and discouraged players Doug Gilmour was acquired from the Chicago Blackhawks at the trade deadline and sparked the Sabres to a playoff berth However Gilmour was stricken by stomach flu during the postseason and even Hasek s return could not prevent a first round playoff series loss to the Philadelphia Flyers Like the previous season there would be an officiating controversy In Game Flyers left wing John LeClair put the puck in the net through a hole in the mesh While replays appeared to show the puck entering through the side of the net the goal was allowed to stand The Flyers would win the game and go on to win the series four games to one br Captain Michael Peca sat out due to a contract dispute and was later traded to the New York Islanders in June in exchange for Tim Connolly and Taylor Pyatt Even so the Sabres still defeated Philadelphia in six games in the first round of the playoffs with a resounding victory in the series winning game In the second round they faced the underdog Pittsburgh Penguins led by rejuvenated superstar Mario Lemieux and captain Jaromir Jagr who had won his fifth Art Ross Trophy that season losing on a seventh game overtime goal scored by defenseman Darius Kasparaitis After lengthy and failed negotiations with their star goaltender the Sabres traded Hasek to the Detroit Red Wings in the summer of bringing a five year era of playoff success to a close Without Hasek and Peca the Sabres missed the playoffs br br br Ownership turmoil and lockout br In May John Rigas and his sons were indicted for bank wire and securities fraud for embezzling more than billion from Adelphia Rigas was later convicted and presently is appealing a sentence of years in prison The NHL took control of the team though the Rigas family remained owners on paper For a while there were no interested buyers After the two year period of uncertainty including rumors of relocating to another city or even straight out folding the team was sold to a consortium led by Rochester New York billionaire and former New York gubernatorial candidate Tom Golisano and former Sabres president Larry Quinn whose bid included no government funding Golisano was introduced as team owner on March br With the season having started under NHL control general manager Darcy Regier could make only minimal moves However with the consultations of impending new ownership the team began their rebuilding process around the March trade deadline by clearing out veteran players The first to go was winger Rob Ray who was sent to the Ottawa Senators The team then sent center and team captain Stu Barnes to the Dallas Stars in exchange for young winger Michael Ryan and a draft pick br A third deal sent center Chris Gratton to the Phoenix Coyotes with a draft pick for Daniel Briere and a draft pick adding a player who would play a key role in the Sabres resurgence in later years The season saw the team emerge from its financial struggles and though the Sabres narrowly missed the playoffs the development of prominent young players Although the NHL season was canceled due to a labor dispute the league and the National Hockey League Players Association NHLPA were able to agree on a new collective bargaining agreement in the summer of thus enabling NHL hockey to return for the season br br On January the Sabres lost their main cable television broadcaster as the Empire Sports Network which had been on the air since ceased operations in a cost cutting move during the Adelphia scandal and reorganization Like the Sabres Empire had been owned by Adelphia prior to the NHL s seizure of the franchise Adelphia sold their rights to Sabres telecasts and for the campaign Madison Square Garden Network MSG a New York City based channel which broadcasts New York Rangers New York Islanders and New Jersey Devils games took over the rights to broadcast Sabres games to television viewers in western New York with the Sabres controlling all aspects of the broadcast The agreement was later extended through then again through br In the Sabres took off finishing with their best record in over years and clinching their first playoff berth since the season The team finished the regular season with wins surpassing the win mark for the first time in franchise history They also finished with points their first point season in years and tied the club for the second best point total in franchise history The Sabres tied the Ottawa Senators and Carolina Hurricanes for the most wins in the Eastern Conference They finished with the fifth best record in the NHL behind Detroit Ottawa Dallas and Carolina br Buffalo defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in the first round of the playoffs in six games and top seeded Ottawa in five games The Sabres advanced to play Carolina in their first Eastern Conference Final since However injuries began to mount They were forced to play without four of their top defensemen Teppo Numminen Dmitri Kalinin Jay McKee and Henrik Tallinder and their top powerplay scorer Tim Connolly for much of the series Despite this the Sabres forced the series to seven games before falling to the eventual Stanley Cup champions Carolina The Sabres impressive season was recognized on June at the NHL Awards Ceremony when Lindy Ruff edged Hurricanes coach Peter Laviolette to win the Jack Adams Award as Coach of the Year in the closest vote in the award s history Ruff was the second Sabres coach to win the award br br br Return to blue and gold br br The Sabres started the season setting a new franchise record for consecutive wins to start a season and

and Chris Drury going to the New York Rangers as free agents The team also nearly lost Thomas Vanek to the Edmonton Oilers which offered him a seven year million offer sheet but the Sabres matched the offer on July After these events the team changed its policy of not negotiating contracts during the regular season Long time Sabres broadcast color commentator Jim Lorentz announced his retirement during the preseason Hockey Night in Canada s Harry Neale took over the position in October br br During the season the Sabres hosted a game against the Pittsburgh Penguins on January which was played outdoors at Ralph Wilson Stadium home of the National Football League s Buffalo Bills Officially the game was called the AMP Energy NHL Winter Classic known colloquially as the Ice Bowl due to it

finishing first overall in the regular season standings to finishing out of the playoffs the following year br On June the Sabres officially announced their new AHL affiliate beginning in the season would be the Portland Pirates from Portland Maine This ended their year affiliation with the Rochester Americans They signed with the Pirates for two seasons with a parent club option for a third The Sabres entered the free agency period quietly but on July signed goaltender Patrick Lalime to a two year contract Three days later the Sabres acquired Craig Rivet from the San Jose Sharks in exchange

on October in exchange for a third round and a conditional fourth round draft selection Paille s move to Boston marked the first ever trade of a player under contract between the two division rivals in their common years in the NHL On January the Sabres became the first team to win consecutive games when trailing by three or more goals since the Dallas Stars did it in Buffalo defeated the Atlanta Thrashers in overtime It was Buffalo s second straight win in a game it trailed following a victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins On March the day of the trade deadline the Sabres made two deals The

and Toni Lydman were allowed to leave as free agents while the team signed veterans Jordan Leopold and Shaone Morrisonn to replace them Additionally center Rob Niedermayer was added as a Stanley Cup winning veteran presence br br br The Pegula era present br br On November Ken Campbell of The Hockey News reported a story that billionaire Terry Pegula had signed a letter of intent to purchase the Sabres for US million Pegula was the founder president and CEO of East Resources one of the largest privately held companies in the United States before he sold the company After the report was released Sabres managing partner Larry Quinn claimed it was untrue but refused further comment The million was later determined to be an undervalued amount as Forbes magazine had valued the team at just under million in In December Pegula officially expressed interest in buying the Sabres for million and submitted a letter of intent to the NHL In January Golisano reportedly issued a counteroffer with an asking price of US million Pegula and Golisano reached an agreement to sell the team on January with Pegula purchasing the team for million million with million in debt included with the Sabres and Golisano officially making an announcement in a press conference on February NHL owners approved the sale on February br In the conference it was stated that an unnamed bidder submitted a much higher bid than Pegula s but made the bid contingent upon moving the team The description is consistent with that of Jim Balsillie who has made public his efforts to move a team to Hamilton Ontario a move the Sabres have actively opposed Terry Pegula named former Pittsburgh Penguins executive Ted Black to be team president Pegula was introduced as the Sabres owner in a public ceremony at HSBC Arena on February accompanied by what would be the final appearance of all three members of The French Connection before Rick Martin s death three weeks later Around the trade deadline the team attempted to trade Craig Rivet but was unsuccessful After initially clearing waivers Rivet entered re entry waivers and was claimed by the Columbus Blue Jackets Late on February the team acquired Brad Boyes from the St Louis Blues in exchange for a second round draft pick This was the Sabres sole trade of the deadline After Pegula s official takeover of the team the Sabres finished the regular season never losing two consecutive games in that span and landed the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference Pegula s approach was credited by players fans and the public with bringing new energy to the team sparking a run to the playoffs that seemed improbable only months earlier On April the Sabres clinched a playoff berth for the second consecutive season defeating the Philadelphia Flyers in overtime The Sabres clinched the seventh seed and faced Philadelphia in the first round The Sabres had a three games to two lead but lost the series in seven games br br br Playoff drought br The Sabres began the season as part of the NHL premiere series for the first time playing games in Finland and Germany The team was particularly well received during a game against Adler Mannheim in

Lindy Ruff named Jason Pominville the Sabres th full time captain in team history The Sabres began the season relatively strong but collapsed after a Boston Bruins game in which Bruins forward Milan Lucic hit and injured goaltender Ryan Miller the subsequent months saw the Sabres collapse to last place in the Eastern Conference Despite a two month rally that began in February along with the emergence of rookie forward Marcus Foligno the Sabres lost the last two games of the regular season and fell three points short of a playoff spot br br The NHL lockout eliminated the first part of the season which ultimately began with a scheduled games After a start to the season the contract of long time head coach Lindy Ruff was terminated by general manager Darcy Regier on February ending seasons as head coach Ruff was replaced by Ron Rolston first on an interim basis then permanently after the season ended Due to the lockout shortened season the trade deadline was moved to April In

NHL approval It was later revealed that draft picks were also involved in the deal the Wild would receive a fourth round pick in the draft and the Sabres would receive a first round pick in the draft and a second round pick in the draft br The following season on November the team dismissed general manager Darcy Regier and head coach Ron Rolston Former Sabres head coach Ted Nolan was named interim head coach for the remainder of the season he later signed a three year contract extension and Pat LaFontaine was named president of hockey operations On January Tim Murray was named general manager

William Carrier and two draft picks After just over three months as president of hockey operations Pat LaFontaine resigned from the Sabres to return to his previous position with the NHL on March Among highlights in the otherwise bad season included the butt goal in which a severely short staffed Sabres won their December contest against the Phoenix Coyotes when Coyotes goaltender Mike Smith backed into his own goal with the puck lodged in his pants and the lone NHL appearance of former Lancaster High School goaltender Ryan Vinz who was working as a videographer in the Sabres organization to suit up as a backup goaltender in the wake of the Ryan Miller trade The Sabres finished the season last in the NHL and again missed the playoffs br br Despite winning two more games than the previous season the season was much like the previous one with the team sitting near the bottom of the standings the entire season and finishing last in the NHL On March during a overtime loss to the Arizona Coyotes spectators at the game ostensibly fans of the Sabres cheered after a game winning goal by Coyotes center Sam Gagner Said fans were more eager to see the team lose the Sabres and Coyotes were th and th in the standings at the time in the hopes that it would ensure the team would deliberately lose to finish in last place and guarantee a top two pick in the NHL Entry Draft which included two extremely highly touted prospects Connor McDavid and Jack Eichel These spectators embrace the tank philosophy led to criticism from the media and Sabres players for how the fans reacted However some praised the fans for how they reacted saying that they did the right thing The Sabres clinched last place and therefore a top two pick with a loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets on April this was later confirmed to be a number two pick after the team for the second year in a row lost the draft lottery the team used the pick to select Eichel Murray fired Nolan at the end of the season citing a lack of chemistry and lukewarm relations between them On May Dan Bylsma was hired as the th head coach in franchise history br The hiring of Bylsma the drafting of Eichel and second overall pick Sam Reinhart the acquisition of star centerman Ryan O Reilly in the off season and the rising performance of youngsters Zemgus Girgensons Jake McCabe and Rasmus Ristolainen resulted in an improved season in Even though the Sabres again missed the playoffs for the fifth consecutive season the team managed to finish just under in points percentage while fans and critics have praised these rebuilding efforts by Sabres general manager Tim Murray br In mid the team announced that its television broadcasts would be spun off to their own regional sports network MSG Western New York The new network continues to operate under the MSG banner but under Pegula Sports and Entertainment control and features additional programs centered around the Sabres and the Buffalo Bills which the Pegulas purchased separately in The team failed to make significant progress and in fact slightly regressed in missing the playoffs for the sixth consecutive season leading to the firings of both head coach Dan Bylsma and general manager Tim Murray on April br br During the off season the Sabres hired two of their former players as head coach and general manager Jason Botterill as general manager and Phil Housley as head coach Among the more notable roster changes for this season was the return of former scoring leader Jason Pominville to the team in a trade that brought him and defenseman Marco Scandella to Buffalo in exchange for sending forwards Tyler Ennis and Marcus Foligno to the Minnesota Wild br On January the Sabres participated in the NHL Winter Classic losing in overtime to the New York Rangers br In the season Buffalo finished in last place in the NHL for the third time in five seasons and won the draft lottery for the NHL Entry Draft for the first time since using the

season after finishing last in the league the previous season The team won games in a row for the first time since the season and tied the franchise record Jeff Skinner became the seventh player in

midnight blue maize gold silver and white colors Front chest numbers were also added The new logo a stylized bison was widely reviled drawing unfavorable comparisons to a banana slug hence the nickname Buffaslug Despite the criticism five of the top ten player jerseys sold in the first two months of the season were Sabres slug designs Nevertheless the Sabres brought back the classic blue jerseys as a third jersey but continued to pair the look with the navy helmet and pants When the Reebok Edge template was unveiled in the Sabres kept their Buffaslug uniforms but the following season they released a new third jersey featuring the classic look depicted in the navy gold silver and white colors The Sabres also wore the original white uniforms during the Winter Classic br The third
