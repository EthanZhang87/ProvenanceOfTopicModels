WUPA channel branded Atlanta is an independent television station in Atlanta Georgia United States The station is owned by the CBS News and Stations group and maintains studios on Northeast Expressway I in unincorporated DeKalb County with an Atlanta mailing address its transmitter is located near Shepherds Lane and Arnold Avenue in the Woodland Hills section of northeastern Atlanta near North Druid Hills br Channel in Atlanta first began broadcasting in as WVEU Years of technical issues provoked by interference to mobile radio users and consequent limitations on the station s operating hours and signal strength contributed to the failure of subscription television STV and a music video service that operated the station WVEU s local founders sold the station to CBS in at a time when CBS needed to find a new affiliate in Atlanta but the network was able to negotiate to affiliate with another more built up station instead WVEU became an affiliate of UPN and was then sold to the Paramount Stations Group Under the new WUPA call sign Paramount substantially improved the station s programming and ratings in the years that followed before UPN was replaced with The CW in After successive owner Paramount Global sold the majority of its stake in The CW to Nexstar Media Group in WUPA disaffiliated from the network on September reverting to independent status br br br History br br br Construction land mobile dispute and STV years br br In the Federal Communications Commission FCC received two applications for new television stations to use channel in Atlanta On August the FCC awarded a construction permit to a consortium of Atlanta based investors known as Broadcast Corporation of Georgia BCG which proposed a hybrid operation consisting of conventional ad supported programming in the daytime and a subscription television STV service in evening hours According to BCG s majority owner and president Atlanta attorney David Harris when the backers of a California STV company visited him he thought they were seeking advice on how to build the station He was surprised to find out they wanted him to put together a consortium to run channel br The antenna atop the Peachtree Plaza Hotel from which channel would radiate had been hoisted into place in mid August days before the license decision was publicized The subscription programming would be supplied under the Superstar TV name by Subscription Television of Greater Atlanta a consortium originally reported to be co owned by Clint Murchison who had subscription television holdings in other cities including the Super TV service in the Washington D C and Baltimore markets and Atlanta electronics manufacturer Dynacom which would produce the decoders subscribers would need to view Superstar programming In actuality the owner was not Clint Murchison but Clyde A Murchison whom a article in The Atlanta Constitution described as Clint s great nephew br WVEU began broadcasting on August However a planned full launch on October had to be scuttled because the station s broadcasts on channel at the top of the TV band to MHz were interfering with two way land mobile radio transmissions Further the station had planned to fill daytime hours with programming from a business news service known as The Market Report which ran into financial difficulties and was unable to start on time Superstar TV was able to begin operating before the end of the year with an official kickoff held on January The FCC continued to curtail WVEU s operating hours WVEU was only allowed to sign on after p m on weekdays and after p m on Saturdays though it was allowed to operate all day on Sundays It only offered commercial non STV programming on Sundays from a m to pm running Superstar TV at all other times it was on the air br The two way radio dispute continued to loom large over every facet of WVEU s operations for several years as the station subsisted on production contracts In June the FCC ruled that the station could begin operating at percent power before p m if it paid an estimated to relocate all of the land mobile users affected by interference However these users protested the decision and filed for reconsideration with the commission In February the FCC ordered the station to engage the users or pay them to relocate on penalty of losing the provisional program test authority under which WVEU had operated since While the dispute was resolved by July when the FCC granted a full license to BCG the issue had doomed Superstar TV which filed for bankruptcy in April and made its last broadcasts on the morning of July with fewer than subscribers br br br The independent years br To replace Superstar TV WVEU signed an operating agreement with VideoMusic Channel which had broadcast music videos on Atlanta area cable systems to program nearly all of channel s airtime The station brought the programming in house in August before eventually canceling it altogether and replacing it with syndicated shows and reruns because it learned music videos were not very salable to advertisers That same year negotiations were held and an initial agreement reached to sell the station to the RBP Corporation of Massachusetts but no transaction was consummated br The station also made its first entry into the television sports market airing what was to be a package of Atlanta Hawks NBA games in the season with John Sterling as the play by play announcer This package was whittled down to games because of insufficient advertiser interest A new game package was carried in the following season this time with the Hawks selling the advertising time the Hawks later added a game at The Omni that sold out their first home telecast in two years br br Through the mid s WVEU became Atlanta s television station of last resort while a stabilizing WATL channel and a growing WGNX channel became the city s primary local independents In a article by Prentis Rogers in The Atlanta Constitution it was described as the city s quicker picker upper constantly airing shows that the local network affiliates passed on These included CBS s morning news program under the titles of the CBS Morning News The Morning Program and CBS This Morning from through and its late night programming as well as numerous preempted network sports telecasts that the local affiliates could not air due to scheduling conflicts Beyond displaced network programs WVEU featured an eclectic mix a function of being what Business Atlanta writer Russell Shaw called the poor cousin of Atlanta independent television There were telecasts of martial arts movies under the banner Black Belt Theater and later hosted by Morgus the Magnificent a character first introduced decades prior in Detroit and New Orleans professional wrestling a weekday public access show Community The Auto Doctor a locally produced weekly magazine show about cars and jazz music video show Jazz Beat After another proposed sale this one to the Home Shopping Network in fell through the station added Japanese language programming under the title Station to its morning lineup br br br Almost a CBS affiliate br br On May as a result of the network winning the rights to air NFC football games New World Communications announced an affiliation deal with Fox to switch the affiliations of most of New World s stations to the network One of the stations involved was Atlanta s longtime CBS affiliate WAGA TV channel which would replace Fox owned WATL as that network s Atlanta outlet The New World deal was attractive to Fox because many of its stations were CBS affiliates in NFC markets This left CBS in the position of seeking a new Atlanta area affiliate br In July BCG approached CBS and proposed to sell WVEU to the network Two months later CBS had still not lined up a new affiliate in Atlanta even though WAGA was due to join Fox at year s end Unable to find a higher profile station CBS agreed to buy WVEU for million and relaunch it as a CBS owned and operated station On the same day CBS announced it was buying another lower tier independent in a major market WGPR TV in Detroit As was the case in Atlanta CBS was being displaced from its longtime affiliate in Detroit as a result of the New World Fox deal Bill Carter of The New York Times characterized the purchases of WVEU and WGPR TV as little more than acquisitions of broadcasting licenses since both stations lacked the facilities and staff typical of network affiliates CBS faced having to mount an unprecedented campaign to build up WVEU to a level commensurate with a major market owned and operated station This would have entailed major expenses in promotion and starting a local news department One consultant interviewed by The Atlanta Journal Constitution estimated that CBS would have to spend as much as million over several years to upgrade WVEU Those expenses potentially included replacing channel s facilities off I which were of inadequate size for a full service news producing station owned by a major network It also faced losing significant viewership in northeastern Georgia as WVEU s signal did not penetrate nearly as far into this region as that of WAGA Additionally while CBS was guaranteed to have most of its programming air in Atlanta after years of rampant pre emptions on WAGA it faced the prospect of a sharp ratings decline for the CBS Evening News until it could build a local news department to serve as a lead in For the outgoing Broadcast Corporation of Georgia the sale to CBS was an unexpected windfall Harris for instance stood to make as much as million a substantial return on his investment of years prior WVEU had never turned a profit in its entire history in it became cash flow positive for the first time br As continued CBS took only minimal steps to close on the WVEU purchase The network actively sought a better partner even if it was only an affiliate It continued to negotiate with Fox and with Tribune Broadcasting then owner of WGNX By mid November CBS had not filed paperwork for the deal at the FCC even though WAGA was scheduled to join Fox within a month CBS executives refused to confirm that they were still moving forward with the deal On November it was announced that CBS would not be moving to WVEU but instead to WGNX CBS had preferred to move to a station that already aired local news WGNX was the only independent station in the market that already had a functioning news department CBS committed to buy WVEU and immediately resell it br br br UPN affiliation br Even though channel was not to be the CBS affiliate in Atlanta WVEU emerged from the sale to CBS having secured a valuable network affiliation Two new networks UPN and The WB were due to launch in By the time The WB announced an affiliation with WATL starting in January UPN still had not signed up an Atlanta affiliate With no other realistic options available UPN signed an agreement with WVEU in December a month before its launch Behind UPN came a buyer the Paramount Stations Group which began to negotiate with CBS to acquire WVEU Paid programming was reduced from hours a week to and stronger syndicated and UPN shows lifted channel s ratings br In May CBS agreed to sell WVEU to Viacom the parent company of the Paramount Stations Group for million to stay under the station ownership limit of the time the company sold one of its non UPN stations KSLA in Shreveport Louisiana After closing on the purchase Viacom began a significant makeover of the station This included a new call sign WUPA for United Paramount Atlanta which it assumed on December as well as a more aggressive stance to purchasing syndicated programming Household ratings tripled and the network recognized WUPA as its first affiliate of the year br In the late s WUPA began to add local sports programming When TBS converted from a superstation to a basic cable channel it was forced to reduce the number of Atlanta Braves baseball games it telecast WUPA picked up an game package of Braves games sold by TBS for the season which became a game package for before being reclaimed for the new Turner South regional cable channel in When Atlanta got a hockey team the new Atlanta Thrashers aired games a year on WUPA The Hawks returned to channel in after years when their existing carrier WHOT TV channel was sold to be changed to Spanish language programming br Over the course of the early s WUPA sought to bolster its local identity It changed its branding from UPN to UPN Atlanta in and began producing non news specials it also sponsored the Music Midtown festival br br br The CW br br On January the Warner Bros unit of Time Warner and CBS Corporation which had been created as a result of the split of Viacom at the start of the year announced that the two companies would shut down The WB and UPN and combine the networks respective programming to create a new fifth network called The CW the day of the announcement it was revealed that of CBS Corporation s UPN affiliates including WUPA would become CW stations br br br Return to independence br On October Nexstar Media Group acquired majority ownership of The CW Under the agreement CBS was given the right to pull its affiliations from WUPA and its seven other CW stations On May CBS announced it would exercise that right and WUPA would cease airing the network s programming at the end of August returning to independent status The CW affiliation was moved to Gray Television owned WPCH TV as part of a larger contract extension between Gray and the network The station was rebranded as Atlanta as part of a larger naming convention among the disaffiliated stations highlighting the city and channel number br br br Local programming br br br Newscasts br On April NBC affiliate WXIA TV began producing a half hour prime time newscast at p m for WUPA titled UPN Atlanta News at Ten This program for which WXIA TV sold the advertising was accompanied by a separately produced live half hour talk program at p m titled Atlanta Tonight Up against stiff competition from the incumbent p m newscast on WAGA both programs seen on channel suffered and the p m newscast and Atlanta Tonight were canceled on August for economic reasons br On January CBS Television Stations announced that it would be introducing a nightly p m newscast for WUPA produced by New York City sister station WCBS TV the program debuted February In March following the temporary shutdown of the CBS Broadcast Center during the COVID pandemic in New York City and for the next five months WUPA began simulcasting WBZ News at from sister station WSBK TV in Boston with local coverage limited to a news ticker and prerecorded weather forecasts br On August the Atlanta oriented newscast was relaunched with production shifted to KTVT in Fort Worth Texas On July this newscast was relaunched as Atlanta Now News under a new hybrid local national format which continued to be produced from Fort Worth On September the Now format was discontinued elsewhere in favor of newscasts produced by the parent CBS O O However WUPA would maintain the branding moving it to an p m timeslot and shifting production back to WCBS TV br In addition to the newscast WUPA produces a weekly public affairs program called Focus Atlanta br br br
