known as Molson Centre The Canadiens previously played at the Montreal Forum which housed the team for seven decades and all but their first two Stanley Cup championships br Founded in the Canadiens

Arizona Cardinals The franchise is one of the Original Six the teams that made up the NHL from until the expansion The team s championship season in marked the last time a Canadian team won the Stanley Cup br The Canadiens have won the Stanley Cup more times than any other franchise having earned championships with victories since the founding of the NHL and since when NHL teams became the only ones to compete for the Stanley Cup The Canadiens also had the most championships by a team of any of the four major North American sports leagues until the New York Yankees won their th World Series title in br br br History br br The Canadiens were founded by J Ambrose O Brien on December as a charter member of the National Hockey Association br the forerunner to the National Hockey League It was to be the team of the francophone community in Montreal composed of francophone players and under francophone ownership as soon as possible The founders named the team Les Canadiens a term identified at the time with French speakers The team s first season was not a success as they placed last in the league After the first year ownership was transferred to George Kennedy of Montreal and the team s record improved over the next seasons The team won its first Stanley Cup championship in the season In with four other NHA teams the Canadiens formed the NHL and they won their first NHL Stanley Cup during the season led by Howie Morenz The team moved from the Mount Royal Arena to the Montreal Forum for the season br The club began the s decade successfully with Stanley Cup wins in and The Canadiens and its cross town rivals the Montreal Maroons who stopped playing after the NHL season declined both on the ice and economically during the Great Depression Losses grew to the point where the team owners considered selling the team to interests in Cleveland Ohio though local investors were ultimately found to finance the Canadiens The Maroons suspended operations and several of their players moved to the Canadiens br br Led by the Punch Line of Maurice Rocket Richard Toe Blake and Elmer Lach in the s the Canadiens enjoyed success again atop the NHL From to the franchise won six Stanley Cups including a record five straight from to with a new set of stars coming to prominence Jean Beliveau Dickie Moore Doug Harvey Bernie Boom Boom Geoffrion Jacques Plante and Richard s younger brother Henri br The Canadiens added ten more championships in seasons from to with another dynastic run of four straight Cups from to In the season the Canadiens set three still standing team records fewest losses in an game season the longest home unbeaten streak and best goal differential and one record that lasted until the Boston Bruins beat it for the most points in an game season The next season the team had a game unbeaten streak the second longest in NHL history The next generation of stars included Guy Lafleur Yvan Cournoyer Ken Dryden Pete Mahovlich Jacques Lemaire Pierre Larouche Steve Shutt Bob Gainey Serge Savard Guy Lapointe and Larry Robinson Scotty Bowman who would later set a record for most NHL victories by a coach was the team s head coach for its last five Stanley Cup victories in the s br The Canadiens won Stanley Cups in led by rookie star goaltender Patrick Roy and in continuing their streak of winning at least one championship in every decade from the s to the s this streak came to an end in the s In the Habs moved from the Montreal Forum their home during seasons and Stanley Cups to Molson Centre now called Bell Centre br Following Roy s departure in the Canadiens fell into an extended stretch of mediocrity missing the playoffs in four of their next ten seasons and failing to advance past the second round of the playoffs until By the late s with both an ailing team and monetary losses exacerbated by a record low value of the Canadian dollar Montreal fans feared their team would end up relocated to the United States Team owner Molson Brewery sold control of the franchise and the Molson Centre to American businessman George N Gillett Jr in with the right of first refusal for any future sale by Gillett and a condition that the NHL Board of Governors must unanimously approve any attempt to move to a new city Led by club president Pierre Boivin the Canadiens returned to being a lucrative enterprise earning additional revenues from broadcasting and arena events In Gillett sold the franchise to a consortium led by the Molson family which included The Woodbridge Company BCE Bell the Fonds de solidarit FTQ Michael Andlauer Luc Bertrand and the National Bank Financial Group for million more than double the million he spent on the purchase eight years prior br During the season the Canadiens celebrated their th anniversary with various events br including hosting both the NHL All Star Game br and the NHL Entry Draft br The Canadiens became the first team in NHL history to reach victories with their victory over the Florida Panthers on December br br For the season the league moved the Canadiens along with the other six teams from Canada to the North Division Due to the COVID pandemic the Canadiens only played against teams in the division in the regular season to avoid travel restrictions between the United States and Canada All teams in the division played without fans to begin the season The Canadiens advanced through the Stanley Cup playoffs beating the Toronto Maple Leafs in the first round of the playoffs overcoming a Maple Leafs lead in the series The Canadiens then swept the Winnipeg Jets in the second round advancing to the Stanley Cup semifinals The Canadiens defeated the Vegas Golden Knights in the semifinals clinching an overtime victory in Game of the series and reaching their first Stanley Cup Finals in years whilst also being the first Canadian team to reach the Finals since the Vancouver Canucks in Montreal lost the Finals to the Tampa Bay Lightning games to br In the Canadiens were unable to replicate their success from the prior season ultimately finishing last in the league for the first time since the season and the first time in the NHL s expansion era in what was one of the worst seasons in the team s history In the process they set team records for most regulation losses most goals against fewest wins and fewest points while their point percentage was the team s third worst ever after only and As a result team owner Geoff Molson authorized a rebuild of the roster over an extended period a first in the modern history of the franchise The Canadiens finished fifth last in the subsequent season br br br Team identity br br The Canadiens organization operates in both English and French For many years public address announcements and press releases have been given in both languages and the team website and social media outlets are in both languages as well At home games the first stanza of O Canada is sung in French and the chorus is sung in English br br br Crest and sweater design br br One of sport s oldest and most recognizable logos the classic C and H of the Montreal Canadiens was first used together in the season when the club changed its name to Club de hockey Canadien from Club athl tique Canadien before evolving to its current form in The H stands for hockey not Habitants a popular misconception According to NHL com the first man to refer to the team as the Habs was American Tex Rickard owner of the Madison Square Garden in Rickard apparently told a reporter that the H on the Canadiens sweaters was for Habitants In French the Habitants nickname dates back to at least when it was printed in Le Devoir to report a win over Toronto on the ninth of February br The team s colours since are blue white and red The home sweater is predominantly red in colour There are four blue and white stripes one across each arm one across the chest and the other across the waistline The main road sweater is mainly white with a red and blue stripe across the waist red at the end of both arm sleeves red shoulder yokes The basic design has been in use since and took its current form in generally evolving as materials changed Because of the team s lengthy history and significance in Quebec the sweater has been referred to as La Sainte Flanelle the holy flannel sweater br Since the Canadiens home red sweater is the only uniform in the league to feature the French language version of the NHL shield logo LNH on the neck collar in acknowledgment of Montreal s French Canadian heritage The road white sweater retains the English NHL shield logo br The Canadiens used multiple designs prior to adopting the aforementioned design in The original shirt of the season was blue with a white C The second season had a red shirt featuring a green maple leaf with the C logo and green pants Lastly the season before adopting the current look the Canadiens wore a barber pole design jersey with red white and blue stripes and the logo being a white maple leaf reading CAC Club athl tique Canadien All three designs were worn during the season as part of the Canadiens centenary br In the season the Canadiens unveiled a Reverse Retro alternate uniform in collaboration with Adidas The uniform was essentially the same as their regular red uniform but with blue as the primary colour and red as the stripe colour A second Reverse Retro uniform was released in the season again using the same template but with red relegated to the logo only and featuring a light blue base with white dark blue white stripes br The Canadiens colours are a readily identifiable aspect of French Canadian culture In the short story The Hockey Sweater Roch Carrier described the influence of the Canadiens and their jersey within rural Quebec communities during the s br The story was later made into an animated short The Sweater narrated by Carrier br A passage from the short story appears on the issue of the Canadian five dollar bill br br br Motto br Nos bras meurtris vous tendent le flambeau vous toujours de le porter bien haut br To you from failing hands we throw the torch Be yours to hold it high br The motto is from the poem In Flanders Fields by John McCrae which was written in the year before the Canadiens won their first Stanley Cup championship The motto appears on the wall of the Canadiens dressing room as well as on the inside collar of the new Adidas jerseys br br br Mascot br br Beginning in the NHL season the Canadiens adopted Youppi as their official mascot the first costumed mascot in their long history Youppi was the longtime mascot for the Montreal Expos baseball team but was dropped from the franchise when they moved to Washington D C in and became the Washington Nationals With the switch Youppi became the first mascot in professional sports to switch leagues He is also the first mascot in professional sports to get ejected from a game In June Youppi became the first mascot from a Canadian based club to be honoured in The Mascot Hall of Fame Youppi s induction in the Mascot Hall of Fame was decided by a long voting process which included the public vote br In the Canadiens introduced an unofficial official mascot for its Reverse Retro series of games that season br br br Rivalries br br The Canadiens have developed strong rivalries with two fellow Original Six franchises with whom they frequently shared divisions and competed in postseason play The oldest is with the Toronto Maple Leafs who first faced the Canadiens as the Toronto Arenas in The teams met times in the playoffs including five Stanley Cup Finals Featuring the two largest cities in Canada and two of the largest fanbases in the league the rivalry is sometimes dramatized as being emblematic of Canada s English and French linguistic divide From to they were the only two Canadian teams in the league br The team s other Original Six rival are the Boston Bruins who since their NHL debut in have played the Canadiens more than any other team in both regular season play and the playoffs combined The teams have played playoff series seven of which were in the finals br The Canadiens also had an intraprovincial rivalry with the Quebec Nordiques during their existence from to nicknamed the Battle of Quebec br br br Broadcasting br br Montreal Canadiens games are broadcast locally in both the

channel in Canada until the launch of TVA Sports and was also the previous national French rightsholder of the NHL as a result the Canadiens forwent a separate regional contract and allowed all of its games to be televised nationally in French as part of RDS s overall NHL rights br With TVA Sports becoming the national French rightsholder in the season through a sub licensing agreement with
