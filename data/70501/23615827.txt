The Calgary Flames are a professional ice hockey team based in Calgary The Flames compete in the National Hockey League NHL as a member of the Pacific Division in the Western Conference and are the third major professional ice hockey team to represent the city of Calgary following the Calgary Tigers and Calgary Cowboys The Flames are one of two NHL franchises based in Alberta the other being the Edmonton Oilers The cities proximity has led to a rivalry known as the Battle of Alberta br The team was founded in in Atlanta as the Atlanta Flames before relocating to Calgary in The Flames played their first three seasons in Calgary at the Stampede Corral before moving into the Scotiabank Saddledome originally the Olympic Saddledome in In the Flames became the first Calgary team since the Tigers to compete for the Stanley Cup In the Flames won their first and only Stanley Cup title The Flames unexpected run to the Stanley Cup Finals gave rise to the Red Mile and in the team hosted and won the second Heritage Classic outdoor game br The Flames have won two Presidents Trophies as the NHL s top regular season team and have claimed eight division championships Individually Jarome Iginla is the franchise leader in games played goals and points and is a two time winner of the Maurice Rocket Richard Trophy as the NHL s leading goal scorer Miikka Kiprusoff has the most wins by a

also own a Western Hockey League franchise the Calgary Hitmen a National Lacrosse League franchise the Calgary Roughnecks a Canadian Football League franchise the Calgary Stampeders and an American Hockey League franchise the Calgary Wranglers Through the Flames Foundation the team has donated over CA million to charity throughout southern Alberta since the franchise arrived br br br Franchise history br br br Atlanta Flames br br The Flames were the result of the NHL s first pre emptive strike against the upstart World Hockey Association WHA In December the NHL hastily granted a team to Long Island the New York Islanders in an attempt to keep the WHA s New York Raiders out of the recently completed Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum Needing another team to balance the schedule the NHL awarded a team to the Atlanta based group that owned the National Basketball Association s Atlanta Hawks headed by prominent local real estate developer Tom Cousins Cousins named the team the Flames after the fire resulting from the March to the Sea in the American Civil War by General William Tecumseh Sherman in which Atlanta was nearly destroyed They played home games in the Omni Coliseum in downtown Atlanta br The Flames were relatively successful early on Under head coaches Bernie Boom Boom Geoffrion Fred Creighton and Al MacNeil the Flames made the playoffs in six of eight seasons in Atlanta In marked contrast their expansion cousins the Islanders won only games during their first two years in the league combined However this success did not carry over to the playoffs as the Flames won only two postseason games during their time in Atlanta br Despite the on ice success the Atlanta ownership was never on sound financial footing Longtime general manager Cliff Fletcher said years later that Cousins initial financial projections for an NHL team did not account for the WHA entering the picture The Flames were also a poor draw and never signed a major television contract br In Cousins was in considerable financial difficulty and was forced to sell the Flames to stave off bankruptcy With few serious offers from local groups he was very receptive to an offer from Canadian entrepreneur and former Oilers owner Nelson Skalbania He was fronting a group of Calgary businessmen that included oil magnates Harley Hotchkiss Ralph T Scurfield Norman Green Doc and Byron Seaman and former Calgary Stampeders great Norman Kwong A last ditch effort to keep the team in Atlanta fell short and Cousins sold the team to Skalbania for US million a record sale price for an NHL team at the time On May Skalbania announced that the team would move to Calgary He chose to retain the Flames name feeling it would be a good fit for an oil town like Calgary while the flaming A logo was replaced by a flaming C Skalbania sold his interest in and the Flames have been locally owned since br br br Early years in Calgary br Unlike the WHA s Calgary Cowboys who folded three years earlier the Flames were immediately embraced by the city of Calgary While the Cowboys could manage to sell only season tickets in their final campaign of the Flames sold full and half season ticket packages in the seat Stampede Corral br br Led by Kent Nilsson s goal point season the Flames qualified for the playoffs in their first season in Calgary with a record good for third in the Patrick Division The team found much greater playoff success in Calgary than it did in Atlanta winning their first two playoff series over the Chicago Black Hawks and Philadelphia Flyers before bowing out to the Minnesota North Stars in the semi finals This early success was not soon repeated After a losing record in Fletcher jettisoned several holdovers from the Atlanta days who could not adjust to the higher pressure hockey environment and rebuilt the roster Over the next three seasons he put together a core of players that remained together through the early s br Fletcher s efforts to match the Oilers led him to draw talent from areas previously neglected by the NHL The Flames were among the earliest teams to sign large numbers of U S college players including Joel Otto Gary Suter and Colin Patterson Fletcher also stepped up the search for European hockey talent acquiring Hakan Loob and other key players He was among the first to draft players from the Soviet Union including CSKA Moscow star Sergei Makarov in but Soviet players were not released to Western teams until Still the team was sufficiently improved to challenge the Oilers who required the maximum seven games to defeat the Flames en route to their Stanley Cup Championship br In the Flames moved into their new home the Olympic Saddledome now known as the Scotiabank Saddledome Located on the grounds of the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede the Saddledome was built as a venue for the Winter Olympics In three seasons in the Corral the Flames lost only home games The Saddledome hosted the NHL All Star Game in a victory by the Wales Conference br br br Presidents Trophies and Stanley Cup Finals br The players acquired by Fletcher matured into one of the strongest teams in the NHL during the mid s and early s From to the Flames tallied points in every season but one However they were usually unable to transform that success into a deep playoff run largely because they could not get the better of their provincial rivals the powerhouse Edmonton Oilers The Oilers and Flames usually finished at or near the top of the Campbell Conference and were usually among the best teams in the entire league during this time However the NHL s playoff structure of the time made it very likely the Flames would meet the Oilers in either the first or second round rather than in the Campbell Conference finals That same structure made it very likely that the other two playoff qualifiers in the Smythe Division would have to get past the Flames or Oilers or both in order to make it to the conference finals From until either the Oilers or the Flames represented the Campbell Conference in the Stanley Cup Finals br By the Flames landed forwards Doug Risebrough Lanny McDonald and Dan Quinn defenceman Al MacInnis and goaltender Mike Vernon Finishing second in the Smythe with a record the only season from to in which they did not finish with or more points the Flames swept the Winnipeg Jets in the first round of the playoffs setting up a showdown with the Oilers Edmonton finished points ahead of Calgary during the season and was heavily favoured to win a third Cup in a row However the Flames upset the Oilers in seven games the only time the Flames defeated the Oilers in a playoff series in the decade The series winning goal came when an errant clearing attempt by Steve Smith ricocheted off goaltender Grant Fuhr s leg and into his own net The goal remains one of the most legendary blunders in hockey history br From there the Flames went on to the Campbell Conference Finals where they defeated the St Louis Blues in another seven game series This time Calgary had to survive a scare of its own shaking off the Monday Night Miracle at the St Louis Arena Trailing by a score of with ten minutes to play in the third period of Game the Blues mounted a furious comeback to send the contest into overtime where Doug Wickenheiser scored to force a deciding seventh game Calgary won Game at home advancing into the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time The Flames proved to be no match for the Montreal Canadiens losing the championship series in five games Montreal rookie goaltender Patrick Roy was nearly unbeatable in the last two games allowing only four goals en route to winning the Conn Smythe Trophy br The Flames followed up their run to the Finals with their best regular season to that point Calgary s record in was good for third overall in the NHL behind the Oilers and Philadelphia Flyers However the Flames were unable to duplicate their playoff success of a year prior losing their first round match up with the Jets in six games The season was also difficult off the ice as first round draft pick George Pelawa was killed in a car accident prior to the season s start br Under new head coach Terry Crisp the Flames recorded their first point season in earning the Presidents Trophy for having the NHL s best record and ending the Oilers six year reign atop the Smythe Division in the process Joe Nieuwendyk became the second rookie in NHL history to score at least goals in a season earning the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year Looking to bolster the line up for a playoff run the Flames traded young sniper Brett Hull along with Steve Bozek to the Blues in exchange for Rob Ramage and Rick Wamsley on March However their playoff frustrations continued after defeating the Los Angeles Kings in five games as Calgary was swept out of the playoffs in four straight by the Oilers br In the Flames continued to improve They captured their second consecutive Presidents Trophy with a franchise record points finishing points better than the second place Kings in the Smythe Division Fletcher continued to tinker with the roster acquiring Doug Gilmour as part of a six player deal at the trade deadline In the playoffs the Flames were stretched to seven games in the first round by the Vancouver Canucks They relied on several saves by goaltender Mike Vernon including a famous glove save off a Stan Smyl breakaway in overtime The save remains a defining moment in Flames history br The Flames then made short work of the Kings defeating them in four straight before eliminating the Chicago Blackhawks in five games to set up a rematch of the Stanley Cup Finals against Montreal This time the Flames won in six games the last being a victory in Montreal on May The clinching win was especially significant in that it marked the only time that an opposing team defeated the Canadiens to win the Stanley Cup on Montreal Forum ice Al MacInnis captured the Conn Smythe as playoffs most valuable player while long time captain Lanny McDonald announced his retirement The Stanley Cup win gave Flames co owner Sonia Scurfield Ralph s widow the distinction of being the first and as of only Canadian woman to have her name engraved on the Cup It also made Kwong one of the few to have his name on both the Stanley Cup and the Grey Cup br In due in part to Cliff Fletcher s diplomatic efforts the Soviets gave permission for a select group of Soviet hockey players to sign with NHL teams The first of these players was Sergei Pryakhin Although Pryakhin never became an NHL regular his arrival blazed a trail for the large number of Russian players who entered the NHL beginning in Sergei Makarov joined the Flames that season and though already in his s became the fifth Flame to win the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL s Rookie of the Year The selection proved controversial prompting the NHL to amend the rules to exclude any player over age from future consideration That season the team fell two points shy of their third straight Presidents Trophy with points Also that season they won their third straight Smythe Division title In the playoffs they were dethroned in six games by the Los Angeles Kings They did not win another playoff series until one of the longest such droughts in NHL history br br br Playoff contention to playoff drought br In Fletcher left the Flames to become the general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs He had been the team s general manager since its inception in He was succeeded in Calgary by Doug Risebrough and the two quickly completed a ten player mega trade that saw disgruntled forward Doug Gilmour dealt to Toronto with four other players in exchange for former goal scorer Gary Leeman and four others The trade transformed both clubs The formerly inept Leafs turned into a contender almost immediately while Leeman scored only goals in a Flames uniform Despite the blossoming of Theoren Fleury into an NHL star the Flames missed the playoffs entirely in only a year after finishing with their third point season in franchise history It was the first time the Flames had missed the playoffs since when they were still in Atlanta It was also only the third time out of the playoffs in the franchise s year history br Calgary rebounded to make the playoffs for the next four seasons including two consecutive division titles However they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs each time The and Division titles led to Game overtime home defeats in the opening round to the Canucks and San Jose Sharks respectively In the season Joe Nieuwendyk was traded to the Dallas Stars in a deal that acquired Jarome Iginla Iginla made his Flames debut in the playoffs during which the Flames again lost in the first round a four game sweep by the Blackhawks In only two years after winning their second consecutive division title the Flames missed the playoffs and did not return for seven years The low point came in the season in which the Flames finished with only points the second lowest point total in franchise history behind only the Atlanta Flames br br During this time the Flames found it increasingly difficult to retain their best players as salaries escalated while the Canadian dollar lost value against the American dollar Calgary has always been one of the smallest markets in the NHL it is currently third smallest behind only Edmonton and Winnipeg and the NHL s small market Canadian teams found it increasingly difficult to compete in the new environment In for example the Flames traded Fleury to the Colorado Avalanche midway through the season The trade came shortly after Fleury became the franchise s all time leading scorer Fleury was due to become an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season and the Flames did not want to risk losing him without getting anything in return br As the Flames sank in the standings their attendance also sagged For most of their first years in Calgary Flames tickets were among the toughest to get in the NHL However by attendance had fallen off so severely that the owners issued an ultimatum buy more season tickets or the team would join its departed counterparts in Winnipeg and Quebec City in leaving for the United States The fans responded by buying enough season tickets to keep the Flames in Calgary for the season The Flames issued another appeal for more season tickets in the summer of The campaign aimed at increasing season ticket sales from a franchise low of to proved successful However the increased sales did not halt the Flames financial losses as the team estimated it lost million between and br One of the few bright spots in this stretch was Iginla who captured the Maurice Rocket Richard and Art Ross Trophies in as NHL goal and point scoring champion after scoring goals and points Iginla again won the Rocket Richard Trophy tied with Rick Nash and Ilya Kovalchuk with goals in Another bright spot for the team during this time was defenceman Robyn Regehr who became the youngest nominee ever for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy which recognizes perseverance sportsmanship and dedication to hockey Regehr had suffered two broken legs in a car accident the summer of but recovered in time to play games at age br During the season the Flames hired Darryl Sutter as the team s head coach replacing Greg Gilbert who was fired as the Flames languished in last place in the Western Conference Sutter also became the team s general manager following the season and is credited with revitalizing the franchise Among Sutter s first moves was to acquire goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff whom he had previously coached in San Jose early in the season Kiprusoff responded by setting a modern NHL record for lowest goals against average GAA at br br br Jarome Iginla era and Western Conference champions br After seven consecutive seasons of not making the playoffs the Flames finally returned to the postseason in They became the first team in the league s history to defeat three division champions en route to becoming the first Canadian team to make it to the Stanley Cup Finals since the Canucks in The Flames first victim was the Northwest Division champion Vancouver Canucks whom they defeated in seven games It was the Flames first playoff series win since they won the final br The Flames then upset the Presidents Trophy winning Detroit Red Wings in six games After eliminating the Pacific Division champion San Jose Sharks also in six games in the Western Conference Final the Flames earned a trip to the Stanley Cup Finals to face the Tampa Bay Lightning Martin Gelinas scored the winning goal in all three series The Canadian Embassy in Washington D C flew the Flames flag beside the Maple Leaf while Prime Minister Paul Martin dubbed the Flames Canada s team br br The final series went to seven games with the Flames suffering a controversial non goal in Game at home Replays showed Martin Gelinas may have scored what would have been the go ahead goal late in the third period however the referees never signalled a goal and later replays were ruled inconclusive The goal would have made Gelinas the only player in NHL history to score the winning goal in every playoff series en route to winning the Stanley Cup The Lightning went on to win the game in double overtime before winning game seven at home to capture the Stanley Cup Despite the loss fans packed into Olympic Plaza to celebrate the Flames run br The Flames did not raise their Western Conference championship banner for nearly months as the season was wiped out by a labour dispute During the lock out team owner and chairman of the board Harley Hotchkiss attempted to save the season by engaging in discussions with National Hockey League Players Association NHLPA president Trevor Linden While their discussions failed to save the season Hotchkiss was credited with easing tensions that allowed for a successful negotiation of a new collective agreement br The Flames played their th season in Calgary in finishing with points It was their best total since the Cup winning season and good enough to capture their first division title in years However the Flames lost to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in seven games during the first round of the playoffs Miikka Kiprusoff captured both the William M Jennings and Vezina Trophies as the NHL s top goaltender while Dion Phaneuf s goals was the third highest total for a rookie defenceman in NHL history br The off season began with a trade for Alex Tanguay formerly of the Colorado Avalanche and with Sutter relinquishing his head coaching position to assistant Jim Playfair so he could focus on his duties as general manager Despite a marked improvement in team offence and a solid point season it was only good enough for eighth place in a Western Conference where seven teams cracked the point barrier In the playoffs Calgary fell in six games to the top seeded Detroit Red Wings in the first round During the series the Flames were fined by the NHL for several stick related penalties in the fifth game Notably backup goaltender Jamie McLennan was suspended five games for slashing Red Wings forward Johan Franzen Franzen scored the series clinching goal in the Game defeat in double overtime br Prior to the start of the season the Flames demoted Playfair to associate coach bringing in Mike Keenan as the team s third head coach in three years During the season Jarome Iginla became the Flames all time leader in games played passing Al MacInnis mark of Iginla also passed Theoren Fleury s mark of goals to become the Flames all time goalscoring leader on March Despite another solid season with points they only garnered the seventh seed in the Western Conference They fell in the Western Conference quarter finals to the Pacific Division champion San Jose Sharks in seven games Iginla continued to set franchise records in surpassing Fleury s franchise mark of points and scoring his th goal on the same night against the Tampa Bay Lightning The team failed to advance past the first round of the playoffs being eliminated by the Chicago Blackhawks in six games resulting in the dismissal of head coach Mike Keenan after two seasons Brent Sutter was named his successor on June but the Flames failed to qualify for the playoffs in the season br br br End of the Iginla era br The Flames struggled to begin the NHL season falling to th place in the conference at the Christmas break Consequently the organization asked Darryl Sutter to step aside as general manager The team named assistant Jay Feaster the interim general manager in his place making it permanent following the season The team pulled itself back into playoff contention following the change but once again failed to qualify for the playoffs br br Calgary hosted the Heritage Classic the NHL s second outdoor game of the year at McMahon Stadium on February The Flames defeated the Montreal Canadiens before spectators Miikka Kiprusoff became the first goaltender to record a shutout in an NHL outdoor game Jarome Iginla reached two major milestones late in the season he became the tenth player in NHL history to score at least goals in ten consecutive seasons and scored his th career point all with the Flames with a goal against the St Louis Blues on April Iginla also scored his th career goal on January against the Minnesota Wild He scored the goal against goaltender Niklas Backstrom en route to a Flames victory br On March long time captain and player Jarome Iginla was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for prospects Kenny Agostino and Ben Hanowski and a first round pick in Morgan Klimchuk leaving the team without a captain for the first time The Flames missed the playoffs once again in selecting Sean Monahan sixth overall at the NHL Entry Draft after the season br br br Giordano Monahan Gaudreau era br br Prior to the beginning of the season Mark Giordano was named as the new captain of the Flames Aided from a goal rookie effort from Monahan the Flames nonetheless endured a poor season watching co leading scorers Mike Cammalleri and Lee Stempniak leave in free agency in the summer However a bright spot came in the season s final game against the Vancouver Canucks as fourth round draft pick Johnny Gaudreau made his much anticipated debut after winning the Hobey Baker Award at Boston College the day before Gaudreau recorded his first NHL goal in the contest the lone goal in a Flames loss br In the season the Flames led by Mark Giordano Sean Monahan Johnny Gaudreau and Jiri Hudler won one of their final home games against the Los Angeles Kings to clinch their first playoff berth since eliminating the defending champion Kings from playoff contention in the progress They eliminated the Vancouver Canucks in six games in the first round of the playoffs for their first playoff series

his career best point season good for eighth in the NHL with the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy for most gentlemanly player br In the season the Flames faced heightened expectations after their surprising year These expectations were bolstered after the unexpected acquisition of Dougie Hamilton from the Boston Bruins for a first round pick and two second round picks at the NHL Entry Draft However along with the other six Canadian teams the Flames failed to qualify for the playoffs As a result in May head coach Bob Hartley was relieved of his duties He was replaced by former Vancouver Canucks assistant coach Glen Gulutzan Aided by their poor finish the Flames were able to select Matthew Tkachuk with the sixth selection at the NHL Entry Draft br br The Flames acquired veterans Troy Brouwer Kris Versteeg Alex Chiasson Brian Elliott and Chad Johnson in the off season but overshadowing these additions were the ongoing negotiations with pending restricted free agents Sean Monahan and Johnny Gaudreau Monahan agreed to a seven year contract worth million on August Gaudreau held out through the pre season before signing a six year million contract on October Bolstered by the emergence of the M Line composed of Tkachuk Mikael Backlund and Michael Frolik the Flames rebounded to make the playoffs in the season as the conference s first wild card seed but they were swept by the Anaheim Ducks in the first round br However during the season the Flames once again failed to qualify for the playoffs and Glen Gulutzan was relieved of his coaching duties in mid April Bill Peters was hired as head coach on April The season was highlighted by the Flames debut of Jaromir Jagr in October but the Czech former star only lasted games in Calgary scoring points br The Flames made several changes to their roster before the season including a blockbuster trade with the Carolina Hurricanes at the NHL Entry Draft agreeing to send Dougie Hamilton Micheal Ferland and Adam Fox to the Hurricanes in exchange for Noah Hanifin and Elias Lindholm Flames general manager Brad Treliving was also active in free agency signing scoring winger James Neal from Vegas on a five year contract

Alberta since br br br High profile turnover present br The off season was marked by the departures and arrivals of many star players Both Gaudreau and Tkachuk became free agents in July The Flames attempted to retain Gaudreau reportedly offering him an eight year million contract extension instead the year old forward signed a seven year deal to join the Columbus Blue Jackets in unrestricted free agency Gaudreau explained that the move was for personal reasons particularly after his father who lives in the eastern United States suffered a heart attack in Shortly thereafter Tkachuk who was a restricted free agent said he did not want to sign a long term deal in Calgary After filing for club elected salary arbitration the Flames traded Tkachuk and a conditional fourth round draft pick to the Florida Panthers in exchange for forward Jonathan Huberdeau defenceman MacKenzie Weegar prospect Cole Schwindt and a conditional first round selection on July As part of the trade negotiations Tkachuk signed an eight year million contract with the Flames before being traded to the Panthers Then on August the Flames traded Monahan and a conditional first round pick in to the Montreal Canadiens for future considerations in a move designed to free up salary cap space The move made room for the Flames to secure one more high profile free agent in the summer Colorado Avalanche star

owned by Theoren Fleury Two years later in the Flames bought the team for million During the NHL lock out the Flames heavily marketed the Hitmen and as a result the team led all professional or junior

Calgary on Stephen Avenue In announcing the venture Flames President and CEO Ken King stated While hockey remains our core competency we are constantly seeking new opportunities in which to grow the Flames brand and allow our fans greater opportunities to enjoy hockey We believe establishing a location outside of the Pengrowth Saddledome to share food fun and hockey will bring our fans even

jersey introduced at the start of the campaign were so strong during the playoffs that manufacturer CCM stopped production on all other team jerseys in order to keep up with demand of Flames uniforms The team set a league record for sales of a new uniform design The tradition of the C of Red dates back to the Stanley Cup playoffs against the Oilers Oiler fans were donning hats promoting Hat Trick Fever in their quest for three straight Stanley Cups Flames fans countered by wearing red In the playoffs against Winnipeg the Jets responded to the C of Red by encouraging fans to wear white creating the Winnipeg whiteout During the Flames games when The Star Spangled Banner is sung fans shout the words see and red to signify the C of Red theme In December Calgary rock band The Dudes and the

incidents were minimal despite the large number of people in a small area br In April the Calgary Police Service announced that Red Mile gatherings would not be encouraged and that measures would be taken to discourage them including traffic diversions a zero tolerance policy on noise and rowdy behaviour and the presence of plain clothed officers among the crowd to ticket offenders After meeting

red and yellow stripes and solid red jerseys with yellow and white stripes In the Flames modified their jersey design adding black to the team s colour scheme The new striping pattern included a diagonal set of stripes from the base of the jersey on the player s right side coming up to just below the logo The contrasting shoulder panels on both jerseys were extended down the sleeves and contained the striping pattern on the forearms For the season the Flames reintroduced the Atlanta logo as their alternate captain s patch and briefly experimented with using a smaller version of the flaming C as a captain s patch Although the C was soon reverted to match the jersey s nameplate the A logo patch remained in use until the team returned to their original design for the season br In to celebrate the Year of the Cowboy the Flames introduced its inaugural third jersey design featuring the flaming horse logo on a black background Two years later the jersey became the Flames road jersey while the home jersey was updated to incorporate the same V style striping on the arms and waist of the jersey This jersey was once again relegated to third jersey status in when the NHL adopted the coloured jerseys for the home team br In with the introduction of the Rbk Edge jersey the Flames updated their look once again replacing the horizontal striping with vertical striping down the sides To honour the team s heritage the Flames added the flags of Alberta and Canada as shoulder patches In celebration of their th season in Calgary the Flames wore their original jersey design for five games in each against a Canadian opponent The version of the jersey was produced in the traditional style that preceded the Edge redesign for the following season the throwback design was adapted to the Edge format as the Flames new regular third jersey br For the Heritage Classic the Flames were matched against the Montreal Canadiens at McMahon Stadium For this event game the Flames wore uniforms inspired by the Calgary Tigers the city s first professional hockey team from the s which represented the Western Canada Hockey League in the Stanley Cup Finals against the Canadiens The Flames adapted the Tigers black and gold jerseys to darker shades of their own colours maroon and burnt yellow with a yellow stripe across the chest and alternating stripes on the sleeves The flaming C logo and pants were cream coloured adding to the vintage look of the uniform br In the Flames introduced a new third jersey to replace their throwback uniform The newest design is Western inspired with a script Calgary in black across the front of the jersey and black shoulders with points on the front mimicking cowboy wear This uniform was used until the season after which the throwback third uniforms used from to were revived anew br The Flames retained their current uniform look when the NHL switched to Adidas as its uniform provider in with the exception of player names and numbers going from an italicized to a straight alignment The throwback red alternates were not used during the season due to the suspension of the third jersey program but were restored in the following season br The Heritage Classic against the Winnipeg Jets at Regina s Mosaic Stadium featured the return of the Flames original white uniform in the modern AdiZero cut br In the Flames promoted the throwback alternate and Heritage Classic uniforms to primary status while retaining the black trimmed red uniforms as an alternate Also in November along with the rest of the league the Flames released their Reverse Retro jersey It is very similar to the alternate dark jersey with some slight modifications The largest difference is that there are only two stripes a yellow and red one and nothing below those stripes The black trimmed red uniforms were retired after the season In the Blasty black uniform returned as an alternate adding the sublimated flame marks on the sleeves Also in the Flames unveiled their second Reverse Retro uniform using the uniform but with black as the base colour br For the Heritage Classic the Flames wore cream based uniforms inspired by the Calgary
