the game against Slovakia so the Swedes would face Switzerland in the quarterfinals instead of Canada or the Czech Republic Shortly before the game Sweden coach Bengt ke Gustafsson was reported to have publicly contemplated tanking in order to avoid those teams saying about Canada and the Czechs One is cholera the other the plague During the game itself one reportedly suspect sequence came when Sweden had an extended five on three powerplay with five NHL stars on the ice Peter Forsberg Mats Sundin Daniel Alfredsson Nicklas Lidstr m and Fredrik Modin and failed to put a shot on net Sports Illustrated writer Michael Farber would say about this particular powerplay If the Swedes had passed the puck any more their next opponent would have been the Washington Generals They were even afraid to shoot Russian coach Vladimir Krikunov said br As part of a subsequent interview about the championship over five years later Forsberg was interpreted to insinuate that Sweden lost their preliminary round game against Slovakia on purpose so as to draw Switzerland as their quarterfinal opponent rather than Canada or the Czech Republic Swedish forward Henrik Sedin who played alongside Forsberg on the team denied the notion while adding that Forsberg s comments in the interview were misconstrued br br br Playoff round br br br Bracket br br br Quarterfinals br br br Semifinals br br br Bronze
