The Winnipeg Jets were a professional ice hockey team based in Winnipeg They began play in the World Hockey Association WHA in The club joined the National Hockey League NHL in after the NHL merged with the WHA Due to mounting financial troubles in the franchise moved to Phoenix Arizona and became the Phoenix Coyotes the former name of the now inactive Arizona Coyotes The team played their home games at Winnipeg Arena br br br Franchise history br br br The WHA years br On December Winnipeg was granted one of the founding franchises in the WHA The original owner was Ben Hatskin a local figure who made his wealth in cardboard shipping containers The team took their name from the Winnipeg Jets of the Western Canada Hockey League br The Jets first signing was Norm Beaudin earning the player the moniker of the Original Jet while the first major signing was Bobby Hull Hull s acquisition partially financed by the rest of the WHA s teams gave the league instant credibility and paved the way for other NHL stars to bolt to the upstart league br The Jets were the first North American club to seriously explore Europe as a source of hockey talent Winnipeg s fortunes were bolstered by acquisitions such as Swedish forwards Anders Hedberg and Ulf Nilsson who starred with Hull on the WHA s most famous and successful forward line nicknamed the Hot Line and defenceman Lars Erik Sjoberg who would serve as the team s captain and win accolades as the WHA s best defenceman Behind these players and other European stars such as Willy Lindstrom Kent Nilsson Veli Pekka Ketola leavened by players such as Peter Sullivan Norm Beaudin and goaltender Joe Daley the Jets were the most successful team in the short lived WHA The team made the finals in five of the WHA s seven seasons winning the Avco World Trophy three times including in the league s final season against Wayne Gretzky and the Edmonton Oilers br Another notable accomplishment was the Jets victory over the Soviet National team on January br In the WHA s last season Kent Nilsson scored points while Morris Lukowich had goals and Peter Sullivan had goals and points During the Avco Cup Finals Gary Smith gave up the last goal in WHA history to Dave Semenko in a Jets win br br br Career leaders WHA br Games Bobby Hull br Goals Bobby Hull br Assists Ulf Nilsson br Points Bobby Hull br Penalty Minutes Kim Clackson br

vast majority of the WHA s teams had folded but the Jets were still going strong After the season the Jets were absorbed into the NHL along with the Nordiques Oilers and Hartford Whalers Pre merger inter league exhibitions had shown that the WHA Jets were the competitive equal of most NHL teams with the possible exceptions of the three time defending Stanley Cup champion Montreal Canadiens and the rising New York Islanders br However the Jets had to pay a very high price for a berth in the more established league They had to give up three of their top six scorers the core of the last WHA champion in a reclamation draft They were also forced to draft th out of teams In the draft they opted to protect defenceman Scott Campbell who had shown a good deal of promise in the last WHA season However Campbell suffered from chronic asthma that was only exacerbated by Winnipeg s frigid weather The asthma drove him out of the league entirely by br Upon entering the NHL the Jets were based in the Smythe Division of the Campbell Conference However with a decimated roster the Jets finished dead last in the league for their first two seasons in the NHL including a horrendous nine win season in that still ranks as the worst in Jets Coyotes history This stands in marked contrast to the other Avco Cup finalist the Oilers who went on to dominate the league during the second half of the s br The Jets first two wretched NHL seasons did net them high draft picks in the draft they picked Dave Babych second overall and in they drafted future Hall of Fame member Dale Hawerchuk first overall The team developed a solid core of players by the mid s with Hawerchuk Thomas Steen Paul MacLean Randy Carlyle Laurie Boschman Doug Smail and David Ellett providing a strong nucleus Also in a league wide realignment placed the Jets with the league s other Central Time Zone teams in the Norris Division which over the course of the decade would become the weakest division in the league br Led by Hawerchuk Steen Babych and Carlyle the Jets returned to respectability fairly quickly and made the playoffs times in the next years However regular season success did not transfer over into the playoffs This was because after just one season in the Norris the relocation of the Colorado Rockies to New Jersey compelled Winnipeg to return to the more competitive Smythe Division along with the Oilers and Calgary Flames by some accounts the two best teams in the league during the second half of the s Due to the way the playoffs were structured at the time whenever the Jets made the playoffs they faced the near certainty of having to beat either the Oilers or the Flames or both to get to the Campbell Conference Finals At the time the top four teams in each division made the playoffs with the regular season division winner playing against the fourth place team and the regular season runner up playing the third place team in the division semifinals The division semifinal winners advanced to the division finals and the two division final winners would meet in the conference finals br For example in they finished with the fourth best record in the entire league behind only Philadelphia Edmonton and Washington They also notched points which would remain the franchise s best as an NHL team until the Coyotes racked up the franchise s second point season and first as an NHL team However they finished second in the Smythe behind the Oilers While they managed to dispatch the Flames with the league s fifth best record in four games in the best of five division semifinal they were swept by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Oilers in the division final In fact Winnipeg and Edmonton played each other in the playoffs six times between and The Oilers not only won every series but also held the Jets to only four total victories Five times and the Oilers went on to win the Stanley Cup The Jets won only one more playoff series in defeating Calgary in the division semifinal before losing to Edmonton in the division final It was not until the season that further expansion and re alignment permitted the original Jets to return to the re branded Central Division the former Norris Division of the Western Conference By this time however the Central was at least the competitive equal of the re named Pacific Division and the strict division based playoff bracket had been abandoned br br br Demise and relocation br As the NHL expanded in the United States and free agency rules were liberalized operating costs and salaries grew rapidly players had the leverage to demand being paid in U S dollars league wide Until about the early s Canadian teams were able to pay their players in Canadian dollars with the exceptions being contracts acquired in trades from U S teams However since the Canadian teams still collected most of their revenue in Canadian dollars having to pay players in U S dollars proved to be a serious drain on finances given the declining value of the Canadian dollar For most of their NHL tenure Winnipeg was the league s second smallest market and was set to become the smallest market after the Quebec Nordiques moved to Denver as the Colorado Avalanche in Despite a loyal fan following serious doubts were raised about whether Winnipeg could continue to support an NHL team Additionally their home arena Winnipeg Arena was over years old had no luxury suites and numerous obstructed view seats br Faced with mounting losses Jets owner Barry Shenkarow agreed to sell the team to American businessmen Steven Gluckstern and Richard Burke for million They planned to move the team to the Minneapolis Saint Paul region which had lost the Minnesota North Stars to Dallas in In response a local consortium called the Spirit of Manitoba was assembled While they persuaded Shenkarow to delay the proposed sale to American interests long enough that the Jets ultimately remained in Winnipeg for the season it eventually became apparent that the Spirit of Manitoba consortium was far too undercapitalized to purchase the franchise and underwrite expected losses while a proposed new arena was built br Meanwhile Gluckstern and Burke failed to reach an agreement with the City of Minneapolis to share the Target Center with the NBA s Minnesota Timberwolves They purchased the team nevertheless but with no suitable alternate venues in the Twin Cities area the Jets new owners reached an agreement with Jerry Colangelo owner of the NBA s Phoenix Suns to move the team to Phoenix and become the Phoenix Coyotes The Jets managed to qualify for the playoffs in their final season in Winnipeg and played their last game on April a home playoff loss to the Detroit Red Wings by a score of Norm Maciver scored the last goal in Jets history br br br Aftermath br Winnipeg was not left without a professional ice hockey team for the season as the International Hockey League s Minnesota Moose moved to Winnipeg to become the Manitoba Moose a few months after the Jets left town br The NHL ultimately returned to Winnipeg years later with the Atlanta Thrashers relocating to become the second incarnation of the Jets franchise which is owned by True North Sports Entertainment Prior to this True North submitted a series of bids for the financially troubled Coyotes in October which were taken seriously enough that the league drew up a tentative schedule with Winnipeg in place of Phoenix The NHL shelved the bid after securing a large subsidy from the Coyotes municipal government As True North s low key approach was praised by NHL commissioner Gary Bettman this placed True North in a favorable position once question of the Thrashers relocation came up br The new Jets despite reclaiming the name and subsequently the original franchise s logos retained the Thrashers franchise records rather than the records of the original Jets br br During their history the Jets retired two numbers Bobby Hull s and Thomas Steen s The Coyotes have continued to honor those numbers and hang their banners in the Jets old blue red white colour scheme Dale Hawerchuk s No was added in in the Coyotes current sand red black scheme Another tradition that was retained when the franchise moved to Phoenix was the whiteout in which fans wore all white to home playoff games br Shane Doan drafted seventh overall by the Jets in the NHL Entry Draft prior to their last season in Winnipeg and who played his rookie season in Winnipeg was the last original Jet to still be active in the NHL and to still be with the franchise upon his retirement in The only other former original Jet playing professionally by that time was Deron Quint who played in the German DEL in Germany until br The current Winnipeg Jets have acknowledged the original Jets history on a number of occasions The original franchise s division and Avco Cup championships currently hang atop the rafters of Canada Life Centre as are the honoured numbers of the original Jets who were inducted into the current Jets Hall of Fame They have also worn throwback uniforms of the original Jets on a few occasions and brought back the Whiteout tradition in the Stanley Cup playoffs The new franchise acquired the trademarks to the name and logo of the original Jets from the NHL when it moved to Winnipeg at the time the league directly owned the Coyotes and thus controlled the Jets trademarks However the franchise s records still belong to the Coyotes br In April after years of instability the Coyotes suspended operations with their assets including players and hockey operations staff being transferred to the new Utah Hockey Club Unlike the Thrashers relocation to Winnipeg which saw all records transferred the Coyotes entered inactivity with their intellectual property remaining in Phoenix Coyotes owner Alex Meruelo was granted a five year window to construct a new arena in the Phoenix area upon which automatic expansion would have been triggered to re activate the Coyotes However in late June Meruelo opted to discontinue his efforts to build an arena and re activate the team ceding the Coyotes intellectual property back to the NHL and leaving the fate of the Jets Coyotes records uncertain br br br Uniforms br The Jets debuted in the WHA wearing blue and white uniforms with red trim White uniforms featured a blue shoulder yoke blue numbers and blue white red white blue waist sock and sleeve stripes The blue uniforms were the inverse of their white counterparts minus the contrasting yoke and used red numbers In the franchise s first season the uniforms featured the futuristic Jets wordmark in front along with red or white player nameplates Starting in the Jets donned their classic look ditching the contrast colour nameplates and unveiling their famous roundel logo In the Jets added a white shoulder yoke on the blue uniform and the following season switched from red to blue pants br Upon moving to the NHL in the Jets unveiled new uniforms Then general manager John Ferguson Sr had been derided for changing the classic New York Rangers uniforms during the late s so he brought most elements of that design to the Jets Both uniforms featured a thick shoulder stripe that extended through the sleeves along with another thick stripe on the waist In addition the blue uniforms now featured white numbers with red trim and a white inverse of the team s logo in front In the Jets added a Goals for Kids patch which remained a prominent figure on the uniforms until the relocation br In the Jets unveiled their final uniform design featuring the updated crest in front and contrasting sleeve and waist stripes They also switched back to red pants br The current incarnation of the Winnipeg Jets employs a different uniform design and logo although they occasionally use the old Jets uniform as an alternate jersey For the season a Reverse Retro jersey was introduced in collaboration with Adidas The jersey was designed to emulate the original Jets look but used colors of the current Jets Before the season the blue WHA era uniform the modern day Jets wore in the Heritage Classic became the team s third jersey A second Reverse Retro jersey this time a recoloured version of the Jets white uniform was released in the season br br br Winnipeg White Out br The Winnipeg White Out is a hockey tradition that dates back to when fans were asked to wear white clothing to home playoff games creating a very intimidating effect and atmosphere It was created as a response to the C of Red created by fans of the Calgary Flames whom the home town Jets were facing in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs The Jets eliminated the Flames in six games and fans wore white for every home playoff game thereafter Fans dubbed it the White Out which is a prairie term for a winter snow storm Marketing for the team during the playoff referred to the charge of the white brigade In later years marketing referred to the White Out as White Noise br Fans of the AHL franchise Manitoba Moose also continued this tradition when the team briefly relocated to St John s Newfoundland as the St John s IceCaps as did fans of the IceCap s White Out and Coyotes White Out respectively When the Thrashers moved to Winnipeg as the second incarnation of the Jets they brought back the White Out tradition for all playoff appearances for the
