moving to Moline Illinois which at that time was part of an area then known as the Tri Cities Moline Illinois Rock Island Illinois and Davenport Iowa br Upon relocation to Moline the team was renamed

the year old NBL and the three year old Basketball Association of America BAA They reached the playoffs in the NBA s inaugural year under the leadership of coach Red Auerbach The following season they drafted three time All American Bob Cousy but they were unable to reach a deal and traded him to the Chicago Stags who would later surrender him in a dispersal draft to the Boston Celtics when the Stags folded The Blackhawks finished last in the Western Division and missed the playoffs By then it was obvious that the Tri Cities area was too small to support an NBA team After the season the franchise relocated to Milwaukee and became the Milwaukee Hawks br br br St Louis and The Bob Pettit era br br In the Hawks drafted Bob Pettit a future NBA MVP Despite this the Hawks were one of the league s worst teams and in the Hawks moved this time to St Louis Missouri Milwaukee s rival in the beer industry and became the St Louis Hawks br In Bob Pettit captured the league s first official

the Finals losing to the Boston Celtics in a double overtime thriller in game seven In after tallying their first winning record they again advanced to the Finals where they avenged their defeat against the Celtics from the previous year winning the series and giving the Hawks their first and only NBA Championship Bob Pettit scored points in the final game of the series The following season Bob Pettit led the Hawks to a Western Division best record helping him capture his second MVP award br The Hawks remained one of the NBA s premier teams for the next decade In under coach Ed Macauley

Celtics in the NBA Finals again and lost in five games They would remain contenders for most of the s advancing deep into the playoffs and also capturing several division titles br br br Relocation to Atlanta br Despite the success Kerner became weary of the Hawks longtime home Kiel Auditorium The year old arena seated only and was starting to show its age The Hawks occasionally played at the larger St Louis Arena mostly against popular opponents but Kerner was not willing to move the team there full time because it had not been well maintained since the s Even though it was being heavily renovated to accommodate the arrival of the National Hockey League s NHL St Louis Blues in Kerner was still not willing to move to the St Louis Arena He wanted a new arena to increase revenue However Kerner was rebuffed by the city on several occasions In early Kerner briefly put the Hawks up for sale One of the bidders was a New Orleans group led by future talk show host Morton Downey Jr but the deal collapsed and Kerner temporarily took his team off the market br Unable to resolve the arena situation Kerner sold the Hawks to Atlanta real estate developer Tom Cousins and former Georgia governor Carl Sanders who moved the team to Atlanta in While a new arena was being constructed the team spent its first four seasons playing at Alexander Memorial Coliseum on the campus of Georgia Tech winning their first Division title in the season with a record in the Western Division Cousins firm soon developed the Omni Coliseum a seat state of the art downtown Atlanta arena for the Hawks

inside a circle remained as the team s logo albeit simplified br The years after the move showcased a talented Hawks team including Pete Maravich and Lou Hudson However after this period of success the team experienced some years of rebuilding Despite appearing to be moving in the right direction when they ended up with the first and third picks overall in the NBA draft the players drafted with those two picks David Thompson of North Carolina State and Marvin Webster of Morgan State both signed with the Denver Nuggets of the American Basketball Association ABA and never played for the Hawks br br br Ted Turner s ownership br Cable network entrepreneur and Atlanta Braves owner Ted Turner bought the team in and hired Hubie Brown to become head coach The Hawks were the only NBA team in the

steel that was intended to rust into a seal around the arena so it could last for decades However the designers and architects did not reckon on Atlanta s humid subtropical climate As a result it never stopped rusting and looked somewhat dated despite being years old When Turner won an NHL franchise the Atlanta Thrashers one condition was that a new arena had to be in place before the new team
