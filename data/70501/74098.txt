of new members can be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as players builders or on ice officials The builders category includes coaches general managers commentators team owners and others who have helped build the game The category for on ice officials was added in and a veteran player category was established in The purpose of the category was to provide a vehicle for players who may have been overlooked and whose chances for election would be limited when placed on the same ballot with contemporary players Eleven players were inducted into that category but in the Board of Directors eliminated it the players who had been inducted under this category were merged into the player category br Candidates for membership in the Hockey Hall of Fame are nominated by an person selection committee The committee includes Hockey Hall of Fame members hockey personnel and media personalities associated with the game the membership is representative of areas throughout the world where hockey is popular and includes at least one member who is knowledgeable about international hockey and one member who is knowledgeable about amateur hockey Committee members are appointed by the Board of Directors to a three year term The terms of the committee members are staggered so that each year there are six newly appointed or reappointed members As of November the selection committee includes chairman John Davidson James M Gregory Chairman Emeritus and committee members David Branch Brian Burke Colin Campbell Cassie Campbell Pascall Mark Chipman Bob Clarke Marc de Foy Michael Farber Ron Francis Mike Gartner Anders Hedberg Jari Kurri Igor Larionov Pierre McGuire Bob McKenzie David Poile and Luc Robitaille br Each committee member is allowed to nominate one person in each

a maximum of four players two builders and one on ice official are inducted as members Player and on ice officials must have not participated in a professional or international game for a minimum of three years to be eligible for nomination Builders may be active or inactive br br The waiting period was waived for ten players deemed exceptionally notable Dit Clapper Maurice Richard Ted Lindsay Red Kelly Terry Sawchuk Jean Beliveau Gordie Howe Bobby Orr Mario Lemieux and Wayne Gretzky Following Gretzky s induction the Board of Directors determined that the waiting period would no longer be waived for any player except under certain humanitarian circumstances Three Hall of Fame members came out of retirement after their induction and resumed a career in the National League Gordie Howe Guy Lafleur and Mario Lemieux Chris Pronger and Shea Weber were inducted in and while still technically active players Pronger and Weber were under contract with the Philadelphia Flyers and the Utah Hockey Club at the time of their induction Pronger s contract expired after the season and Weber s contract will expire after the season The Hall of Fame amended its by laws by introducing the three

January Starting in male and female players are considered for induction separately and a maximum of two women can be inducted as players per year The by law also clarifies that a builder does not need to have been a coach manager or executive to be inducted Although they remain separate categories the builders and on ice officials are considered on the same ballot and a combined maximum of two can be inducted each year The board of directors will now meet at least once every five years to consider potential changes to the limits br There is also a category for Media honourees The Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award is awarded by the Professional Hockey Writers Association to distinguished members of the newspaper profession whose words have brought honour to journalism and to hockey The

their career in hockey broadcasting The voting for both awards is conducted by their respective associations While media honourees are not considered full inductees they are still honoured with a display at the Hockey Hall of Fame The ceremonies associated with these awards are held separately from the induction of the members of the Hall of Fame Some of the award winners have also been inducted into the Hall of Fame as builders including Foster Hewitt br br br Induction ceremony br The induction ceremony was held at the Hall of Fame from until In it was held at the Royal York Hotel in Toronto and would be held there until From to the ceremony was held at various different locations in Toronto except for and when the ceremonies were held in Vancouver Detroit and Ottawa respectively Since it has been held at the current Hall of Fame building The ceremony was first broadcast by The Sports Network in In the Hockey Hall of Fame game was established a contest between the Toronto Maple Leafs and a visiting team with a special ceremony honouring that year s inductees held before the game Robert Tychkowski of the Edmonton Sun reports that many including Edmonton Oilers president Kevin Lowe believe the induction ceremony should be held on a night when there are no NHL games scheduled This would allow a more representative portion of the hockey world to attend br br br Criticism br The Hall of Fame has been criticized for inducting several lacklustre candidates in the early s decade due to a shortage of true greatness Since then some have claimed that the Hall of Fame has become too exclusive The Hall of Fame has also been criticized for failing to induct international players critics re emphasized from to that the Hall has been far too focused on the National Hockey League that it is more of an NHL Hall of Fame than a general Hockey Hall of Fame Partially in response to these claims the Hall of Fame has hosted International Ice Hockey Federation IIHF exhibits and the IIHF Hall of Fame since and announced that it would start looking at more international players for induction While Vladislav Tretiak had been a notable inductee in Valeri Kharlamov was inducted in and is one of the few other modern day inductees to never play in the NHL The Hall of Fame has also been criticized for overlooking World Hockey Association players and overrepresenting the Original Six era from to For several years the Hall of Fame was criticized for overlooking female hockey players before the Hall of Fame announced that women would be given separate consideration In Angela James and Cammi Granato were the first women to be inducted into the Hall of Fame br One of the most discussed potential nominees is Paul Henderson who scored the winning goal in the final moments of the deciding eighth game of the Summit Series between Canada and the Soviet Union This is one of the best known moments in hockey and Canadian sports history While there is little question of the historical significance of that goal Henderson s NHL statistics are not at a level comparable to those players usually selected for induction His candidacy led to many debates among hockey fans and columnists br br br Controversy br br br Conn Smythe resignation br Conn Smythe served as the Hall s chairman for several years but resigned in June when Harvey Busher Jackson was posthumously elected into the Hall Smythe said that it made him sick to think of Jackson alongside such Toronto Maple Leafs players as Apps Primeau Conacher Clancy and Kennedy If the standards are going to be lowered I ll get out as chairman of the board Jackson was notorious for his off ice lifestyle of drinking and broken marriages Smythe would not condone the induction and even tried to block it because he considered Jackson a poor role model Frank J Selke head of the selection committee defended the selection on the belief that a man should not be shut out because of the amount of beer he drank br br br Gil Stein dispute br On March it was announced that Gil Stein who at the time had been president of the National Hockey League for nine months but had been bypassed for the new job of commissioner in favour of Gary Bettman would be inducted into the Hall of Fame There were immediate allegations that he had engineered his election through manipulation of the hall s board of directors Due to these allegations NHL commissioner Gary Bettman hired two independent lawyers Arnold Burns and Yves Fortier to lead an investigation They concluded that Stein had improperly manipulated the process and created the false appearance and illusion that his nomination was the idea of Bruce McNall They concluded that Stein pressured McNall to nominate him and had refused to withdraw his nomination when asked to do so by Bettman There was a dispute over McNall s role and Stein was categorical in stating that the idea was Mr McNall s They recommended that Stein s selection be overturned but it was revealed Stein had decided to turn down the induction before their announcement br br br Alan Eagleson resignation br In Alan Eagleson a longtime executive director of the National Hockey League Players Association NHLPA was inducted as a builder He resigned nine years later from the Hall after pleading guilty to mail fraud and embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars from the NHLPA pension funds His resignation came six days before a vote was scheduled to determine if he should be expelled from the Hall Originally the Hall of Fame was not going to become involved in the issue but was forced to act when dozens of inductees including Bobby Orr Ted Lindsay and Brad Park campaigned for Eagleson s expulsion even threatening to renounce their membership if he was not removed He became the first member of a sports hall of fame in North America to resign br br br See also br br Ford Performance Centre home of Hockey Hall of Fame
