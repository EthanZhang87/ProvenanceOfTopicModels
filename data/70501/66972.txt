properties not covered under the CBC contract would have been offered to other broadcasters However CBC Sports staff including executive director Jeffrey Orridge continued to insist on exclusivity for every Saturday night game involving Canadian teams The CBC was unable to reach a deal the league reportedly aimed for its next round of Canadian television contracts to have a total value of at least billion BCE owners of Bell Media and previous cable rights holder TSN bid for sole national rights to the NHL and attempted to contact the CBC about a partnership the CBC Sports staff did not respond

playoffs and Stanley Cup Finals with the latter simulcast on a Rogers network if needed The NHL Winter Classic aired in on the CBC moving to Sportsnet the following year br The CBC did not pay any rights fees to Rogers or the NHL but Rogers assumed responsibility for production and advertising sales Promotions for CBC programs are included on CBC simulcasts Rogers paid the corporation for CBC production staff and rent for offices and Studio of the Canadian Broadcasting Centre for Hockey Night and Sportsnet coverage Hockey Night in Canada was a financial boon for CBC Television which received half of its total estimated advertising revenue from the broadcasts To assign responsibility for televised content compliance with regulatory guidelines and advertising to Rogers the HNIC broadcasts are broadcast on a part time television network owned by Rogers Sportsnet subsidiary and affiliated with the CBC s English language television stations although CBC Television branding and continuity is still used on air A licence for the arrangement was approved by the Canadian Radio television and Telecommunications Commission in April br The loss of NHL rights accompanied other reductions in CBC funding and revenue leading the corporation to cut its budget staff and programming In April the CBC decided not to compete for NHL or other professional sports broadcast rights Among staff members laid off were the advertising sales staff who handled Hockey Night In an internal staff notification of the Rogers deal CBC president Hubert T Lacroix wrote that the arrangement with Rogers may not be the ideal scenario for the CBC but the network would have suffered a major blow to its prestige if it was excluded from NHL broadcasts Lacroix said that the deal is the right outcome for Canadian hockey fans allowing Hockey Night in Canada to remain on the CBC for a wider audience at a low cost before the Pan American Games and Summer Olympics whose broadcast rights were owned by the broadcaster CBC staff called the agreement as a structured exit from NHL coverage if Rogers did not extend it br Rogers Hockey Night was initially guided by Scott Moore appointed Rogers
