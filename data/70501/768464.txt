not last nearly as long as many other arenas built during the same time period in part because a number of its innovations did not work as intended Most seriously its designers failed to reckon with Atlanta s humid subtropical climate which specifically caused problems with the Cor Ten exterior walls the weathering steel never actually created the seal that had been envisioned and instead corroded to the point where holes large enough for a person to climb through began showing up along the perimeter of the building In addition the space frame roof of the building would often leak water as the designers did not anticipate the building settling into its foundation as quickly as it did br In the late s and early s a growing number of NBA and NHL teams began to construct arenas with better amenities for their high end customers to increase revenue These amenities included luxury boxes club seating and massive club concourses Some of these new arenas had as many as luxury boxes By comparison the Omni had only luxury boxes and no club level It also became a disadvantage during Atlanta s explosive population growth br Although the Omni hosted many events it lost more than its share due to the smaller capacity and lack of amenities compared to newer buildings in other cities By the start of the s an effort began to build a replacement A new arena would have likely been needed in any event due to the Omni s structural problems This also stemmed from Ted Turner s desire to own an NHL franchise the Flames had been sold to Canadian businessmen and relocated to Calgary Alberta a decade earlier The NHL determined the Omni was not suitable even as a temporary facility and would only grant Atlanta an expansion team if Turner guaranteed a brand new arena would be in place by the time the new team took the ice br Despite the arena s close proximity to the CNN Center Georgia World Congress Center and the Omni MARTA station the Omni was imploded on July Philips Arena now State Farm Arena was constructed in its place and opened on September The demolition of the Omni forced the Hawks to split their home games for the and seasons between the Alexander Memorial Coliseum at Georgia Tech their first home in Atlanta and the Georgia Dome br br br br br br External links br br Summer Olympics official report Volume p br Summer Olympics official report
