projects and programs The YLD has also gained national recognition by winning several American Bar Association awards for its projects and publications br br br History br In the American Bar Association was founded at Saratoga Springs NY It soon began to encourage its members to form organizations of the legal profession in their respective states br In June Woodrow Wilson left his failing law practice on Spring Street in Atlanta In September of the same year the General Assembly meeting at a building that combined the Atlanta city hall and Fulton County courthouse appropriated one million dollars to build a new state capitol building on the same site br The next year there was a meeting in Atlanta to form the Georgia Bar Association The initial members of the Georgia Bar Association were all the Georgia members of the ABA They chose as the first state bar president L N Whittle who was commander of the Macon Militia during the Civil War br br br Macon headquarters br In the late th century Macon was the population center of Georgia and was easily accessible to the rest of the state When the state s legal community formed the Georgia Bar Association in Macon was chosen as its headquarters location and it remained so for the next years L N Whittle was the first of Macon lawyers to serve as president of the Georgia Bar Association during its eight decades of existence He and Walter B Hill who served as the first secretary treasurer were among petitioners from around the state listed on the association s corporate charter when it was granted by the Superior Court of Bibb County on July br Although membership remained strictly voluntary the Georgia Bar Association gradually expanded its activities and organizational efforts throughout the state In the association set up an office in downtown Macon utilizing space in the Persons Building offered by the law firm of John B Harris br br br Unified Bar br Efforts to bring about a unified bar in Georgia began in the late s and continued almost without interruption In soon after his inauguration Governor Carl Sanders was visited by Atlanta lawyers Gus Cleveland and Harry Baxter who had been delegated by the voluntary Georgia Bar Association to approach the Governor about supporting legislation to create a unified State Bar It turned out to be an easier task than they expected as the year old new lawyer Governor immediately saw the advantages of an organized Bar capable of enforcing academic and professional standards for would be lawyers along with a disciplinary process to protect the public from lawyer misconduct br Sanders later recalled that Up until that time while a fairly rigorous written Bar exam was required of every applicant it was not nearly as comprehensive and onerous as the one we have today and there was no multistate component Also the Bar association at the time was a toothless tiger unorganized with no right to discipline its members The governor told Baxter and Cleveland who later served as State Bar president in that his administration would indeed support the unified Bar proposal He directed his House of Representatives floor leader future Attorney General Arthur Bolton and the lieutenant governor future Supreme Court Justice George T Smith to head up the legislative effort br The harder task was actually passing the bill Any time you seek to change something that has been in existence for that many years it s going to be difficult Sanders said Like many other lawyers I knew there were going to be some who would not be able to meet the requirements He recalls there was vigorous opposition to the proposal under the Gold Dome I remember Johnnie Caldwell who later served as the state s insurance commissioner making a long speech in the House about Abraham Lincoln having read the law by candlelight in a log cabin in Illinois Sanders said He said if that was good enough for Abe Lincoln it was good enough for Georgia br In the General Assembly passed an Act Ga L p stating that the Supreme Court of this State shall be authorized upon a petition presented by the Georgia Bar Association to establish as an administrative arm of the court a unified self governing bar association to be known as the State Bar of Georgia composed of all persons now or hereafter licensed to practice law in this State This Act recited that it gave the Supreme Court authority upon recommendation of the Georgia Bar Association to adopt rules and regulations for the organization of a unified bar and to define the rights duties and obligations of members including payment of a reasonable license fee and to otherwise regulate and govern the practice of law in Georgia br A committee of lawyers was charged with taking the next steps which included the preparation and filing of a petition with the Supreme Court of Georgia asking for the Court s approval Although some opposition was voiced at a hearing in October the Court issued an order on Dec establishing the State Bar of Georgia Pursuant to this grant of authority the Supreme Court of Georgia created and established the State Bar of Georgia by court order on December Thus the State Bar of Georgia was created pursuant to the authority of the Supreme Court of Georgia and the Act of the Georgia General Assembly approved by the Governor on March Georgia Laws page br The initial draft of the proposed rules for the new State Bar was discussed and agreed upon in an all day meeting in the conference room of Frank Jones law firm in Macon under the leadership of Newell Edenfield of Atlanta who chaired the organizational committee and Holcombe Perry of Albany who was president of the Georgia Bar Association in Attributing the successful incorporation of the Bar in large part to Perry s leadership as president Jones said Holcombe worked hundreds of hours on this undertaking and few if any other lawyers in Georgia could have achieved the success that he did br In Jones was elected as the unified Bar s sixth president and the first of three from Macon He says a highlight of his term was the Supreme Court of Georgia issuing resounding opinions in Wallace v Wallace and Sams v Olah rejecting constitutional challenges to the State Bar of Georgia s existence br Creation of the unified Bar was not without controversy The only member of the Board of Governors ever impeached by the lawyers in his circuit was due to his support of bar unification Irwin Stolz was informally impeached as there was no procedure for that at a meeting of the Lookout Mountain Circuit Bar Association in He later served as State Bar president and on the Georgia Court of Appeals and his law partner Norman Fletcher became Chief Justice of the Supreme Court In their post judicial careers Stolz practices law in Athens and practices law and mediates in Rome br br br Move of headquarters to Atlanta br During Frank Jones presidency of the State Bar the potential benefits of moving the Bar headquarters from Macon to Atlanta started to become obvious to him In addition to quarterly meetings of the board of governors that were held around the state and the annual meeting that was almost always in Savannah there were meetings of the executive committee and various general and special committees and other meetings that Jones sought to attend The great majority of these meetings were held in Atlanta with virtually none in Macon because Atlanta was more convenient to a majority of attendees and the facilities were limited in Macon Jones said Madrid Williams or Judge Mallory C Atkinson our first general counsel and sometimes both usually accompanied me in traveling to Atlanta for such meetings and we would talk from time to time about the probable need someday to move the office to Atlanta Jones also noted that Atlanta was shedding its reputation as what he called kind of a sleepy metropolis Starting in the s there was an explosive growth in the number of lawyers practicing in the Atlanta metropolitan area and many law firms greatly increased in size br In Jones served on the Governor s Commission on Judicial Processes chaired by Hon Bob Hall The panel s recommendations resulted in the establishment of the Judicial Qualifications Commission JQC as a constitutional body and the Judicial Nominating Commission JNC by executive order of each of Georgia s governors The meetings of the JQC were invariably held in the Judicial Building because we reported our findings and recommendations to the Supreme Court of Georgia and the meetings of the JNC were normally held in Atlanta as well Jones said This is another illustration of how Atlanta increasingly became the focus of the activities of the State Bar and related organizations br A Special Committee on State Bar Headquarters was appointed in with Jones as chairman and Ben L Weinberg Jr as vice chairman Also serving were B Carl Buice Wilton D Harrington G Conley Ingram H H Perry Jr Hon Paul W Painter and Frank W Sonny Seiler with then Bar President Irwin W Stolz Jr A G Cleveland Jr and Thomas E Dennard Jr as ex officio members In November the committee submitted its final report during a meeting of the board of governors officially recommending that the State Bar headquarters be moved from Macon to downtown Atlanta because in part Ideally the headquarters should be reasonably close to the State Capitol area as accessible as possible to those lawyers throughout the state who would enter Atlanta on the interstate and other highways and at the same time not inconvenient to the large number of State Bar of Georgia members who have their offices in the business and financial district in Atlanta The fact that the State Bar had been authorized by the Supreme Court of Georgia and its rules had to be approved by the Supreme Court was another persuasive reason why the headquarters should be in downtown Atlanta and within reasonable proximity to the Supreme Court br The report acknowledged that the anticipated doubling of office space addition of at least one more staff member higher rental rates and salary scales prevailing in Atlanta and various other factors would result in a substantial increase in operating expenses A dues increase would undoubtedly be required One of the committee s recommendations specified The State Bar of Georgia should not give any further consideration at this time to building its own headquarters building as some other state bars have done Jones said That was a wise decision at the time I believe We needed to walk before we could run br After the committee s recommendations were unanimously approved by the board of governors the wheels were set in motion for the move from Macon to Atlanta F Jack Adams joined committee members Seiler and Cleveland in submitting a detailed report concerning costs and a proposed dues increase which was approved by the board in July Increased expenditures were estimated at just over necessitating a dues increase of per year The target date for opening the new headquarters in the Fulton National Bank building was July By Feb the contract had already been signed construction of the offices was underway and moving vans were packed and ready to leave Macon for Atlanta Seiler who was the State Bar president that year recounted in his end of year report for the annual meeting what happened next br I ll never forget that day Seiler said of the planned moving day of Feb Gus Cleveland Jack Adams and I were in Cleveland Ohio attending the ABA National Conference of Bar Presidents It was extremely cold in Cleveland but the skies were clear We knew that winter storms were harassing the South and Gus and I had speculated as to whether or not the move could be accomplished On the day of the intended move I picked up a Cleveland paper and the headlines read Heavy Snow Hits Macon Georgia and I knew darn well they weren t talking about Cubbege Jr or Sr Cubbege Snow was the name of a father son legal duo in Macon with a third generation having since joined the practice The snow melted a few days later and the new office was fully occupied on Law Day May two months ahead of schedule br Performing an integral role in the move was Madrid Williams who had originally informed the officers of her intention to retire as executive secretary on Jan rather than make the move to Atlanta But she got caught up in the excitement Jones said and instead of retiring Williams wound up personally supervising the entire project coordinating the moving and purchase of equipment furniture and decorations as well as interviewing and hiring new staff members Her help was invaluable during those first years after the move Jones said of Williams who in became one of the first women to serve as president of the National Association of Bar Executives She did retire in a full years after opening the first Georgia Bar Association office f br According to Jones opposition to the move from Macon to Atlanta was virtually non existent and the only backlash he received from below Georgia s fall line for having spearheaded the effort was some good natured ribbing from his hometown colleagues When I accepted an invitation to become a partner in the firm of King Spalding LLP in Atlanta as of July several of my friends jokingly remarked that I was being run out of Macon because I had been instrumental in the move Jones said But I had realized it would be an easier pill to swallow if a past president from Macon was the one making the recommendation br Jones concluded In my judgment both then and now it was essential that the State Bar have its headquarters conveniently located in downtown Atlanta in order to maximize its service to the lawyers of Georgia the judiciary and the general public Such a location provides ready access to the Supreme Court of Georgia the Governor s Office the General Assembly and other governmental agencies with which the State Bar has dealings from time to time It is also consistent with the extraordinary growth in the number of practicing lawyers residing in the greater Atlanta area br br br Georgia Bar Center br In the State Bar began an effort to establish a Bar Center that would be a professional gathering place for members of the profession from around the state After an exhaustive search and a struggle with financing the State Bar purchased the former home of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta The Georgia Bar Center is reputedly the finest state bar headquarters in the United States in the assessment of delegates to the ABA midyear meeting in It includes a conference center used for continuing legal education seminars and professional meetings almost daily a law related education program that hosts over school children each year the offices of the State Bar and a number of other law related organizations In addition visiting bar members enjoy free parking when attending events in downtown Atlanta br And adjoining the lobby is a small museum depicting a nineteenth century law office near the site of the Bar Center where Woodrow Wilson labored until he gave up the dreadful drudgery of law practice and boarded a northbound train in br br br Past Presidents br Past presidents of the former Georgia Bar Association and the State Bar of Georgia include the following br br br Georgia Bar
