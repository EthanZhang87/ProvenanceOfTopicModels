but were unable to win the Stanley Cup After the season the franchise moved to Dallas and the team was renamed the Dallas Stars br br br History br br br Beginnings br br On March NHL President Clarence Campbell announced that the league would expand to teams from six by creating a new six team division for the season In response to the announcement a partnership of nine men led by Walter Bush Jr Robert Ridder and John Driscoll was formed to seek a franchise for the Twin Cities area of Minnesota Their efforts were successful as the NHL awarded one of its six expansion franchises to Minnesota on February The five other franchises were awarded to Oakland Los Angeles Philadelphia Pittsburgh and St Louis The expansion fee for each new team was million million in dollars The North Stars name was announced on May after a public contest The name derives from the state motto L toile du Nord a French phrase meaning The Star of the North Months after the naming of the team ground was broken on October for a new hockey arena in Bloomington The home of the North Stars the Metropolitan Sports Center was built in months at a cost of million million in dollars The arena was ready for play for the start of the NHL season but parts of its construction were incomplete Spectator seats were still being installed as fans arrived for the opening home game on October br br br Early years br On October the North Stars played the first game in franchise history on the road against the St Louis Blues another expansion team The game was a tie with former US National Team forward Bill Masterton scoring the first goal in franchise history On October the North Stars played their first home game against the California Seals The North Stars won The team achieved success early reaching first place in the West Division halfway through the season Tragedy struck the team on January when Masterton suffered a fatal hit during a game against the Seals at Met Center Skating towards the Seals goal across the blue line he fell backward hitting the back of his head on the ice rendering him unconscious He never regained consciousness and died on January two days after the accident He was Doctors described the cause of death as a massive brain injury To date this remains the only death of a player as a result of an injury during a game in NHL history The North Stars retired his jersey and later that year hockey writers established the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy which would be given annually to a player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance sportsmanship and dedication to hockey Following the news of Masterton s death the North Stars lost the next six games br The North Stars achieved success in their first year of existence by finishing fourth in the West Division with a record of and advancing to the playoffs During the playoffs the North Stars defeated the Los Angeles Kings in seven games after losing the first two in the series In the next round the West finals the North Stars faced the St Louis Blues in a series that also went seven games Minnesota was one game away from advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals but lost the deciding game in double overtime br The team was led in the early years by the goaltending duo Lorne Gump Worsley and Cesare Maniago Defenseman Ted Harris was the North Stars captain The first Stars team also included high scoring winger Bill Goldsworthy and other quality players such as Barry Gibbs Jude Drouin J P Parise Danny Grant Lou Nanne Tom Reid and Dennis Hextall br The World Hockey Association WHA began play in with a franchise based in St Paul the Minnesota Fighting Saints While a number of exhibition games were played between teams in the two leagues the North Stars never played their cross town rivals But the competition for the hockey dollar between these two clubs was fierce Despite making a good account of themselves on the ice insurmountable financial difficulties forced the Fighting Saints to fold midway through their fourth season A second incarnation of the Fighting Saints lasted only half of the next season before also folding br By the North Stars had missed the playoffs in five of the previous six seasons and had only tallied two winning seasons since joining the league Attendance had tailed off so rapidly that the league feared that the franchise was on the verge of folding At this point Gordon and George Gund III owners of the equally strapped Cleveland Barons stepped in with an unprecedented solution merging the North Stars with the Barons The merged team retained the North Stars name colors and history and remained in Minnesota But the wealthier Gunds became majority owners of the merged team and the North Stars moved from the then five team Smythe Division to the Barons place in the Adams Division which would otherwise have been left with only three teams for the season The recently retired Nanne was named general manager and some of the Barons players notably goaltender Gilles Meloche and forwards Al MacAdam and Mike Fidler bolstered Minnesota s lineup Furthermore Minnesota had drafted Bobby Smith who went on to win the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL s top rookie that year and Steve Payne who recorded goals in his second campaign in br On January the North Stars defeated the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden Tim Young became the second player in NHL history to score five goals on five shots His five goal game remains the best offensive output by a player in the Minnesota Dallas franchise br br br s br In the middle of this transition a historic night awaited the North Stars On January Minnesota was scheduled to play the Philadelphia Flyers who came to Bloomington with the NHL s and major league sports longest undefeated streak a game run of wins and ties An all time record Met Center crowd of squeezed into the arena which remained the highest total in all seasons of the North Stars franchise Minnesota ended the Flyers streak with a win Seven different North Stars scored seven unanswered goals In the quarter final round of the playoffs the North Stars upset the four time defending champion Montreal Canadiens in seven games before bowing out to Philadelphia in the next round br With the addition of new players such as Minnesota native and Olympian Neal Broten and sniper Dino Ciccarelli the North Stars had five straight winning seasons starting in which included back to back trips to the Stanley Cup semifinals against the Flyers in and against the Calgary Flames in By defeating the Flames in the North Stars reached their first Stanley Cup Finals They lost in five games to the heavily favored New York Islanders br On November the Winnipeg Jets visited Met Center Fueled by an eight goal second period and a four goal seven point night by Bobby Smith the North Stars scored the most goals in an NHL game since in a win br Following the NHL realignment to a more geographically grouped configuration the North Stars were in the Norris Division Ciccarelli scored a franchise record goals in just his second season in leading Minnesota to its first division title The team bowed out of the playoffs in the first round against the Chicago Black Hawks br In the summer of general manager Lou Nanne drafted Brian Bellows who scored goals in his rookie season of when the team finished with wins and regular season points both the most ever recorded in the years the franchise was based in Minnesota The North Stars lost in the playoffs to the Chicago Black Hawks in the second round br In Bill Mahoney a defensive minded coach took over Early in the season Bobby Smith was traded to the Montreal Canadiens for a pair of defense minded forwards Keith Acton and Mark Napier The team posted the second highest victory total in its history with and won its second Norris Division crown in three years Luckily for them the Norris Division was very weak that year they were the only team in the division to have a winning record br In the playoffs the North Stars defeated the Blackhawks Minnesota won the series then eliminated the St Louis Blues in seven games They then lost to the Edmonton Oilers in four games br After the franchise only had one more winning season in Minnesota in In it won games the second fewest wins in franchise history A loss to the Calgary Flames coupled with the Leafs win over the Red Wings not only kept the North Stars out of the playoffs but also with the worst record in the league Chronic attendance problems led the owners to threaten to move the club to the San Francisco Bay Area against the league s wishes br br br s br The NHL instituted a compromise for the season whereby the Gund brothers were awarded an expansion team in the Bay Area the San Jose Sharks that would receive players from Minnesota via a dispersal draft with the North Stars Both the Sharks and North Stars would then be able to select players from the other NHL teams in an expansion draft A group previously petitioning for an NHL team in the Bay Area led by Howard Baldwin and Morris Belzberg bought the North Stars as part of the deal Baldwin and Belzberg purchased the team from the Gunds for approximately million including million in liabilities as well as giving the Gunds their share of the fees from the next three expansion teams expected to be million Norman Green a former part owner of the Calgary Flames and a last minute newcomer to Baldwin and Belzberg s group purchased controlling interest in the North Stars from them with Baldwin and Belzberg sharing the remaining stake Green agreed to purchase Baldwin s share giving him more than control of the team shortly after a dispute with Baldwin arose Belzberg maintained his share of the rest of the team s stock until October when Green became the team s sole owner by buying Belzberg s shares br In the season despite a losing record in the regular season the North Stars embarked on a Cinderella run to the Stanley Cup Finals They knocked off the Chicago Blackhawks and St Louis Blues the top two teams in the NHL during the regular season in six games each and the defending Stanley Cup Champion Edmonton Oilers in five games making it to the finals for the second time in franchise history The team fought hard against the eventual champion Pittsburgh Penguins led by Mario Lemieux They won two out of the first three contests before being obliterated in game six of the best of seven series It was the most lopsided defeat in a deciding game of the Stanley Cup Finals since the original Ottawa Senators defeated the Dawson City Nuggets in br Following the Finals run the North Stars adopted a new logo the word STARS in italicized gold capitals over a green star with a gold outline the gold now a more metallic shade than the previous yellowish shade The team also adopted black as its primary color for its road uniforms and eliminated gold from the uniform except for the logo Even before the logo change it had been speculated that the North Stars would adopt a new logo following the season as the future primary logo was first painted on the Met Center ice before the aforementioned season albeit in a reverse color scheme from its upcoming incarnation br To celebrate the team s th anniversary the team wore a commemorative patch on the left shoulder of its uniforms The patch depicted Bill Goldsworthy wearing a green uniform facing off against Mike Modano wearing the new black uniform br Per the expansion agreement the North Stars were allowed to protect fourteen players from selection by the Sharks This meant the core of their conference championship roster essentially remained intact with the team losing only four players from its NHL roster to San Jose the Sharks remaining selections from Minnesota were minor leaguers As a result while the Sharks endured the typical struggles of an expansion team and finished last overall the North Stars modestly improved from the regular season though still finishing with a losing record They made the playoffs and took a series lead into game six at the Met Center against the Norris Division champion Detroit Red Wings The Red Wings won in overtime after a video referee review confirmed that Sergei Fedorov had scored a goal This was the first use of video replay in the Stanley Cup playoffs The Wings won the seventh game at home br br br Departure to Dallas br br By Norman Green was arranging a deal to turn the team into the Los Angeles Stars playing at a new arena which is now the Honda Center under construction in Anaheim California However as The Walt Disney Company was already in negotiations with the NHL to create an expansion team in the area the league instead asked Green to let Disney create the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim while the North Stars would be allowed to relocate to any city of Green s choosing In January Green chose Dallas Texas as the new home of the franchise and the decision was formally announced on March Several reasons were cited for the relocation including poor attendance during a string of losing seasons the failure to reach deals for a new arena in either Minneapolis or Saint Paul and a sexual harassment lawsuit against Green that resulted in his wife threatening to leave him unless he moved the team The subsequent decision to relocate the franchise to Texas made Green much reviled in Minnesota where he derisively came to be known as Norm Greed br Another factor that also precipitated the move to Dallas was the fact that the team refused to play at the Target Center where the NBA s Minnesota Timberwolves played due to the fact that Coca Cola had advertising and pouring rights at that arena The North Stars and the Met Center had Pepsi as their sponsor Despite that the newly relocated Stars did play at Target Center on December against the Ottawa Senators though only fans showed up to watch the Stars defeat the Senators br Due to mounting financial problems resulting from poor management of his non hockey business ventures Green only kept the Stars for three more years before selling them to Tom Hicks in br On the other hand the Dallas franchise has taken some steps to mend the emotional wounds left in Minnesota When the Dallas Stars won the Stanley Cup three years after Green sold the team their official video Nothing Else Matters not only included their past seasons disappointments but also paid tribute to the North Stars run to the final of which star Mike Modano and general manager Bob Gainey had been part br Modano who retired in was the last former North Star in the NHL leaving the Stars franchise after the season The last active former North Star was Mike Craig who played in Italy until After Modano s last game as a Dallas Star which was in Minnesota playing the Wild Modano came on the ice as the first star wearing a North Stars jersey getting a standing ovation from the crowd br With the departure of former North Stars scout Les Jackson from the Dallas Stars franchise on June there is no longer anyone working for Dallas who had a direct connection to the franchise s time in Minnesota br br br Return of NHL hockey to Minnesota br br NHL hockey returned to Minnesota when the NHL announced in that the state had been awarded an expansion franchise to begin play in the NHL season In the team name for the new franchise became the Minnesota Wild br On December the Wild hosted the Dallas Stars in the latter s first visit to Minnesota since the relocation excluding the aforementioned neutral site game at Target Center in The Wild won that game with Darby Hendrickson scoring two goals and Manny Fernandez making saves for a shutout As of the season the Stars won of meetings with the Wild with one tie and nine OT SO losses The two teams also faced each other in the and first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs the Stars prevailed over the Wild in both series br On April the Wild honored the North Stars by wearing North Stars jerseys for warmups despite the North Stars history belonging to the Dallas Stars Martin Hanzal warmed up with number as the North Stars retired number in honor of Bill Masterton Zach Parise also warmed up with equipment belonging to his father the late Jean Paul Parise who played for the North Stars br An alumni game pitting the Chicago Blackhawks against Team Minnesota took place the day prior to the NHL Stadium Series Team Minnesota featured a mix of former North Stars and Wild players and wore throwback North Stars jerseys with the former s logo on the right shoulder and the Wild logo on the left shoulder br For the season the Minnesota Wild introduced a version of the North Stars jersey featuring a recolored Wild logo as part of the league wide Reverse Retro jersey program In the season a green version of the Reverse Retro jersey was used The Wild s green Reverse Retro jersey was subsequently promoted to a full time third jersey as The s
