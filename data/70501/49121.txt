area is the th largest by population in the United States with approximately million people as of making it the most populous in the Southwestern United States Phoenix the seat of Maricopa County is the largest city by population and area in Arizona with an area of square miles km and is also the th largest city by area in the United States br Phoenix was settled in as an agricultural community near the confluence of the Salt and Gila Rivers and was incorporated as a city in It became the capital of Arizona Territory in Its canal system led to a thriving farming community with the original settlers crops such as alfalfa cotton citrus and hay remaining important parts of the local economy for decades Cotton cattle citrus climate and copper were known locally as the Five C s anchoring Phoenix s economy These remained the driving forces of the city until after World War II when high tech companies began to move into the valley and air conditioning made Phoenix s hot summers more bearable br Phoenix is the cultural center of Arizona It is in the northeastern reaches of the Sonoran Desert and is known for its hot desert climate The region s gross domestic product reached over billion by The city averaged a four percent annual population growth rate over a year period from the mid s to the mid s and was among the nation s ten most populous cities by Phoenix is also one of the largest plurality Hispanic cities in the United States with of its population being Hispanic br br br History br br br Early history br br The Hohokam people occupied the Phoenix area for years They created roughly miles kilometers of irrigation canals making the desert land arable and paths of these canals were used for the Arizona Canal Central Arizona Project Canal and the Hayden Rhodes Aqueduct They also carried out extensive trade with the nearby Ancient Puebloans Mogollon and Sinagua as well as with the more distant Mesoamerican civilizations It is believed periods of drought and severe floods between and led to the Hohokam civilization s abandonment of the area br After the departure of the Hohokam groups of Akimel O odham commonly known as Pima Tohono O odham and Maricopa tribes began to use the area as well as segments of the Yavapai and Apache The O odham were offshoots of the Sobaipuri tribe who in turn were thought to be the descendants of the Hohokam br The Akimel O odham were the major group in the area They lived in small villages with well defined irrigation systems that spread over the Gila River Valley from Florence in the east to the Estrellas in the west Their crops included corn beans and squash for food as well as cotton and tobacco They banded with the Maricopa for protection against incursions by the Yuma and Apache tribes The Maricopa are part of the larger Yuma people however they migrated east from the lower Colorado and Gila Rivers in the early s when they began to be enemies with other Yuma tribes settling among the existing communities of the Akimel O odham br The Tohono O odham also lived in the region but largely to the south and all the way to the Mexican border The O odham lived in small settlements as seasonal farmers who took advantage of the rains rather than the large scale irrigation of the Akimel They grew crops such as sweet corn tapery beans squash lentils sugar cane and melons as well as taking advantage of native plants such as saguaro fruits cholla buds mesquite tree beans and mesquite candy sap from the mesquite tree They also hunted local game such as deer rabbit and javelina for meat br The Mexican American War ended in Mexico ceded its northern zone to the United States and the region s residents became U S citizens The Phoenix area became part of the New Mexico Territory In the mining town of Wickenburg was the first to be established in Maricopa County to the northwest of Phoenix Maricopa County had not been incorporated the land was within Yavapai County which included the major town of Prescott to the north of Wickenburg br The Army created Fort McDowell on the Verde River in to forestall Indian uprisings The fort established a camp on the south side of the Salt River by which was the first settlement in the valley after the decline of the Hohokam Other nearby settlements later merged to become the city of Tempe br br br Founding and incorporation br br The history of Phoenix begins with Jack Swilling a Confederate veteran of the Civil War who prospected in the nearby mining town of Wickenburg in the newly formed Arizona Territory As he traveled through the Salt River Valley in he saw a potential for farming to supply Wickenburg with food He also noted the eroded mounds of dirt that indicated previous canals dug by native peoples who had long since left the area He formed the Swilling Irrigation and Canal Company that year dug a large canal that drew in river water and erected several crop fields in a location that is now within the eastern portion of central Phoenix near its airport Other settlers soon began to arrive appreciating the area s fertile soil and lack of frost and the farmhouse Swilling constructed became a frequently visited location in the valley Lord Darrell Duppa was one of the original settlers in Swilling s party and he suggested the name Phoenix as it described a city born from the ruins of a former civilization br The Board of Supervisors in Yavapai County officially recognized the new town on May and the first post office was established the following month with Swilling as the postmaster In October valley residents met to select a new townsite for the valley s growing population A new location three miles to the west of the original settlement containing several allotments of farmland was chosen and lots began to officially be sold under the name of Phoenix in December of that year This established the downtown core in a grid layout pattern that has been the hallmark of Phoenix s urban development ever since br On February the territorial legislature created Maricopa County by dividing Yavapai County it was the sixth one formed in the Arizona Territory The first election for county office was held in when Tom Barnum was elected the first sheriff He ran unopposed when the other two candidates John A Chenowth and Jim Favorite fought a duel Chenowth killed Favorite and was forced to withdraw from the race br The town grew during the s and President Ulysses S Grant issued a land patent for the site of Phoenix on April By the town had a telegraph office saloons and four dance halls but the townsite commissioner form of government needed an overhaul An election was held in and three village trustees and other officials were elected By the town s population stood at br br By Phoenix s continued growth made the board of trustees obsolete The Territorial Legislature passed the Phoenix Charter Bill incorporating Phoenix and providing a mayor council government Governor John C Fremont signed the bill on February officially incorporating Phoenix as a city with a population of around br The railroad s arrival in the valley in the s was the first of several events that made Phoenix a trade center whose products reached eastern and western markets In response the Phoenix Chamber of Commerce was organized on November The city offices moved into the new City Hall at Washington and Central in The territorial capital moved from Prescott to Phoenix in and the territorial offices were also in City Hall The arrival of the Santa Fe Prescott and Phoenix Railway in connected Phoenix to Prescott Flagstaff and other communities in the northern part of the territory The increased access to commerce expedited the city s economic rise The Phoenix Union High School was established in with an enrollment of br br br to World War II br br On February Governor Oakes Murphy dedicated the permanent Capitol building and the Carnegie Free Library opened seven years later on February dedicated by Benjamin Fowler The National Reclamation Act was signed by President Theodore Roosevelt in which allowed dams to be built on waterways in the west for reclamation purposes The first dam constructed under the act Salt River Dam began in It supplied both water and electricity becoming the first multi purpose dam and Roosevelt attended the official dedication on May At the time it was the largest masonry dam in the world forming a lake in the mountains east of Phoenix The dam would be renamed after Teddy Roosevelt in and the lake would follow suit in br On February Phoenix became a state capital as Arizona was admitted to the Union as the th state under President William Howard Taft This occurred just six months after Taft had vetoed a joint congressional resolution granting statehood to Arizona due to his disapproval of the state constitution s position on the recall of judges In Phoenix s move from a mayor council system to council manager made it one of the first cities in the United States with this form of city government After statehood Phoenix s growth started to accelerate eight years later its population reached In Phoenix would see its first skyscraper the Heard Building it was the tallest building in the state until the completion of the Luhrs Building in In Sky Harbor was officially opened at the time owned by Scenic Airways The city purchased it in and continues to operate it today br br On March former U S President Calvin Coolidge dedicated a dam on the Gila River named in his honor However the state had just been through a long drought and the reservoir which was supposed to be behind the dam was virtually dry The humorist Will Rogers who was on hand as a guest speaker joked If that was my lake I d mow it Phoenix s population had nearly doubled during the s and by stood at It was also during the s that Phoenix and its surrounding area began to be called The Valley of the Sun which was an advertising slogan invented to boost tourism br During World War II Phoenix s economy shifted to that of a distribution center transforming into an embryonic industrial city with the mass production of military supplies There were three air force fields in the area Luke Field Williams Field and Falcon Field as well as two large pilot training camps Thunderbird Field No in Glendale and Thunderbird Field No in Scottsdale br br br Post World War II explosive growth br A town that had just over residents in became America s fifth largest city by with a population of nearly million and millions more in nearby suburbs After the war many of the men who had undergone their training in Arizona returned with their new families Learning of this large untapped labor pool enticed many large industries to move their operations to the area In high tech industry which would become a staple of the state s economy arrived in Phoenix when Motorola chose Phoenix as the site of its new research and development center for military electronics Seeing the same advantages as Motorola other high tech companies such as Intel and McDonnell Douglas moved into the valley and opened manufacturing operations br By over people resided in the city and thousands more in surrounding communities The s growth was spurred on by advances in air conditioning which allowed homes and businesses to offset the extreme heat experienced in Phoenix and the surrounding areas during its long summers There was more new construction in Phoenix in alone than from to br Like many emerging American cities at the time Phoenix s spectacular growth did not occur evenly It largely took place on the city s north side a region that was nearly all Caucasian In one local activist testified at a US Commission on Civil Rights of hearing that of homes that had recently sprung up in this neighborhood not a single one had been sold to an African American Phoenix s African American and Mexican American communities remained largely sequestered on the south side of town The color lines were so rigid that no one north of Van Buren Street would rent to the African American baseball star Willie Mays in town for spring training in the s In a reporter from The New Republic wrote of segregation in these terms Apartheid is complete The two cities look at each other across a golf course br br br s to present br br The continued rapid population growth led more businesses to the valley to take advantage of the labor pool and manufacturing particularly in the electronics sector continued to grow The convention and tourism industries saw rapid expansion during the s with tourism becoming the third largest industry by the end of the decade In the Phoenix Corporate Center opened at the time it was the tallest building in Arizona topping off at feet The s saw many other buildings constructed as the city expanded rapidly including the Rosenzweig Center today called Phoenix City Square the landmark Phoenix Financial Center as well as many of Phoenix s residential high rises In the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum opened at the Arizona State Fairgrounds west of downtown When Phoenix was awarded an NBA franchise in which would be called the Phoenix Suns they played their home games at the Coliseum until after which they moved to America West Arena In President Lyndon B Johnson approved the Central Arizona Project assuring future water supplies for Phoenix Tucson and the agricultural corridor between them The following year Pope Paul VI created the Diocese of Phoenix on December by splitting the Archdiocese of Tucson with Edward A McCarthy as the first Bishop br In the s the downtown area experienced a resurgence with a level of construction activity not seen again until the urban real estate boom of the s By the end of the decade Phoenix adopted the Phoenix Concept plan which split the city into urban villages each with its own village core where greater height and density was permitted further shaping the free market development culture The nine original villages have expanded to over the years see Cityscape below This officially turned Phoenix into a city of many nodes which would later be connected by freeways The Phoenix Symphony Hall opened in other major structures which saw construction downtown during this decade were the First National Bank Plaza the Valley Center the tallest building in Arizona and the Arizona Bank building br On September Phoenix resident Sandra Day O Connor broke the gender barrier on the U S Supreme Court when she was sworn in as the first female justice In the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station the nation s largest nuclear power plant began electrical production Pope John Paul II and Mother Teresa both visited the Valley in br There was an influx of refugees due to low cost housing in the Sunnyslope area in the s resulting in different languages being spoken in local schools by The new story City Hall opened in br Phoenix has maintained a growth streak in recent years growing by before This made it the second fastest growing metropolitan area in the United States surpassed only by Las Vegas In Squaw Peak the city s second tallest mountain was renamed Piestewa Peak after Army Specialist Lori Ann Piestewa an Arizonan and the first Native American woman to die in combat while serving in the U S military as well as being the first American female casualty of the Iraq War also saw Phoenix as one of the cities hardest hit by the subprime mortgage crisis and by early the median home price was down from its peak in Crime rates in Phoenix have fallen in recent years and once troubled decaying neighborhoods such as South Mountain Alhambra and Maryvale have recovered and stabilized On June the State of Arizona announced the decision to halt new housing development in the Phoenix metropolitan area that relies solely on groundwater due to a predicted water shortfall br br br Geography br br Phoenix is in the south central portion of Arizona about halfway between Tucson to the southeast and Flagstaff to the north in the southwestern United States By car the city is approximately miles kilometers north of the US Mexico border at Sonoyta and mi km north of the border at Nogales The metropolitan area is known as the Valley of the Sun due to its location in the Salt River Valley It lies at a mean elevation of feet m in the northern reaches of the Sonoran Desert br Other than the mountains in and around the city Phoenix s topography is generally flat which allows the city s main streets to run on a precise grid with wide open spaced roadways Scattered low mountain ranges surround the valley McDowell Mountains to the northeast the White Tank Mountains to the west the Superstition Mountains far to the east and both South Mountain and the Sierra Estrella to the south southwest Camelback Mountain North Mountain Sunnyslope Mountain and Piestewa Peak are within the heart of the valley The city s outskirts have large fields of irrigated cropland and Native American reservation lands The Salt River runs westward through Phoenix but the riverbed is often dry or contains little water due to large irrigation diversions South Mountain separates the community of Ahwatukee from the rest of the city br br According to the United States Census Bureau the city has an area of sq mi km of which sq mi km is land and sq mi km or is water br Maricopa County grew by from in to by due in part to air conditioning cheap housing and an influx of retirees The once modest urban sprawl now grew by epic proportions not only a myriad of residential tract developments on both farmland and desert Retail outlets and office complexes spread out and did not concentrate in the small downtown area There was low population density and a lack of widespread and significant high rise development As a consequence Phoenix became a textbook case of urban sprawl for geographers Even though it is the fifth most populated city in the United States the large area gives it a low density rate of approximately people per square mile In comparison Philadelphia the sixth most populous city with nearly the same population as Phoenix has a density of over people per square mile br Like most of Arizona Phoenix does not observe daylight saving time In Governor Jack Williams argued to the U S Congress that energy use would increase in the evening should Arizona observe DST He went on to say energy use would also rise early in the day because there would be more lights on in the early morning Additionally he said daylight saving time would cause children to go to school in the dark br br br Cityscape br br br Neighborhoods br br Since the city of Phoenix has been divided into urban villages many of which are based upon historically significant neighborhoods and communities that have since been annexed into Phoenix Each village has a planning committee appointed directly by the city council According to the city issued village planning handbook the purpose of the village planning committees is to work with the city s planning commission to ensure a balance of housing and employment in each village concentrate development at identified village cores and to promote the unique character and identity of the villages There are urban villages Ahwatukee Foothills Alhambra Camelback East Central City Deer Valley Desert View Encanto Estrella Laveen Maryvale North Gateway North Mountain Paradise Valley Rio Vista and South Mountain br The urban village of Paradise Valley is distinct from the nearby Town of Paradise Valley Although the urban village is part of Phoenix the town is independent br In addition to the above urban villages Phoenix has a variety of commonly referred to regions and districts such as Downtown Midtown Uptown West Phoenix North Phoenix South Phoenix Biltmore Area Arcadia and Sunnyslope br br br Flora and fauna br While some of the native flora and fauna of the Sonoran Desert can be found within Phoenix city limits most are found in the suburbs and the undeveloped desert areas that surround the city Native mammal species include coyote javelina bobcat mountain lion desert cottontail rabbit jackrabbit antelope ground squirrel mule deer ringtail coati and multiple species of bats such as the Mexican free tailed bat and western pipistrelle that roost in and around the city There are many species of native birds including Costa s hummingbird Anna s hummingbird Gambel s quail Gila woodpecker mourning dove white winged dove the greater roadrunner the cactus wren and many species of raptors including falcons hawks owls vultures such as the turkey vulture and black vulture and eagles including the golden and the bald eagle br The greater Phoenix region is home to the only thriving feral population of rosy faced lovebirds in the U S This bird is a popular birdcage pet native to southwestern Africa Feral birds were first observed living outdoors in probably escaped or released pets and by the Greater Phoenix population had grown to about birds These lovebirds prefer older neighborhoods where they nest under untrimmed dead palm tree fronds br The area is also home to a plethora of native reptile species including the Western diamondback rattlesnake Sonoran sidewinder several other types of rattlesnakes Sonoran coral snake dozens of species of non venomous snakes including the Sonoran gopher snake and the California kingsnake the gila monster desert spiny lizard several types of whiptail lizards the chuckwalla desert horned lizard western banded gecko Sonora mud turtle and the desert tortoise Native amphibian species include the Couch s spadefoot toad Chiricahua leopard frog and the Sonoran desert toad br Phoenix and the surrounding areas are also home to a wide variety of native invertebrates including the Arizona bark scorpion giant desert hairy scorpion Arizona blond tarantula Sonoran Desert centipede tarantula hawk wasp camel spider and tailless whip scorpion Of great concern is the presence of Africanized bees which can be extremely dangerous even lethal when provoked br The Arizona Upland subdivision of the Sonoran Desert of which Phoenix is a part has the most structurally diverse flora in the United States One of the most well known types of succulents the giant saguaro cactus is found throughout the city and its neighboring environs Other native species are the organpipe barrel fishhook senita prickly pear and cholla cacti ocotillo Palo Verde trees and foothill and blue paloverde California fan palm agaves soaptree yucca Spanish

Association Vehicle emissions are cited as precursors to ozone formation Phoenix also has high levels of particulate pollution although cities in California lead the nation in this hazard PM particulate matter which is a component of diesel engine exhaust and larger PM particles which can come from dust can both reach concerning levels in Phoenix In fact people pets and other animals exposed to high concentrations of PM dust particles primarily from dust storms or from disturbed agricultural or construction sites are at risk of contracting Valley Fever a fungal lung infection br Unlike most desert locations which have drastic fluctuations between day and nighttime temperatures the urban heat island effect limits Phoenix s diurnal temperature variation As the city has expanded average summer low temperatures have been steadily rising Pavement sidewalks and buildings store the Sun s heat and radiate it at night The daily normal low remains at or above F C for an average of days per summer On July Phoenix set its record for the warmest daily low temperature at F C br br The city averages approximately days of sunshine or over of daylight hours per year and receives scant rainfall the average annual total at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport is in mm The region s trademark dry and sunny weather is interrupted by sporadic Pacific storms in the winter and the arrival of the North American monsoon in the summer Historically the monsoon officially started when the average dew point was F C for three days in a row typically occurring in early July To increase monsoon awareness and promote safety however the National Weather Service decreed that starting in June would be the official first day of the monsoon and it would end on September When active the monsoon raises humidity levels and can cause heavy localized precipitation flash floods hail destructive winds and dust storms which can rise to the level of a haboob in some years br br br
