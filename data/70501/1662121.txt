id: 1662121
In sports broadcasting a sports commentator also known as a sports announcer or sportscaster provides a real time live commentary of a game or event traditionally delivered in the present tense Radio was the first medium for sports broadcasts where the radio commentators had to describe the action in detail because the listeners could not see it for themselves In the case of televised sports coverage commentators are presented as a voiceover with images of the contest shown on viewers screens and sounds of the action and spectators heard in the background Television commentators are rarely shown on screen during an event though some networks choose to feature their announcers on camera either before or after the contest or briefly during breaks in the action br br br Types of commentators br br br Main play by play commentator br br The main commentator also called the play by play commentator or announcer in North America blow by blow in combat sports coverage lap by lap for motorsports coverage or ball by ball for cricket coverage is the primary speaker on the broadcast Broadcasters in this role are adept at being articulate and carry an ability to describe each play or event of an often fast moving sporting event The play by play announcer is meant to convey the event as it is carried out Because of their skill level commentators like Al Michaels Brian Anderson Ian Eagle Kevin Harlan Jim Nantz and Joe Buck in the U S David Coleman in the UK and Bruce McAvaney in Australia may have careers in which they call several different sports at one time or another Other main commentators may however only call one sport Joe Rogan for example announces only one sport which is Mixed Martial Arts specifically the UFC organization and Peter Drury for the Premier League Football Association The vast majority of play by play announcers are male female play by play announcers had not seen sustained employment until the st century br Radio and television play by play techniques involve slightly different approaches radio broadcasts typically require the play by play host to say more to verbally convey the on field activity that cannot be seen by the radio audience It is unusual to have radio and television broadcasts share the same play by play commentator for the same event except in cases of low production budgets or when a broadcaster is particularly renowned Rick Jeanneret s hockey telecasts for example were simulcast on radio and television from until his retirement br br br Analyst color commentator br br The analyst or color commentator provides expert analysis and background information such as statistics strategy on the teams and athletes and occasionally anecdotes or light humor They are usually former athletes or coaches in their respective sports although there are some exceptions br The term color refers to levity and insight provided by the analyst The most common format for a sports broadcast is to have an analyst color commentator work alongside the main play by play announcer An example is NBC Sunday Night Football in the United States which is called by color commentator Cris Collinsworth a former NFL receiver and play by play commentator Mike Tirico a professional announcer In the United Kingdom however there is a much less distinct division between play by play and color commentary although two man commentary teams usually feature an enthusiast with formal journalistic training but little or no competitive experience leading the commentary and an expert former or current competitor following up with analysis or summary There are however exceptions to this most of the United Kingdom s leading cricket and snooker commentators are former professionals in their sports while the former Formula One racing commentator Murray Walker had no formal journalistic training and only limited racing experience of his own he had come from an advertising background and his initial hiring was more of a comic double act than a traditional sports commentary pairing In the United States Pat Summerall a former professional kicker spent most of his broadcasting career as a play by play announcer Comedian Dennis Miller s short lived run as part of the Monday Night Football booth in caused what Miller himself described as a maelstrom of perplexed reviews br Although the combination of a play by play announcer and color commentator is now considered the standard it was much more common for a broadcast to have only one play by play announcer working alone Vin Scully longtime announcer for the Los Angeles Dodgers was one of the few examples of this practice lasting into the st century until he retired in The three person booth is a format used on Monday Night Football in which there are two color commentators usually one being a former player or coach and the other being an outsider such as a journalist Howard Cosell was one long running example or a comedian such as the before mentioned Dennis Miller br br br Sideline reporter br A sideline reporter assists a sports broadcasting crew with sideline coverage of the playing field or court The sideline reporter typically makes live updates on injuries and breaking news or conducts player interviews while players are on the field or court because the play by play broadcaster and color commentator must remain in their broadcast booth Sideline reporters are often granted inside information about an important update such as injury because they have the credentials necessary to do so In cases of big events teams consisting of many sideline reporters are placed strategically so that the main commentator has many sources to turn to for example some sideline reporters could be stationed in the dressing room area while others could be between the respective team benches In the United States sideline reporters are heavily restricted by NFL rules in contrast both the and incarnations of the XFL featured sideline reporters in a much more prominent role br In motorsports it is typical for there to be multiple pit reporters covering the event from along the pit road Their responsibilities include covering breaking news trackside probing crew chiefs and other team leaders about strategy and commentating on pit stops from along the pit wall On occasion in motorsport the reporter on the sideline is an understudy to the lead commentator as Fox NASCAR has used this tactic numerous times based on the career of Cup lead Mike Joy a former pit reporter Those who made the switch included Steve Byrnes Truck Series Vince Welch Truck Series since late and Adam Alexander who did Cup for Fox produced TNT broadcasts from Xfinity on Fox since did the same too br br br Sports presenter studio host br In British sports broadcasting the presenter of a sports broadcast is usually distinct from the commentator and often based in a remote broadcast television studio away from the sports venue In North America the on air personality based in the studio is called the studio host During their shows the presenter studio host may be joined by additional analysts or pundits especially when showing highlights of various other matches e g in Jim Nantz was the studio host for The Prudential College Football Report in Studio in New York for CBS Sports and during his four year tenure there through college football seasons he had Pat Haden in and Ara Parseghian in and as his co hosts pundits br br br Other roles br Various sports may have different commentator roles to cover situations unique to that sport In the s as popularized by Fox American football broadcasts began to increasingly employ rules analysts to explain penalties and controversial calls and analyze instant replay reviews to predict whether a call will or will not be overturned This helps viewers who may not understand some of the rules or calls understand further These analysts are typically former referees br br br Sportscaster br In North American English sportscaster is a general term for any type of commentator in a sports broadcast It may also refer to a sports talk show host or a newscaster covering sports news br br br Esports br In video games and particularly esports commentators are often called shout casters this term is derived from Shoutcast an internet audio streaming plugin and protocol associated with the Winamp media player They are also sometimes referred to as simply casters br br br United States br br While sports broadcasts took place from Florent Gibson of the Pittsburgh Post newspaper broadcast the first sports commentary in April covering the fight between Johnny Ray and Johnny Hutch Dundee at the Motor Square Garden Pittsburgh br One of the highest paid sportscasters in the United States is Tony Romo a former NFL quarterback and professional golfer who serves as lead color analyst for the NFL on CBS Romo earns per year for his contributions to the network br Jim Rome being the highest paid sports Broadcasters in The United States making over per year Jim also has his own Sports talk show called The Jim Rome Show syndicated by CBS Sports Radio br br br Women br In the National Hockey League NHL made headlines when two coaches of the NHL All Star Game in Montreal allowed Robin Herman The New York Times and Marcelle St Cyr CKLM radio in Montreal access into the men s locker room Both were believed to have been the first women ever allowed to enter a professional men s locker room to conduct a post game interview Sport organizations began to follow in the NHL s footsteps and allowed for other female sportswriters to be given the same access as men sportswriters br It was not until the year when Melissa Ludtke a sportswriter from Sports Illustrated was given the assignment to cover the New York Yankees playoff series but was denied entry into the men s locker room Baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn and other officials chose to discriminate against her based on her sex Knowing that this would put Sports Illustrated in a disadvantage from other publishers Time Inc and Ludtke filed a lawsuit against Kuhn br The lawsuit was taken to the United States District Court in where Judge Constance Baker Motley ruled the act as violating the th Amendment of the United States Constitution The court ruled that the Yankees organization devise a plan to protect the players of their privacy while female sportswriters conducted interviews suggesting the use of towels br After the access of allowing women in was put into effect the Yankees organization allowed reporters to spend ten minutes interviewing players and was then asked to leave and wait Male reporters were unhappy with this and blamed the women from keeping them out and not being able to do their job br In the issue made its way back into the headlines when Lisa Olson made a public statement revealing that players from the New England Patriots had exposed themselves while interviews were being conducted This prompted other female reporters who had been harassed to come forward Their credibility was undermined by accusations that female interviewers appeared as being too friendly or conversing too long with players as though they were flirting Thus the issue of sexism was still present despite the equal access to men s locker rooms br br br In professional wrestling br br Though not always the case in professional wrestling the color commentator is usually a heel sympathizer or a supporter of the bad guys as opposed to the play by play announcer who is more or less the voice of the fans as well as babyface sympathizers or supporters of the good guys Though both are supposed to show neutral stance while announcing the color commentators especially when they support heels are usually more blatant about their stance than the play by play announcers Jesse The Body Ventura and Bobby The Brain Heenan pioneered the heel sympathizer for color commentary in wrestling Jerry The King Lawler later made a successful transition into the same role though Lawler has since shown more sympathy for faces partially due to his popularity with fans after a forty year career br Rowdy Roddy Piper and Macho Man Randy Savage pioneered the babyface sympathizer for color commentary in wrestling Michael Cole as a play by play announcer for WWE since has also portrayed this role for most of his announcing career From to Cole served as a heel announcer showing arrogance and contempt for faces and more sympathy for the heels partially due to being bullying from other face wrestlers and jealousy from on screen authority figures and other commentators However after Lawler suffered a legitimate heart attack on the September episode of Raw Cole broke character and continued to provide updates on his colleague s condition whilst simultaneously calling the action His professionalism in the situation led to a slow babyface transition which was cemented when the two men hugged in the ring upon Lawler s return to commentating two month later br In some cases commentators are also active managers for wrestlers usually following continuity as heels Former Extreme Championship Wrestling color commentator Cyrus was known for having dual roles as a heel manager and a somewhat neutral commentator and continues to do so during his clients matches in New Japan Pro Wrestling and All Elite Wrestling Acting as a commentator has also been used to keep injured wrestlers such as Samoa Joe on Raw between late and April in the public eye while recuperating Special guest color commentators serve two purposes the primary is usually to place them in position to interfere with the match they are calling the second is to provide promoters with the opportunity to determine if this performer can speak well extemporaneously br br br See also br Announcerless game December experimental broadcast of an NFL game without TV commentators br List of
