The National Hockey League NHL began its second century in Since the NHL has added three new teams with the Vegas Golden Knights Seattle Kraken and Utah Hockey Club joining the Western Conference The COVID pandemic was a major disruption to the league during the and seasons The NHL played games without spectators in controlled conditions The Arizona Coyotes indefinitely suspended operations following the season becoming the first team to do so since the Brooklyn Americans in the team s hockey assets including its roster and coaches were transferred to the newly founded Utah franchise This era saw the emergence of Connor McDavid as a superstar becoming the first player in nearly years to record points in a single season among other accomplishments br br br Background br Prior to the NHL s last expansion was in adding the Columbus Blue Jackets and Minnesota Wild to bring the number of teams to thirty After the Atlanta Thrashers relocated to Winnipeg in sixteen of the teams in the league were in the Eastern time zone and the conferences remained balanced with fifteen teams each until the league realigned in Following the realignment all sixteen teams in the Eastern time zone were placed into the Eastern Conference and the remaining fourteen teams were placed in the Western Conference leaving the conferences unbalanced Beginning in the NHL started hearing from groups interested in getting an NHL franchise Interest was shown from groups in Seattle Kansas City Las Vegas and Quebec City Groups in the west were favoured by the NHL so as to even out the team distribution Seattle did not have an arena while Las Vegas and Quebec City were building new rinks In June the NHL announced that it was officially considering expansion and set an application deadline for July for teams to begin play in Prospective teams had to pay US million to apply of which million was refundable Las Vegas and Quebec City progressed to stage two of the process in August Ultimately only Las Vegas was approved by the league s Board of Governors on June to pay an expansion fee of US million Las Vegas was not considered to be a hotbed for ice hockey To ensure the new team s success on the ice and attendance the NHL made more players available in the expansion draft from the existing teams This led to a large number of trade deals by Las Vegas as existing teams sought to protect players strategically The shorter lists of protected players meant high profile players such as Marc Andre Fleury James Neal Eric Staal and Sami Vatanen were available for selection in the expansion draft br br br The second century br br br Vegas and Seattle additions br br In the Vegas Golden Knights joined the NHL increasing league membership to teams In their first season as a franchise the Golden Knights became an immediate success capturing the Pacific Division title en route to an appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals a feat never seen before in North American professional sports However they lost the series to the Washington Capitals losing four straight games after a victory in the first game Vegas returned to the Finals in defeating the Florida Panthers four games to one to win their first Stanley Cup and becoming the second fastest expansion team to win their first Cup br On December it was announced that a team in Seattle later named the Seattle Kraken would be the nd team in the league Upon debuting in the Kraken joined the Pacific Division with the Arizona Coyotes moving to the Central Division After a dismal inaugural season that saw them finish near the bottom of the league the Kraken reached the playoffs for the first time in their second season defeating the defending champion Colorado Avalanche in the first round before falling to the Dallas Stars in seven games in the second round br br br Multiple first time champions and Floridian success br The six year streak of a Pittsburgh Penguins Chicago Blackhawks or Los Angeles Kings Stanley Cup win came to an end in The Washington Capitals not seen in the Stanley Cup Finals since their loss to the Detroit Red Wings in won their first Stanley Cup in franchise history defeating the aforementioned Golden Knights in five games In the St Louis Blues who had not made the Finals since won their first Stanley Cup championship defeating the Boston Bruins in seven games As previously mentioned the expansion Vegas Golden Knights also won their first Stanley Cup in becoming the second fastest expansion team to win the Cup br br The season saw the Tampa Bay Lightning record one of the most successful regular seasons in NHL history in their Presidents Trophy winning campaign the team s wins tied the Detroit Red Wings then NHL all time record with Nikita Kucherov s points then the most in a single season during the salary cap era However the team suffered a humiliating first round playoff exit being swept by the wild card Columbus Blue Jackets in one of the largest upsets in NHL history and becoming the first Presidents Trophy winners to be swept in the first round However the team subsequently rebounded defeating the Dallas Stars to win the Stanley Cup the following year after a pandemic shortened season and modified playoff format The Lightning then repeated as champions in the similarly shortened and modified season defeating the Montreal Canadiens in the Stanley Cup Finals Tampa Bay additionally reached a third consecutive Stanley Cup Finals in but lost to the Colorado Avalanche in six games br In the same season as the Lightning s third consecutive Finals the cross state Florida Panthers won the Presidents Trophy for the first time despite head coach Joel Quenneville resigning early in the season as a result of the Chicago Blackhawks sexual assault scandal The Panthers would go on to win their first playoff series in years defeating the Washington Capitals in the first round in six games before being swept by the Lightning in the second round The following offseason the Panthers hired Paul Maurice as head coach and traded for Calgary Flames forward Matthew Tkachuk After narrowly making the playoffs as a wild card the Panthers upset the heavily favored record breaking Boston Bruins in the first round in seven games despite facing a deficit Florida would reach the Stanley Cup Finals their first since but fell to the Vegas Golden Knights in five games After defeating the Lightning in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs the Panthers returned to the Finals the following year marking the fifth consecutive Finals featuring a Florida based team Despite nearly blowing a series lead the Panthers defeated the Edmonton Oilers in seven games to win their first Stanley Cup br br br Further outdoor games br During the NHL s th anniversary celebrations in two one off outdoor games were held in Eastern Canada The NHL Centennial Classic took place at Toronto s BMO Field on January and it featured a rematch of the Winter Classic between the Red Wings and Maple Leafs Then on December the NHL Classic between the Canadiens and Senators was played at TD Place Stadium in Ottawa Canada commemorating the first games of the NHL in br br A unique series of NHL outdoor games took place on February and at the Edgewood Tahoe Resort near Lake Tahoe in Nevada The NHL Outdoors at Lake Tahoe event saw the Golden Knights play the Avalanche in the first game and the Bruins and Philadelphia Flyers in the second Unlike previous NHL outdoor games it was not held in a stadium or ballpark but in a golf course overlooking the lake and no fans were in attendance due to the COVID pandemic This event replaced both the Winter Classic and Stadium Series due to the shortened season see below br The Stadium Series continued to move into southern and non traditional markets On March the Capitals hosted the Toronto Maple Leafs at the Navy Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis Maryland in a unique partnership between the NHL and the United States Armed Forces The edition was contested between the Tampa Bay Lightning and Nashville Predators at Nissan Stadium in Nashville this was followed by the edition which featured the Capitals and the Carolina Hurricanes at Carter Finley Stadium on the campus of North Carolina State University in Raleigh The event returned north to MetLife Stadium just outside New York City and held multiple games for the first time since in two of the highest attended games in hockey history the Flyers took on the New Jersey Devils in the first game while the New York Rangers took on the New York Islanders in the second br br The Winter Classic additionally saw a move southward with the NHL Winter Classic taking place at the Cotton Bowl between the Predators and Stars The event meanwhile featured a battle of expansion teams with the Golden Knights and Kraken facing off in Seattle s T Mobile Park The Heritage Classic continued to be held irregularly most notably the edition became the first to be officially hosted by an American team with the Buffalo Sabres playing as the home team against the Maple Leafs at Tim Hortons Field in Hamilton Ontario br br br Olympic participation br In the NHL elected not to send its players to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang South Korea While the league initially considered sending players to the Winter Olympics they ultimately opted not to due to complications with COVID protocols In the NHL and International Ice Hockey Federation announced that NHL players would participate in the Winter Olympics br br br COVID concerns br br The NHL halted play in the season due to the COVID pandemic indefinitely postponing the remainder of the regular season and playoffs In early March the NHL suspended media access to the locker rooms saying that only official personnel would be allowed in after the games to limit person to person contact But after the National Basketball Association NBA suspended all games when two players tested positive for the disease the NHL scheduled a meeting to discuss pausing the season On March the morning practice sessions and media access were cancelled for all teams Shortly after they announced the season was paused indefinitely It was the biggest interruption to an NHL season since the NHL lockout On March it was announced that a player from the Ottawa Senators tested positive for COVID On March it was announced that a second Senators player tested positive for COVID Two Colorado Avalanche players also tested positive for the virus On April the originally intended date for the final games of the regular season Commissioner Gary Bettman participated in a call with President Donald Trump and other sport commissioners on the state of the sport world br On May the league and the NHLPA agreed on a basic framework to stage a team playoff tournament behind closed doors The seeds would be based on each club s points percentage when the season paused on March effectively scrapping the remainder of the regular season The top four seeds in each conference would get a bye while the next eight seeds in each conference would play in a best of five series Many of the logistics still have to be negotiated including COVID testing protocols visas and whether these games would be held in one or more hub cities as the Canada United States border remains closed to non essential travel until June That same day the U S government announced that foreign athletes would be exempted from pandemic related travel bans still in effect br On May the NHL announced phase two of its Return to Play Plan which was to begin at some point in June Players would be allowed to resume use of team practice facilities in small groups no more than six with only players allowed on ice and no other agents or press admitted Players were required to self isolate for days if they used public transport and would be regularly monitored and tested for COVID If a player tested positive they were not allowed to attend training until cleared with teams suggested to use guidelines issued by the U S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC Training camps phase three were planned to reopen no later than the first half of July br On May Bettman formally discussed aspects of the Return to Play Plan including the proposed team playoff format with the top four teams in each conference playing a round robin tournament under regular season overtime rules to determine their seeding and modifications to the procedures for the Draft Lottery Whether the first and second round proper would use a best of five format as opposed to seven was to be determined the conference finals and Stanley Cup Finals were each to remain a best of seven series Bettman stated that at least two hub cities would be used for the playoffs shortlisting hosts such as Chicago Columbus Dallas Las Vegas Los Angeles Minneapolis Pittsburgh Vancouver Edmonton and Toronto the latter two of which would be chosen by the league on July Health testing and security protocols would be in place at these sites As Canadian law requires all travellers entering the country to self isolate for days on arrival Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly stated that this may impact the ability to use Canadian host cities unless these issues can be addressed br On June it was announced that the NHL and NHLPA had approved aspects of the format that had not yet been finalized during the May briefing with the first and second rounds proper using a best of seven format as usual and all teams being reseeded after each round to account for the lack of home advantage due to all games being played at a neutral site br It was reported that the NHL planned to have one American host and one Canadian host As Canada s Quarantine Act required all travelers entering the country to self isolate for days on arrival Deputy Commissioner Daly stated that it could impact the ability to use Canadian host cities unless the issues could be addressed On June British Columbia Premier John Horgan stated that the province s medical officer Bonnie Henry had endorsed proposed protocols developed by the Vancouver Canucks in collaboration with local officials and that they were being sent to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for federal approval These include allowing the NHL to cohort players and restrict their access to the general public br Phase two of the Return to Play Plan began on June Amidst an intense growth of new cases in Florida the Tampa Bay Lightning temporarily closed their training facility on June after several staff members and three players tested positive for COVID br On June Rogers Sportsnet reported that Vancouver s bid had been complicated by disagreements over protocols for positive cases The next day Global BC s Richard Zussman reported that the NHL had moved on for now from Vancouver and was increasing its focus on Edmonton and Toronto as potential sites While Las Vegas was initially considered a front runner a spike of cases in Nevada and other U S states led to reports on July that the NHL had decided on Edmonton and Toronto as the sites br On July the NHL confirmed that it had ratified agreements with the NHLPA to begin the playoffs on August concluding no later than early October with games being hosted by Edmonton Western Conference early rounds conference finals and Stanley Cup Finals and Toronto Eastern Conference early rounds The league also renewed its CBA for four additional seasons which includes an increase to minimum player salaries and a deference of player salaries for the season to be paid out over three seasons beginning br The season began on January over three months after the previous season had concluded The league unveiled a game regular season and that the teams would temporarily be realigned into four regional divisions Due to limitations on travel into and out of Canada the seven Canadian teams were aligned into a single North division The seven teams in the North Division played each other nine or ten times during the regular season The other teams from the United States were realigned into the Central East and West divisions br The NHL returned to a full game season in coinciding with the addition of the Seattle Kraken and the return to the previous divisional alignment However by late November despite the availability of COVID vaccines most teams again endured COVID outbreaks resulting in many postponed games In the case of Canadian teams some postponed games came as a result of attendance restrictions from local governments due to localized outbreaks The entire season calendar which originally scheduled an Olympic break in February after the All Star Game so that players could participate in the Winter Olympics was reworked to make up the games lost due to COVID outbreaks Thus NHL players were again barred from competing in the Olympics On June the Colorado Avalanche won their third Cup in defeating the two time defending champion Tampa Bay Lightning in six games br br br Connor McDavid s emergence br br During the late s and early s Edmonton Oilers forward Connor McDavid emerged as one of the greatest players in the history of the league After winning his first Art Ross Trophy as the NHL s leading scorer and Hart Memorial Trophy as league MVP in McDavid went on to win two more Hart Trophies in and the former of which made him only the second unanimous MVP in NHL history McDavid likewise won four further Art Ross wins in the aforementioned years as well as and and added his first Maurice Rocket Richard Trophy in as the NHL s leading goal scorer br Despite the season s shortening to games due to the aforementioned COVID pandemic McDavid recorded a league leading points in the process becoming the first player since Mario Lemieux in to reach points in or fewer games He followed this historic performance two years later in where he became only the sixth player in league history and first since the aforementioned Lemieux in to record points ending his season with a league leading points in games Though he failed to achieve again in McDavid instead became the fourth player in NHL history and first since Wayne Gretzky in to reach assists in a single season The same year McDavid led the Oilers to the Stanley Cup Finals although the Oilers ultimately lost in seven games McDavid led the team back from a series deficit to even the series ultimately becoming the sixth player and second skater ever after Reggie Leach in to win the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP despite losing the Finals In game four of the Finals McDavid also broke Gretzky s single playoff assist record with his assist on a Dylan Holloway goal marking his nd of the playoffs Additionally McDavid recorded back to back four point games in games four and five of the Finals setting a new NHL record for the most total points in consecutive Finals games br br br Boston s historic season br The Boston Bruins recorded statistically the greatest regular season campaign in NHL history Winning the Presidents Trophy for the fourth time Boston s wins and points both set new NHL records surpassing the wins shared by the aforementioned Detroit Red Wings and Tampa Bay Lightning and points held by the Montreal Canadiens The team set multiple other records as well becoming the fastest team to points and wins in NHL history as well as setting a new record of consecutive home wins to start the season br Despite this and like the aforementioned Lightning the Bruins suffered a first round elimination to the wild card Florida Panthers despite holding a series lead four games into the series The Panthers would go on to win the Eastern Conference before losing the Stanley Cup Finals to the Vegas Golden Knights in five games br br br Deactivation of the Arizona Coyotes and expansion to Utah br After years of instability the Arizona Coyotes were purchased by Alex Meruelo in However in the city of Glendale and Gila River Arena terminated its operating lease with the Coyotes after the season forcing the Coyotes to submit proposals for a new arena in Tempe and possibly play at a temporary location during its construction The team elected to temporarily play at the seat Mullett Arena on the campus of Arizona State University beginning in while the Tempe project was pursued however the public referendum to approve the arena failed with voters rejecting the proposed development br On April it was reported that with the NHL s permission the Coyotes had begun efforts to relocate to Salt Lake City Utah following concerns about an indefinite timeframe on a new arena and the effects of continued play at Mullett Arena The sale which involved the NHL buying the franchise from Coyotes owner Meruelo then reselling it to Ryan Smith owner of the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association NBA became official on April after the NHL Board of Governors voted to establish a team in Utah using the Coyotes hockey assets under the terms of the agreement rather than a formal relocation the Coyotes will be considered inactive with Utah regarded as an expansion team in a similar situation to the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League The Coyotes will continue minor business operations while Meruelo remains on the NHL Board of Governors as an observer retaining the rights to the Coyotes brand with a five year window to build or otherwise locate a new arena for the team If this effort is successful the Coyotes will be reactivated through an expansion draft conversely if Meruelo fails to provide a suitable arena by end of that five year window he will be required to cede the franchise back to the NHL This would result in the franchise ceasing operations permanently at that time br While the deal was reported in the media as a US billion sale of the Coyotes it was in reality two separate transactions in which billion was paid by the NHL to Meruelo for the Coyotes franchise while Smith is paying a billion expansion fee to the NHL s other owners The million difference is thus in effect a de facto relocation fee to be shared equally by the other NHL clubs br The Utah Hockey Club will begin play out of the Delta Center in the NHL season with a temporary name and colors while a full identity is developed in
