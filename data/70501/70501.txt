The Atlanta Thrashers were a professional ice hockey team based in Atlanta Atlanta was granted a franchise in the National Hockey League NHL on June and became the League s th franchise when it began play in the season They were members of the Southeast Division of the NHL s Eastern Conference and played their home games at what is now known as State Farm Arena in downtown Atlanta The Thrashers qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs in the season after winning the Southeast Division but were swept in the first round by the New York Rangers br In May the Thrashers were sold to Canadian based ownership group True North Sports Entertainment The group moved the franchise to Winnipeg which became the second incarnation of the Winnipeg Jets the first incarnation of the Winnipeg Jets relocated to Phoenix in to become the Coyotes The sale and relocation were approved by the NHL on June With the sale and relocation of the team Atlanta became the first city in the NHL s modern era to have two ice hockey teams relocate to different cities In both cases the team moved from Atlanta to a Western Canadian city the city s previous NHL team the Atlanta Flames moved to Calgary in to become the Calgary Flames br br br Franchise history br br After the departure of the International Hockey League IHL s Atlanta Knights to become the Quebec Rafales the city of Atlanta was awarded an NHL franchise on June as part of a four team tiered expansion This also included teams in Nashville Columbus and St Paul in which each new franchise would begin play as its respective new arena was completed The birth of the new franchise marked NHL hockey s return to Georgia after the Atlanta Flames established in departed for Canada in to become the Calgary Flames The Flames had been the League s first foray into the southern U S and their failure discouraged further efforts to bring NHL hockey south of Washington for another decade br The nickname Thrashers after Georgia s state bird the Brown Thrasher was selected from a fan poll Thrashers had actually been runner up to Flames in the poll as a homage to the old Atlanta Flames and Philips Arena the Thrashers new home was built on the site of the former Omni which had been home to the Flames By coincidence the first encampment circa which later became Atlanta was called Thrasherville and a historical marker of this is located just down from the arena in front of the State Bar of Georgia the former home of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta The team was owned by Atlanta based media mogul Ted Turner who also owned Major League Baseball s Atlanta Braves and the NBA s Atlanta Hawks br br br The early years br The newly formed Thrashers selected Patrik Stefan with the first overall selection and Luke Sellars with the th overall pick second pick of the second round in the NHL Entry Draft However the entire NHL Entry Draft was a major disappointment for the Thrashers as all of their draft picks were out of the NHL by the team s last season Stefan played the most games for the Thrashers from that draft Their first two picks Stefan and Sellars were two of the biggest disappointments in draft history NHL com listed Stefan as the worst first overall pick of all time and Sellars who played only one NHL game as the worst th overall pick in NHL history This was a surprise as not only did the media hype Stefan as a franchise player but hockey experts also considered then Thrashers general manager Don Waddell to have excellent scouting ability br The Thrashers played their first game on October losing to the New Jersey Devils Captain Kelly Buchberger scored the franchise s first goal in the loss and the team finished their first season in last place in the Southeast Division with wins losses including four overtime losses and seven ties for a total of points br Atlanta had the second overall pick in the NHL Entry Draft this draft brought better results as the player chosen with that pick Dany Heatley became one of the team s best players The team also had a fine choice in the Draft with first overall pick Ilya Kovalchuk Both Heatley and Kovalchuk played their first season in the NHL in both were named to the NHL All Rookie Team and Heatley was awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy as the League s Rookie of the Year br The early years of the Atlanta Thrashers saw a sharp increase of hockey fans in Atlanta Ticket sales for Thrashers games averaged at per night many of them being season tickets A section of the arena was dedicated to season ticket holders that called themselves the Nasty Nest The Nasty Nest chanted and shouted at the opposing team to disrupt them The Thrashers also had two Thrasher bird heads that faced opposite to the scoreboard The Thrasher heads opened their beaks to reveal a flamethrower that ignited when the team scored a goal At this time the franchise adopted a motto Believe in Blueland which was often used in advertising br At the same time however the Thrashers were hamstrung by Turner s reluctance to spend the money it took to make them competitive According to veteran forward Ray Ferraro who played for the Thrashers during their first three seasons Waddell told him that Turner treated the Thrashers mostly as an afterthought they were allocated whatever money was left over after Turner allocated payroll for the Braves and Hawks br Marcel Comeau was named director of amateur scouting for the Thrashers on July and stayed in the role until the team was sold br br br The Atlanta Spirit years and the NHL lockout br Turner stepped down as vice chairman of AOL Time Warner parent company of Turner s Turner Broadcasting System in A year later AOL Time Warner sold both teams to Atlanta Spirit LLC a group consisting of businessmen based both in Atlanta and elsewhere br It later emerged that Atlanta Spirit almost immediately put the Thrashers on the market which only came to light after one of a myriad of lawsuits involving the consortium br Tragedy struck the team just eight days after the sale as star forward Dany Heatley crashed his Ferrari in a one car accident that seriously injured both himself and Thrashers center Dan Snyder Heatley suffered a broken jaw and arm a sprained wrist and a torn anterior cruciate ligament ACL and medial collateral ligament MCL Snyder died five days later due to septic shock from his injuries The Thrashers dedicated their entire season to Snyder s memory and Thrashers players wore black patches with Snyder s number on their jerseys for the season Heatley s blood alcohol content was below the legal limit but his combination of speeding he was driving an estimated miles per hour and recklessness led to criminal charges which were later dropped He eventually received three years probation and community service br Led by captain Shawn McEachern the Thrashers jumped quickly out of the gate with some notable highlights Ilya Kovalchuk scored eight goals in the first seven games including two hat tricks one in a rout of the Chicago Blackhawks and another in a come from behind victory against the Nashville Predators Those comeback victories became a recurring sight throughout the season as Atlanta pulled off stunning upsets over the Toronto Maple Leafs Boston Bruins and Ottawa Senators as well as wins against the Los Angeles Kings and New York Islanders br Eleven games into the season the Thrashers were in first place in the Southeast Division and the NHL Although they continued to play well they could not keep up with the Tampa Bay Lightning the eventual Stanley Cup champions or other teams in the League Boxing Day marked both a bright and dark day for the Thrashers On that day Heatley skated for the first time since his car accident with Snyder but it also marked the last win for the Thrashers before an extended losing streak From December to February the team went a dismal Kovalchuk became only the second Thrashers player to score in the NHL All Star Game after Heatley br While the Thrashers playoff hopes were done for the year they finished second in the Southeast Division to Tampa Bay and tenth in the Eastern Conference only a handful of wins away from the Stanley Cup playoffs Kovalchuk tied for the League lead in goals with the Calgary Flames Jarome Iginla and the Columbus Blue Jackets Rick Nash Goaltender Kari Lehtonen began his NHL career with four wins in four starts including one shutout br br br Post lockout br Before the start of the season the Thrashers signed several NHL veterans in the hopes of making the playoffs including forwards Bobby Holik and Scott Mellanby defenseman Jaroslav Modry and goaltender Mike Dunham At the same time however they lost one of their brightest stars as Heatley requested a trade in an attempt to leave behind memories of his tragic car accident He was eventually swapped to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for Marian Hossa a four time goal scorer at the time of the trade and Greg de Vries br The season saw the Thrashers win a club record games even with numerous goaltending injuries Only a few minutes into the first game of the season Kari Lehtonen pulled his groin an injury that would keep him out for a good portion of the season Veteran backup Mike Dunham an experienced number one netminder stepped in but also promptly injured himself only a few games later this left only prospects Michael Garnett and Adam Berkhoel to tend goal Journeyman goaltender Steve Shields was signed but he too was injured within ten games On April Lehtonen was run into by Tampa Bay s Chris Dingman injuring him yet again The remainder of the season was left to Dunham Garnett was injured in a game against the Washington Capitals Dunham who had started the game but was relieved by the young rookie after poor play was forced back into action in the third period br br br Brief success and only playoff appearance br br The Thrashers season began with the highest expectations in franchise history even after the team s second leading scorer Marc Savard departed as a free agent for the Boston Bruins Veteran center Steve Rucchin Niko Kapanen and Jon Sim were acquired in an effort to make up for the Savard loss With NHL superstars Marian Hossa and Ilya Kovalchuk as well as a healthy goaltender in Kari Lehtonen the Thrashers clinched their first and only playoff berth winning the Southeast Division title with wins and claiming the third seed in the Conference and home ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs However they were eliminated from the playoffs on April being swept by the New York Rangers in four straight games in the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals br This season was the highest attended the Thrashers ever had with every home playoff game sold out as well as the season opening and closing games The team was gaining notoriety within the league for their playoff debut and team popularity within Atlanta reached an all time high Atlanta based hip hop artist Lil Jon publicly showed his support for the team posing for a picture with the Stanley Cup while wearing a Thrashers jersey After this season the Thrashers ticket sales would start dwindling due to the housing market crash of and a stale economy in Atlanta It did not help matters that the great majority of Thrashers fans lived in Atlanta s northern suburbs and were not willing to brave Atlanta s infamous traffic to go to games at Philips Arena br br br Struggles br Just months after reaching the playoffs for the first time the Thrashers began the season Consequently they fired Head Coach Bob Hartley on October with General Manager Don Waddell taking over behind the bench on an interim basis The Thrashers ended the season with only points finishing th in the

history In his first season the Thrashers matched their previous season with points while finishing th in the Eastern Conference Simultaneously Atlanta Spirit LLC the team s ownership group was coming apart at the seams A dispute between Steve Belkin and his seven fellow owners dated back to Belkin claimed the other owners breached their contract giving him the right to buy them out at cost while his partners said they should be able to buy out Belkin s stake On November court proceedings began in Maryland to decide the group s fate br In the final year of his contract Ilya Kovalchuk and the Thrashers could not come to an agreement on an extension General Manager Don Waddell reportedly offered year million and seven year million contracts both of which Kovalchuk turned down Rather than potentially losing him to free agency in the off season the team traded Kovalchuk on February to the New Jersey Devils Atlanta received defenseman Johnny Oduya rookie forward Niclas Bergfors junior prospect Patrice Cormier and a first round pick in the NHL Entry Draft in exchange for Kovalchuk and defenseman Anssi Salmela the teams also traded second round selections in The Thrashers finished
