History of ice hockey in Salt Lake City br br Prior to the arrival of the NHL Salt Lake City had limited ice hockey history The first team to call the area home the minor league Salt Lake Golden Eagles played seasons across the Western Hockey League WHL Central Hockey League CHL and International Hockey League IHL from to Playing out of the Salt Palace for their first seasons and the then new Delta Center for their final three the Golden Eagles won two Adams Cup championships in the CHL and two Turner Cup championships in the IHL before ultimately being sold and relocating to Auburn Hills Michigan as the Detroit Vipers after the IHL season br After just one season out of ice hockey Salt Lake received another IHL franchise in as the reigning Turner Cup champion Denver Grizzlies having been replaced by the newly relocated Colorado Avalanche of the NHL relocated to the Delta Center for the season as the Utah Grizzlies The Grizzlies spent two seasons in Salt Lake City proper including a second consecutive Turner Cup championship in notably the Cup clinching game of the Turner Cup Finals saw an attendance of at the time the largest attendance in minor league ice hockey history The Grizzlies later moved to the newly constructed E Center since renamed the Maverik Center in the suburb of West Valley City for the IHL season and joined the American Hockey League AHL in alongside five other surviving IHL franchises upon the latter s collapse However the Grizzlies voluntarily suspended operations for the season before being sold to Dan Gilbert the owner of the NBA s Cleveland Cavaliers and relocating to Cleveland Ohio as the Lake Erie Monsters later Cleveland Monsters for the season br The AHL iteration of the Grizzlies were subsequently replaced by a relocated ECHL franchise of the same name the franchise had most recently played in Lexington Kentucky as the Lexington Men O War but had become dormant after the ECHL season The new Grizzlies began play out of the E Center in immediately after their AHL predecessor had gone dormant and have played seasons in the ECHL since However the franchise has been comparatively unsuccessful although they have missed the playoffs only three times they have won just one division championship and no conference championships only having reached the conference finals twice br The Delta Center has hosted multiple Los Angeles Kings preseason games as part of the NHL s Frozen Fury series However the arena was not considered well suited to host ice hockey permanently owing to poor sightlines and broadcasting capabilities The Maverik Center and the Peaks Ice Arena in the suburb of Provo hosted the ice hockey tournaments at the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City which featured NHL players Salt Lake City is also the preferred host city for the Winter Olympics br br br Establishment of the team br Salt Lake City initially emerged as a potential NHL destination in June with rumors regarding the Arizona Coyotes potential relocation spreading after the failure of the New Tempe Arena referendum Six months later in January Ryan Smith owner of the NBA s Utah Jazz and co owner of Major League Soccer s Real Salt Lake petitioned the NHL to begin the process of expansion to Salt Lake City Discussions to bring an expansion team to the city were revealed to have been underway since early with the Utah State Senate passing tax legislation in February to support a new ice hockey capable downtown arena proposed by Smith the only condition asked by the Senate was that any potential team be branded Utah to honor the state in general as opposed to any branding using Salt Lake City br On April it was reported that with the NHL s permission the Coyotes were making efforts to relocate to Salt Lake City following concerns about an indefinite timeframe on a new arena and the effects of continued play at the seat Mullett Arena The deal became official on April after the NHL Board of Governors voted to establish a team in Utah using the Coyotes hockey assets under the terms of the agreement rather than a formal relocation the Coyotes will be considered inactive with Utah regarded as an expansion team in a similar situation to the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League br While the deal was reported in the media as a billion sale of the Coyotes it is in reality two separate transactions in which billion is being paid by the NHL to Alex Meruelo for the Coyotes franchise while Smith is paying a billion expansion fee to the NHL s other owners The million difference is thus in effect a de facto relocation fee to be shared equally by the other NHL clubs According to Smith the team sold more than season ticket deposits in the four hours after going on
