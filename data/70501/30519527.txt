The St Louis Blues are a professional ice hockey team based in St Louis The Blues compete in the National Hockey League NHL as a member of the Central Division in the Western Conference The franchise was founded in as one of the six teams from the NHL expansion and is named after the W C Handy song Saint Louis Blues They play their home games at the seat Enterprise Center in downtown St Louis which has been their arena since moving from St Louis Arena in br The Blues won the Stanley Cup in and have the most Stanley Cup playoff appearances outside of the Original Six Although frequent postseason contenders for most of their history the franchise has usually struggled in the playoffs including consecutive Stanley Cup Finals defeats at the end of their first three seasons With the Blues victory in their fourth Stanley Cup Finals years after their last appearance and in their nd year of existence they became the final active team from the expansion to win their first Stanley Cup br The Blues have a rivalry with the Chicago Blackhawks with whom they have shared a division since The Springfield Thunderbirds of the American Hockey League AHL and Bloomington ECHL team ECHL is the team s minor league affiliate br br br Franchise history br br br Hockey in St Louis before br Although the St Louis Arena was not originally designed with hockey in mind it met NHL standards of the era for size and had good sight lines for the game After an ice plant was installed the minor league St Louis Flyers began play there in St Louis soon began to attract the interest as a potential NHL market eventually leading the owners of the moribund Ottawa Senators to move there for the season The move proved both ill conceived and ill timed as the renamed St Louis Eagles continued to lose money Their situation was not helped by the decision to keep the Eagles in the Canadian Division to keep the divisions balanced which left the team with unaffordable travel expenses to games in Toronto and Montreal The team finished last in the division and disbanded after one season br Following further contraction the league stabilized at six teams after During this period the NHL rebuffed attempts at further expansion Eventually the St Louis Arena came under the control of the owners of the Chicago Black Hawks The Black Hawks treated St Louis as a secondary market placing minor league affiliates there and even playing a few NHL games in St Louis during the s while the team still struggled to sell tickets at Chicago Stadium br br br expansion br The Blues were one of the six teams added to the NHL in the expansion along with the Minnesota North Stars Los Angeles Kings Philadelphia Flyers Pittsburgh Penguins and California Seals St Louis was the last of the six expansion teams to gain entry into the League the market was chosen over Baltimore at the insistence of the Black Hawks owners James D Norris and Arthur Wirtz Following the Black Hawks championship in the team became much more successful at the box office in Chicago thus St Louis was no longer useful as a secondary market Nevertheless the Black Hawks owners still owned the St Louis Arena They sought to unload what was then a decrepit facility which had not been well maintained since the s and thus pressed the NHL to give the franchise to St Louis which had not submitted a formal expansion bid The Black Hawks owners felt they could establish a lovable loser much like the Cubs with the St Louis hockey team NHL president Clarence Campbell said during the expansion meetings We want a team in St Louis because of the city s geographical location and the fact that it has an adequate building br The team s first owners were insurance tycoon Sid Salomon Jr his son Sid Salomon III and Robert L Wolfson who were granted the franchise in Sid Salomon III convinced his initially wary father to make a bid for the team Former St Louis Cardinals great Stan Musial and Musial s business partner Julius Biggie Garagnani were also members of the man investment group that made the initial formal application for the franchise Garagnani would never see the Blues franchise take the ice as he died from a heart attack on June less than three months before the Blues played their first preseason game Upon acquiring the franchise in Salomon then spent several million dollars on extensive renovations for the year old arena expanding it from seats to br br br Beginnings and Stanley Cup Finals appearances br br Lynn Patrick initially served as general manager and head coach However he resigned as head coach in late November after recording a record He was replaced by assistant coach Scotty Bowman who thereafter led the team to a winning record for the rest of the season Like the other five expansion teams the Blues roster consisted primarily of castoffs from the Original Six and players who had previously never managed to break out of the minor leagues As part of the expansion the NHL had agreed to put all of the expansion teams in the new Western Division an arrangement which was intended to ensure all of the new teams all had an equal chance of reaching the playoffs br Under the expansion playoff format Bowman s leadership was enough as the Blues qualified for the playoffs in their inaugural season Although they had finished in third place St Louis was regarded as fairly evenly matched with the other three Western qualifiers since only four points separated first and fourth place Ultimately it was the Blues who prevailed by winning in seven games each over the Philadelphia Flyers and Minnesota North Stars to reach the Stanley Cup Finals However St Louis was swept in their first Finals appearance by the heavily favored Montreal Canadiens br Under Bowman the Blues dominated the West for the next two seasons becoming the only expansion team to compile a winning record and they captured division titles by wide margins each year However they were swept in the Stanley Cup Finals by the Montreal Canadiens in and then by the Boston Bruins in br While the first Blues teams included fading veterans like Doug Harvey Don McKenney and Dickie Moore the goaltending tandem of veterans Glenn Hall and Jacques Plante proved more durable winning a Vezina Trophy in behind a sterling defense that featured players like skilled defensive forward Jim Roberts team captain Al Arbour and hardrock brothers Bob and Barclay Plager Phil Goyette won the Lady Byng Trophy for the Blues in and New York Rangers castoff Red Berenson became the expansion team s first major star at center The arena quickly became one of the loudest buildings in the NHL a reputation it maintained throughout its tenure as the Blues home br During that time Salomon gained a reputation throughout the NHL as the top players owner He gave his players cars signed them to deferred contracts and treated them to vacations in Florida The players used to being treated like mere commodities felt the only way they could pay him back was to give their best on the ice every night br br br Financial problems near move and playoff streak br The Blues successes in the late s however did not continue into the s The Stanley Cup playoff format changed in such a way that a Western team was no longer guaranteed a Finals berth and also the Chicago Black Hawks were moved into the Western Division following the expansion The Blues lost Bowman who left during the season following a power sharing dispute with Sid Salomon III who was taking an increasing role in team affairs as well as Hall Plante Goyette and ultimately Berenson who were all lost to retirement or trade Veteran player Al Arbour hastily stepped in to coach the team Under Arbour the Blues essentially matched their regular season performance in their fourth season and were still the best of the expansion teams however it was only good enough for second place in the West as St Louis finished points behind Chicago The Blues would go on to be upset by the North Stars in six games thus failing to advance past the first round for the first time in franchise history br Arbour who officially retired as a player after the season would remain behind the Blues bench for the next two seasons The Berenson trade did bring then Detroit Red Wings star center Garry Unger who ultimately scored goals in eight consecutive seasons while breaking the NHL s consecutive games played record Defensively however the Blues were less than stellar and saw Chicago and the Philadelphia Flyers overtake the Division After missing the playoffs for the first time in the Blues ended up in the Smythe Division after a League realignment This division was particularly weak and in the Blues won it while finishing five games below though this would be their last playoff appearance in the decade br br In the meantime the franchise was on the brink of financial collapse This was partly due to the pressures of the World Hockey Association WHA but mostly the result of financial decisions made when the Salomons first acquired the franchise The deferred contracts came due just as the Blues performance began to slip At one point the Salomons cut the team s staff down to three employees One of them was Emile Francis who served as team president general manager and head coach In hopes of saving the franchise Francis persuaded St Louis based pet food giant Ralston Purina to buy the team arena and the million debt The Salomons sold the Blues to Ralston on July However longtime Ralston Purina chairman R Hal Dean said that he intended to keep the Blues as a Ralston subsidiary only temporarily until a more stable owner who would keep the team in St Louis could be found Ralston renamed the arena the Checkerdome After two awful years including what is still a franchise worst record with points in the Blues made the playoffs the following year the first of consecutive postseason appearances br After being one of the worst teams a couple of years before they were one of the best in as they finished with a then franchise best record of record which translated to points and the second best record in the league Ten players reached at least goals including Wayne Babych future Hall of Famer Bernie Federko and team captain Brian Sutter They also had strong goaltending led by Mike Liut They would get rewarded as head coach Red Berenson won the Jack Adams Award Mike Liut finished a close second to Wayne Gretzky in the Hart Trophy voting and earned the top spot on the NHL All Star team Larry Patey finished third in the Frank J Selke Trophy voting and Blake Dunlop won the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy Their regular season success however did not transfer into the playoffs as they were eliminated by the New York Rangers in the second round after beating the Pittsburgh Penguins in the first round The Blues would underachieve greatly the following year as they posted a but they beat the Winnipeg Jets in the Norris Division Semi Finals before dropping to the Chicago Black Hawks in the Norris Division br br While the Blues had returned to respectability on the ice they were struggling off it Ralston Purina lost an estimated million a year during its six year ownership of the Blues However Dean took the losses philosophically having taken over out of a sense of civic responsibility In Dean retired His successor William Stiritz wanted to refocus on the core pet food business and his personal sporting interests were in horse racing rather than hockey He saw the Blues as just another money bleeding division and put the team on the market While there were a number of interested parties none had enough cash to meet Ralston s asking price On January Batoni Hunter Enterprises Ltd led by WHA and Edmonton Oilers founder Bill Hunter tendered an offer to buy the team Hunter intended to build a million seat arena in his hometown of Saskatoon Saskatchewan to house the team in time for the season While the fans were stunned the players were aware of this When the Blues faced the Oilers on December brochures were distributed titled Saskatchewan in the NHL These distractions would greatly affect their performance as they squeezed into the playoffs with a record in the season good enough for points This led to a Norris Division semi finals exit against the Chicago Black Hawks Following their playoff exit Ralston authorized the deal to Hunter s company renamed Coliseum Holdings Ltd for million on April Emile Francis would call it quits on May leaving to become president and general manager of the Hartford Whalers The Blues then fired percent of their employees The remaining staff included the accounting department scouting staff and coach Barclay Plager They waited for an authorization by of the NHL Board of Governors for the sale and transfer of the club However the NHL Board of Governors rejected the deal by a vote on May feeling that Saskatoon was not big enough to support an NHL team and also wary of Hunter s involvement based on his roles in the WHA br Ralston then filed a million anti trust lawsuit in U S District Court claiming that the NHL broke federal antitrust laws and breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing by voting to reject the sale and transfer of the Blues to Hunter s group They also requested that the court allow them to give up the team and bar the NHL from interfering with the sale of the team On June Ralston announced that it had no interest in running the team anymore Because they were not required to participate in the NHL Entry Draft they did not send a representative which led the Blues to forfeit their picks The day after the draft the NHL filed a million counter suit against Ralston accusing Ralston of damaging the league by willfully wantonly and maliciously collapsing its St Louis Blues hockey operation The NHL also said that Ralston broke a league rule that an owner had to give two years notice before dissolving a franchise Ralston called the counter suit ridiculous and gave the NHL an ultimatum if the NHL would not accept Hunter s offer by June Ralston would dissolve the team and sell its players and assets to other teams The Board of Governors rejected the offer and terminated the team on June one day before Ralston s supposed deadline It then took control of the franchise and began searching for a new owner League president John Ziegler said they would try to keep the team in St Louis However had the league not found a new owner by August it would dissolve the team and hold a dispersal draft for the players On July ten days before the deadline the NHL approved a bid from businessman Harry Ornest and a group of St Louis based investors for the team and the arena Ornest had made plans to buy the team as early as March but built up his efforts in late June to have enough money Ornest immediately reverted the name of the team s home venue to the St Louis Arena To date this is the closest that an NHL team has come to folding since the Cleveland Barons merged with the Minnesota North Stars after the season br Ornest ran the Blues very cheaply though the players did not mind According to Sutter they wanted to stay in St Louis because it reminded them of the rural Canadian towns where many of them grew up For instance Ornest asked many players to defer their salaries to help meet operating costs but the players always got paid in the end During most of Ornest s tenure the Blues had only players under contract in St Louis plus three on their farm team the Montana Magic Most NHL teams during the mid s had over players under contract Despite operating on a shoestring the Blues remained competitive even though they never finished more than six games over in Ornest s three years as owner During this time Doug Gilmour drafted by St Louis in emerged as a star br While the Blues remained competitive they were unable to keep many of their young players More often than not several of the Blues emerging stars ended up as Calgary Flames and the sight of Flames executive Al MacNeil was always greeted with dread In fact several of the Blues young stars such as Rob Ramage Joe Mullen and Gilmour were main cogs in the Flames Stanley Cup win Sutter and Federko were the only untouchables on the Blues during that era By the team reached the Campbell Conference Finals against the Flames Doug Wickenheiser s overtime goal in Game to cap a furious comeback remains one of the greatest moments in team history known locally as the Monday Night Miracle but the Blues lost Game Years later Sutter argued that had the Blues made it to the Stanley Cup Finals they would have likely beaten the Canadiens having won two out of three games against the Habs in the regular season After that season Ornest sold the team to a group led by St Louis businessman Michael Shanahan br br br Brett Hull era br br St Louis kept chugging along through the late s and early s General manager Ron Caron made astute moves landing forwards Brett Hull Adam Oates and Brendan Shanahan defenseman Al MacInnis and goaltender Curtis Joseph among others While the Blues contended during this time period they never passed the second round of the playoffs Nonetheless their on ice success was enough for a consortium of companies to buy the team They also provided the capital to build the Kiel Center now the Enterprise Center which opened in br Hull nicknamed the Golden Brett a reference to his father NHL legend Bobby Hull who was nicknamed the Golden Jet became one of the League s top stars and a scoring sensation netting goals in en route to earning the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league s most valuable player Hull s goals set the record for most goals in a single season by a right winger and the third most overall at the time Only Wayne Gretzky found the net more than Hull during any given three year period Despite posting the second best regular season record in the entire league in the Blues were upset in the second round of the playoffs to the Minnesota North Stars a defeat that was symbolic of St Louis playoff struggles br Mike Keenan was hired as both general manager and coach before the abbreviated season with the hope that he could end the postseason turmoil that Blues fans had endured for years Keenan instituted major changes including trades that sent away fan favorites Brendan Shanahan and Curtis Joseph as well as the acquisition of the legendary but aging Wayne Gretzky and goaltender Grant Fuhr both from the declining Los Angeles Kings During the season he publicly criticized Gretzky who entered free agency after the season declined an offer from the Blues and took a less lucrative contract with the New York Rangers Ultimately Keenan s playoff resume with St Louis included a first round exit in and a second round exit in and he was fired on December Caron was reinstated as interim general manager for the rest of the season and general manager Larry Pleau was hired on June Hull who had a lengthy feud with Keenan left for the Dallas Stars in He went on to win the Stanley Cup with the Stars the next year scoring a controversial goal on the Buffalo Sabres Dominik Hasek to clinch the Cup for Dallas The Blues ended the s as the only NHL team to make the playoffs for the entire decade although a Stanley Cup title still eluded the franchise br br br End of the playoff streak lockout and rebuild br Defenseman Chris Pronger acquired from the Hartford Whalers in for Brendan Shanahan Keith Tkachuk Pavol Demitra Pierre Turgeon Al MacInnis and goaltender Roman Turek kept the Blues a contender in the NHL In the team notched a franchise record points during the regular season earning the Presidents Trophy for the League s best record However they were stunned by the San Jose Sharks in the first round of the playoffs in seven games In the Blues advanced to the Western Conference Finals before bowing out in five games to the eventual champions the Colorado Avalanche Nonetheless the team remained competitive for the next three years despite never advancing beyond the second round Despite years of mediocrity and the stigma of never being able to take the next step the Blues were a playoff presence every year from to the third longest streak in North American professional sports history all three of which being held by NHL teams However they never made an appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals In fact they made it to the conference finals only two times in their streak and br Amid several questionable personnel moves and an unstable ownership situation the Blues finished the season with their worst record in years They missed the playoffs for only the fourth time in franchise history Moreover for the first time in club history the normally excellent support seen by St Louisans began to decrease with crowds normally numbering around notably less than the team s normal high about in a seat arena Wal Mart heir Nancy Walton Laurie and her husband Bill purchased the Blues in On June the Lauries announced that they would sell the team Bill Laurie a former point guard at Memphis State University had long desired to buy and move a National Basketball Association NBA team to St Louis coming close to achieving this in with an unsuccessful attempt to purchase the then Vancouver Grizzlies and it was thought that this desire caused him to neglect the Blues On September it was announced that the Lauries had signed an agreement to sell the Blues to SCP Worldwide a consulting and investment group headed by former Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts On November the Blues announced that SCP Worldwide had officially withdrawn from negotiations to buy the team On December it was announced that the Blues had signed a letter of intent to exclusively negotiate with General Sports and Entertainment LLC However after the period of exclusivity SCP entered the picture again On March the Lauries completed the sale of the Blues and the lease to the Savvis Center to SCP and TowerBrook Capital Partners L P a private equity firm The Blues are currently the only team in the four major North American sports ice hockey basketball baseball and American football to be owned by a private equity firm br br Following the disappointing season which saw the Blues with the worst record in the NHL the new management focused on rebuilding the franchise Under new management the Blues promptly installed John Davidson as president of hockey operations moving Pleau to a mostly advisory role The former New York Rangers goaltender promptly made multiple blockbuster deals picking up Jay McKee Bill Guerin and Manny Legace from free agency and bringing Doug Weight back to St Louis after a brief and productive stopover in Carolina Weight was again traded in December to the Anaheim Ducks along with a minor league player in exchange for Andy McDonald At the beginning of the season the Blues looked to be competitive in the Central Division However injuries plagued the team all season and the lack of a bona fide scorer hampered them as well Fan support was sluggish during the first half of the campaign and the end of the calendar year was capped by an game losing streak On December the Blues fired head coach Mike Kitchen and replaced him with former Los Angeles Kings head coach Andy Murray Davidson also installed a strong development program under head scout Jarmo Kekalainen using the team s raft of high draft picks in and to select highly touted prospects such as T J Oshie Erik Johnson and David Perron On January the Blues had a record of in their previous ten games which was the best in the NHL during that stretch Despite a healthy point jump from the previous season the strain of playing in a conference where seven teams finished with more than points kept them out of the playoffs for the second year in a row br Just before the NHL trade deadline the Blues traded several key players including Bill Guerin Keith Tkachuk and Dennis Wideman in exchange for draft picks though they re signed Tkachuk after the season ended Brad Boyes picked up from the Boston Bruins in exchange for

announced that after going much of the season without a captain defenseman Eric Brewer was chosen as the team s th captain The team later traded veteran defenseman Bryce Salvador to the New Jersey Devils for enforcer and St Louis native Cam Janssen He made his debut two days later wearing number against the Phoenix Coyotes br After spending the first half of the season at or near the bottom of the Western Conference standings the Blues began to turn things around behind the solid goaltending of Chris Mason After a strong second half run the Blues made the playoffs on April after defeating the Columbus Blue Jackets On April the Blues clinched the sixth seed in the West with a win against the Colorado Avalanche For the first time in five years that is since the lockout the Blues were in the playoffs They faced the third seeded Vancouver Canucks in the first round but despite the team s tremendous run to end the season the Blues would ultimately lose the series in a quick four game sweep br The Blues fired head coach Andy Murray on January after a disappointing record points sitting in th place in the Conference Especially galling were the frequent blown leads after two periods

new alternate white jersey The jersey brought back the contrasting shoulder yoke and returned to the lighter blue of previous eras It also replaced red with navy blue as an accent color A corresponding blue jersey was introduced the following season thus retiring the previous set br Like all NHL teams the Blues updated their jerseys for the season with new Rbk Edge jerseys The Blues simplified their design with only the blue note logo on the front there were no third jerseys for the season The Blues announced plans for a navy third jersey featuring a new logo with the Gateway

Anaheim Ducks on November br For the season the Blues made a few tweaks to their jerseys While they kept the Reebok Edge era template they brought back the look The navy blue third jersey was kept without any alterations before it was retired prior the season br When Adidas became the uniform provider before the season the Blues kept most of the same template with the exception of the home

Blues aired their games on KPLR TV and KMOX radio with team patron Gus Kyle calling games alongside St Louis broadcasting legend Jack Buck Buck elected to leave the booth after one season though and was replaced by another famed announcer in Dan Kelly This setup Kelly as commentator with either Kyle Bob Plager or Noel Picard whose heavy French Canadian accent became famous such as pronouncing owner Sid Salomon III Sid the Turd instead of Third joining as an analyst simulcast on KMOX and KPLR continued through the season then simulcast on KMOX and KDNL TV for the next three seasons KMOX is a watt clear channel station that reaches almost all of North America at night allowing Kelly to become a celebrity in both the United States and Canada Indeed many of the Blues players liked the fact that their families could hear the games on KMOX br From to the radio and television broadcasts were separated for the first time since the inaugural season with Kelly doing the radio broadcasts and Eli Gold hired to do the television Following the season the television broadcasts moved from KDNL to NBC affiliate KSD TV for the season produced by Sports Network Incorporated SNI owned and operated by Greg Maracek who did the broadcasts with Channel sportscaster Ron Jacober The broadcasts failed to produce a profit and then returned to KPLR for the NHL playoffs and the season before returning to KDNL currently St Louis ABC affiliate for the season the first under the ownership of Harry Ornest The Blues skated back to KPLR years later br In Ornest wanting more broadcast revenue put the radio rights up for bid A new company who had purchased KXOK won the bid for a three year contract and Kelly moved over from KMOX to do the games on KXOK However the station was never financially competitive in the market Additionally fans complained they could not hear the station at night it had to readjust its coverage due to a glut of clear channels on adjacent frequencies KXOK backed out of the contract after just years and the Blues immediately went back to KMOX who held the rights until Dan Kelly continued to broadcast the games on radio but he was diagnosed with lung cancer in October and died on February After his death Ron Jacober who had left Channel to be KXOK s sports director in then left for KMOX in finished the season as the radio play by play announcer before John Kelly took that position Furthermore Ken Wilson became St Louis Blues lead television play by play announcer alongside former Blues players Joe Micheletti Bruce Affleck and Bernie Federko During this time from to more games began to be aired on Prime Sports Midwest the forerunner to today s Bally Sports Midwest br The long term partnership between KMOX and the Blues had its problems however namely
