The Hartford Whalers were a professional ice hockey team based for most of its year existence in Hartford Connecticut The club played in the World Hockey Association WHA from until and in the National Hockey League NHL from to br Originally based in Boston they were charter members of the WHA known as the New England Whalers for all seven seasons After their second season the team moved one hundred miles km southwest to Hartford in April five years later the Whalers joined the NHL in the NHL WHA merger and were renamed the Hartford Whalers br After years in New England the franchise relocated to North Carolina in and became the Carolina Hurricanes br br br WHA history br br br Early seasons in Boston br The Whalers franchise was created in November when the World Hockey Association WHA awarded a franchise to New England businessmen Howard Baldwin W Godfrey Wood John Coburn and William Edward Barnes to begin play in Boston The team began auspiciously signing former Detroit Red Wings star Tom Webster hard rock Boston Bruins defenseman Ted Green the team s inaugural captain Toronto Maple Leafs defensemen Rick Ley Jim Dorey and Brad Selwood and former Pittsburgh Penguins goaltender Al Smith br New England signed an unusually large number of American players including Massachusetts natives and former U S Olympic hockey team members Larry Pleau who had been a regular with the Montreal Canadiens the previous season Kevin Ahearn John Cunniff and Paul Hurley Two other ex U S Olympians on the Whalers roster Minnesotans Timothy Sheehy and Tommy Williams had spent a significant part of their careers in Boston with Boston College and the Bruins respectively br The Whalers had the WHA s best regular season record in the season Webster led the team in scoring and through the playoffs Behind legendary ex Boston University head coach Jack Kelley the team defeated the Winnipeg Jets to win the inaugural WHA championship br The club played its first season s home games at Boston Garden and Boston Arena However the Arena was too small and antiquated to sustain a WHA team while the Garden was owned by the rival NHL Bruins in which the Whalers found themselves fourth in priority for dates behind the Bruins Boston Celtics and even the American Hockey League s Boston Braves Fed up with the situation Baldwin decided to move elsewhere In late February he announced the Whalers upcoming relocation to Hartford targeted for early April br br br Relocation to Hartford br Hartford was about to open a new modern downtown arena and convention center the Hartford Civic Center The city had hoped to get an American Basketball Association ABA team as the main tenant but when that fell through city leaders got in touch with the Whalers Aside from various minor league teams in New Haven the area had been largely bereft of professional hockey until the Whalers arrival The Civic Center was still being finished when the season began so the Whalers played the first part of the season at The Big E Coliseum in West Springfield Massachusetts about thirty miles km north br On January the team played its first game at the Hartford Civic Center in front of a sellout crowd The franchise remained in Hartford until it relocated to North Carolina for the season save for a temporary relocation to the nearby Springfield Civic Center in the late s while their Hartford arena was being rebuilt after heavy snow followed by heavy rain caused the roof which suffered from several engineering and construction shortcomings to collapse br Though they never again won the WHA championship the New England Whalers were a successful team never missing the playoffs in league history and finishing first in their division three times They had a more stable roster than most WHA teams Ley Webster Selwood Pleau and Tommy Earl played over games each with the club The team scored a major coup when it signed legend Gordie Howe and his sons Mark and Marty from the Houston Aeros in br The Whalers recorded losing records in their first two full seasons in Hartford their final two WHA seasons saw more success They went to the finals again in with a veteran team spearheaded by the Howes year old Gordie led the team in scoring future NHL stars Gordie Roberts and Mike Rogers All Star defenseman Ron Plumb and forwards John McKenzie Dave Keon and Mike Antonovich and possessed the league s best defense The next season was not so fine however but while age finally caught up with Gordie Howe the slack was picked up by Andre Lacroix the WHA s all time leading scorer acquired from the Aeros br br br Admission to the NHL br br As the Whalers were one of the most stable WHA teams the club was one of the four franchises admitted to the NHL when the rival leagues merged in Unlike the other former WHA teams the Whalers were not stripped of most of their players The Howes Rogers Ley Keon Smith Roberts and Lacroix are the New England Whalers players who stayed on the team as it made the transition to the NHL and became the Hartford Whalers In the case of the Howes Detroit intentionally turned down their option to re sign longtime Red Wing Gordie out of respect for his legacy already in place there Only Selwood George Lyle and Warren Miller were reclaimed by their former NHL teams The Whalers were the only American based WHA team to join the NHL br The New England Whalers renamed themselves the Hartford Whalers in May at the insistence of the Boston Bruins who objected to the team naming themselves for New England Connecticut based graphic designer Peter Good was hired by the Jack Lardis Associates advertising agency to design a new logo for the team Good put a whale s tail over a W allowing the negative space between the two shapes to create an H Good also helped design the team s new uniforms for the season in the team s new colors of green and blue br br br NHL history br The Whalers were never as successful in the NHL as they had been in the WHA They recorded only three winning seasons in their years in the NHL made the Stanley Cup playoffs eight times and won only one playoff series earning the nickname The Forever s in mocking jest of their winning percentage Whenever they did make the playoffs they faced the near certainty of having to get past the Boston Bruins or Montreal Canadiens to make it to the Conference Finals The team developed a heated rivalry with the Bruins because they were based only miles northeast of Hartford and the fact they used to play in the same arena Home games against the Bruins usually attracted the Whalers largest crowds as many Bruins fans followed their team to Hartford The Whalers had an all time head to head record of against Boston br The Whalers were hampered by numerous off ice factors Hartford was the smallest American market in the NHL and was located on the traditional dividing line between the home territories for Boston and New York area teams This limited the team s marketability Additionally for most of the Whalers tenure as an NHL team the Hartford Civic Center was one of the smallest arenas in the league At its maximum it seated just for hockey The team averaged over fans only twice in its years at the Civic Center They averaged only from to Most of their sellouts came when either the Bruins the New York Islanders or the New York Rangers played in Hartford bringing thousands of their own fans with them br br br Inaugural NHL season br Upon joining the NHL the Whalers were placed in the Norris Division of the Wales Conference Their first NHL season in looked somewhat promising They were led by Mike Rogers Blaine Stoughton Dave Keon Mark Howe Rick Ley NHL legend Gordie Howe and the all time WHA leading scorer Andre Lacroix along with the franchise s first starting goaltender Al Smith The Whalers also acquired another NHL legend Bobby Hull near the NHL trade deadline in They finished the season with points and a playoff berth and had the best record of the four former WHA franchises that entered the NHL in The Whalers remained the most recent first year expansion franchise to make the playoffs in their inaugural season along with the Edmonton Oilers until the Vegas Golden Knights accomplished the feat In the first round of the playoffs the Whalers were swept by the Montreal Canadiens three games to none Following this season Gordie Howe Bobby Hull and Andre Lacroix all announced their retirements from professional hockey br br br The early s br Following the season the Whalers had many aging veterans left over from their WHA days To make matters worse the Whalers reputation of making disastrous trades began to unfold as the team began to trade away stars for mediocre players in an attempt to gain depth For instance they traded star defenseman Mark Howe and their first NHL scoring leader Mike Rogers in separate deals for players and draft picks which never panned out and also swapped defensive defenseman Gordie Roberts who would go on to play remaining professional seasons for the remaining half of the season of Mike Fidler s NHL career For the season the NHL realigned its divisions and the Whalers were resituated in the Adams Division of the Wales Conference The Whalers bottomed out in the season with a record of points ranked th out of teams in the NHL standings On May the Whalers hired Emile Francis as their new general manager to rebuild the team About two months later on July Francis hired Jack Evans to be the Whalers new head coach By the end of the season Francis had cut or traded away every player from the Whalers roster save for Ron Francis Paul MacDermid and Paul Lawless br br br Success in the mid s br The team had a brief period of success in the and seasons The Whalers began looking like a playoff contender By the end of January they had a record of for points after games At this time however the Whalers began to struggle when they lost their franchise player Ron Francis and star goal scorer Kevin Dineen to injuries As a result the Whalers struggled through February winning just two games in the month and in danger of missing the playoffs for the sixth year in a row In March Francis and Dineen returned from their injuries and the Whalers put up a record of in the months of March and April The Whalers finished fourth in the Adams Division in the regular season earning themselves a playoff berth for the first time since The Whalers went on to eliminate the first place Quebec Nordiques in a three game sweep in the first round winning their first and only NHL playoff series in Hartford The Whalers then pushed the division finals to seven games losing the final game in overtime to the eventual Stanley Cup champions the Montreal Canadiens The Canadiens disposed of both the Rangers and Calgary Flames in five games in the Conference Finals and Stanley Cup Finals respectively br The following season the Whalers won their lone division championship led by centers Ron Francis and Ray Ferraro emerging winger Kevin Dineen defenseman Ulf Samuelsson superstar goaltender Mike Liut and scorer Sylvain Turgeon The points earned that season were the most they would earn as an NHL team in Hartford however they were quickly eliminated in the first round by the Nordiques The Whalers started the series strongly winning the first two games at home but beginning in Game the Nordiques were able to successfully take the Whalers off their game by playing a tough chippy style of hockey As a result both teams broke NHL records in penalty minutes for an individual playoff game and a whole playoff series The Nordiques won the next four games and thus the series four games to two While Hartford would make the playoffs for the next five seasons in a row they never came close to duplicating their previous success with one exception in the season br br br The season br In the Whalers finished seventh overall in the NHL standings and fourth overall in the Wales Conference with points This was the franchise s second highest point total in the NHL while located in Hartford The regular season was highlighted by captain Ron Francis putting up career highs in goals assists and points Later in his career Francis was only able to exceed points once in and never again exceeded goals in a single season At the trade deadline the Whalers first year general manager Eddie Johnston made the first in a series of destructive trades by sending franchise goaltender Mike Liut to the Washington Capitals in exchange for center Yvon Corriveau Liut was having a career year during the season and this trade left the Whalers with sophomore goaltender Peter Sidorkiewicz as their starter with rookie Kay Whitmore as the backup br The Whalers went on to face the Boston Bruins in the first round of the playoffs In Game the Whalers were in front of their home crowd with a two games to one series lead and a lead in the game entering the third period Bruins starting goaltender Reggie Lemelin was struggling throughout the series and was replaced by backup Andy Moog in the third period At the same time Peter Sidorkiewicz began struggling in goal for the Whalers and the Bruins scored four unanswered goals in the third period winning the game Sidorkiewicz struggled for the rest of the series and Moog was spectacular for the Bruins Without Liut the Whalers had to either stick with Sidorkiewicz which they did or use the unproven rookie Kay Whitmore in goal Goaltending turned out to be one of the big differences in this series and the Bruins won it in seven games The Bruins went on to dispose of the Canadiens in five games then sweep the Capitals in the Wales Conference Finals before losing in the Stanley Cup finals to the Edmonton Oilers br br br The Ron Francis trade br On March Francis was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins along with Ulf Samuelsson and Grant Jennings in exchange for John Cullen Zarley Zalapski and Jeff Parker Francis was one of the most popular players on the team and held nearly every significant offensive record in the franchise s history both in the WHA and NHL The trade was savagely condemned by Whalers fans few of whom believed The Hockey News assessment that the Whalers had actually come out on the better end of the trade Parker would only play four games in Hartford before suffering a concussion and a knee injury within two weeks of each other effectively ending his NHL career The Francis trade was made all the more painful when Francis and Samuelsson promptly helped lead the Penguins to two consecutive Stanley Cup titles Coincidentally Eddie Johnston the Hartford general manager who had orchestrated the Francis trade would follow him to Pittsburgh as the Penguins head coach two years later br The trades that Johnston made particularly the Ron Francis trade proved to be disastrous for the Whalers since the players acquired did not meet the team s expectations leaving the Whalers depleted of talent and costing them substantial goodwill in Hartford The links below show all of the trades and transactions Ed Johnston made as the general manager of the Whalers br br br The playoffs br The Whalers went to the playoffs for the final time in behind Jimmy Roberts coaching despite winning only games In those days however the top four teams in each division made the playoffs regardless of record They faced the heavily favored Montreal Canadiens in the Adams Division Semi finals The Whalers lost Game by a score of and Game by a score of creating the expectation that the Canadiens would sweep the Whalers out of the first round as they did in the playoffs However the Whalers came back home to win Games and by scores of and respectively The main turning point in the series came in the second period of Game the Whalers had a lead midway through the second period where the Canadiens began rushing the crease and getting in the face of Whalers goaltender Frank Pietrangelo to distract him The strategy worked as the Canadiens scored four unanswered goals in the final five minutes of the second period These goals were not called back since this was before the time when the NHL began strictly enforcing crease infractions on goals The Whalers lost Game by a score of The Whalers came back to win Game by a score of just seconds into overtime on a goal by Yvon Corriveau The series went back to Montreal for game and the Whalers lost a dramatic double overtime game by a score of as Russ Courtnall scored on a turn around shot against Pietrangelo Corriveau had an excellent chance for a second consecutive overtime winner in the first overtime period on a breakaway but his shot missed the net It was the last time the Whalers would qualify for the playoffs for the rest of their time in Hartford br Roberts was fired thereafter along with general manager Eddie Johnston At the end of the three year Johnston era only seven players remained from the Whalers active roster prior to Johnston taking over as general manager Those players were forwards Ed Kastelic and Terry Yake defensemen Randy Ladouceur Brad Shaw and Adam Burt and goaltenders Peter Sidorkiewicz and Kay Whitmore During the summer of following Johnston s departure Shaw and Whitmore were traded away Kastelic left via free agency and Sidorkiewicz was lost to the Ottawa Senators in the expansion draft br br br The Brian Burke and Paul Holmgren years br In the summer of the Whalers hired Brian Burke to replace Eddie Johnston as general manager to rebuild the Whalers Burke had worked for the Vancouver Canucks helping them build the team that eventually went to the Stanley Cup Finals in Burke hired Paul Holmgren to be the Whalers new head coach Holmgren had been the head coach of the Philadelphia Flyers Holmgren immediately named Pat Verbeek the new captain and he ended up playing on a line with young stars Andrew Cassels and Geoff Sanderson The Whalers also acquired goaltender Sean Burke in exchange for former first round draft pick Bobby Holik Cassels Sanderson and Sean Burke remained star players for the Whalers through their final season in Hartford In addition future NHL star Michael Nylander began his NHL career with the Whalers during the season Since the season was a rebuilding year for the Whalers they finished the season with only points the second worst point total in franchise history and missed the playoffs for the first time since br The Whalers entered the season as members of the Northeast Division of the Eastern Conference and with high hopes from a core of young talented players The Whalers were also able to draft defenseman Chris Pronger who began his career with the Whalers playing alongside veteran defenseman Brad McCrimmon and later became an NHL star However problems began at the management level when general manager Brian Burke announced he would resign when the season began to take an executive position with the NHL In addition Burke had some disagreements with Whalers owner Richard Gordon After Burke left Holmgren took over as both the head coach and general manager The Whalers started off the season poorly Holmgren felt he was unable to handle the job of general manager and head coach so he made Pierre McGuire the new head coach The coaching change did not help the Whalers however since McGuire was not popular with the players the Whalers continued to struggle The Whalers reached a low point in the season when six players and two assistant coaches were arrested in Buffalo New York after being involved in a bar room brawl Pronger was one of the players arrested he was years of age at the time two years below than the legal drinking age in the State of New York Around this same time Paul Holmgren checked himself into rehab for alcohol addiction after being arrested with a DUI in Simsbury The Whalers finished the season with points only a five point improvement from the previous season One bright spot for the Whalers was the emergence of Sean Burke as their franchise and star goaltender Another highlight of the season was when Brian Propp scored his th career NHL point with the Whalers Propp announced his retirement after the season br br br New ownership br In the summer of the Whalers were purchased in a deal brokered by the Connecticut Development Authority by Compuware CEO Peter Karmanos along with partners Thomas Thewes and Jim Rutherford Rutherford became the team s new general manager and Holmgren returned as the head coach The new ownership wanted to turn the team into a winner for the lockout shortened season so Rutherford went out to the free agent market and signed Jimmy Carson and Steven Rice On draft day the Whalers selected the highly rated Jeff O Neill in the first round Rutherford also acquired defenseman Glen Wesley from the Boston Bruins in exchange for three first round draft picks Kyle McLaren Johnathan Aitken and Sergei Samsonov Despite these acquisitions the Whalers struggled at the beginning of the season starting off with a record of In mid February the Whalers began improving led by their top line of Sanderson Cassels and Verbeek along with franchise goaltender Sean Burke For the next games the Whalers put up a record of and it appeared as if the Whalers were on their way to their first playoff berth since Unfortunately the Whalers played poorly down the stretch winning only one game in the last seven and missed the playoffs by four points br Before the beginning of the season the Whalers management became frustrated with the slow development of highly rated prospect Chris Pronger As a result Pronger was sent to the St Louis Blues in exchange for Brendan Shanahan Shanahan was not happy with the trade even before playing a single game in Hartford However he was immediately made the team s new captain The Whalers won their first four games of the season but then struggled for the rest of the calendar year of As a result Paul Maurice replaced Holmgren as head coach in November On December the Whalers received a morale boost when they reacquired one of their most popular players from the s Kevin Dineen His skills and leadership had an immediate impact on the team as the Whalers began playing significantly better in January Despite the strong finish in the second half of the season the Whalers were unable to recover from their poor start and they missed the playoffs for the fourth year in a row br Before the beginning of the season Brendan Shanahan ended his silence about his displeasure about playing in Hartford He demanded a trade out of Hartford because he claimed he did not want to play in a small market for a team with an uncertain future about its location Whalers fans and local media condemned Shanahan for his comments and he was immediately stripped of his captaincy Kevin Dineen took over the role After the second game of the season Shanahan was traded along with Brian Glynn to the Detroit Red Wings for Keith Primeau Paul Coffey and a first round draft pick Despite these problems the Whalers got off to a very good start with a record after the first games sitting in first in their division They were led by a strong first line of Sanderson Cassels and Dineen along with a solid second line of Primeau O Neill and Sami Kapanen During the calendar year of the Whalers achieved a record of in games In following the good start the Whalers season began to slip away This included a nine game losing streak in January and a six game losing streak in March Despite the poor performance down the stretch the Whalers still had an opportunity to make the playoffs in the final week of the season However the Whalers lost two games on the road to Ottawa and the New York Islanders which eliminated them from the playoffs before their final regular season game against the Tampa Bay Lightning br br br Departure from Hartford br Owner Peter Karmanos pledged to keep the Whalers in the city of Hartford for four years when he purchased the team in However two years later frustrated with lackluster attendance and little corporate support he announced that if the Whalers were unable to sell at least season tickets for the season he would likely move the team Furthermore ownership only made season tickets available in full season game packages eliminating the popular six and game mini plans in a strategy largely designed to spur purchases from corporations and wealthier individuals Sales were underwhelming at the beginning of the campaign and at the end of the season it was still unknown whether the Whalers would stay in Connecticut past or move elsewhere However thanks to an aggressive civic campaign and the efforts of many fans the Whalers announced that they would stay in Connecticut through at least one year shy of his original promise The Save the Whale campaign netted season ticket sales totaling in less than a day span despite the Whalers raising ticket prices by an average of percent eliminating partial ticket plans and increasing the deposit amount for season tickets by percent This represented an expansion of over tickets from the existing base br In early Connecticut Governor John G Rowland stated that he did not want to spend Connecticut taxpayer dollars to fund a new arena in Hartford Despite this negotiations between the Whalers and Rowland to build a new million arena seemed to be going well Talks fell apart when Karmanos wanted an additional million to cover losses during the three years the new arena was to be built The Whalers ultimately announced that they would be leaving Hartford after the season This marks one of the few times that a team announced it would leave its current city without having already announced an agreement with a new one Karmanos had discussed relocating the Whalers to Norfolk Virginia which would have been the first major sports team for that market as the Hampton Roads Rhinos but the failure of a season ticket drive in Norfolk coupled with a lack of an adequate arena led to those plans being canceled Karmanos stated that Rowland had no intention of making a serious offer to keep the Whalers in Connecticut since Rowland harbored hopes to bring a National Football League NFL franchise to the State Rowland went on to negotiate a tentative deal that would bring the New England Patriots to Connecticut but those talks also fell apart after the state and Patriots ownership failed to reach an agreement on a new stadium instead choosing to stay in Foxborough to build what would become Gillette Stadium br On April the Whalers played their last game in Hartford defeating the Tampa Bay Lightning Team captain Kevin Dineen who had returned to Hartford midway through the season after being acquired in a trade with the Philadelphia Flyers scored the final goal in Whalers history On May Karmanos announced the team would move to Raleigh North Carolina to become the Carolina Hurricanes playing its first two seasons in North Carolina at the Greensboro Coliseum while awaiting arena construction in Raleigh a year earlier than planned Talks with Nashville Columbus and even Suburban Detroit were discussed before bringing the Whalers to North Carolina br br br Post departure br The following summer in the Binghamton Rangers the American Hockey League AHL affiliate of the New York Rangers relocated to the Hartford market to take the place of the Whalers renaming themselves the Hartford Wolf Pack Former Whalers owner Howard Baldwin acquired the right to manage the team in and announced that the Wolf Pack were changing their name to the Connecticut Whale in the middle of the season adopting the Whalers old green blue white palette The team changed back to the Hartford Wolf Pack after the Rangers terminated the relationship following the season br Glen Wesley was the last Whaler still active with the Hartford Carolina franchise upon his retirement on June though his stint was not continuous playing seven games for the Toronto Maple Leafs in after a deadline deal before re signing in Carolina in the off season Craig Adams was the last player drafted in Whalers history However Adams did not become a member of the team until after the team had already moved to North Carolina and he retired in br Goaltender Jean Sebastien Giguere was the final former Hartford Whalers player still playing in the NHL he retired after the end of the season Robert Petrovicky was the last former Whaler active in professional hockey playing in European leagues through the end of the season br br br Uniforms br br br New England br As the New England Whalers the team generally wore dark green and white uniforms with a similar style to the iconic Detroit Red Wings uniforms The uniforms feature the team roundel in front and the Pucky logo on either shoulder In the white uniform added yellow trim and replaced the roundel logo with the harpoon W logo and the following year the green uniform adopted the same elements In the striping on the waist and socks was modified br br br Green uniform era br After becoming the Hartford Whalers the team adopted its most iconic uniform design green and white uniforms with blue white and green stripes and the new Peter Good designed logo in front The design underwent a few cosmetic changes such as wearing Cooperalls in the season switching from angular to straight sleeve stripes and back during the early s and removing the Pucky logo in br br br Blue and silver uniform era br For the Whalers final years in Hartford the team switched their primary colors to dark blue and added silver accents to the logo and striping The numbers received extra contrasting trim br br br Hurricanes Whalers tribute br In the Hurricanes announced they would wear green Hartford Whalers throwback uniforms during two games against the Boston Bruins first on December at home and again on March in Boston The announcement was generally viewed as positive recognition of the roots of the Hurricane franchise although not all former Whalers fans approved of the use The Hurricanes again wore the Whalers uniforms for a home game against the Los Angeles Kings on January Its fourth appearance came on January against the New Jersey Devils The most recent appearance came on March in a shootout loss to the Bruins br Adidas Reverse Retro program in saw the Hurricanes wear silver versions of the classic Whalers uniform bridging both Whalers eras in the design br In the season the Hurricanes wore a white version of the Whalers uniform against the Devils and donned Cooperalls in pregame warmups br br br Brass Bonanza theme song br Unlike most sports teams at any level the Whalers had an official theme song The song was entitled Brass Bonanza and was a tune composed and arranged by Jacques Ysaye under the pseudonym of Jack Say originally called Evening Beat The song was a big hit with the team Whalers fans and even fans of other NHL teams and was played at home games when the Whalers entered the rink for warmups and also after they scored a goal It was introduced in the mid s on the B side of a souvenir record of team radio broadcast highlights while they were still named the New England Whalers and playing in the WHA However in then general manager Brian Burke cancelled the use of the song because he said there were players who were embarrassed by it and replaced it with a goal horn and the song Hot Hot Hot by Buster Poindexter then a year later Rock and Roll Part by Gary Glitter While the goal horn is still used by the Hurricanes today Brass Bonanza was quickly reintroduced after Burke left the team the following year br The song is still very popular with Hartford crowds and continues to occasionally be played at XL Center events including at Hartford Wolf Pack Connecticut Whale games from to and at the University of Connecticut s basketball and men s ice hockey games The song plays whenever a player on the city s minor league baseball team the Hartford Yard Goats hits a home run It was also previously used by the Whalers AHL affiliate the Binghamton Whalers the Danbury Whalers of the Federal Hockey League FHL and Quinnipiac University s men s and women s ice hockey teams It has also been played at Fenway Park in Boston during Boston Red Sox games in between innings for several years Rock bands have been known to play the song during shows in Connecticut most notably The Zambonis The song was played when the Carolina Hurricanes scored a goal on an event called heritage night where the Hurricanes dressed in Whalers attire The Florida Everblades a former affiliate of the Hurricanes in the ECHL play the song after every home game at Hertz Arena The song has now been adopted by the city s soccer team Hartford Athletic and by the Premier Hockey Federation s Connecticut Whale being played after goals scored by the teams The Victoria Royals of the WHL
