attached to a wall stone or other vertical surface and bearing text or an image in relief or both to commemorate one or more persons an event a former use of the place or some other thing Many modern plaques and markers are used to associate the location where the plaque or marker is installed with the person event or item commemorated as a place worthy of visit A monumental plaque or tablet commemorating a deceased person or persons can be a simple form of church monument Most modern plaques affixed in this way are commemorative of something but this is not always the case and there are purely religious plaques or those signifying ownership or affiliation of some sort A plaquette is a small plaque but in English unlike many European languages the term is not typically used for outdoor plaques fixed to walls br br br Historical br br br Benin Kingdom br br The Benin Empire which flourished in present day Nigeria between the thirteenth and nineteenth centuries had an exceedingly rich sculptural tradition One of the kingdom s chief sites of cultural production was the elaborate ceremonial court of the Oba divine king at the palace in Benin Among the wide range of artistic forms produced at the court were rectangular brass or bronze plaques At least a portion of these plaques which were mainly created from the thirteenth through sixteenth centuries commemorate significant persons and events associated with the Oba s court including important battles during Benin s sixteenth century expansionary period br br br Medieval Europe br br Brass or bronze memorial plaques were produced throughout medieval Europe from at least the early thirteenth through the sixteenth centuries as a form of sepulchral memorial generally inset into the walls of churches or surfaces of tombs Surviving in great numbers they were manufactured from sheet brass or latten very occasionally coloured with enamels and tend to depict highly conventional figures with brief inscriptions br br br Modern br br Historical markers are put on display by the owners of sites listed by national agencies concerned with historic preservation such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation and the National Register of Historic Places in the United States the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty in the United Kingdom An Taisce in Ireland National Historical Commission of the Philippines in the Philippines and the National Trusts of other countries br Other historical markers are created by local municipalities non profit organizations companies or individuals In addition to geographically defined regions individual organizations such as E Clampus Vitus or the American Society of Mechanical Engineers can choose to maintain a national set of historical markers that fit a certain theme br The Royal Society of Arts established the first scheme in the world for historical commemoration on plaques in br The scheme was established under the influence of the British politician William Ewart and the civil servant Henry Cole The first plaque was unveiled in to commemorate Lord Byron at his birthplace Holles Street Cavendish Square The earliest historical marker to survive commemorates Napoleon III in King Street St James s and was also put up in br The original plaque colour was blue but this was changed by the

in Manila The initial markers were placed in br Markers have their texts primarily in Filipino while there are also markers in the English language especially for markers that were installed during the American colonial era Markers in regional languages such as Cebuano Ilocano and Kapampangan are also available and issued by the NHCP Markers are found all over the country and there have been markers installed outside the country The plaques themselves are permanent signs installed in publicly visible locations on buildings monuments or in special locations There are more than markers to date Most markers are located within Luzon especially in Metro Manila with more than which has prompted the NHCP to install more markers in Visayas and Mindanao for their greater inclusion in the national historical narrative br Issues and controversies have also been the concern of several individual markers from the commemoration of former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos to the reaction of the Japanese embassy to the comfort women statue and marker There have also been some markers replaced by new ones because of rectified information theft or loss due to war or disasters Many American era markers have been destroyed or were lost as casualties of World War II br Local municipalities and cities can also install markers of figures and events of local significance Though they may have the permission of the NHCP these markers are barred from using the seal of the Republic of the Philippines br From March to October quincentennial historical markers were unveiled by the

system in the UK An example is the blue plaque scheme run by English Heritage in London although these were originally erected in a variety of shapes and colors This has been running for over years and is thought to be the oldest system of its kind in the world Plaques are attached to buildings to commemorate their association with important occupants or events The National Trust which is a non profit charity organization unlike English Heritage and English Heritage properties has its own similar markers as well The Dead Comics Society installs blue plaques to commemorate the former residences of well known comedians including those of Sid James and John Le Mesurier br However not all historical markers in the United Kingdom are blue and many are not ceramic A range of other commemorative plaque schemes which are typically run by local councils and charitable bodies exists throughout the United Kingdom These tend to use their own criteria for determining the eligibility to put up a plaque There are commemorative plaque schemes in Bath Edinburgh Brighton Liverpool Loughton and elsewhere some of which differ from the familiar blue plaque A scheme in Manchester uses color coded plaques to commemorate figures with each of the colors corresponding to the person s occupation The Purple Plaques Placiau Porffor scheme in Wales uses purple to commemorate significant women In the London Borough of Southwark started a plaque scheme which included living people in the awards Even in London the Westminster City Council runs a green plaque scheme which is run alongside that of the blue plaque scheme administered by English Heritage Other schemes are run by civic societies district or town councils or local history groups and often operate with different criteria br br After the First World War the families of British and British Empire now Commonwealth service men and women killed during the conflict were presented with bronze Memorial Plaques The plaques of about millimetres in in diameter were designed by the eminent sculptor and medallist Edward Carter Preston br br br United States br In the United States various state governments have commemorative plaque schemes usually using the name historical markers The National Trust for Historic Preservation or the U S Government through the National Register of Historic Places can bestow historical status br State programmes such as the California Register of Historical Resources allow designated sites to place their own markers br The criteria and circumstances through which a party administers the distribution of historical markers varies For example the Preservation Worcester program in Worcester Massachusetts allows a person to register their house or other structure of least fifty years of age if the building is well preserved with retention of its original character and importance to the architectural cultural or historical nature of the local neighborhood One then pays a fee to to receive the historical marker itself br br In the same state the Boston neighborhood Charlestown has its own local association to administer historical markers Other historical markers in and around Boston are administered by agencies such as The Bostonian Society or are associated with sites such as those along the Freedom Trail the Black Heritage Trail and the Emerald Necklace br Other examples of mostly locally generated historical markers in the United States include the plaque outside the Alaska Governor s Mansion made by the Alaska Centennial Commission s historical markers program the historical markers of State Historic Marker Council in Florida the markers placed by various agencies in Georgia of which one source mentions different historical markers in Indiana where it is illegal to create a historical marker in the state format without first getting official approval from that state s historical bureau historical markers in Kansas erected by the Kansas Historical Society and the Kansas Department of Transportation the Roadside Historic Marker Program in Maryland administered by the Maryland Historical Trust the State Historic Marker Program
