The New York Islanders colloquially known as the Isles are a professional ice hockey team based in Elmont New York The Islanders compete in the National Hockey League NHL as a member of the Metropolitan Division in the Eastern Conference and play their home games at UBS Arena The Islanders are one of three NHL franchises in the New York metropolitan area along with the New Jersey Devils and New York Rangers and their fanbase resides primarily on Long Island br The team was founded in as part of the NHL s maneuvers to keep a team from rival league World Hockey Association WHA out of the newly built Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in suburban Uniondale New York After two years of building up the team s roster they found almost instant success by securing straight playoff berths starting with their third season The Islanders won four consecutive Stanley Cup championships between and the eighth of nine dynasties recognized by the NHL in its history Their consecutive playoff series wins between and is a feat that remains unparalleled in the history of professional sports They are the last team in any major professional North American sport to win four consecutive championships and to date the last NHL team to achieve a three peat br Following the team s dynasty era the franchise ran into problems with money ownership and management an aging arena and low attendance Their woes were reflected on the ice as the team has not won a division title since and went seasons without winning a playoff series prior to the playoffs After years of failed attempts to rebuild or replace Nassau Coliseum in suburban Long Island the Islanders relocated to Barclays Center in Brooklyn following the season In the and seasons the Islanders split their home games between Barclays Center and Nassau Coliseum The Islanders played all their home games in the season at Nassau Coliseum Their new arena near Belmont Park was opened in br Ten former members of the Islanders have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame seven of whom Mike Bossy Clark Gillies Denis Potvin Billy Smith Bryan Trottier coach Al Arbour and general manager Bill Torrey were members of all four Cup winning teams Post dynasty players Pat LaFontaine Roberto Luongo and Pierre Turgeon were also inducted br br br History br br br The NHL heads to Long Island br In fall the emerging World Hockey Association WHA planned to place its New York team the New York Raiders in Nassau County s brand new Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum County officials did not consider the WHA a major league and wanted to keep the Raiders out William Shea who had helped bring Major League Baseball s New York Mets to the area a decade earlier was enlisted to bring an NHL team to Long Island Although Shea had previously worked with upstart rival leagues including the aborted Continental League the American Football League and the American Basketball Association his ultimate goal in these efforts had always been to try to persuade the established leagues to grant second franchises to New York as had been the case with the Mets and also with the New York Jets and New York Nets as a result of those teams leagues merging with their established rivals br br In contrast Shea decided there was no need to work with the WHA since unlike the initial results of his previous approaches to established leagues in the other major sports Shea immediately found NHL president Clarence Campbell to be receptive to adding a second team in New York Nevertheless the Islanders bid faced opposition from the New York Rangers who did not want additional competition in the New York area Eventually Campbell and Shea persuaded the Rangers owners Madison Square Garden to reconsider Rangers president Bill Jennings weighed pros and cons Another local NHL team would be compelled to compensate the Rangers for sharing the New York area On the other hand a WHA team would owe the Rangers nothing unless it was included in a potential NHL WHA merger a prospect to which both Campbell and Jennings were adamantly opposed Finally consenting to the establishment of an NHL franchise in suburban Nassau County would help to ensure the vast majority of the Rangers fanbase within New York City proper would continue to support the older franchise and reduced the prospect of a rival league eventually establishing a team and fanbase there Perhaps remembering the crucial role the Jets had played in ensuring the success of the AFL just a few years earlier as a challenger of the National Football League Jennings decided to help bring a new NHL team to the New York metropolitan area br Despite expanding to teams just two years prior the NHL awarded a Long Island based franchise to clothing manufacturer Roy Boe owner of the American Basketball Association s New York Nets on November The terms included million million in dollars franchise fee plus a million million in dollars territorial fee to the Rangers An expansion franchise was also given to Atlanta the Flames to keep the schedule balanced and to prevent the WHA from entering the growing market at the newly built Omni Coliseum br The New York Islanders name was unveiled by the franchise on February at a press conference held across the street from Roosevelt Raceway at a restaurant owned by Burt Bacharach Many expected it to use the Long Island Ducks after the Eastern Hockey League team that played from to The team was soon nicknamed the Isles by the local newspapers The Islanders arrival effectively doomed the Raiders who played in Madison Square Garden under difficult lease terms and were forced to move to Cherry Hill New Jersey in the middle of their second season br Former California Golden Seals executive vice president Bill Torrey was named as the team s general manager at the same press conference as the franchise s name unveiling The Islanders secured veteran forward Ed Westfall defenseman Gerry Hart and goaltender Billy Smith in the Expansion Draft along with junior hockey stars Billy Harris Lorne Henning and Bobby Nystrom in the Amateur Draft Soon after the draft Phil Goyette was named as the team s first head coach however he was fired halfway through the season and replaced with Earl Ingarfield and assistant coach Aut Erickson Unlike most other expansion teams general managers Torrey made few trades for veteran players in the early years as he was committed to building the team through the draft Torrey stated I told the owners that we re not going to beat this team next door by taking the castoffs from others teams We d have to develop our own stars Before the season began Westfall was named the team s first captain br By September the Islanders were waiting for the Nassau Coliseum to be completed as well as their practice facility The Royal Ice Rink in Kings Park The team was forced to practice as late as October the day before their first game at the Rangers practice rink in New Hyde Park br The Islanders first win came on October in a game against the Los Angeles Kings In the team s first season young players such as Smith Nystrom and Henning all of whom would be part of the Islanders dynasty of the early s were given chances to prove themselves in the NHL The young and inexperienced expansion team however posted a record of setting an NHL record for most losses and worst overall record in a season A highlight occurred on January when they defeated the defending Stanley Cup champion Boston Bruins br Finishing last in the standings that season they received the right to select first in the draft Off the ice the Islanders struggled financially a situation that was exacerbated by the then unprecedented million in franchise and territorial fees Montreal Canadiens general manager Sam Pollock was keen to acquire the Islanders pick so he could draft French Canadian junior star defenseman Denis Potvin who had been touted as the next Bobby Orr when he was years old Pollock made several lucrative trade offers including cash to the Islanders but Torrey turned the Canadiens down and selected Potvin with the first overall pick During the off season Torrey convinced former St Louis Blues coach Al Arbour to come coach the Islanders Even with Arbour as the team s head coach and Potvin who won the Calder Memorial Trophy as NHL Rookie of the Year the team again finished last in the East Division that season but allowed fewer goals than the previous season br The season included their first win against the Rangers on October which also happened to be the game where Potvin scored his first NHL goal Although they failed to make the playoffs their points represented a point improvement from the previous season br br br Ascendancy and playoff inability br br With the th and nd picks in the draft the Islanders added young forwards Clark Gillies and Bryan Trottier to continue Torrey s building plan In the season the Islanders made one of the biggest turnarounds in NHL history Led by Potvin forwards Westfall Harris Nystrom Gillies and goaltenders Smith and Glenn Chico Resch the team earned points more than the previous season and two more than their first two seasons combined earning their first playoff berth They defeated the rival New York Rangers in a best of first round series as J P Parise scored just seconds into overtime of the third game In the next round down three games to none in a best of seven series against the Pittsburgh Penguins the Islanders rallied to win the next four and take the series winning Game on a late third period goal by Westfall Only four other major North American professional sports teams have accomplished this feat the Toronto Maple Leafs Boston Red Sox the Philadelphia Flyers and the Los Angeles Kings They were close but not as lucky in the following round rallying from another deficit to force a seventh game against the defending Stanley Cup champion Philadelphia Flyers before the Flyers took the decisive seventh game at home and went on to win the Cup again Despite a disappointing playoff finish Arbour remained complimentary of the team s attitude and maturity saying If I called a practice next week every one of them would show up br The Islanders continued their climb up the standings in earning points and the fifth best record in the league It was the first point season in Islanders history in only their fourth year of existence Rookie center Trottier finished the season with points and won the Calder Memorial Trophy his points and assists totals set a new league record for most in each category by a rookie It would be the first of four consecutive point seasons including the first two division titles in franchise history Despite the emergence of young star players and regular season success between and the Islanders suffered a series of playoff disappointments In and the Islanders were knocked out in the semi finals by the eventual Stanley Cup champions the Montreal Canadiens The Canadiens posted a record in the playoffs during those two seasons with all three losses coming at the hands of the Islanders br br In the draft Torrey had the th overall pick and was deciding between forwards Mike Bossy and Dwight Foster Bossy was known as an emerging scorer who lacked physicality Foster was known as a solid checker with marginal offensive ability despite having led the Ontario Hockey League in scoring Arbour persuaded Torrey to pick Bossy arguing it was easier to teach a scorer how to check In the season Bossy became the third Islander to win the Calder Trophy and scored goals that season a rookie record at the time The team earned their first Patrick Division and Campbell Conference championships Six players finished the season with goals scored or more with five of them Islanders draft picks showing the success of the draft building process The season ended with a familiar result in the playoffs as the team lost in overtime in Game of the quarterfinals against the Toronto Maple Leafs br In the team finished with the best record in the NHL clinching it with three goals in the third period of the season s final game against the Rangers Trottier won the Hart Memorial Trophy as league MVP and captured the Art Ross Trophy for the most points while sophomore Bossy scored goals which also led the league Despite their regular season dominance the Islanders exited the playoffs with another upset playoff loss this time to the Rangers in the semi finals As the team was leaving Madison Square Garden following their Game elimination Rangers fans rocked and threw objects at the team s bus Hockey professionals and journalists generally questioned whether the Islanders were capable of winning the important games needed to win a Stanley Cup championship Islander players would cite fear of repeating the pain of this loss as spurring their later success After transferring the captaincy to Gillies the season before Westfall retired and shortly thereafter became a color commentator on the team s telecasts br Off the ice the Islanders were on shaky ground Boe was losing money on both his franchises even as the Islanders quickly surged to NHL prominence and the Nets became an ABA power The Islanders were still far behind on the million they had paid in startup costs and the expansion and territorial fees associated with moving the Nets to the National Basketball Association threw Boe s finances into a tailspin Eventually Boe was forced to sell both his teams He readily found a buyer for the Nets but had less luck finding one for the Islanders Torrey orchestrated a sale to one of the team s limited partners John Pickett In return Pickett promoted Torrey to team president though Torrey had already been operating head of the franchise before then Soon after purchasing the team Pickett signed a very lucrative cable television contract with the fledgling SportsChannel network as their owner Charles Dolan thought the up and coming Islanders would be a perfect centerpiece for his new network Dolan gave Pickett a long term guaranteed contract intended not only to keep the team on Long Island but give area governments an incentive to renew his cable contracts The Islanders have remained on the network now known as MSG Sportsnet for over four decades br br br The Dynasty br After the Islanders regular season dominance and playoff disappointment in Arbour decided that he would no longer concern himself too greatly with his team s finish in the regular season Instead he focused his team s energy on how they would perform in the playoffs In the Islanders dropped below the point mark for the first time in five years earning only points However they finally broke through and won the Stanley Cup br br Before the playoffs Torrey made the difficult decision to trade longtime and popular veterans Billy Harris and defenseman Dave Lewis to the Los Angeles Kings for second line center Butch Goring Goring s arrival is often called the final piece of the puzzle a strong two way player his presence on the second line ensured that opponents would no longer be able to focus their defensive efforts on the Islanders first line of Bossy Trottier and Clark Gillies Contributions from new teammates such as wingers Duane Sutter and Anders Kallur and stay at home defensemen Dave Langevin Gord Lane and Ken Morrow the latter fresh off a gold medal win at the Olympics also figured prominently in the Islanders playoff success br In the playoffs the Islanders defeated the Los Angeles Kings in the preliminary round then beat the Boston Bruins in the quarterfinals In the semifinals the Islanders faced the Buffalo Sabres who had finished second overall in the NHL standings The Islanders won the first two games in Buffalo including a victory in game two on Bob Nystrom s goal in double overtime They went on to win the series in six games and reach the finals for the first time in franchise history where they would face the NHL s regular season champions the Philadelphia Flyers who had gone undefeated for straight games during the regular season In game one in Philadelphia the Islanders won on Denis Potvin s power play goal in overtime Leading the series they went home to Long Island for game six In that game the Islanders blew a lead in the third period but Nystrom continued his overtime heroics scoring at of the extra frame on assists by John Tonelli and Lorne Henning to bring Long Island its first Stanley Cup championship This was the most recent Stanley Cup clinching game won in overtime by the home team until the Los Angeles Kings did it in It was also the Islanders sixth overtime victory of the playoffs Bryan Trottier won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player in the playoffs Torrey s strategy of building through the draft turned out very well nearly all of the major contributors on the champions were home grown Islanders or had spent most of their NHL careers in the Islanders organization The Islanders were the first NHL team to win the Stanley Cup with Europeans Stefan Persson and Kallur on its roster br The Islanders dominated the next two seasons Bossy scored goals in games in and the Islanders lost only three playoff games en route to defeating the Minnesota North Stars in five games to win the Stanley Cup Goring won the Conn Smythe Trophy During their semi final sweep of the Rangers Islander fans began taunting the Rangers with a chant of referring to the Rangers last Stanley Cup win in the Rangers would not win the cup again until Fans in other NHL cities soon picked up the chant br br In the Islanders won a then record straight games en route to a franchise record points while Mike Bossy set a scoring record for right wingers with points in an game schedule The Islanders finished with the most points in the league yet once in the playoffs against the Pittsburgh Penguins they found themselves down late in the third period of deciding game before John Tonelli scored both the tying goal and the overtime winner After defeating the Rangers in six games they swept both the Quebec Nordiques and the Vancouver Canucks in the first ever coast to coast Stanley Cup Finals for their third straight championship During that series Bossy upended by a check from Tiger Williams and falling parallel to the ice managed to hook the puck with his stick and score Bossy netted the Stanley Cup winning goal and was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy br The next year although the Islanders had won the Stanley Cup three straight times more attention was being paid to the upstart Edmonton Oilers whose young superstar Wayne Gretzky had just shattered existing scoring records In the Oilers had a better regular season but the Islanders swept them in the Stanley Cup Finals to win their fourth straight championship Billy Smith was named the Conn Smythe Trophy winner after shutting down the Oilers vaunted scoring machine Gretzky failed to score a goal during the series Duane and Brent Sutter scored and points respectively in the first games while Bossy again scored the Stanley Cup winning goal in game four After that game the Oilers players walked past the Islanders dressing room and were surprised to see the champions exhausted Oilers players such as Gretzky and Mark Messier said that they realized at that moment how much it would actually take to win the Stanley Cup br br br Post dynasty and the Easter Epic br The Islanders finished the regular season tied atop the Prince of Wales Conference while successfully defending their Patrick Division title The Drive for Five got off to a tense start Late in the deciding game of their first round series against the Rangers Don Maloney tied the game with a controversial goal as the Islanders believed Maloney s stick was too high They ultimately eliminated the Rangers for the fourth consecutive year The team then defeated the Washington Capitals in five games and the Montreal Canadiens in six to set up a finals rematch with the Oilers The series featured rookie Pat LaFontaine scoring two third period goals in seconds This time the Oilers dethroned the Islanders to win the first of what would be five Stanley Cup victories in seven years For the playoffs the NHL changed the home and away schedule for the finals which provided the Islanders home ice advantage in the series based on winning a regular season game against the Oilers despite finishing lower than them in the overall standings The new format had them play three straight games in Edmonton where the Oilers managed to lock up the series Bossy cited the team s hard time winning an away game as their downfall in the series The Oilers also ended the Islanders series playoff winning streak It remains the longest streak in the history of professional sports one more than the streak by the Boston Celtics of the NBA Unlike the Canadiens who needed to win three series in the and playoffs under the playoff format in place at that time the Islanders had to win four series in each of their Stanley Cup seasons br The Islanders remained competitive for the rest of the decade even as some of the stars from the Cup teams departed As the decade wore on Pickett began to keep the money from the team s cable deal rather than reinvest it in the team as he had done in years past Although it did not become clear immediately the lack of funds limited Torrey s ability to replace all of the departing talent In the NHL season the Islanders slipped to third in their division followed by similar results in the and seasons They began facing stiff competition from division rivals the Philadelphia Flyers who eliminated the Islanders in the Patrick Division Finals in and and the Capitals who swept the Islanders first round series the team s first exit without winning a playoff round since br br In Nystrom retired due to a serious injury and Clark Gillies was picked up on waivers by the Buffalo Sabres Arbour retired as coach following the season and was replaced by longtime junior hockey coach Terry Simpson During the first round of the playoffs against the Capitals the Islanders had fallen behind in the series three games to one but were not eliminated due to a playoff format change from a best of series to a best of The Islanders evened the series which set the stage for one of the most famous games in NHL history the Easter Epic Kelly Hrudey stopped shots on goal while Pat LaFontaine scored at of the fourth overtime and at a m on Easter Sunday morning The win came even though the Islanders had been outshot They were eliminated in the Patrick Division finals in seven games by the Flyers Chronic back pain forced Mike Bossy to retire after the season br The following season the Islanders captured another division title but were defeated in the first round of the playoffs by the upstart New Jersey Devils Potvin retired after the playoffs holding records for most career goals assists and points by a defenseman though he has since been passed in these categories by Ray Bourque and Paul Coffey Around this time the team s run of good luck in the draft began to run out Of their four top draft picks from to they lost one to a freak knee injury and two others never panned out br The season saw the Islanders win only seven of their first games Torrey fired Simpson and brought Arbour back Arbour was unable to turn things around and the team finished with points tied with the Quebec Nordiques for the worst record in the league It was their first losing season and the first time missing the playoffs since their second season Smith the last remaining original Islanders player retired after the season to become the team s goaltending coach Not long after the end of the season Pickett moved to Florida and turned day to day operations over to a committee of four Long Island entrepreneurs Ralph Palleschi Bob Rosenthal Stephen Walsh and Paul Greenwood In return they each bought a interest in the team In the next season the Islanders rebounded to get back into the playoffs but fell to the Rangers in five games of the opening round The team bought out the remaining years of Bryan Trottier s contract sending him off with a team record of games played The season had the team finish well out of the playoffs after winning only games br br br New faces and the run br LaFontaine was frustrated with the team s lack of success and the progress of his contract negotiations and held out rather than report to camp before In response to the holdout Torrey engineered a rebuilding project with two blockbuster trades on October He dealt LaFontaine Randy Wood and Randy Hillier along with future considerations to the Buffalo Sabres in return for Pierre Turgeon Benoit Hogue Uwe Krupp and Dave McLlwain He also sent longtime captain Brent Sutter and Brad Lauer to the Chicago Blackhawks for Steve Thomas and Adam Creighton With these additions and a talented core of players such as Derek King Ray Ferraro and Patrick Flatley along with incoming Soviet players Vladimir Malakhov and Darius Kasparaitis the Islanders had a new foundation in the early s The management committee however was not nearly as patient as Boe and Pickett had been and forced Torrey to resign after the Islanders missed the playoffs again that season Assistant general manager Don Maloney was hired in Torrey s place while Torrey quickly resurfaced with the expansion Florida Panthers br In Maloney s first year the Islanders rebounded to make the playoffs in the process surpassing the point mark for the first time in five years The LaFontaine Turgeon trade proved successful for both the Islanders and Sabres as both players hit career highs in points and Turgeon won the Lady Byng Trophy br Ray Ferraro emerged as a playoff hero scoring a pair of overtime winners in the first round series against the Capitals Instead of celebrating after winning Game at Nassau Coliseum however the Islanders were both irate and despondent Only seconds after Turgeon the team s star center and leading scorer scored an insurance goal in the series clinching game Dale Hunter violently checked him from behind Turgeon was believed to be out for the entire second round if not longer with a separated shoulder He returned only for spot power play duty in the last game of the second round Hunter received a game suspension at the time the longest for on ice misconduct in modern NHL history br The Islanders next opponent the Pittsburgh Penguins were twice defending Stanley Cup champions and full of stars such as Mario Lemieux Jaromir Jagr and Ron Francis The Penguins had roared through the regular season with points as well as recording a record consecutive wins towards the end of the season and were overwhelmingly favored to win a third straight championship Jim Smith of Newsday predicted that with Turgeon on the sidelines the Penguins would sweep the Islanders out of the playoffs however on the strength of outstanding goaltending from Glenn Healy and contributions from all four lines the Islanders achieved a huge upset when David Volek scored at of overtime of the deciding seventh game Newsday s front page the day following the win was a picture of Healy with a headline reading It s a Miracle This was the last playoff series won by the Islanders for years until the season Turgeon returned to the Islanders top line for the Wales Conference Finals against the Montreal Canadiens though he was not in peak form as he had not fully recovered The Islanders bowed out of the playoffs after a hard fought five games two of which went to overtime After beating the Islanders the Canadiens went on to win the Cup br Maloney had avoided making many personnel changes his first year but on the eve of the Expansion Draft he traded backup goaltender Mark Fitzpatrick to the Quebec Nordiques for Ron Hextall The clubs also exchanged first round picks in the deal Able to protect only one netminder in the Expansion Draft the Islanders left Healy exposed He was claimed by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim then was claimed by the Tampa Bay Lightning in Phase II of the draft the next day and finally had his rights traded to the Rangers where he became the backup br The Islanders barely squeezed past the Panthers to make the playoffs before being swept in a lopsided opening series by the first place Rangers who went on to win the Cup it would be the Islanders last playoff appearance until Arbour retired for good as coach and was succeeded by longtime assistant Lorne Henning Hextall who allowed goals in three games drew most of the criticism for the failed playoff campaign and was shipped to Philadelphia for Tommy Soderstrom in September In the lockout shortened season the Islanders not only failed to qualify for the playoffs they finished ahead of only the third year Ottawa Senators br br br Management issues br By the end of the season Maloney was under considerable heat from the press and fan base for his handling of the team Since taking over in the only noticeable attempt he made to upgrade the roster was the acquisition of Hextall Near the end of the failed campaign Maloney decided that the core of players he had left alone for three seasons needed to be revamped leading to a rebuilding project He traded Turgeon and Malakhov to the Montreal Canadiens for Kirk Muller and Mathieu Schneider while Hogue was sent to Toronto for young goaltender Eric Fichaud Additionally Maloney allowed the team s leading scorer Ferraro to depart as an unrestricted free agent at the conclusion of the season Fans displeasure at Maloney for trading the popular Turgeon was magnified when Muller balked at joining a rebuilding team He played games for the Islanders before being sent to Toronto as well br Before the season Maloney fired Henning and named Mike Milbury head coach The same year the Islanders attempt at updating their look resulted in the unveiling of a new team logo of a slicker clad fisherman holding a hockey stick Islanders fans disliked it and rival Rangers fans mockingly called the Islanders fishsticks mocking how the logo resembled the Gorton s Fisherman The team reverted to a modified version of the old logo as soon as the league allowed them to do so The year was a disappointment on the ice as well as the Islanders finished in last place with a record of During the season team management fired Maloney whom fans blamed for the team s downfall and gave Milbury full control of hockey operations as both a coach and general manager Milbury went on to resign as head coach during the following season and elevated assistant Rick Bowness to the position After another unsuccessful season with little improvement Milbury took over as coach again during the season The team improved to fourth place in their division but again failed to make the playoffs Milbury followed by once again stepping down as coach during the following season while retaining his job as general manager br During the continued playoff drought instability in the front office mirrored the Islanders substandard performance on the ice Pickett sold the team to Dallas businessman John Spano in However three months after the closing Spano had only paid Pickett a fraction of the first installment on the cable rights deal Several Islanders executives tipped off Newsday that something was amiss about their new boss In July Newsday exposed Spano as a fraud who did not have the assets required to complete the deal The investigation showed that Spano had deliberately misled the NHL and the Islanders about his net worth and also had two lawsuits pending against him Within days of the report Spano was forced to relinquish the team to Pickett Federal prosecutors turned up evidence that Spano had forged many of the documents used to vouch for his wealth and to promise payment to Pickett and even appeared to have sent many of the documents from his own office in Dallas He was sentenced to months in prison for bank and wire fraud The NHL took additional heat when reports surfaced that the league spent well under depending on the source the league spent either or to check Spano s background It subsequently stiffened the process for vetting future owners The incident and its aftermath were covered in the ESPN for documentary Big Shot Pickett finally found a buyer a group led by Howard Milstein and Phoenix Coyotes co owner Steven Gluckstern a deal which almost fell through when Spectacor Management Group which managed the Coliseum for Nassau County tried to force Pickett to certify that the Coliseum was safe Pickett refused since the Coliseum had fallen into disrepair in recent seasons SMG backed down under pressure from the Islanders the NHL and Nassau County officials br Initially the team made numerous trades and increased their payroll in an effort to assemble a better team In one transaction young players Todd Bertuzzi and Bryan McCabe were traded for veteran Trevor Linden After the Islanders finished points short of the playoffs in the season however Milstein and Gluckstern decided to run the team on an austere budget in an attempt to make a profit They also complained about the condition of the Nassau Coliseum and made noises about moving the team elsewhere They began trading or releasing many popular players to avoid paying their salaries including star scorer Zigmund Palffy team captain Linden former rookie of the year Bryan Berard and rugged defenseman Rich Pilon Losing the highly regarded players the team finished with similar results the next two seasons Attendance which had been in a steady decline over the past few years decreased even further to under per game Around that time Milstein bid hundreds of millions of dollars in unsuccessful attempts to purchase the National Football League s Washington Redskins and Cleveland Browns br br br New ownership and a return to the playoffs br br In Milstein and Gluckstern sold the team to Computer Associates executives Charles Wang and Sanjay Kumar The sale cost million million in dollars and gave fans hope for the team to turn its lack of success around The new owners allowed Milbury to spend money and invest in free agents His first attempt proved unpopular with fans as he traded away future star players Roberto Luongo and Olli Jokinen to the Florida Panthers for Oleg Kvasha and Mark Parrish Milbury then further surprised the hockey world when he took Rick DiPietro with the first selection in the draft ahead of consensus picks Dany Heatley and Marian Gaborik Reporters and fans were alternately confused and enraged by the moves which Milbury acknowledged saying As dangerous as this may be we think Mad Mike maybe has something going for him Establishing a record of controversial decisions Milbury held onto the Mad Mike nickname for years to follow He remained adamant that his moves were to immediately improve the team whose poor winning percentage that year was ahead of only the franchise s first season The team s uninspired play led Milbury to fire head coach and past player Butch Goring Fans vocalized their dislike of Goring taking the fall rather than Milbury which was further worsened when Milbury passed on hiring Ted Nolan as Goring s successor Instead Boston Bruins assistant coach Peter Laviolette was hired br br Three key personnel acquisitions were made prior to the season Laviolette s first Alexei Yashin was acquired from the Ottawa Senators in exchange for forward Bill Muckalt defenseman Zdeno Chara and the Islanders second overall pick in the draft Next Islanders prospects Tim Connolly and Taylor Pyatt were traded to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for Michael Peca who became the team s captain By virtue of finishing with the worst record in the previous season Detroit Red Wings goaltender Chris Osgood was the next addition taken as the first pick in the September waiver draft adding a former Stanley Cup championship goaltender without giving up any players in exchange The additions proved to be a great help as the team opened the season with a record the best in franchise history They finished the season with new broken records their points marked the fourth biggest one year turnaround in the league s history points higher than the previous season while Osgood s starts surpassed Ron Hextall s previous record of During the Stanley Cup playoffs they were seeded fifth and faced the fourth seeded Toronto Maple Leafs The Islanders lost in a very physical first round series in seven games the home team won every game of the series Notably Game featured Gary Roberts charging Islander defenseman Kenny Jonsson and Darcy Tucker submarining Peca with a questionable check that tore the Islander captain s anterior cruciate ligament sidelining both players for the series final game The situation between Tucker and Peca caused a bit of outrage with speculation that Tucker had intended to injure Peca before the game had begun which Tucker denied br Despite the promise shown in the Toronto playoff series the Islanders had a slow start to the season They rebounded to make the playoffs but lost a five game series in the first round to the top seeded Ottawa Senators Milbury continued his controversial move making by firing Laviolette after the season citing postseason interviews with the players in which they expressed a lack of confidence in the coach He was replaced with Steve Stirling who had previously been coaching the team s top minor league affiliate the Bridgeport Sound Tigers In the following season the Islanders again lost in the first round of the playoffs this time to the eventual champion Tampa Bay Lightning br Following the NHL lockout which eliminated that season of play the Islanders made several player moves to increase offense for following season Peca was traded to the Edmonton Oilers for center Mike York freeing up room under the NHL s new salary cap The same day the team signed winger Miroslav Satan to play alongside Yashin Milbury also worked on remaking the team s defense adding Alexei Zhitnik Brad Lukowich and Brent Sopel to replace the departed Adrian Aucoin and Roman Hamrlik who left as free agents and Jonsson who left the NHL to play in the HockeyAllsvenskan in Sweden In the aftermath Yashin was named as the team s new captain The team s inconsistent play led to Stirling s dismissal midway through the season br br br Management shake ups and the DiPietro contract br On the day of Stirling s firing January Milbury also announced that he would step down as general manager once a successor was found He served as vice president of Wang s sports properties for one year before resigning in May Wang proceeded by hiring Neil Smith as general manager and Ted Nolan as head coach following a brief stint by Brad Shaw as the team s interim head coach Smith however was fired after approximately one month and quickly replaced by the team s backup goaltender Garth Snow who retired from his playing career to accept the position Before his dismissal Smith made several free agent acquisitions including defensemen Brendan Witt and Tom Poti and forwards Mike Sillinger and Chris Simon br On September the Islanders signed DiPietro to a year million million in dollars contract which was believed to be the longest contract to date in the NHL and the second longest in North American sports behind a year contract for National Basketball Association player Magic Johnson DiPietro Wang and Snow all spoke confidently and felt it was the best move for both sides despite the mixed reactions it received from the rest of the hockey world Specifically Wang stated This is not a big deal You have to have a commitment to who you re working with As speculation began as to whether other teams would follow suit and give lengthy contracts to star players Atlanta Thrashers general manager Don Waddell felt that It s highly unlikely that you will see teams go beyond that This is a once in a lifetime contract Ownership must feel very strongly that he s their guy for the next years br br The new look Islanders were picked by most analysts to languish towards the bottom of the standings Eyeing a playoff spot Snow traded for forward Ryan Smyth from the Edmonton Oilers at the trade deadline on February Injuries to DiPietro provided extra setbacks but not enough to drop the team from playoff contention They qualified for the playoffs assisted by a late season winning steak and a shootout victory against the New Jersey Devils in their final regular season game Despite DiPietro s return to the team in time for the playoffs the team lost their first round matchup in five games to the Presidents Trophy winning Buffalo Sabres br Management announced in June that they would buy out captain Alexei Yashin s contract which had four seasons remaining on it Free agents Smyth Poti Viktor Kozlov Jason Blake and Richard Zednik also left in July During that month the Islanders signed Bill Guerin to a two year contract as he immediately assumed team captaincy Also in the off season free agents Mike Comrie Andy Sutton and Jon Sim joined the team That summer it was announced that Nolan extended an invitation to Al Arbour to return as a coach for one game in order to bring his total number of games coached to Arbour signed a one day contract the shortest in league history on November it put him behind the bench the following day as the Islanders defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins raising his career coaching win total to The team remained in the playoff hunt through the trade deadline as they resigned Comrie to a one year contract and traded away Simon and Marc Andre Bergeron A rash of injuries saw them plummet to the fifth worst record in the league by the end of the season br br At the NHL Entry Draft the Islanders made two trades to move down from the fifth to the ninth overall pick with which they selected center Josh Bailey They also added free agents Mark Streit and Doug Weight The team dismissed head coach Ted Nolan over alleged philosophy differences and later that summer replaced him with Scott Gordon Near the trade deadline Snow traded Comrie and Chris Campoli to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for forward Dean McAmmond and the San Jose Sharks first round draft pick in the NHL Entry Draft and sent captain Bill Guerin to the
