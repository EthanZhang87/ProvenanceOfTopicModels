has its roots in the various stick and ball games played over the centuries in the United Kingdom and North America From prior to the establishment of Canada Europeans are recorded as having played versions of field hockey and its relatives while the Mi kmaq indigenous peoples of the Maritimes also had a ball and stick game and made many hockey sticks used by Europeans in the s Similarly ice skating team games which eventually became the organized sport of bandy were also played From these roots the contemporary sport of ice hockey was developed in Canada most notably in Montreal where the first indoor hockey game was played on March at the Victoria Skating Rink organized by James Creighton a McGill University student from Halifax Nova Scotia Some characteristics of that game such as the length of the ice rink and the use of a puck have been retained The International Ice Hockey Federation IIHF later adopted the Canadian rules as the official rules of ice hockey br br Annual championships began in Montreal in the s leading to the awarding of the Stanley Cup considered the oldest trophy in North American sports Lord Stanley of Preston was appointed by Queen Victoria to be the Governor General of Canada on June While governor ice hockey was still just forming in Canada He first got to see the game of hockey played at Montreal s Winter Carnival During the carnival he

depriving Canada of some of its best players Other early professional play took place in Northern Ontario the Timiskaming League and in the Maritimes the Coloured Hockey League Although many Canadian amateur teams paid their players under the table most Canadian hockey associations still stuck to the codes of amateurism The IPHL ceased after three years but that was long enough to spark the creation of a Canadian based professional league the Ontario Professional Hockey League in Though some believe the IHL s short existence was due to lack of spectator interest the primary reason the league failed was a loss of good players back to Canadian teams that by played in hockey associations such as the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association that allowed professionals to play alongside amateurs The National Hockey Association was formed in leading to the National Hockey League in The Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs are two of the NHL s Original Six franchises and its two

Association was forced to re evaluate its position on amateurism in hockey and to assess its relationship to the amateur sports infrastructure in Canada which was headed by the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada The lacklustre performance of the Canadian national hockey team at the Olympics over player availability forced radical changes on approaches to how the game was formulated in the country br

era In Ottawa the Alerts women s team found similar success drawing thousands of fans and winning a world series in Pittsburgh over an American team called the Polar Milk Maids However the return of professional men s hockey after the war and the onset of the Great Depression together led to a slump in women s hockey particularly at the professional level One exception to this trend was the Preston Rivulettes an Ontario team that dominated women s hockey through the s The Second World War further set women s hockey back br A major milestone in the women s game occurred in with the organization of the Ontario Women s Hockey Association by Fran Rider which established infrastructure dedicated to growing the women s game The establishment and success of the Edmonton Chimos women s

Jack Roxburgh did extensive research to find if Canadian parliament had ever declared a national game and specifically looked into whether lacrosse was officially declared After going through parliamentary records he found no law was ever enacted The Canadian Press reported at the time that the myth of lacrosse as Canada s national game possibly came from a book published in titled Lacrosse the National Game of Canada and that the Canadian Lacrosse Association was founded in His endeavour to declare hockey as Canada s national game coincided with the Great Canadian Flag Debate On October Roxburgh moved to introduce Bill C with respect to declaring hockey as the national game of Canada br Canadian Lacrosse Association members responded to the motion by calling it insulting and out of line and vowed to fight it On June Bob Prittie replied by introducing a separate bill to have lacrosse declared as Canada s national game and stated that I think it is fitting at this time when we are considering national flags national anthems and other national symbols that this particular matter should be settled now The choice of Canada s national game was debated in but neither bill was passed when parliament was dissolved In Prime Minister Lester B Pearson proposed to name national summer and winter games but nothing was resolved Finally in April Bill C was passed to recognize hockey as Canada s official winter game and lacrosse as its summer game br br br See also br History of Canadian sports br History of the National Hockey League br Ice hockey in Calgary br
