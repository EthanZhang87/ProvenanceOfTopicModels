title: Expansion team
id: 1945737
An expansion team is a new team in a sports league usually from a city that has not hosted a team in that league before formed with the intention of satisfying the demand for a local team from a population in a new area Sporting leagues also hope that the expansion of their competition will grow the popularity of the sport generally The term is most commonly used in reference to the North American major professional sports leagues but is applied to sports leagues in other countries with a closed franchise system of league membership The term refers to the expansion of the sport into new areas The addition of an expansion team sometimes results in the payment of an expansion fee to the league by the new team and an expansion draft to populate the new roster br br br Reasons for expansion br In North America expansion often takes place in response to population growth and geographic shifts of population Such demographic change results in financial opportunities to engage with the new market as consumers of sports demand local teams to support Major League Baseball MLB was limited to teams located north and east of St Louis Missouri for the first half of the th century During that time the United States population doubled and expanded to the south and west Rival interests explored the possibility of forming a rival league in the untapped markets To forestall that possibility one of the measures that MLB took was to expand by four teams in and Over the past four decades MLB expanded further to its current team membership In the context of MLB the term expansion team is also used to refer to any of the teams enfranchised in the second half of the th century br Leagues that are new and or financially struggling may also admit large numbers of expansion teams so that the existing franchises can pocket more revenue from expansion fees Indoor American football leagues are notorious for doing so the leagues can double the number of teams and have many new teams fail within a year or two Major League Soccer after spending most of its first decade of existence with relatively stable membership and struggling finances adopted a policy of continuous expansion beginning in a policy that the league as of has no intention of stopping br When an expansion team begins play it is generally stocked with less talented free agents inexperienced players and veterans nearing retirement Additionally prospective owners may face expensive fees to the league as well as high startup costs such as stadiums and facilities The team is also at a disadvantage in that it has not been together as a team as long as its opponents and thus lacks the cohesiveness other teams have built over years As a result most expansion teams are known for their poor play during their first seasons Expansion teams must also compete with any expansion rivals for available talent a common problem since leagues often expand by two or four teams in one season br Expansion teams are not necessarily doomed to mediocrity however as most leagues have policies which promote parity such as drafts and salary caps which give some expansion teams the opportunity to win championships only a few years after their first season In Major League Baseball MLB The Arizona Diamondbacks won the World Series in their fourth season and the Florida Marlins won the World Series in their fifth season In the NBA The Milwaukee Bucks won the NBA Finals in their third year of existence greatly helped by drafting Kareem Abdul Jabbar in the draft and acquiring Oscar Robertson from the Cincinnati Royals before the season began In the NHL the Florida Panthers made the Stanley Cup Finals in their third season even though like MLB the league then had no salary cap a cap was established in However the Vegas Golden Knights quickly emerged as one of the NHL s best teams in its first season Thanks to a generous expansion draft the team defied all odds and advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals and later winning the Stanley Cup Finals in just their sixth season br The National Football League NFL despite being considered the most generous in its revenue sharing and the strictest with its salary cap has had far more difficulty bringing expansion teams up to par with their more established brethren Of the six teams to have been added to the NFL since the AFL NFL merger the fastest turnaround between an inaugural season and the team s first Super Bowl victory was seasons the Tampa Bay Buccaneers established in won Super Bowl XXXVII in the season none of the four teams to hold expansion drafts since have ever won that contest with only one the Carolina Panthers who reached the game in their th and st seasons of existence playing in the game In the Panthers and Jacksonville Jaguars each made it to their respective conference championship games in their second season in the league br Expansion teams are usually considered as such in their first season and sometimes in their second season A team that moves to another location and or changes its name is not an expansion team If it moves it is known as a relocated team and if the name changes the team is known as a renamed team In response to a negative attitude that some fans have towards relocated teams there have recently been instances where relocating clubs change their identity completely name colors and mascot but because the roster is the same and the league does not expand as a result they are not regarded as expansion teams One exception is the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League NFL when the Cleveland Browns moved to Baltimore an agreement was reached for which the trademark and history of the pre Cleveland Browns remained in that city and was claimed by the post Browns when the league placed a new franchise there even though the personnel and roster had moved to Baltimore to become the Ravens Another exception is the New Orleans Pelicans who were previously known as the New Orleans Hornets after relocating to New Orleans from Charlotte N C in After the sale of the Hornets new owner Tom Benson changed the name colors and mascot from Hornets to Pelicans The Charlotte Hornets segment of the franchise s history was sold to the then Charlotte Bobcats themselves formerly considered a expansion team and the New Orleans Hornets are now officially regarded as an expansion team br Cities and regions with large populations that lack a team are generally regarded to be the best candidates for new teams In rugby league the United Kingdom based Rugby Football League s Super League has added teams from France and Wales to cover a great demographic spread The operator of Super League England s Rugby Football League has also added teams to the lower levels of its league pyramid specifically the Championship and League from both France and Wales and most recently Canada In rugby union the competition originally known as the Celtic League and now as Pro which began with sides only from the Celtic nations of Ireland Scotland and Wales has added teams from Italy and more recently South Africa The U S based NFL has been laying groundwork for a potential franchise in the UK with a target date some time in the early to mid s br br br Expansion teams in North America br br br Major League Baseball MLB br br The National League had an eight
