third round of the Stanley Cup playoffs The two series are played in mid to late May early June in and due to labour disputes that delayed the start of the season and September in due to the COVID pandemic The winners of the Eastern and Western Conference finals receive the Prince of Wales Trophy and Clarence S Campbell Bowl respectively and advance to face each other in the Stanley Cup Finals br br br History br br Before the season the NHL was made up only of a single division From the season through the season the NHL was made up of two divisions as opposed to conferences the East Division and the West Division br Following the season the NHL again realigned The East and West Divisions were renamed the Prince of Wales and Clarence Campbell Conferences respectively At the time the new conferences and divisions had little to do with North American geography and geographical references were removed Furthermore all playoff teams were seeded regardless of conference br Beginning in the season the conferences and the playoffs were realigned The NHL was hoping to reduce travel costs in the face of a struggling economy and high energy prices The regular season and playoffs were also altered to emphasize divisional match ups Thus the first official conference finals were held in br Beginning in the season the names of conferences and divisions were changed to reflect their geographic locations At the instigation of then new NHL commissioner Gary Bettman the NHL made the change to help non hockey fans better understand the game as the National Basketball Association uses geographic based names for their conferences and divisions and the National Football League and Major League Baseball use geographic based names for their divisions Therefore the Campbell Conference became the Western Conference and the Wales Conference became the Eastern Conference The winner of the Eastern Conference finals still receives the Prince of Wales Trophy while the winner of the Western Conference finals still receives the Clarence S Campbell Bowl The only exception to this practice was the pandemic affected season that was played without conferences The league decided in June to award the trophies one per team to the two victors of the Stanley Cup Semifinals After that season the league revived the conferences for the season br The Hartford Whalers never
