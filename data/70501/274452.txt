id: 274452
The California Golden Seals were a professional ice hockey club that competed in the National Hockey League NHL from to Based in Oakland California they played their home games at the Oakland Alameda County Coliseum Arena The Seals were one of six teams added to the league as part of the NHL expansion Initially named the California Seals the team was renamed the Oakland Seals during the season and then the Bay Area Seals in before becoming the California Golden Seals the same year br The Seals were the least successful of the teams added in the expansion never earning a winning record and only making the playoffs twice in nine seasons of play Off the ice they were plagued by low attendance The franchise was relocated in to become the Cleveland Barons who would cease operations two years later They are the only franchise from the expansion never to reach the Stanley Cup Finals br br br History br br br Founding br br In the NHL announced that six expansion teams would be added as a new division for the season officially because of a general desire to expand the league to new markets but also to squelch the Western Hockey League s threat to turn into a major league The San Francisco Seals were one such team from the WHL The NHL awarded an expansion team to Barry Van Gerbig for the San Francisco Bay area Van Gerbig decided to purchase the WHL club with the intent of bringing them into the NHL as an expansion team the following season br Van Gerbig had planned to have the team play in a new arena in San Francisco but the new arena was never built He decided to move the team across the Bay from the Cow Palace in Daly City to Oakland to play in the new Oakland Alameda County Coliseum Arena He renamed the club the California Seals This was done in an attempt to appeal to fans from San Francisco and to address complaints from the other NHL teams that Oakland was not considered a major league city and would not be a draw for fans br A year later Van Gerbig brought the Seals into the NHL as an expansion team The team participated with the other five expansion teams in the NHL Expansion Draft however the terms imposed by the established Original Six teams were very one sided in their favor The existing NHL teams were permitted to protect nearly all of their best players thus the players available for selection were mostly castoffs aging players well past their prime and career minor leaguers To bolster their roster and also to maintain a semblance of familiarity and continuity for existing Seals fans the team retained a portion of the club s WHL roster such as Charlie Burns George Swarbrick Gerry Odrowski Tom Thurlby and Ron Harris br The Bay Area was not considered a particularly lucrative hockey market however the terms of a new television agreement with CBS called for two of the expansion teams to be located in California and other than the Kings there were no other prospective franchise applicants of similar pedigree to the Seals Nevertheless while the WHL Seals had drawn well at the Cow Palace the team drew poorly in Oakland once they entered the NHL The plan to bring fans in from San Francisco failed and on November Van Gerbig announced that the team s name would be changed to the Oakland Seals although the league did not register the change until December to focus more on the East Bay br br br Struggles br br The Seals were never successful at the gate even after the name change and because of this poor attendance Van Gerbig threatened on numerous occasions to move the team elsewhere First year coach and general manager Bert Olmstead publicly advocated a move to Vancouver resulting in an offer from Labatt s brewery to purchase and relocate the team to the Canadian city as well as a proposal to move the team to Buffalo from the Knox brothers who like Vancouver had been shut out of the expansion The NHL not wanting to endanger its TV deal with CBS rejected both proposals As a compromise the NHL agreed to expand again in adding teams in both Vancouver and Buffalo The Knoxes bought a minority share of the Seals in only to sell it a year later to fund the Sabres br This as well as the team s mediocre on ice performance led to major changes to both the Seals front office and the roster only of the Seals players remained after the first season The new look Seals were somewhat more successful In their second season they improved to points which while still seven games below was good enough for second place in the all expansion West Division The Seals were actually favored to win their first round playoff matchup against the Kings but were upset in seven games Oakland regressed to points the following season but still edged out Philadelphia for the final playoff spot on a tiebreaker Their second playoff appearance was a brief one as they were swept by the Pittsburgh Penguins Those were the only two years that the franchise made the playoffs br The league s rejection of a proposed move to Vancouver prompted a lawsuit that was not settled until San Francisco Seals Ltd v National Hockey League The Seals organization filed suit against the NHL claiming that the prohibition violated the Sherman Act The Seals asserted that the league s constitution was in violation by prohibiting clubs from relocating their operations and that the relocation request was denied in an attempt to keep the San Francisco market in the NHL and thereby discourage the formation of a rival team or league in that location The court ruled that the NHL was a single entity and that the teams were not competitors in an economic sense so the league restrictions on relocation were not a restraint of trade br For the season the team was sold to Trans National Communications whose investors included Pat Summerall and Whitey Ford However the group filed for bankruptcy after missing a payment and relinquished the team to Van Gerbig who put the team back on the market br br br Charles O Finley purchases the franchise br br Prior to the season Charles O Finley the flamboyant and eccentric owner of baseball s Oakland Athletics purchased the Seals Finley and Roller Derby boss Jerry Seltzer had both put in a bid on the team Although Seltzer s offer was slightly better and included a more detailed plan for revival a majority of NHL owners from the old establishment voted in favor of Finley General manager Bill Torrey left by mid season due to clashes with Finley br Finley renamed the team the Bay Area Seals to begin the season but after just two games into the season on October he changed the team name to the California Golden Seals following a number of other marketing gimmicks intended to promote the team to the fans among them changing the Seals colors to green and gold to match those of the popular A s The team s uniform crest was now the word Seals in a unique typeface but an alternate logo using a sketch based on a photo of star player Carol Vadnais was used on marketing materials such as pennants stickers and team programs The original California Seals logo recolored in green and gold was often seen on trading cards and other unofficial material but was never adopted by the team The Seals are remembered for wearing white skates but initially Torrey convinced Finley to use green and gold painted skates instead as team colored skates were a trend of the period However this was all for naught as the Seals finished with the worst record in the NHL that year Other innovations that Finley s Seals incorporated were the inclusion of player names on the back of the jerseys which then set the precedent for today s current NHL teams identifying players in the same fashion Finley also was the first owner to allow players to fly first class on commercial flights to games thus starting a trend that ultimately culminated in NHL teams regularly chartering aircraft by the st century The Seals regularly used the new Boeing s the airlines had put into service at the time Finley also introduced the flamboyant green and gold Seals luggage which all players and coaches were required to carry to identify them as the northern California NHL team On May the Seals traded their pick in the first round of the NHL Amateur Draft to the Montreal Canadiens along with Francois Lacombe in return for Montreal s first round pick in the draft Seals selected Chris Oddleifson Ernie Hicke and cash As a result of the Seals dreadful season the Canadiens had the top pick in the draft and used it to select future Hall of Fame member Guy Lafleur This transaction now ranks as one of the most one sided deals in NHL history br br br Under the ownership of the NHL and Mel Swig br The team rebounded in but the arrival of the World Hockey Association WHA wiped out most of those gains Finley refused to match the WHA s contract offers causing five of the team s top ten scorers from the previous season to bolt to the new league Devoid of any defensive talent save for goaltender Gilles Meloche the Seals sank into last place again in where they would remain for the rest of their history Although divisional restructuring in included a revamped format in which three teams in each division made the playoffs the team s efforts were frustrated by their placement in the Adams Division with the strong Sabres Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs of the day The Seals once again finished well out of playoff contention and were notably the only team to lose at home to the expansion Washington Capitals br Finley soon lost patience with his struggling hockey team especially given the contrast to his World Series champion Athletics He tried to sell the Seals but when no credible buyers came forward who were interested in keeping the team in the Bay Area he sold the team back to the league for million A attempt by Finley to sell the team to Indianapolis interests who planned to relocate the team to that city was rejected by the NHL s board of governors br In early newspapers reported that the Seals and Pittsburgh Penguins were to be relocated to Denver and Seattle respectively in an arrangement that would have seen the two teams sold to groups in those cities that had already been awarded conditional franchises for the season At the same time the league announced that if the Seals sale to the Denver group was not completed or new ownership found locally the franchise would be liquidated at the end of the season br The Denver arrangement fell through and the league ran the Seals for more than a year until a group headed by San Francisco hotel magnate Melvin Swig bought the team on July with the intention of moving the team to a proposed new arena in San Francisco The team fell just short of the playoffs and after a mayoral election plans for the new arena were cancelled With a new arena out of the picture the league dropped their objection to the relocation of the franchise br br br The end br br Although attendance was finally showing some improvement and the team playing better minority owners George and Gordon Gund persuaded Swig to seek approval to move the team to their hometown of Cleveland The team s final game in Oakland was a win over the Los Angeles Kings on April league approval for the move was granted on July and the team was renamed the Cleveland Barons after the city s old AHL squad br Unfortunately details were not finalized until less than six weeks before the start of the season rendering the Barons all but invisible in Cleveland After two more years of losses and with attendance worse than it had been in Oakland the Gunds by this time majority owners were permitted to merge the Barons with the equally strapped Minnesota North Stars on June The merged team continued as the Minnesota North Stars under the Gunds ownership but assumed the Barons place in the Adams Division The North Stars ultimately relocated to Texas following the season to become the Dallas Stars br The Cleveland Barons remain the most recent team in an established North American major professional league to fold They were also the last actively playing NHL team to do so since the Brooklyn Americans in the franchise was formally cancelled in and the last team to cease operations since the Montreal Maroons had their franchise formally canceled in though they had not iced a team since As a result the NHL consisted of teams for the season br br br Legacy br The current NHL team in the Bay Area the San Jose Sharks has a historical connection to the Seals Years after the Barons North Stars merger the Gunds wanted to bring hockey back to the Bay Area They asked the NHL for permission to move the North Stars there in the late s but the league was unwilling to abandon a traditional hockey market like the Twin Cities Meanwhile a group led by former Hartford Whalers owner Howard Baldwin was pushing the NHL to bring a team to San Jose where an arena was being built Eventually a compromise was struck whereby the Gunds would sell their share of the North Stars to Baldwin s group with the Gunds receiving an expansion team in the Bay Area to begin play in the season In return the Sharks would have the rights to players from the North Stars and then participate with the North Stars as an equal partner in an expansion draft with the new franchise On May the Gunds officially sold their share of the North Stars to Baldwin and were awarded a new team in the Bay Area that became the Sharks Ironically in their first two seasons in the league the Sharks played their home games at the Cow Palace in Daly City the same facility the NHL rejected as a home for the Seals in while their new permanent home arena in San Jose was being completed br Dennis Maruk was the last Seals player active in the NHL retiring as a member of the North Stars in The last former Seals player in any league was George Pesut who was active in Germany until br Though no longer an active team the Seals remained a popular subject and are the subject of multiple works In Brad Kurtzberg published the first book on the Seals franchise Shorthanded The Untold Story of the Seals Hockey s Most Colorful Team In January filmmaker Mark Greczmiel released his documentary The California Golden Seals Story on iTunes In the Seals tribute site GoldenSealsHockey com was founded to help promote the November release of the
