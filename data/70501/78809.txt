title: Speed limit
id: 78809
Speed limits on road traffic as used in most countries set the legal maximum speed at which vehicles may travel on a given stretch of road Speed limits are generally indicated on a traffic sign reflecting the maximum permitted speed expressed as kilometres per hour km h or miles per hour mph or both Speed limits are commonly set by the legislative bodies of national or provincial governments and enforced by national or regional police and judicial authorities Speed limits may also be variable or in some places nonexistent such as on most of the Autobahnen in Germany br The first numeric speed limit for automobiles was the mph km h limit introduced in the United Kingdom in br As of the highest posted speed limit in the world is km h mph applied on two motorways in the UAE Speed limits and safety distance are poorly enforced in the UAE specifically on the Abu Dhabi to Dubai motorway which results in dangerous traffic according to a French government travel advisory Additionally drivers often drive at high speeds and unsafe driving practices are common especially on inter city highways On highways unmarked speed bumps and drifting sand create additional hazards according to a travel advisory issued by the U S State Department br There are several reasons to regulate speed on roads It is often done in an attempt to improve road traffic safety and to reduce the number of casualties from traffic collisions The World Health Organization WHO identified speed control as one of a number of steps that can be taken to reduce road casualties As of the WHO estimates that approximately million people die of road traffic crashes each year br Authorities may also set speed limits to reduce the environmental impact of road traffic vehicle noise vibration emissions or to enhance the safety of pedestrians cyclists and other road users For example a draft proposal from Germany s National Platform on the Future of Mobility task force recommended a blanket km h mph speed limit across the Autobahnen to curb fuel consumption and carbon emissions Some cities have reduced limits to as little as km h mph for both safety and efficiency reasons However some research indicates that changes in the speed limit may not always alter average vehicle speed br Lower speed limits could reduce the use of over engineered vehicles br br br History br br In Western cultures speed limits predate the use of motorized vehicles In the American colony of New Amsterdam passed a law stating No wagons carts or sleighs shall be run rode or driven at a gallop The punishment for breaking the law was two pounds Flemish the equivalent of US in The Stage Carriage Act introduced the offense of endangering the safety of a passenger or person by furious driving in the United Kingdom UK In then President of the United States Ulysses S Grant was arrested for speeding in his horse drawn carriage in Washington D C br A series of Locomotive Acts in and created the first numeric speed limits for mechanically propelled vehicles in the UK the Act introduced a UK speed limit of mph km h on open roads in town which was reduced to mph km h in towns and mph km h in rural areas by the Red Flag Act The Locomotives on Highways Act which raised the speed limit to mph km h is celebrated by the annual London to Brighton Veteran Car Run br On January the first person to be convicted of speeding is believed to be Walter Arnold of East Peckham Kent UK who was fined shilling plus costs for speeding at mph km h br br In Connecticut was the first state in the United States to impose a numerical speed limit for motor vehicles setting the maximum legal speed to mph km h in cities and mph km h on rural roads Speed limits then propagated across the United States by all but states had established numerical limits br In in the UK the national speed limit was raised to mph km h however as this was difficult to enforce due to the lack of speedometers the Road Traffic Act abolished speed limits entirely In a new limit of mph km h was imposed in urban centers and in July a mph km h national speed limit was introduced br In Australia during the early th century there were people reported for furious driving offenses One conviction in cited a vehicle furiously driving mph km h when passing a tram traveling at half that speed br In May the Nazi era Road Traffic Act imposed the first nationwide speed limit in Germany br In the s in continental Europe some speed limits were established based on the V speed so that of drivers respect this speed br In Australian speed limits underwent metrication the urban speed limit of mph km h was converted to km h mph the rural speed limits of mph km h and mph km h were changed to km h mph and km h mph respectively br In Sweden defined the Vision Zero program a multi national road traffic safety project that aims to achieve a highway system with no fatalities or serious injuries involving road traffic br br br Regulations br br Most countries use the metric speed unit of kilometres per hour while others including the United States United Kingdom and Liberia use speed limits given in miles per hour br br br Vienna Convention on Road Traffic br In countries bound by the Vienna Conventions on Road Traffic Article defines a basic rule for speed and distance between vehicles br br Every driver of a vehicle shall in all circumstances have his vehicle under control to be able to exercise due and proper care and to be at all times in a position to perform all man uvres required of him He shall when adjusting the speed of his vehicle pay constant regard to the circumstances in particular the lie of the land the state of the road the condition and load of his vehicle the weather conditions and the density of traffic so as to be able to stop his vehicle within his range of forward vision and short of any foreseeable obstruction He shall slow down and if necessary stop whenever circumstances so require and particularly when visibility is not excellent br br br Reasonable speed br Most legal systems expect drivers to drive at a safe speed for the conditions at hand regardless of posted limits br In the United Kingdom and elsewhere in common law this is known as the reasonable man requirement br The German Highway Code Stra enverkehrs Ordnung section on speed begins with the statement translated to English br br Any person driving a vehicle may only drive so fast that the car is under control Speeds must be adapted to the road traffic visibility and weather conditions as well as the personal skills and characteristics of the vehicle and load br In France the law clarifies that even if the speed is limited by law and by local authority the driver assumes the responsibility to control a vehicle s speed and to reduce that speed in various circumstances such as when overtaking a pedestrian or bicycle individually or in a group when overtaking a stopped convoy when passing a transportation vehicle loading or unloading people or children when the road does not appear clear or risky when visibility is low etc If drivers do not control their speed or do not reduce it in such cases they can be penalized Other qualifying conditions include driving through fog heavy rain ice snow gravel or when drivers encounter sharp corners a blinding glare darkness crossing traffic or when there is an obstructed view of orthogonal traffic such as by road curvature parked cars vegetation or snow banks thus limiting the Assured Clear Distance Ahead ACDA br In the United States this requirement is referred to as the basic rule as outlined by US federal government law CFR which applies in all states as permitted under the commerce clause and due process clause The basic speed law is almost always supplemented by specific maximum or minimum limits but applies regardless In California for instance Vehicle Code section states that No person shall drive a vehicle upon a highway at speed greater than is reasonable and in no event at a speed which endangers the safety of persons or property The reasonable speed may be different than the posted speed limit Basic rule speed laws are statutory reinforcements of the centuries old common law negligence doctrine as specifically applied to vehicular speed Citations for violations of the basic speed law without a crash have sometimes been ruled unfairly vague or arbitrary hence a violation of the due process of law at least in the State of Montana Even within states differing jurisdictions counties and cities choose to prosecute similar cases with differing approaches br br br Excessive speed br Consequential results of basic law violations are often categorized as excessive speed crashes for example the leading cause of crashes on German autobahns in fell into that category so called speed related crashes claimed the lives of people which represented almost half of autobahn fatalities in However excessive speed does not necessarily mean the speed limit was exceeded rather that police determined at least one party traveled too fast for existing conditions Examples of conditions where drivers may find themselves driving too fast include wet roadways due to rain snow or ice reduced visibility due to fog or white out snow uneven roads construction zones curves intersections gravel roads and heavy traffic Per distance traveled consequences of inappropriate speed are more frequent on lower speed lower quality roads in the United States for example the speeding fatality rate for local roads is three times that for Interstates br For speed management a distinction can exist between excess speed which consists of driving in excess of the speed limit and inappropriate speed which consists of going too fast for the conditions br br br Maximum speed limits br Most countries have a legally assigned numerical maximum speed limit which applies on all roads when no other speed limit indications are present lower speed limits are often shown on a sign at the start of the restricted section although the presence of streetlights or the physical arrangement of the road may sometimes also be used instead A posted speed limit may only apply to that road or to all roads beyond the sign that defines them depending on local laws br The speed limit is commonly set at or below the th percentile speed the operating speed which no more than of traffic exceeds and in the US is frequently set to mph to km h below that speed Thus if the th percentile operating speed as measured by a Traffic and Engineering Survey exceeds the design speed legal protection is given to motorists traveling at such speeds design speed is based on conservative assumptions about the driver the vehicle and roadway characteristics The theory behind the th percentile rules is that as a policy most citizens should be deemed reasonable and prudent and limits must be practical to enforce However there are some circumstances where motorists do not tend to process all the risks involved and as a mass choose a poor th percentile speed This rule in practice is a process for voting the speed limit by driving in contrast to delegating the speed limit to an engineering expert br The maximum speed permitted by statute as posted is normally based on ideal driving conditions and the basic speed rule always applies Violation of the statute generally raises a rebuttable presumption of negligence br On international European roads speed should be taken into account during the design stage br br br Minimum speed limits br Some roads also have minimum speed limits usually where slow speeds can impede traffic flow or be dangerous The use of minimum speed limits is not as common as maximum speed limits since the risks of speed are less common at lower speeds In some jurisdictions laws requiring a minimum speed are primarily centered around red light districts or similar areas where they may colloquially be referred to as kerb crawling laws br br br Middle speed limits br Traffic rules limiting only middle speeds are rare One such example exists on the ice roads in Estonia where it is advised to avoid driving at the speed of km h mph as the vehicle may create resonance that may in turn induce the breaking of ice This means that two sets of speeds are allowed under km h mph and between km h mph br br br Variable speed limits br br In Germany the first known experiments with variable speed limit signs took place in on a kilometre mi stretch of German motorway the A between Munich and the border city of Salzburg Austria Mechanically variable message signs could display speeds of and km h as well as text indicating a danger zone or accident Personnel monitored traffic using video technology and manually controlled the signage Beginning in the s additional advanced traffic control systems were put into service Modern motorway control systems can work without human intervention using various types of sensors to measure traffic flow and weather conditions In kilometres mi of German motorways were equipped with such systems br In the United States heavily traveled portions of the New Jersey Turnpike began using variable speed limit signs in combination with variable message signs in the late s Officials can adjust the speed limit according to weather traffic conditions and construction More typically variable speed limits are used on remote stretches of highway in the United States in areas with extreme changes in driving conditions For example variable limits were introduced in October on a mile km stretch of Interstate in Wyoming replacing the winter season speed reduction from to mph to km h that had been in place since This Variable Speed Limit system has been proven effective in terms of reducing crash frequency and road closures Similarly Interstate at Snoqualmie Pass and other mountain passes in Washington State have variable speed limits as to slow traffic in severe winter weather As a response to fog induced chain reaction collisions involving vehicles in a variable speed limit system covering miles km of Interstate in Tennessee was implemented in fog prone areas around the Hiwassee River The Georgia Department of Transportation installed variable speed limits on part of Interstate around Atlanta in These speeds can be as low as mph km h but are generally set to mph km h In the Oregon Department of Transportation installed a variable speed zone on a mi km stretch of Interstate between Baker City and Ladd Canyon The new electronic signs collect data regarding temperature skid resistance and average motorist speed to determine the most effective speed limit for the area before presenting the limit on the sign This speed zone was scheduled to be activated November Ohio established variable speed limits on three highways in then in granted the authority to the Ohio Department of Transportation to establish variable limits on any of its highways br In the United Kingdom a variable speed limit was introduced on part of the M motorway in on the busiest mile km section from junction to Initial results suggested savings in journey times smoother flowing traffic and a decrease in the number of crashes the scheme was made permanent in However a National Audit Organisation report noted that the business case was unproved conditions at the site of the Variable Speed Limits trial were not stable before or during the trial and the study was deemed neither properly controlled nor reliable Since December the upgraded section of the M between the M and Luton has had the capability for variable speed limits In January temporary variable speed cameras on the M between J and J were made permanent br New Zealand introduced variable speed limits in February The first installation was on the Ngauranga Gorge section of the dual carriageway on State Highway characterized by steep terrain numerous bends high traffic volumes and a higher than average accident rate The speed limit is normally km h mph br Austria undertook a short term experiment in with a variable limit configuration that could increase statutory limits under the most favorable conditions as well as reduce them In June a stretch of motorway was configured with variable speed limits that could increase the general Austrian motorway limit of to km h to mph Then Austrian Transport Minister Hubert Gorbach called the experiment a milestone in European transport policy despite all predictions to the contrary however the experiment was discontinued br br br Roads without speed limits br Just over half of the German autobahns have only an advisory speed limit a Richtgeschwindigkeit have temporary speed limits due to weather or traffic conditions and have permanent speed limits according to estimates The advisory speed limit applies to any road in Germany outside of towns which is either a dual carriageway or features at least two lanes per direction regardless of its classification e g Autobahn Federal Highway State Road etc unless there is a speed limit posted although it is less common for non autobahn roads to be unrestricted All other roads in Germany outside of towns regardless of classification do have a general speed limit of km h mph which is usually reduced to km h mph at All e streets roads bordered by trees or bushes on one or both sites Travel speeds are not regularly monitored in Germany however a report noted that on the autobahn in Niemegk between Leipzig and Berlin significantly more than of road users exceed km h mph and more than of motorists exceed km h mph Measurements from the state of Brandenburg in showed average speeds of km h mph on a lane section of autobahn in free flowing conditions br Prior to German reunification in accident reduction programs in eastern German states were primarily focused on restrictive traffic regulation Within two years of reunification the availability of high powered vehicles and a increase in motorized traffic led to a doubling of annual traffic deaths despite interim arrangements which involved the continuation of the speed limit of km h mph on autobahns and of km h mph outside cities An extensive program of the four Es enforcement education engineering and emergency response brought the number of traffic deaths back to pre unification levels after a decade of effort while traffic regulations were conformed to western standards e g km h mph freeway advisory limit km h mph on other rural roads br Many rural roads on the Isle of Man have no speed limits a proposal to introduce general speed limits of mph km h and mph km h on Mountain Road for safety reasons was not pursued following consultation Measured travel speeds on the island are relatively low br The Indian states of Andhra Pradesh Maharashtra and Telangana also do not have speed limits by default br br br Roads formerly without speed limits br Many roads without a maximum limit became permanently limited following the oil crisis For example Switzerland and Austria had no maximum restriction prior to on motorways and rural roads but imposed a temporary km h mph maximum limit in response to higher fuel prices the limit on motorways was increased to km h mph later in br br Montana and Nevada were the last remaining U S states relying exclusively on the basic rule without a specific numeric rural speed limit before the National Maximum Speed Law of After the repeal of federal speed mandates in Montana was the only state to revert to the basic rule for daylight rural speed regulation The Montana Supreme Court ruled that the basic rule was too vague to allow citation prosecution and conviction of a driver concluding enforcement was a violation of the due process requirement of the Montana Constitution In response Montana s legislature imposed a mph km h limit on rural freeways in br Australia s Northern Territory had no rural speed limit until and again from to Sections of the Stuart Highway had no limits as part of an open speed limit trial br br br Method br Several methods exist to set up a speed limit br br Engineering br Harm minimization br Economic optimization br Expert system br For instance the Injury Minimization known as Safe System method takes into account the crash types that are likely to occur the impact forces that result and the tolerance of the human body to withstand these forces to set speed limit This method is used in countries such as the Netherlands and Sweden br The Operating speed method sets the maximum speed at or around the th percentile speed This reduces the need to enforce the speed limit but also allows drivers to fail to select the appropriate travel speed when they misjudge the risk their environment induces This is one method used in the United States of America br br br Enforcement br br Speed limit enforcement is the action taken by appropriately empowered authorities to check that road vehicles are complying with the speed limit Methods used include roadside speed monitoring set up and operated by the police and automated roadside speed camera systems which may incorporate the use of an automatic number plate recognition system br In in the UK of drivers did not comply with speed limits br In Europe between and of European drivers have been fined for excessive speed br In in Europe of people supported the idea of setting up speed limiting devices with adequate tolerance levels in order to limit driver confusion One efficient scheme consists of penalty points and charges for speeding slightly over the speed limit br Another possibility is to alter the roadway by implementing traffic calming measures vehicle activated signs or safety cameras br The city of Munich has adopted self explaining roads roadway widths intersection controls and crossing types have been harmonized so that drivers assume the speed limit without a posted sign br br br Effectiveness br br br Compliance br Speed limits are more likely to be complied with if drivers have an expectation that the speed limits will be consistently enforced br To be effective and abided by the speed limits need to be perceived as credible they should be reasonable regarding factors such as how well the driver can see ahead and to the sides on a particular road Speed limits also need to conform to road infrastructure education and enforcement activity br br In the UK in the average free flow speed for each vehicle type is correlated with the applicable speed limit for that br road type and for motorways and national speed limit single carriageway roads the average free flow speed is below br the designated speed limit for each vehicle type except motorcycles on motorways br br br Relationship with crash frequency br A US Federal Highway Administration report cited a number of studies regarding the effects of reductions in speed limits and the observed changes in speeding fatalities injuries and property damage which followed Some states increase penalties for more serious offenses by designating as reckless driving speeds greatly exceeding the maximum limit br A OECD ITF case study established a strong relationship between speed and crash frequency when the mean speed decreases the number of crashes and casualties decreases to the contrary when speed increases the number of crashes and casualties increases In no case was an increase in mean speed associated with a decrease in the number of crashes or casualties br br South Dakota increased its maximum speed limit from to mph to km h in Annual surveys of speed on South Dakota Interstate roads show that from to the average speed rose from to mph to km h A study found that the U S states that increased speed limits in the wake of the repeal of federally mandated speed limits had a increase in fatalities br The Synthesis of Safety Research Related to Speed and Speed Limits report sponsored by the Federal Highway Administration published in found that changing speed limits on low and moderate speed roads appeared to have no significant effect on traffic speed or the number of crashes whilst on high speed roads such as freeways increased speed limits generally resulted in higher traffic speeds and more crashes The report stated that limited evidence suggests that speed limits have a positive effect on a system wide basis br Research in showed that the reduction of some mph km h United Kingdom speed limits to mph km h had achieved only a mph km h drop in speeds and no discernible reduction in accidents mph km h speed limit zones which use self enforcing traffic calming achieved average speed reductions of mph km h child pedestrian accidents were reduced by and child cyclist accidents by Zones where speeds are set at km h or mph are gaining popularity as they are found to be effective at reducing crashes and increasing community cohesion br Studies undertaken in conjunction with Australia s move from km h mph speed limits to km h mph in built up areas found that the measure was effective in reducing speed and the frequency and severity of crashes A study of the impact of the replacement of km h mph with km h mph speed limits in New South Wales Australia showed only a km h mph drop in urban areas and a km h mph drop in rural areas The report noted that widespread community compliance would require a combination of strategies including traffic calming treatments Information campaigns are also used by authorities to bolster support for speed limits for example the Speeding No one thinks big of you campaign in Australia in br br br Justification br Speed limits are set primarily to balance road traffic safety concerns with the effect on travel time and mobility Speed limits are also sometimes used to reduce consumption of fuel or in response to environmental concerns e g to reduce vehicle emissions or fuel use Some speed limits have also been initiated to reduce gas oil imports during the oil crisis br br br Road traffic safety br br According to a report from the World Health Organization of all injury mortality worldwide was from road traffic injuries in and without increased efforts and new initiatives casualty rates would increase by between and The report identified that the speed of vehicles was at the core of the problem and recommended that speed limits be set appropriately for the road function and design along with the implementation of physical measures related to the road and the vehicle and increased effective enforcement by the police Road incidents are said to be the leading cause of deaths among children years of age children die a year million are injured br Maximum speed limits place an upper limit on speed choice and if obeyed can reduce the differences in vehicle speeds by drivers using the same road at the same time Traffic engineers observe that the likelihood of a crash happening is significantly higher if vehicles are traveling at speeds faster or slower than the mean speed of traffic when severity is taken into account the risk is lowest for those traveling at or below the median speed and increases exponentially for motorists travelling much faster br br It is desirable to attempt to reduce the speed of road vehicles in some circumstances because the kinetic energy involved in a motor vehicle collision is proportional to the square of the speed at impact The probability of a fatality is for typical collision speeds empirically correlated to the fourth power of the speed difference depending on the type of collision not necessarily the same as travel speed at impact rising much faster than kinetic energy br br Kinetic energy br br br br br br E br

frac v right br br br Typically motorways have higher speed limits than conventional roads because motorways have features which decrease the likelihood of collisions and the severity of impacts For example motorways separate opposing traffic and crossing traffic employ traffic barriers and prohibit the most vulnerable users such as pedestrians and bicyclists Germany s crash experience illustrates the relative effectiveness of these strategies on crash severity on autobahns people died per injury crashes a lower rate than the deaths per injury accidents on conventional rural roads However the rural risk is five times higher than on urban roads speeds are higher on rural roads and autobahns than urban roads increasing the severity potential of a crash The net effect of speed crash probability and impact mitigation strategies may be measured by the rate of deaths per billion travel kilometres the autobahn fatality rate is deaths per billion travel kilometres lower than either the rates on rural roads or the rate in urban areas The overall national fatality rate was slightly higher than urban rate and more than twice that of autobahns br The technical report An Analysis of Speeding Related Crashes Definitions and the Effects of Road Environments by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration showed that about of all speeding related crashes when fatal listed exceeding posted speed limits among their crash factors and had driving too fast for conditions among their crash factors However the authors of the report did not attempt to determine whether the factors were a crash cause contributor or an unrelated factor Furthermore separate research finds that only of crashes are caused by drivers that exceed the posted speed limit Finally exceeding the posted limit may not be a remarkable factor in the crash analysis as there are roadways where virtually all motorists are in technical violation of the law br The speed limit will also take note of the speed at which the road was designed to be driven the design speed which is defined in the US as a selected speed used to determine the various geometric design features of the roadway However traffic engineers recognize that operating speeds and even posted speed limits can be higher than design speeds without necessarily compromising safety since design speed is based on conservative assumptions about driver vehicle and roadway characteristics br Vision Zero which envision reducing road fatalities and serious injuries to zero by suggests the following possible long term maximum travel speeds related to the infrastructure given best practice in vehicle design and restraint use br br Roads with no possibility of a side impact or frontal impact are sometimes designated as Type motorways freeways Autobahns Type roads or Type roads These roadways have crash barriers separating opposing traffic limited access grade separation and prohibitions on slower and more vulnerable road users Undivided rural roads can be quite dangerous even with speed limits that appear low by comparison For example in Germany s km h mph limited rural roads had a fatality rate of deaths per billion travel km over four times higher than the autobahn rate of deaths Autobahns accounted for of German road travel in but just of of traffic deaths br In an IRTAD WG published a document which recommended maximum speed limits taking into account forces the human body can tolerate and survive br br br Fuel efficiency br Fuel efficiency sometimes affects speed limit selection The United States instituted a National Maximum Speed Law of mph km h as part of the Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act in response to the oil crisis to reduce fuel consumption According to a report published in by The Heritage Foundation a Conservative advocacy group the law was widely disregarded by motorists and hardly reduced consumption at all In the American Trucking Associations called for a mph km h speed limit and also national fuel economy standards claiming that the lower speed limit was not effective at saving fuel br br br Environmental considerations br Speed limits can also be used to improve local air quality issues or other factors affecting environmental quality e g the environmental speed limits in an area of Texas The European Union is also increasingly using speed limits as in response to environmental concerns br European studies have stated that whereas the effects of specific speed reduction schemes on particulate emissions from trucks are ambiguous lower maximums speed for trucks consistently result in lower emissions of CO and better fuel efficiency br br br Advocacy br Speed limits and especially some of the methods used to attempt to enforce them have always been controversial A variety of organisations and individuals either oppose or support the use of speed limits and their enforcement br br br Opposition br Speed limits and their enforcement have been opposed by various groups and for various reasons since their inception In the UK the Motorists Mutual Association est was formed initially to warn members about speed traps the organisation would go on to become the AA br More recently advocacy groups seek to have certain speed limits as well as other measures removed For example automated camera enforcement has been criticised by motoring advocacy groups including the Association of British Drivers and the German Auto Club ADAC br Arguments used by those advocating a relaxation of speed limits or their removal include br br A peer reviewed paper by Charles A Lave et al titled Did the mph Speed Limit Save Lives which states as evidence that a higher speed limit may create a positive shift in traffic to designated safer roads br A report in the Wall Street Journal titled Highways are safe at any speed stating when speed limits are set artificially low tailgating weaving and speed variance the problem of some cars traveling significantly faster than others make roads less safe br A ePetition to the UK government calling for speed cameras to be scrapped on the basis that the benefits were exaggerated and that they may actually increase casualty levels conducted by Safe Speed a UK advocacy organisation campaigning for higher speed limits which received over signatures br A declaration by the German Automobile Manufacturer s Association calling general limits patronizing arguing instead for variable speed limits The Association also stated that raising the speed limits in Denmark in from to km h to mph and Italy increase on six lane highways from to km h to mph had no negative impact on traffic safety The number of accidental deaths even declined br In a ADAC report it was said that an autobahn speed limit was unnecessary because numerous countries with a general highway speed limit had worse safety records than Germany However more recent data show that Germany ranks in the lower middle field in a Europe wide comparison regarding the number of fatalities per billion vehicle kilometers traveled on motorways ETSC considers that those data are not comparable because estimations of the number of kilometers traveled are not estimated the same way in different countries Since the ADAC is nicht mehr grunds tzlich no longer in principle against a speed limit on autobahns br br br Support br Various other advocacy groups press for stricter limits and better enforcement The Pedestrians Association was formed in the United Kingdom in to protect the interests of the pedestrian Their president published a critique of motoring legislation and the influence of motoring groups in titled Murder most foul which laid out in an emotional but detailed view of the situation as they saw it calling for tighter speed limits Historically the Pedestrians Association and the Automobile Association were described as bitterly opposed in the early years of United Kingdom motoring legislation More recently organisations such as RoadPeace Twenty is Plenty and Vision Zero have campaigned for lower speed limits in residential areas In the United States advocacy groups favoring stricter limits and better enforcement include the Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the National Safety Council br br br Signage br br Most countries worldwide measure speed limits in kilometres per hour while the United Kingdom United States and several smaller countries measure speed limits in miles per hour instead Signs in Samoa display both units simultaneously br There are two basic designs for speed limit signs the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals specifies a white or yellow circle with a red border while the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices MUTCD published by the United States Federal Highway Administration specifies a white rectangle with the legend SPEED LIMIT Vienna style speed limit signs originated in Europe and are used in most of the world including many countries that otherwise follow the MUTCD Variations on the MUTCD design are used in Canada Guam Liberia Puerto Rico the mainland United States the U S Virgin Islands Australia also used a variation on the MUTCD design until the country metricated in The Central American Integration System SICA equivalent to the US MUTCD specifies a variation on the MUTCD design as an option though not widely used br In the United States Canada Australia and Peru speed limit signs are rectangular In most of the United States speed limit signs bear the words SPEED LIMIT above the numeric speed limit as specified in the MUTCD However in Alaska and California speed limits are often labeled MAXIMUM SPEED instead In Oregon most speed limit signs are simply labeled SPEED Canada has similar signs bearing the legend MAXIMUM which has a similar meaning in English and French the country s two main languages Peru uses a similar reversed variation of the MUTCD order in which the words VELOCIDAD MAXIMA speed limit are placed below the numeric limit Australia uses the same rectangular design but inscribes the numeric speed limit within a red circle as in Vienna Convention signs The MUTCD formerly specified an optional metric design that included the words SPEED LIMIT and the numeric limit inscribed within a black circle though it was rarely used in the United States this design is still occasionally found in Liberia Speed limit signs of Mexico and Panama are square unlike the United States br In the European Union large signposts showing the national maximum speed limits of the respective country are usually erected immediately after border crossings with a repeater sign some to m to ft after the first Some places provide an additional speed zone ahead ahead of the restriction and speed limit reminder signs may appear at regular intervals which may be painted on the road surface br In Ontario the type location and frequency of speed limit signs are covered by regulation of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act br br br Maximum speed limit br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br

to mark where a speed zone ends The speed limit beyond the sign is the prevailing limit for the general area for example the sign might be used to show the end of an urban area In the United Kingdom the sign means that the national speed limit applies mph km h on open roads and mph km h on dual carriageways and motorways In New Zealand it means you are on an open road but the maximum legal speed of km h mph still applies On roads without general speed limits such as the German Autobahn a portion of the Stuart Highway and rural areas on the Isle of Man it means the end of all quantitative

in vehicle systems that support drivers compliance with the speed limit known as intelligent speed adaptation ISA ISA supports drivers in complying with the speed limit in various parts of the network while speed limiters for heavy goods vehicles and coaches only govern the maximum speed These systems have positive effects on speed behaviour and improve safety A speed limiting device such as ISA are considered useful by of European car drivers In Google Maps integrated alerts for speed traps within its application along with audible alerts for nearby speed cameras The technology was first
