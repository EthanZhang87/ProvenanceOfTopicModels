id: 3314237
The Stanley Cup Finals in ice hockey also known as the Stanley Cup Final among various media French Finale de la Coupe Stanley is the National Hockey League s NHL annual championship series The winner is awarded the Stanley Cup North America s oldest professional sports trophy and one of the most important championships available to the sport of ice hockey according to the International Ice Hockey Federation br Originally inscribed the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup the trophy was donated in by Lord Stanley of Preston then Governor General of Canada initially as a challenge trophy for Canada s top ranking amateur ice hockey club The champions held onto the Cup until they either lost their league title to another club or a champion from another league issued a formal challenge and defeated the reigning Cup champion in a final game to claim their win br Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in Starting in the Cup was officially held between the champion of the National Hockey Association NHA and the champion of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association PCHA After a series of league mergers and folds it became the championship trophy of the National Hockey League NHL in Starting in the championship round of the NHL s playoffs has been a best of seven series played between the champions of the Eastern and Western Conferences Since then Western champions have won times while the Eastern champions have won times br br br History br The Stanley Cup was first awarded to the Montreal Hockey Club in when the team won the AHAC season The team then had to defend its champion title both through league championships and challenge games organised by the Stanley Cup trustees Until these challenges could take place before or during a league season After the trustees ordered that challenges only take place after all league games were completed br The last challenge in was the inauguration of the first World Series of ice hockey a series between the Stanley Cup and league champion Toronto Hockey Club of the National Hockey Association NHA and the Victoria Aristocrats champions of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association PCHA The series was pre arranged between the two leagues before the season after post season exhibitions held in their previous seasons The inaugural series was to be held in the city of the NHA champion and alternate annually following the series br After the series got under way there was some concern that the series would not produce an official Stanley Cup champion The Victoria club had not formally applied to the Stanley Cup trustees to challenge for the Cup A letter arrived from the Stanley Cup trustees on March that the trustees would not let the Stanley Cup travel west because they did not consider Victoria a proper challenger as they had not verified themselves with the trustees However on March trustee William Foran stated that it was a misunderstanding PCHA president Lester Patrick had not filed a challenge because he had expected Emmett Quinn of the NHA to make all of the arrangements in his role as hockey commissioner whereas the trustees thought they were being purposely ignored The Victoria challenge was accepted Any tension was diffused as Toronto successfully defended the Cup by sweeping a best of five series in three games This began the end of the influence of the Stanley Cup trustees on the challengers and series for the Cup In March trustee William Foran wrote to NHA president Emmett Quinn that the trustees are perfectly satisfied to allow the representatives of the three pro leagues NHA PCHA and Maritime to make all arrangements each season as to the series of matches to be played for the Cup br Victoria vs Toronto br br All games played at Arena Gardens in Toronto br Part of their agreement to set up drafting and player rights ownership the NHA and PCHA agreed to have their respective champions face each other for the Cup At the same time the NHA concluded a similar agreement with the Maritime Hockey League but the MHL champions abandoned their challenge and did not challenge again From onwards the Stanley Cup championship finals alternated between the East and the West each year with alternating games played according to NHA and PCHA rules The Cup trustees agreed to this new arrangement because after the Allan Cup became the highest prize for amateur hockey teams in Canada the trustees had become dependent on the top two professional leagues to bolster the prominence of the trophy After the Portland Rosebuds an American based team joined the PCHA in the trustees issued a statement that the Cup was no longer for the best team in Canada but now for the best team in the world Two years later the Rosebuds became the first American team to play in the Stanley Cup championship finals In the Seattle Metropolitans became the first American team to win the Cup After that season the NHA dissolved and the National Hockey League NHL took its place br In the Spanish influenza epidemic forced the Montreal Canadiens and the Seattle Metropolitans to cancel their series tied at marking the first time the Stanley Cup was not awarded br The format for the Stanley Cup championship changed in with the creation of the Western Canada Hockey League WCHL Now three leagues competed for the Cup and this necessitated a semi final series between two league champions with the third having a bye directly to the finals In the PCHA and the WCHL merged to form the Western Hockey League WHL and the championship reverted to a single series After winning in the season the Victoria Cougars became the last team outside the NHL to win the Stanley Cup br The WHL folded in and most of the players moved to the NHL This left the NHL as the only league left competing for the Cup Other leagues and clubs have issued challenges but from that year forward no non NHL team has played for it leading it to become the de facto championship trophy of the NHL In the NHL reached an agreement with trustees P D Ross and Cooper Smeaton to grant control of the cup to the NHL allowing the league itself to reject challenges from other leagues that may have wished to play for the Cup A Ontario Superior Court case found that the trustees had gone against Lord Stanley s conditions in the agreement The NHL has agreed to allow other teams to play for the Cup should the league not be operating as was the case in the NHL lockout br br br Broadcasting br br The first television broadcast of the Stanley Cup Finals in Canada was in English language coverage was aired by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation CBC with Danny Gallivan calling the play by play Keith Dancy providing the colour commentary and Wes McKnight hosted The Hockey Night in Canada team of Gallivan and Dancy called the next eight finals Gallivan called his last championship series in For decades Hockey Night in Canada on CBC remained the exclusive English language broadcaster across Canada except in when a lengthy NABET strike forced coverage to be instead aired on CTV and from to when the series was split between CBC and either CTV or Global TV In the CBC telecast became a Rogers Media produced broadcast under a sub license agreement with it streaming on Rogers Media s digital platform and a simulcast on Sportsnet starting in br French language broadcasts in Canada also began in with play by play commentator Rene Lecavalier and colour commentator Jean Maurice Bailly on CBC s T l vision de Radio Canada SRC division SRC continued to be the exclusive French language broadcaster until when R seau des sports RDS took over Since under a sub license agreement with Rogers TVA has been the exclusive home of French language broadcasts in Canada br The first television broadcast in the United States was in covered by local Chicago station WGN while network broadcasts started in on NBC However national coverage on American television like the rest of the NHL season remained in a state of flux for decades From to NBC and CBS held the rights at various times but they each only covered selected games of the series It was then carried on syndication from to through the s NHL Network In the Hughes broadcast network simulcast CBC s feed before the series was moved to cable During its time on cable from to rights to the series was held at various times by USA SportsChannel America and ESPN but there was no exclusive coverage of games and thus local broadcasters could also still televise them regionally as well In Fox signed on to be the exclusive national broadcast network of selected games of the final round splitting it with ESPN This splitting of exclusive national coverage between a cable and a broadcast network was then passed to ABC and ESPN in and then NBC and Versus now NBCSN in Since the series has been rotated annually between ABC in even years and the cable channel TNT in odd years with the option for simulcasts on their respective sister cable networks or streaming platforms br br br Timeline of national broadcasters br br br Series format br br The championship series began with the interleague World Series played in one city The series alternated between a rink of the NHA and later the NHL and a rink of the PCHA and later the WCHL WHL It was not until the demise of the WHL that the final series alternated games between the two finalists home ice br The series allowed ties until As the two and later three leagues differed the series would alternate using each league s rules The PCHA continued to use seven man team play and games would alternate with six and seven man games br After the NHL became the last remaining league to compete for the Cup the trophy was then awarded to the winner of the NHL s championship playoff round This first took place in between the Boston Bruins and the Ottawa Senators which was planned to be a best of three series although the series allowed ties The series ended after four games when the Senators defeated the Bruins in the fourth game br The NHL has changed its playoff format several times since and thus the final round has not always pitted conference or division playoff champions against each other In the playoff format used from to the two teams with identical division ranking would face each other i e the first place teams played each other the second place teams play each other and likewise for the third place teams The winner of the first place series would automatically advance to the final round The winner of the second and third place series would then play each other with the winner of that series earning the other berth to the championship round br During the Original Six era the top four teams made the playoffs with the first and third place teams battling in one semifinal series while the second and fourth place teams battled in the other And from to all the playoff teams were seeded regardless of division or conference From to the NHL s final round pitted the league s two conference playoff champions In the league temporarily realigned due the COVID pandemic as a result the four playoff division champions were re seeded and played in the Semifinals with the winners of those series advancing to the finals The league then returned to the previous conference based playoff format in br
