Hockey League NHL as a member of the Atlantic Division in the Eastern Conference The club is owned by Maple Leaf Sports Entertainment a company that owns several professional sports teams in the city The Maple Leafs broadcasting rights are split between BCE Inc and Rogers Communications For the first seasons the team played its home games at the Mutual Street Arena before moving to Maple Leaf Gardens in The Maple Leafs moved to their present home Scotiabank Arena originally named Air Canada Centre in February br The club was founded in operating simply as Toronto and known then as the Toronto Arenas Under new ownership the team was renamed the Toronto St Patricks in In the franchise was purchased by Conn Smythe and renamed the Maple Leafs A member of the Original Six the club was one of six NHL teams to have endured the period of League retrenchment during the Great Depression The club has won Stanley Cup championships second only to the championships of the Montreal Canadiens The Maple Leafs history includes two recognized dynasties from to and from to Winning their last championship in the season the Maple Leafs season drought between championships is the longest drought in league history The Maple Leafs have developed rivalries with five NHL franchises the Boston Bruins Buffalo Sabres Detroit Red Wings the Montreal Canadiens and the Ottawa Senators br The Maple Leafs have retired the use of numbers in honour of players including the first in professional sports In addition several individuals who hold an association with the club have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame The Maple Leafs are presently affiliated with the Toronto Marlies of the American Hockey League AHL br br br Team history br br br Early years br The National Hockey League was formed in in Montreal by teams formerly belonging to the National Hockey Association NHA that had a dispute with Eddie Livingstone owner of the Toronto Blueshirts The owners of the other four clubs the Montreal Canadiens Montreal Wanderers Quebec Bulldogs and the Ottawa Senators wanted to replace Livingstone but discovered that the NHA constitution did not allow them to simply vote him out of the league Instead they opted to create a new league the NHL and did not invite Livingstone to join them They also remained voting members of the NHA and thus had enough votes to suspend the other league s operations effectively leaving Livingstone s league with one team br The NHL had decided that it would operate a four team circuit made up of the Canadiens Montreal Maroons Ottawa and one more club in either Quebec City or Toronto Toronto s inclusion in the NHL s inaugural season was formally announced on November with concerns over the Bulldogs financial stability surfacing The League granted temporary franchise rights to the Arena Company owners of the Arena Gardens The NHL granted the Arena responsibility of the Toronto franchise for only the inaugural season with specific instructions to resolve the dispute with Livingstone or transfer ownership of the Toronto franchise back to the League at the end of the season br br The franchise did not have an official name but was informally called the Blueshirts or the Torontos by the fans and press Although the inaugural roster was made up of players leased from the NHA s Toronto Blueshirts including Harry Cameron and Reg Noble the Maple Leafs do not claim the Blueshirts history as their own During the inaugural season the club performed the first trade in NHL history sending Sammy Hebert to the Senators in return for cash Under manager Charlie Querrie and head coach Dick Carroll the team won the Stanley Cup in the inaugural season br For the next season rather than return the Blueshirts players to Livingstone as originally promised on October the Arena Company formed the Toronto Arena Hockey Club which was readily granted full membership in the NHL The Arena Company also decided that year that only NHL teams were allowed to play at the Arena Gardens a move which effectively killed the NHA Livingstone sued to get his players back Mounting legal bills from the dispute forced the Arenas to sell some of their stars resulting in a horrendous five win season in With the company facing increasing financial difficulties and the Arenas officially eliminated from the playoffs the NHL agreed to let the team forfeit their last two games Operations halted on February with the NHL ending its season and starting the playoffs The Arenas winning percentage that season remains the worst in franchise history However the Stanley Cup Finals ended without a winner due to the worldwide flu epidemic br br The legal dispute forced the Arena Company into bankruptcy and it was forced to sell the team On December Querrie brokered the team s purchase by the owners of the St Patricks Hockey Club Percy and Fred Hambly allowing him to maintain an ownership stake in the team The new owners renamed the team the Toronto St Patricks or St Pats for short which they used until Changing the colours of the team from blue to green the club won their second Stanley Cup championship in Babe Dye scored four times in the Stanley Cup clinching victory against the Vancouver Millionaires br In the team s ownership changed again as movie theatre impresario Nathan Nathanson and mining magnate Jack Bickell purchased the shares of the Hamblys Bickell invested CA in the St Pats as a favour to his friend Querrie who needed to financially reorganize his hockey team br br br Conn Smythe era br After several financially difficult seasons the St Patricks ownership group Querrie and Nathan Nathanson seriously considered selling the team to C C Pyle for CA equivalent to in Pyle sought to move the team to Philadelphia However Toronto Varsity Blues coach Conn Smythe put together a group of his own and made a CA equivalent to in offer With the support of minority shareholder Bickell Smythe persuaded Querrie and Nathanson to accept their bid arguing that civic pride was more important than money Bickell would become team president br Smythe took control on February installing himself as governor and general manager He immediately renamed the team the Maple Leafs after the national symbol of Canada He attributed his choice of a maple leaf for the logo to his experiences as a Canadian Army officer and prisoner of war during World War I Viewing the maple leaf as a badge of courage and a reminder of home Smythe decided to give the same name to his hockey team in honour of the many Canadian soldiers who wore it However the team was not the first to use the name A Toronto minor league baseball team had used the name Toronto Maple Leafs since Although Smythe would not acquire controlling interest in the team until he would be the franchise s dominant voice for the next four decades br Initial reports were that the team s colours were to be red and white but the Leafs wore white sweaters with a green maple leaf for their first game on February On September it was announced that the Leafs had changed their colour scheme to blue and white Although Smythe later stated he chose blue because it represents the Canadian skies and white to represent snow these colours were also used on the trucks for his gravel and sand business The colour blue was also a colour historically associated with the City of Toronto The use of blue by top level Toronto based sports clubs began with the Argonaut Rowing Club in the th century later adopted by their football team the Toronto Argonauts in br br br Opening of Maple Leaf Gardens s br br By Smythe saw the need to construct a new arena viewing the Arena Gardens as a facility lacking modern amenities and seating Finding an adequate number of financiers he purchased land from the Eaton family and construction of the arena was completed in five months br The Maple Leafs debuted at their new arena Maple Leaf Gardens with a loss to the Chicago Black Hawks on November The opening ceremonies for Maple Leaf Gardens included a performance from the th Highlanders of Canada Pipe and Drums The military band has continued to perform in every subsequent season home opening game as well as other ceremonies conducted by the hockey club The debut also featured Foster Hewitt in his newly constructed press box above the ice surface where he began his famous Hockey Night in Canada radio broadcasts that eventually came to be a Saturday night tradition The press box was often called the gondola a name that emerged during the Gardens inaugural season when a General Motors advertising executive remarked how it resembled the gondola of an airship br br By the NHL season the Maple Leafs were led by the Kid Line consisting of Busher Jackson Joe Primeau and Charlie Conacher and coached by Dick Irvin The team captured their third Stanley Cup that season vanquishing the Chicago Black Hawks in the first round the Montreal Maroons in the semifinals and the New York Rangers in the finals Smythe took particular pleasure in defeating the Rangers that year He had been tapped as the Rangers first general manager and coach for their inaugural season but had been fired in a dispute with Madison Square Garden management before the season had begun br Maple Leafs star forward Ace Bailey was nearly killed in when Boston Bruins defenceman Eddie Shore checked him from behind at full speed into the boards Leafs defenceman Red Horner knocked Shore out with a punch but Bailey writhing on the ice had his career ended The Leafs held the Ace Bailey Benefit Game the NHL s first All Star Game to collect medical funds to help Bailey His jersey was retired later the same night The Leafs reached the finals five times in the next seven years but bowed out to the now disbanded Maroons in the Detroit Red Wings in Chicago in Boston in and the Rangers in After the end of the season Smythe allowed Irvin to leave the team as head coach replacing him with former Leafs captain Hap Day br br br The first dynasty s br br In the Stanley Cup Finals the Maple Leafs were down three games to none in the best of seven series against Detroit Fourth line forward Don Metz then galvanized the team to score a hat trick in game four and the game winner in game five Goalie Turk Broda shut out the Wings in game six and Sweeney Schriner scored two goals in the third period to win the seventh game completing the reverse sweep The Leafs remain the only team to have successfully performed a reverse sweep in the Stanley Cup finals Captain Syl Apps won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy that season not taking one penalty and finished his ten season career with an average of minutes seconds in penalties a season br Smythe who reenlisted in the Canadian Army at the outbreak of World War II was given leave from military duty to view the final game of the finals He arrived at the game in full military regalia Earlier at the outbreak of war Smythe arranged for many of his Maple Leafs players and staff to take army training with the Toronto Scottish Regiment Most notably the Leafs announced a large portion of their roster had enlisted including Apps and Broda who did not play on the team for several seasons due to their obligations with the Canadian Forces During this period the Leafs turned to lesser known players such as rookie goaltender Frank McCool and defenceman Babe Pratt br The Maple Leafs beat the Red Wings in the Finals They won the first three games with goaltender McCool recording consecutive shutouts However in a reversal of the finals the Red Wings won the next three games The Leafs were able to win the series winning the seventh game by the score of to prevent a complete reversal of the series played three years ago br br After the end of the war players who had enlisted were beginning to return to their teams With Apps and Broda regaining their form the Maple Leafs beat the first place Canadiens in the finals To bolster their centre depth the Leafs acquired Cy Thomas and Max Bentley in the following off season With these key additions the Leafs were able to win a second consecutive Stanley Cup sweeping the Red Wings in the finals With their victory in the Leafs moved ahead of Montreal as the team having won the most Stanley Cups in League history Apps announced his retirement following the finals with Ted Kennedy replacing him as the team s captain Under a new captaincy the Leafs managed to make it to the finals facing the Red Wings who had finished the season with the best overall record However the Leafs went on to win their third consecutive Cup sweeping the Red Wings in four games This brought the total of Detroit s playoff game losses against the Leafs to eleven The Red Wings were able to end this losing streak in the following postseason eliminating Toronto in the NHL playoffs br br br The Barilko Curse s br The Maple Leafs and Canadiens met again in the finals with five consecutive overtime games played in the series Defenceman Bill Barilko managed to score the series winning goal in overtime leaving his defensive position despite coach Joe Primeau s instructions otherwise to pick up an errant pass and score Barilko helped the club secure its fourth Stanley Cup in five years His glory was short lived as he disappeared in a plane crash near Timmins Ontario four months later The crash site was not found until a helicopter pilot discovered the plane s wreckage plane about kilometres mi north of Cochrane Ontario years later The Leafs did not win another Cup during the s with rumours swirling that the team was cursed and would not win a cup until Barilko s body was found The curse came to an end after the Leafs Stanley Cup victory which came six weeks before the discovery of the wreckage of Barilko s plane br Their victory was followed by lacklustre performances in the following seasons The team finished third in the season and was eventually swept by the Red Wings in the semi finals With the conclusion of the regular season the Leafs failed to make it to the postseason for the first time since the playoffs The Leafs poor performance may be attributed partly to a decline in their sponsored junior system including the Toronto St Michael s Majors and the Toronto Marlboros The junior system was managed by Frank J Selke until his departure to the Canadiens in In his absence the quality of players it produced declined Many who were called up to the Leafs in the early s were found to be seriously lacking in ability It was only later in the decade that the Leafs feeder clubs produced prospects that helped them become competitive again br After a two year drought from the playoffs the Maple Leafs clinched a berth after the season Under Punch Imlach their new general manager and coach the Leafs made it to the Finals losing to the Canadiens in five games Building on a successful playoff run the Leafs followed up with a second place finish in the regular season Although they advanced to their second straight Cup Finals the Leafs were again defeated by the Canadiens in four games br br br New owners and a new dynasty br br Beginning in the s the Leafs became a stronger team with Johnny Bower as the goaltender and Bob Baun Carl Brewer Tim Horton and Allan Stanley serving as the Maple Leafs defencemen To bolster their forward group during the off season Imlach traded Marc Reaume to the Red Wings for Red Kelly Originally a defenceman Kelly was asked to make the transition to the role of centre where he remained for the rest of his career Kelly helped reinforce a forward group made up of Frank Mahovlich and team captain George Armstrong The beginning of the season also saw the debut of rookies Bob Nevin and Dave Keon Keon previously played for the St Michael s Majors the Maple Leafs junior affiliate but had impressed Imlach during the Leafs training camp and joined the team for the season Despite these new additions the Leafs playoff run ended in the semifinals against the Red Wings with Armstrong Bower Kelly and others suffering from injuries br In November Smythe sold nearly all of his shares in the club s parent company Maple Leaf Gardens Limited MLGL to a partnership composed of his son Stafford Smythe and his partners newspaper baron John Bassett and Toronto Marlboros president Harold Ballard The sale price was million equivalent to in a handsome return on Smythe s original investment years earlier Initially Conn Smythe claimed that he knew nothing about his son s partners and was furious with the arrangement though it is highly unlikely he could have believed Stafford could have financed the purchase on his own However he did not stop the deal because of it Conn Smythe was given a retiring salary of per year for life an office a secretary a car with a driver and seats to home games Smythe sold his remaining shares in the company and resigned from the board of directors in March after a Muhammad Ali boxing match was scheduled for the Gardens Smythe found Ali s refusal to serve in the United States Army offensive noting that the Gardens was no place for those who want to evade conscription in their own country He had also said that because the Gardens owners agreed to host the fight they had put cash ahead of class br br Under the new ownership Toronto won another three straight Stanley Cups The team won the Stanley Cup Finals beating the defending champion Chicago Black Hawks on a goal from Dick Duff in Game During the season the Leafs finished first in the league for the first time since the season In the following playoffs the team won their second Stanley Cup of the decade The season saw certain members of the team traded With Imlach seeking to reinvigorate the slumping Leafs he made a mid season trade that sent Duff and Nevin to the Rangers for Andy Bathgate and Don McKenney The Leafs managed to make the postseason as well as the Cup finals In game six of the Cup finals Baun suffered a fractured ankle and required a stretcher to be taken off the ice He returned to play with his ankle frozen and eventually scored the game winning goal in overtime against the Red Wings The Leafs won their third consecutive Stanley Cup in a game victory Bathgate scored two goals br The two seasons after the Maple Leafs Stanley Cup victories the team saw several player departures including Bathgate and Brewer as well as several new additions including Marcel Pronovost and Terry Sawchuk During the season the team had lost games in a row sending Imlach to the hospital with a stress related illness However from the time King Clancy took over as the head coach to Imlach s return the club was on a game undefeated streak building momentum before the playoffs The Leafs made their last Cup finals in Playing against Montreal the heavy favourite for the year the Leafs managed to win with Bob Pulford scoring the double overtime winner in game three Jim Pappin scored the series winner in Game Keon was named the playoff s most valuable player and was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy br From to the Maple Leafs made it to the playoffs only once They lost several players to the expansion drafts and the team was racked with dissension because of Imlach s authoritative manner and his attempts to prevent the players from joining the newly formed Players Association Imlach s management of the team was also brought into question due to some of his decisions It was apparent that he was too loyal to aging players who had been with him since In the season Mahovlich was traded to Detroit in a deal that saw the Leafs acquire Paul Henderson and Norm Ullman The Leafs managed to return to the playoffs after the season only to be swept by the Bruins Immediately after Stafford Smythe confronted Imlach and fired him This act was not without controversy with some older players including Horton declaring that if this team doesn t want Imlach I guess it doesn t want me br The Maple Leafs completed the season out of the playoffs With their low finish the Leafs were able to draft Darryl Sittler at the NHL Amateur Draft The Leafs returned to the playoffs after the season with the addition of Sittler as well as Bernie Parent and Jacques Plante who were both acquired through trades during the season They were eliminated in the first round against the Rangers br br br The Ballard years br br A series of events in made Harold Ballard the primary owner of the Maple Leafs After a series of disputes between Bassett Ballard and Stafford Smythe Bassett sold his stake in the company to them Shortly afterwards Smythe died in October Under the terms of Stafford s will of which Ballard was an executor each partner was allowed to buy the other s shares upon their death Stafford s brother and son tried to keep the shares in the family but in February Ballard bought all of Stafford s shares for million valuing the company at million equivalent to in Six months later Ballard was convicted of charges including fraud and theft of money and goods and spent a year at Milhaven Penitentiary br By the end of the World Hockey Association WHA began operations as a direct competitor to the NHL Believing the WHA would not be able to compete against the NHL Ballard s attitude caused the Maple Leafs to lose key players including Parent to the upstart league Undermanned and demoralized the Leafs finished with the fourth worst record for the season They got the fourth overall pick in the NHL Amateur Draft and drafted Lanny McDonald General Manager Jim Gregory also acquired the th overall pick from the Philadelphia Flyers and the th overall pick from the Bruins using them to acquire Bob Neely and Ian Turnbull In addition to these first round picks the Leafs also acquired Borje Salming during the off season br Despite acquiring Tiger Williams in the draft and Roger Neilson as head coach in the season the Maple Leafs found themselves eliminated in the playoffs by stronger Flyers or Canadiens teams from to Although Neilson was a popular coach with fans and his players he found himself at odds with Ballard who fired him late in the season Nielson was later reinstated after appeals from the players and the public He continued as Leafs head coach until after the playoffs when he was fired again alongside Gregory Gregory was replaced by Imlach as general manager br In the first year of his second stint as general manager Imlach became embroiled in a dispute with Leafs captain Darryl Sittler over his attempt to take part in the Showdown series for Hockey Night in Canada In a move to undermine Sittler s influence on the team Imlach traded McDonald who was Sittler s friend By the end of the season Imlach had traded away nearly half of the roster he had at the beginning of his tenure as general manager With the situation between Ballard and Sittler worsening Sittler asked to be traded Forcing the Leafs hand the club s new general manager Gerry McNamara traded Sittler to the Flyers on January Rick Vaive was named the team s captain shortly after Sittler s departure br The Maple Leafs management continued in disarray throughout most of the decade with an inexperienced McNamara named as Imlach s replacement in September He was followed by Gord Stellick on April who was replaced by Floyd Smith on August Coaching was similarly shuffled often after Nielson s departure Imlach s first choice for coach was his former player Smith although he did not finish the season after being hospitalized by a car accident on March Joe Crozier was named the new head coach until January when he was succeeded by Mike Nykoluk Nykoluk was head coach until April Dan Maloney returned as head coach from to with John Brophy named head coach from to Both coaches had little success during their tenure Doug Carpenter was named the new head coach to begin the season when the Leafs posted their first season above in the decade br The team did not have much success during the decade missing the playoffs entirely in and On at least two occasions they made the playoffs with the worst winning percentages on record for a playoff team However in those days the top four teams in each division made the playoffs regardless of record Since the Norris only had five teams in total this meant only the last place team in the division missed the postseason In for instance they finished with a winning percentage the fourth worst in the league However due to playing in a Norris Division where no team cracked the point mark the Leafs still made the playoffs because Detroit had the worst record in the league In they entered the final day of the season with the worst record in the league but were only one point behind the Minnesota North Stars and thus were still in playoff contention The Red Wings was the only team in the division with a winning record However the Leafs upset the Red Wings in their final game while the North Stars lost to the Flames hours later to hand the Leafs the final spot from the Norris br The low finishes allowed the team to draft Wendel Clark first overall at the NHL Entry Draft Clark managed to lead the Leafs to the playoffs from to as well as the playoffs Ballard died on April br br br Resurgence br br Don Crump Don Giffin and Steve Stavro were named executors of Ballard s estate Stavro succeeded Ballard as chairman of Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd and governor of the Maple Leafs Cliff Fletcher was hired by Giffin to be the new general manager although this was opposed by Stavro who told Fletcher that he wanted to appoint his own general manager br Notwithstanding Stavro s initial reluctance with Fletcher s appointment the Leafs new ownership would soon earn a reputation for steering clear of exerting undue interference in hockey operations in stark contrast to Ballard Fletcher soon set about building a competitive club hiring Pat Burns as the new coach and making a series of trades and free agent acquisitions such as acquiring Doug Gilmour and Dave Andreychuk which turned the Leafs into a contender Assisted by stellar goaltending from minor league call up Felix Potvin the team posted a then franchise record points br Toronto dispatched the Detroit Red Wings in seven games in the first round then defeated the St Louis Blues in another seven games in the Division Finals Hoping to meet long time rival Montreal who was playing in the Wales Conference finals against the New York Islanders in the Cup finals the Leafs faced the Los Angeles Kings in the Campbell Conference finals They led the series but dropped game six in Los Angeles The game was not without controversy as Wayne Gretzky clipped Gilmour in the face with his stick but referee Kerry Fraser did not call a penalty and Gretzky scored the winning goal moments later The Leafs eventually lost in game seven br br The Leafs had another strong season in starting the season on a game winning streak and finishing it with points The team made it to the conference finals again only to be eliminated by the Vancouver Canucks in five games At the NHL Entry Draft the Leafs packaged Wendel Clark in a multi player trade with the Quebec Nordiques that landed them Mats Sundin Missing two consecutive playoffs in and the Leafs relieved Fletcher as general manager br br br New home and a new millennium br On February MLGL purchased the Toronto Raptors a National Basketball Association franchise and the arena the Raptors were building from Allan

Devils in the second round In the playoffs the Leafs dispatched the Islanders and the Senators in seven games each during the first two rounds only to lose to the Cinderella story Carolina Hurricanes in six games in the Conference Finals The season was particularly impressive in that injuries sidelined many of the Leafs better players but the efforts of depth players including Alyn McCauley Gary Roberts and Darcy Tucker led them to the Conference Finals br As Joseph opted to become a free agent during the off season the Leafs signed Ed Belfour as the new starting goaltender Belfour played well during the season and was a finalist for the Vezina Trophy The Leafs lost to Philadelphia in seven games during the first round of the playoffs In an ownership change occurred in MLSE Stavro sold his controlling interest in MLSE to the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan OTPP and resigned his position as chairman in favour of Tanenbaum Quinn remained as head coach but was replaced as general manager by John Ferguson Jr br Before the season the team held their training camp in Sweden and played in the NHL Challenge against teams from Sweden and Finland The Leafs went on to enjoy a very successful

final games led by goaltender Jean Sebastien Aubin Toronto was out of playoff contention for the first time since This marked the first time the team had missed the postseason under Quinn who was later relieved as head coach Quinn s dismissal was controversial since many of the young players who were key contributors to the Leafs late season run had been drafted by him before Ferguson s

would be cruel and unusual punishment to let Ron coach another game in the Air Canada Centre In the season fans threw Leafs jerseys onto the ice to show their disapproval of the team s poor performances in the past few decades Similarly during the later portion of the season which overlaps with the start of Major League Baseball s regular season of play fans were heard sarcastically chanting Let s go Blue Jays and clapping alongside the chant as a sign of their farcical shift in priority from an under performing team to the more successful playoff bound Toronto Blue Jays season Leafs fans also vandalized Mike Babcock s Wikipedia article amid the poor records of the first few months into the season his article was temporarily semi protected to minimize further vandalism br In addition to the Greater Toronto Area GTA many fans live throughout Ontario including the Ottawa Valley the Niagara Region and Southwestern Ontario As a result Leafs away games at the Canadian Tire Centre in Ottawa KeyBank Center in Buffalo and Little Caesars Arena in Detroit host a more neutral attendance This is due in part to the Leafs fans in those areas and those cities proximity to the GTA br The Leafs are also a popular team in Atlantic Canada In November a survey was conducted that found percent of respondents from Atlantic Canada viewed the Leafs as their favourite team second only to the Montreal Canadiens at percent The Leafs were found to be the most favoured team in Prince Edward Island with percent of respondents favouring the Leafs and the second favourite team in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador and percent respectively both trailing respondents who favoured the Canadiens by one percent br br br Rivalries br br During the years of the Original Six era teams played each other times during the regular season and with only four teams continuing into the playoffs rivalries were intense The Maple Leafs established several rivalries with other teams that played in this era including the Boston Bruins Detroit Red Wings and the Montreal Canadiens In addition to the aforementioned teams the Maple Leafs have also developed a rivalry with the Ottawa Senators as well as a minor geographic rivalry with the Buffalo Sabres called the Battle of the QEW after the Queen Elizabeth Way QEW the freeway that links Buffalo with Toronto along the western edge of Lake Ontario within the Golden Horseshoe br br br Boston Bruins br br Both teams are Original Six teams with their first game played in Boston s inaugural season on December In the match up the St Patricks earned a victory against the Bruins at Mutual Street Arena The Maple Leafs played their first Stanley Cup playoff series against the Bruins in winning the series From to the two teams played in postseason series against one another including one Stanley Cup Finals br The rivalry has since been renewed from the Stanley Cup playoffs which saw the Bruins rally from a third period deficit to defeat the Maple Leafs in overtime and advance to the second round In the and Stanley Cup playoffs the Bruins would again defeat the Maple Leafs in seven games in all three of those years br br br Detroit Red Wings br br The Detroit Red Wings and the Maple Leafs are both Original Six teams playing their first game together in From to the teams met each other in the playoff series as well as seven Stanley Cup Finals Meeting one another a combined times in the postseason they have played each other in more playoff series than any other two teams in NHL history except of the Bruins and Canadiens who have played a total of playoff series Overlapping fanbases particularly in markets such as Windsor Ontario and the surrounding Essex County have added to the rivalry br The rivalry between the Detroit Red Wings and the Maple Leafs was at its height during the Original Six era The Leafs and Red Wings met in the playoffs six times during the s including four Stanley Cup finals The Leafs beat the Red Wings in five of their six meetings In the s the Leafs and Red Wings met one another in six Stanley Cup semifinals the Red Wings beat the Leafs in five of their six meetings From to the two teams met one another in three playoff series including two Stanley Cup finals Within those years the Leafs and Red Wings played a total of playoff series including six Cup Finals the Maple Leafs beat the Red Wings in all six Cup Finals br The teams have only met three times in the playoffs since the Original Six era with their last meeting in After the Leafs moved to the Eastern Conference in they faced each other less often and the rivalry began to stagnate The rivalry became intradivisional once again in when Detroit was moved to the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference as part of a realignment br br br Montreal Canadiens br br The rivalry between the Montreal Canadiens and the Maple Leafs is the oldest in the NHL featuring two clubs that were active since the inaugural NHL season in In the early th century the rivalry was an embodiment of a larger culture war between English Canada and French Canada The Canadiens have won Stanley Cups while the Maple Leafs have won ranking them first and second for most Cup wins respectively br br The height of the rivalry was during the s when the Canadiens and Leafs combined to win all but one Cup The two clubs had playoff meetings However the rivalry has waned with the two having not met in the postseason from to It also suffered when Montreal and Toronto were placed in opposite conferences in with the Leafs in the Clarence Campbell Western Conference and the Canadiens in the Prince of Wales Eastern Conference The rivalry became intradivisional once again in when the Leafs were moved into the Eastern Conference s Northeast Division br The rivalry s cultural imprint may be seen in literature and art The rivalry from the perspective of the Canadiens fan is captured in the popular Canadian short story The Hockey Sweater by Roch Carrier Originally published in French as Une abominable feuille d rable sur la glace An abominable maple leaf on the ice it referred to the Maple Leafs sweater a mother forced her son to wear The son is presumably based on Carrier himself when he was young This rivalry is also evident in Toronto s College subway station which displays murals depicting the two teams one on each platform the Leafs mural being on the southbound platform given that when the murals were installed in the station was the closest to the Leafs then home of Maple Leaf Gardens br br br Ottawa Senators br br The modern Ottawa Senators entered the NHL in but the rivalry between the two teams did not begin to emerge until the late s From to Ottawa and Toronto played in different conferences Prince of Wales Eastern and Clarence Campbell Western respectively which meant they rarely played each other However before the season the conferences and divisions were realigned with Toronto moved to the Eastern Conference s Northeast Division with Ottawa From to the teams played four postseason series the Leafs won all four playoff series Due in part to the number of Leafs fans living in the Ottawa Valley and in part to Ottawa s relative proximity to Toronto Leafs Senators games at the Canadian Tire Centre in Ottawa hold a more neutral audience br br br Team operations br br br Branding br br br Logo and uniform br br The team is represented through several images and symbols including the maple leaf logo found on the club s uniform The Maple Leafs jersey has a long history and is one of the best selling NHL jerseys among fans The club s uniforms have been altered several times The club s first uniforms were blue and featured the letter T The first major alteration came in when the club was renamed the St Patricks The uniforms were green with Toronto St Pats on the logo lettered in green either on a white pill shape or stripes br When the club was renamed the Maple Leafs in the season the logo was changed and the team reverted to blue uniforms The logo was a point maple leaf with the words lettered in white The home jersey was blue with alternating thin thick stripes on the arms legs and shoulders The road uniform was white with three stripes on the chest and back waist and legs For the alternating thin thick stripes were replaced with stripes of equal thickness This remained the basic design for the next years In veins were added to the leaf and Toronto curved downwards at the ends instead of upwards In the point leaf was introduced In the logo added trimming to the leaf with a white or blue border while C for captain and A for alternate captain first appeared on the sweaters In the Toronto Maple Leafs lettering was in

the early Leafs sweaters Before the season the Leafs adopted a new point leaf logo with a Kabel bold font Toronto going straight across running parallel to the other words Other changes to the sweater included the replacement of the arm strips with an elongated yoke that extended to the ends of the sleeves a solid single stripe on the waist replacing the three waistline stripes two stripes on the stockings and a smaller textless Leaf crest on the shoulders In the jersey s neck was a lace tie down design before the V neck returned in In the NHL rules were changed to require names on the backs of the uniforms but Harold Ballard resisted the change Under Ballard s direction the team briefly complied with the rule by placing blue letters on the blue road jersey for a game on February With the NHL threatening hefty fines for failing to comply with the spirit of the rule namely having the names be legible for the fans and broadcasters in attendance Ballard reached a compromise with the league allowing the Leafs to finish the season with contrasting white letters on the road sweaters and coming into full compliance with the new rule in the season by adding names in blue to the white home sweaters br With the NHL s th anniversary season season the Leafs wore Original Six style uniforms similar to the designs used in the s Because of the fan reaction to the previous season s

CCM returned to manufacturing the Leafs uniforms in when Nike withdrew from the hockey jersey market and kept most of the changes although in the Kabel numbers were replaced with block numbers outlined in silver and a silver outlined interlocked TML monogram replaced the vintage leaf on the shoulders Also during this time the Leafs began wearing a white s style throwback third jersey featuring the outlined point leaf blue shoulders and lace up collar br With Reebok taking over the NHL jersey contract following the lock out changes were expected when the Edge uniform system was set to debut in As part of the Edge overhaul the TML monograms were removed from the shoulders and the silver outlines on the numbers were replaced with blue or white outlines e g the blue home jersey featured white numbers with blue and white outlines rather than blue and silver and the waistline stripes were removed In the two waistline stripes were restored the vintage leaf returned to the shoulders and the player names and numbers were changed again reverting to a simpler single colour block font Finally lace up collars were brought back to the primary uniforms The Leafs also brought back the blue uniform replacing the white s jersey as their third uniform For the NHL Winter Classic the Leafs wore a sweater inspired by their earlier uniforms in the s br On February the team unveiled a new logo for the season in honour of its centennial dropping the use of the Kabel style font lettering used from it returns the logo to a form inspired by the earlier designs with points to

percent interest in the company together and thus decisions on the management of the company must be made by consensus between the two A portion of Bell s share in MLSE is owned by its pension fund to make Bell s share in MLSE under percent This was done so that Bell could retain its existing percent interest in the Montreal Canadiens as NHL s conflict of interest rules prevent any shareholder that
