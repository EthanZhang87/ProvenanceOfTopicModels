id: 18599942
The expansion era of the National Hockey League NHL began when six new teams were added for the season ending the Original Six era The six existing teams were grouped into the newly created East Division and the expansion teams the Los Angeles Kings Minnesota North Stars Oakland Seals Philadelphia Flyers Pittsburgh Penguins and St Louis Blues formed the West Division br The NHL added another six teams by to bring the league to teams This continued expansion was partially brought about by the creation of the World Hockey Association WHA which operated from until and sought to compete with the NHL for markets and players Bobby Hull was the most famous player to defect to the rival league signing a million contract with the Winnipeg Jets When the WHA ceased operations in the NHL absorbed four of the league s teams the Edmonton Oilers Hartford Whalers Quebec Nordiques and Winnipeg Jets This brought the NHL to teams the Cleveland Barons had ceased operations in a figure that remained constant until the San Jose Sharks joined as an expansion franchise in br The NHL became involved in international play starting with the Summit Series in which pitted the top Canadian players of the NHL against the top players of the Soviet Union Canada won the eight game series four wins to three with one tie The success of the series led to the creation of the Canada Cup held five times between and NHL teams also faced Soviet League teams that toured North America between and in what was known as the Super Series The fall of the Iron Curtain in saw many former Soviet Bloc players stream into the NHL joining several players who had defected in the s br This was the highest scoring period in NHL history It was led in the s by the Edmonton Oilers and Wayne Gretzky who scored points or more four times including a current league record in Gretzky s goals in also remains a league record No other player in NHL history has scored points although Mario Lemieux came close in with br br br Background br Expansion had been a major topic of discussion among NHL owners since when William M Jennings of the New York Rangers proposed adding two new teams on the West Coast to counter fears that the Western Hockey League intended to compete as a major league After several years of discussion the NHL announced in February that it would expand by six teams doubling the league s size The Los Angeles Kings Minnesota North Stars California Seals Philadelphia Flyers Pittsburgh Penguins and St Louis Blues began play in the season They formed the newly created West Division and the existing teams were grouped into the East Division The playoff format was constructed so that an established team would face an expansion team in the Stanley Cup Finals The Clarence S Campbell Bowl was created in honour of league president Clarence Campbell and was awarded to the West Division champion br The new teams were stocked by the NHL s first expansion draft as each team selected players from the existing franchises There was much debate over how many players each existing team could protect the strongest clubs wished to protect more players while the weaker clubs hoped that protecting fewer players would help improve the balance of competition Montreal Canadiens manager Sam Pollock s suggestion to allow each team to protect eleven players to start then add an additional player to their protected list for each player selected in the draft was ultimately agreed to as a compromise solution In addition an intra league draft was held following the and seasons to help accelerate the improvement of the expansion teams Each team protected two goaltenders and fourteen skaters leaving their remaining players open to be selected by any other team br Some teams created instant farm systems by buying existing minor league franchises The Kings bought the Springfield Indians of the American Hockey League the night before the expansion draft leading the Flyers to purchase the Quebec Aces Expansion also changed how the amateur draft was handled The old system in which franchises sponsored junior teams and players was abandoned by when all junior aged players were made eligible for the entry draft br br br Expansion years br In their inaugural season the Flyers finished atop the West Division recording points in games The California Seals a pre season favourite to win the division changed their name to the Oakland Seals a month into the season The team disappointed both on the ice and at the gate finishing last in the NHL with wins The Blues defeated the Flyers and North Stars to become the first expansion team to play for the Stanley Cup where they were defeated in four consecutive games by the Canadiens The Blues reached the finals again in both and but were similarly swept in both years losing to the Canadiens and Boston Bruins respectively br On January North Stars rookie Bill Masterton became the first and to date only player to die as a result of injuries suffered during an NHL game Early in a game against the Seals Masterton was checked hard by two players Ron Harris and Larry Cahan causing him to flip over backwards and land on his head He was rushed to hospital with massive head injuries and died there two days later The National Hockey League Writers Association presented the league with the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy later in the season the trophy is awarded annually to the player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance sportsmanship and dedication to hockey Following Masterton s death players slowly began wearing helmets starting in the season the league mandated that all players entering the league wear them br br br Bobby Orr br br In the season second year defenceman Bobby Orr scored goals an NHL record for a defenceman en route to winning his first of eight consecutive Norris Trophies as the league s top defenceman At the same time Orr s teammate Phil Esposito became the first player in league history to score points in a season finishing with points He was one of three players to break the century mark that year including Bobby Hull and year old Gordie Howe br A gifted scorer Orr revolutionized defencemen s impact on the offensive side of the game as blue liners began to be judged on how well they created goals in addition to how well they prevented them Orr scored the Stanley Cup winning goal in overtime of the fourth game against the Blues in which gave the Bruins their first championship in years The goal was highlighted by his famous flight through the air after being tripped up following his shot Orr twice won the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL s leading scorer still the only defenceman in NHL history to do so His plus minus of in is a league record Orr signed a five year contract that paid him per season in the first million contract in league history br Chronic knee problems plagued Orr throughout his career In he tore ligaments in his left knee after a hard hit leading to the first of six knee operations He played seasons in the NHL before injuries forced his retirement in Orr finished with goals and points in games and won the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league s Most Valuable Player three times The customary three year post retirement waiting period for entry into the Hockey Hall of Fame was waived as he was enshrined in br br br Buffalo and Vancouver br In Canada there was widespread outrage over the denial of an expansion team to Vancouver in Three years later the NHL added a third Canadian team and the first in Western Canada when the Vancouver Canucks formerly of the Western Hockey League were admitted as an expansion team for the season along with the Buffalo Sabres another team whose owners had bid unsuccessfully for an expansion team in The Canucks were placed in the East Division despite being on the west coast while the Chicago Black Hawks were shifted to the West in an attempt to equalize the divisions strength br The league also gave the Sabres and Canucks the first two picks in each round of the NHL Amateur Draft offering them a better opportunity to build their rosters than the expansion teams had Buffalo s first round pick was Gilbert Perreault a future Hall of Famer who would play seventeen seasons in Buffalo br Before the season Gordie Howe and Jean Beliveau announced their retirements Beliveau finished his year career with Stanley Cups Hart Trophies and career points his points total was the second highest in NHL history After playing seasons in the NHL Howe retired as the league s all time leader in games played goals assists and points Howe was a six time league scoring champion and also won six Hart Trophies Both players had the customary three year waiting period waived for entry into the Hockey Hall of Fame in acknowledgement of their achievements br br br World Hockey Association br In the NHL faced competition from the newly formed World Hockey Association WHA The WHA lured many players away from the NHL including Derek Sanderson J C Tremblay and Ted Green The WHA s biggest coup was to lure Bobby Hull from the Black Hawks to play for the Winnipeg Jets Hull signed a year deal five years as a player for per season and five more for per season in a front office position It also included a million signing bonus The deal totaled million and lent instant credibility to the new league After Hull signed several other players quickly followed suit Bernie Parent Gerry Cheevers Johnny McKenzie and Rick Ley jumped to the WHA as the NHL suddenly found itself in a war for talent By the time the WHA season began players had switched from the NHL to the WHA Defections continued following the season and the WHA scored another major coup when it signed Gordie Howe s sons Mark and Marty The league then convinced Gordie to come out of retirement to play with them on the Houston Aeros br The NHL tried to block several of the defections The Bruins attempted to restrain Cheevers and Sanderson from joining the WHA though a United States federal court refused to prohibit the signings The Black Hawks were successful in having a restraining order filed against Hull and the Jets pending the outcome of legal action the Black Hawks were taking against the WHA The WHA was eager for the court action intending to challenge the legality of the reserve clause which bound a player to their NHL team until that team released him In November a Philadelphia district court placed an injunction against the NHL preventing it from enforcing the reserve clause and freeing all players who had restraining orders against them including Hull to play with their WHA clubs The decision effectively ended the NHL s monopoly on major league professional hockey talent br The NHL also found itself competing with the WHA for markets Initially the league had no intention to expand past teams but the threat the WHA posed changed this Hoping to keep the WHA out of the newly completed Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale New York and the Omni Coliseum in Atlanta Georgia the league hastily announced the creation of the New York Islanders and Atlanta Flames as expansion teams Following the season the NHL announced it was further expanding to teams for the season adding the Kansas City Scouts and Washington Capitals which marked the end of the league s first major expansion period In just eight years the NHL had tripled in size to teams br br br Summit Series br br Internationally Canada had long been protesting the Soviet Union s use of professional amateurs at the World Championships and the Olympic Games which were amateur events Canada withdrew from international competition in and boycotted the Olympic hockey tournament As an alternative NHL Players Association executive director Alan Eagleson negotiated a deal with Soviet authorities to hold an eight game series between the Soviet national team and Canada s top professionals br The tournament was the NHL s response to the defection of players to the WHA Bobby Hull was barred from playing as was any other player who signed a contract with the rival league which was a heavily criticized move Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau sent a telegram to NHL president Clarence Campbell expressing his intense interest which I share with millions of Canadians that Canada should be represented by its best hockey players including Bobby Hull Echoing the feelings of the public Hull called the decision crazy and stated that I m a Canadian and I want to play for my country I don t know why the NHL has to be so petty over this I want to do this for Canada The NHL did not relent br br The series was tied at three wins apiece and a tie entering the eighth and deciding game with millions of Canadians watching the game of the century With the game tied at five late in the third the Soviets were met with a concerted Canadian attack in the final seven minutes With seconds remaining in the game Esposito took a shot at Vladislav Tretiak from feet out Paul Henderson scooped up the rebound and put it past the fallen Soviet goalie to score the goal that won the game and the series Later Alexander Yakolev the former Soviet ambassador to Canada argued that the Summit Series planted the seeds of glasnost and perestroika in the Soviet Union as it was one of the first times that the Soviet people had seen so many foreigners who had not come to do harm but to share in the game br br br Legacy br The series forced the NHL and the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association to reassess all aspects of how the game was played in North America Journalist Herb Pinder described the NHL to that point in this way The Europeans took our game and evolved it while we stood still or even went backwards The Russians had a style and the Czechs style was different from that There was this hockey world evolving through international competition and we re back here stuck just playing ourselves It was a business monopoly And like any monopoly the NHL got stagnant Throughout the s and s Canadian hockey encouraged the adoption of new coaching and training methods used in Europe and emphasized conditioning and skills development br The NHL took a greater interest in international play The Canada Cup a tournament that featured the top professional players in the world was held first in and then four more times until It was succeeded by the World Cup of Hockey in Beginning in Soviet club teams began touring North America playing NHL clubs in exhibition games that were known as the Super Series The Calgary Flames and Washington Capitals similarly toured the Soviet Union in in the first Friendship Series The Soviet national team defeated an NHL all star team in a challenge series two games to one and split Rendez vous a two game series held in Quebec City br br br s br br br Broad Street Bullies br The s were associated with aggressive and often violent play Known as the Broad Street Bullies the Philadelphia Flyers are the most famous example of this style The Flyers established league records for penalty minutes Dave the Hammer Schultz s total of in remains a league record and ended up in courtrooms multiple times when players went into the stands to challenge fans who got involved One such incident occurred in Vancouver in December when a fan reached over the glass to pull the hair of Don Saleski who had a chokehold on Vancouver s Barry Wilkins Bobby Taylor and several Flyers teammates followed the fan into the stands The next time Philadelphia went to Vancouver several players were brought before the courts on charges that ranged from use of obscene language to common assault Six players were fined and Taylor received a day suspended sentence Despite these incidents the Flyers won they captured the Stanley Cup becoming the first expansion team to win the league championship and repeated as champions in br In Soviet club teams began to tour North America in the first Super Series The Canadiens played Central Red Army to a draw on New Year s Eve in a game that is considered one of the finest ever played Red Army lost only one of four games against the NHL in the first tour a defeat to Philadelphia who intimidated them as the Flyers did to their NHL opponents At one point Red Army threatened to forfeit the game after Ed Van Impe decked Valeri Kharlamov Red Army was persuaded to complete the game after Alan Eagleson threatened to withhold their appearance fee if the team did not return to the ice Super Series games continued until when Soviet players were allowed to enter the NHL after the collapse of the Soviet Union br br br End of the two league era br br On February Maple Leafs star Darryl Sittler set an NHL record scoring points in one game in an victory over the Bruins His six goal four assist effort broke Maurice Richard s record of eight points in a game The game came shortly after the Bruins lured Gerry Cheevers back from the WHA though Cheevers was given an extra night to rest and rookie Dave Reece was the victim of all Toronto goals It was his th and final NHL game br By both leagues were dealing with serious financial problems Talks of a merger between the NHL and the WHA were growing Bobby Hull declared that a merger was inevitable though WHA president Bill MacFarland stated that his league had no interest in joining with the NHL In for the first time in four decades the NHL approved franchise relocations the Scouts moved after just two years in Kansas City to Denver to become the Colorado Rockies while the California Golden Seals became the Cleveland Barons In its wake the league quietly shelved provisional expansion franchises granted to Seattle and Denver to take place in the season Two years later after failed overtures towards merging the Barons with Washington and Vancouver they merged with the Minnesota North Stars reducing the NHL to teams for br The WHA s last triumph was to lure junior prodigy Wayne Gretzky to their league in Nelson Skalbania owner of the Indianapolis Racers and part owner of the Edmonton Oilers was convinced to sign Gretzky to play for the Racers The year old Gretzky scored points in his first professional season split between the Racers and the Oilers br The move towards a merger picked up in when John Ziegler succeeded Campbell as NHL president After several years of negotiations WHA owners thought they had an agreement in March The motion to merge failed when supporters in the NHL lost by one vote Word got out that the Montreal Canadiens owned by Molson Brewery and the Vancouver Canucks who served Molson products at their games had voted against the merger Fans across Canada quickly organized a boycott of Molson products while the House of Commons unanimously passed a motion urging the NHL to reconsider Another vote was held and both Montreal and Vancouver switched their votes allowing the motion to pass The WHA folded following the season and the Edmonton Oilers New England Whalers Quebec Nordiques and Winnipeg Jets joined the NHL as expansion teams br br br Twenty one teams br br The merger brought Gordie Howe back to the NHL for one final season in At age Howe played all games for the Whalers scoring goals to bring his NHL career total to He entered his second retirement as the league s all time scoring leader with points Howe s final season was also the last for the Atlanta Flames The team averaged an attendance of only fans per game and lost over million in They were sold for a record million and relocated north to become the Calgary Flames in Two years later the Rockies were sold for million and left Denver to become the New Jersey Devils for the season br The St Louis Blues nearly relocated to Saskatoon in as Bill Hunter an original investor in the WHA announced an intention to purchase and relocate the team Hunter quickly convinced people to commit to season tickets in a proposed arena for the city The other team owners rejected the sale and relocation by a vote prompting the Blues owner Ralston Purina to file a million anti trust lawsuit against the league Both the league as a whole and the individual teams filed million counter suits against Purina As part of the conflict Purina turned the team over to the NHL at the beginning of June to operate sell or dispose of in whatever manner the league desires while the Blues refused to participate in the NHL Entry Draft forfeiting all of their draft picks By the end of July the league had sold the team to Harry Ornest who vowed the team would remain in St Louis Ralston Purina and the NHL settled their legal issues in though terms of the settlements were not released br In the New York Islanders won their first of four consecutive Stanley Cups With the likes of Billy Smith Mike Bossy Denis Potvin and Bryan Trottier the Islanders dominated both the regular season and the playoffs In Bossy became the first player to score goals in games since Maurice Richard in In the Edmonton Oilers won the regular season championship The Islanders and Oilers met in the Finals and New York swept Edmonton for their last Stanley Cup They were the second franchise to win four straight championships after the Canadiens The playoffs would be the site of the infamous Good Friday Massacre between the Quebec Nordiques and the Montreal Canadiens br The following season the Oilers and Islanders met again in the playoffs The Oilers won the rematch in five games marking the start of another dynasty Led by Wayne Gretzky and Mark Messier the Oilers won five Stanley Cup championships between and The Oilers won two consecutive Cups in the and seasons and in the and seasons They also won a Cup in the season The Oilers Cup streaks were interrupted in the and seasons by two other Canadian teams Edmonton s hopes for a third consecutive title in were dashed by their provincial rival the Calgary Flames after Oilers rookie Steve Smith accidentally bounced the series winning goal off goaltender Grant Fuhr and into his own net Smith s error remains one of the most legendary blunders in hockey history The Flames were defeated by the Canadiens in the finals as rookie goaltender Patrick Roy led Montreal to their rd Stanley Cup The final was a rematch between the Flames and the Canadiens and was won by Calgary which captured its only championship in franchise history The Flames also became the only team to defeat the Montreal Canadiens for the Stanley Cup at the Montreal Forum The league would move its headquarters from Montreal to New York City in br The team era ended in when the league revealed ambitious plans to double league revenues from million within a decade and bring the NHL to franchises during that period The NHL quickly announced three new teams the San Jose Sharks who began play in the season and the Ottawa Senators and Tampa Bay Lightning who followed a year later br The Sharks creation forestalled a unilateral franchise move by North Stars owners George and Gordon Gund to the San Francisco Bay Area A settlement with the league granted them the expansion franchise while they sold the North Stars to Howard Baldwin s group in Prior to the season the Sharks and North Stars participated in a unique expansion draft which saw San Jose select unprotected players from Minnesota including future All Star goalie Arturs Irbe before both teams picked players from the remainder of the league The Sharks would struggle in their inaugural season finishing with a league low wins and points while playing out of the Cow Palace while the North Stars who were sold again to Norman Green during the season would make the playoffs for what proved to be the final time before their eventual relocation to Dallas in br br br Wayne Gretzky br br In the latter part of the s the Oilers won five Stanley Cup titles in seven years becoming the only team to score or more goals in a season which they did four times With future Hall of Famers Grant Fuhr Paul Coffey Jari Kurri Mark Messier and Glenn Anderson they established numerous new scoring records br The Oilers were led by Wayne Gretzky who remained with the Oilers when they joined the NHL in At feet inches m and pounds kg some observers doubted that Gretzky could match his offensive performance from his lone WHA season I heard a lot of talk then that I d never get points like I did in the WHA said Gretzky He proved his critics wrong scoring points in and winning the first of nine Hart Trophies including consecutive awards from to as the NHL s most valuable player Over the next several seasons Gretzky established new highs in goals scored in a season with in the season in assists with in the and in total points with in He also scored goals in games the fastest any player had reached the total in a single season Gretzky scored his th NHL point in his th game breaking Guy Lafleur s old record of games br Gretzky s teammates set records of their own Fuhr s assists in the season set a record for most points by a goaltender in a season In Coffey set a record for the most goals in a season by a defenceman with Adding assists Coffey wound up a point short of tying Bobby Orr s record for most points in a season by a blue liner br On August Oilers owner Peter Pocklington in financial trouble traded Gretzky along with Marty McSorley and Mike Krushelnyski to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for Jimmy Carson Martin Gelinas US million and three first round draft picks Gretzky left Edmonton with a tear filled news conference and later said that Edmonton was the only place he ever dreaded playing Gretzky s trade to the Kings popularized ice hockey in the United States making hockey cool in Hollywood and shocked fans across Canada The Kings were the most popular Los Angeles sports team and Gretzky s fame rivaled that of his peers with baseball s Los Angeles Dodgers and basketball s Los Angeles Lakers br With the Kings Gretzky broke Gordie Howe s record for career points On October against his former Oilers teammates and with Howe in attendance Gretzky tied the record with a first period assist before notching his st career point with a third period goal An award such as this takes a lot of teamwork and help and both teams here today definitely have a part of the points said Gretzky br br br Fall of the Iron Curtain br br While European born players were a part of the NHL since its founding it was still rare to see them in the league until The WHA turned to the previously overlooked European market in search for talent signing players from Finland and Sweden Anders Hedberg Lars Erik Sjoberg and Ulf Nilsson signed with the Jets in and thrived in North America both in the WHA and later the NHL The Jets won three of the six remaining WHA championships after signing European players and their success sparked similar signings league wide br Borje Salming was the first European star in the NHL He signed with the Maple Leafs in and played seasons in the NHL retiring in He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in His fellow Swede Pelle Lindbergh was one of the top goaltenders in the world in the early s He led the Flyers to the Stanley Cup Finals before dying in a car accident during the season Finns Jari Kurri and Esa Tikkanen helped lead the Oilers dynasty of the s br While the WHA opened the door and players slowly joined the NHL those behind the Iron Curtain were restricted from following suit In Peter Stastny his wife and his brother Anton secretly fled Czechoslovakia with the aid of Nordiques owner Marcel Aubut The Stastnys defection made international headlines and contributed to the first wave of Eastern Europeans entrance into the NHL Hoping that they would one day be permitted to play in the NHL teams drafted Soviet players in the s in all by the draft However defection was the only way such players could join the teams that drafted them Michal Pivonka defected from Czechoslovakia in while Russian Alexander Mogilny defected following the World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Anchorage Alaska Czech teenager Petr Nedved walked into a Calgary police station in January after playing in the Mac s AAA midget hockey tournament br Shortly before the end of the regular season Flames general manager Cliff Fletcher announced that he had reached an agreement with Soviet authorities that allowed Sergei Pryakhin to play in North America It was the first time a member of the Soviet national team was permitted to play for a non Soviet team Shortly after Soviet players began to flood into the NHL Teams anticipated that there would be an influx of Soviet players in the s as Soviets were selected in the NHL Entry Draft The entire KLM line the Soviet team s top line joined the NHL in as Vladimir Krutov and Igor Larionov played for the Canucks while Sergei Makarov went to Calgary Makarov won the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year in a selection that caused controversy he was years old and had played pro seasons in the Soviet League In the wake of the controversy the NHL amended its rules players over the age of were no longer considered for the award The fall of the Berlin Wall in and the demise of the Iron Curtain paved the way for more Eastern European players to play in North America Only six European players were selected at the NHL Entry Draft That number increased to in while a record Europeans were drafted in Europeans made up of the NHL in totalling players br br br Rules and innovations br The early s saw many tie games The North Stars and Capitals both finished with ties in games while of teams tied or more games The season before the North Stars recorded ties As a result of the frequent ties the NHL reintroduced overtime for the season The effect was immediate as only seven teams had ten or more ties Before its discontinuation during World War II the NHL played a full minute overtime period The modern overtime format was set as a five minute sudden death period the game ended when either team scored br The NHL changed its divisional alignment and playoff formats numerous times as it grew The league s doubling in also led to the expansion of the playoffs to eight teams from four the previous year Expansion to teams in caused the league to realign into two conferences and four divisions each named after important figures in league history The teams were split into the Campbell Conference consisting of the Patrick and Smythe divisions and the Prince of Wales Conference consisting of the Adams and Norris divisions The playoffs were expanded to teams and each division winner was granted a bye in the first round of the playoffs The addition of the four WHA teams in saw the playoffs expanded to teams br In the league realigned all teams by geography although the historical names of the divisions remained Eastern teams played in the Adams and Patrick divisions of the Wales Conference and Western teams played in the Norris and Smythe divisions of the Campbell Conference In addition the playoff format was changed to have the top four teams in each division qualify rather than the top teams overall The first two playoff rounds were played entirely within each division This format lasted until br br br Entry Draft br During the late s the concept of sponsoring junior players and teams had been dismantled meaning that for the NHL Amateur Draft every player aged or above was eligible to be selected The Montreal Canadiens however exercised a special cultural option that allowed them to select two players of French Canadian heritage before any other players were selected These players counted as Montreal s first two choices After the Canadiens took Rejean Houle and Marc Tardif the rest of the league voted to end the rule in just before future star Gilbert Perreault was selected first in the expansion draft by the Buffalo Sabres br In Sabres general manager Punch Imlach decided to play a joke on the league during the draft He selected Taro Tsujimoto of the Tokyo Katanas with his th round pick Other teams were shocked that the Sabres had scouted for players in Japan and the league made the pick official Weeks later Imlach admitted that he made the player up choosing the name out of a phone book br The league reformatted the Amateur Draft into the NHL Entry Draft in and simultaneously lowered the draft age to It was first opened to the public in when fans attended the draft in the Montreal Forum The public draft has grown such that it is now held annually in NHL arenas and televised internationally br br br Timeline br br Notes br br The year given refers to the year in which that season began and not the year in which the Stanley Cup
