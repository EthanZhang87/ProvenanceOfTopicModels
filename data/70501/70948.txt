history br br br Quebec Nordiques br br The Quebec Nordiques were one of the World Hockey Association s WHA original teams when the league began play in Though first awarded to a group in San Francisco the team was subsequently sold and moved to Quebec City prior to the start of the league s opening During their seven WHA seasons the Nordiques won the Avco World Trophy once in and lost the finals once in In the franchise entered the NHL along with the WHA s Edmonton Oilers Hartford Whalers and Winnipeg Jets br br After making the postseason for seven consecutive years from to the Nordiques started to decline From to the team finished last in their division every season with three of those finishes landing them last in the league This included a dreadful win season in that is still the worst in franchise history As a result the team earned three consecutive first overall draft picks used to select Mats Sundin Owen Nolan and Eric Lindros Lindros made it clear he did not wish to play for the Nordiques to the extent he did not wear the team s jersey for the press photographs only holding it when it was presented to him On advice from his mother he refused to sign a contract and began a holdout that lasted over a year On June he was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for five players the rights to Swedish prospect Peter Forsberg two first round draft picks and US million The Eric Lindros trade turned the moribund Nordiques into a Stanley Cup contender almost overnight and is seen in hindsight as one of the most one sided deals in sports history In the first season after the trade the Nordiques reached the playoffs for the first time in six years Two years later they won the Northeast Division and had the second best regular season record during the lockout shortened season br While the team experienced on ice success it spent most of its first years struggling financially Quebec City was by far the smallest market in the NHL and the changing financial environment in the NHL made things even more difficult In team owner Marcel Aubut asked for a bailout from Quebec s provincial government as well as a new publicly funded arena The bailout fell through and Aubut subsequently began talks with COMSAT Entertainment Group in Denver which already owned the Denver Nuggets In May COMSAT announced an agreement in principle to purchase the team The deal became official on July and season tickets were sold in the days after the announcement of the move br COMSAT considered several names for the team including Extreme Blizzards and Black Bears It also debated whether to brand the team as a Denver team or as a regional franchise representing either Colorado or the entire Rocky Mountain region Initially COMSAT filed copyright protection for Black Bears but reportedly decided to name the team Rocky Mountain Extreme When The Denver Post leaked the intended name fan reaction was so negative that COMSAT reconsidered and chose the name Colorado Avalanche The new name was revealed on August With the move the newly relocated team transferred to the Pacific Division of the Western Conference br br br Colorado Avalanche present br br br

controlling interest with the other available on NASDAQ The Avalanche played their first game in the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver on October winning against the Detroit Red Wings It marked a

Devils Valeri Kamensky scored the first goal as the Avalanche as well as the game winning goal in the final minutes Led on the ice by captain Joe Sakic forward Peter Forsberg and defenseman Adam Foote and with Pierre Lacroix as the general manager and Marc Crawford as the head coach the Avalanche became stronger when All Star Montreal Canadiens goaltender Patrick Roy joined the team Roy joined the

respectively During a rematch of the previous year Western Conference Finals the Avalanche lost to the Detroit Red Wings in six games Detroit went on to sweep the Stanley Cup Finals just as the Avalanche had done the year before Sandis Ozolinsh was elected for the NHL s first All Star team at the end of the season br br As a free agent during the summer of Joe Sakic signed a three year million offer sheet with the New York Rangers Under the collective agreement in place at the time between the NHL and NHL Players Association NHLPA the Avalanche had one week to match the Rangers offer or let go of Sakic Colorado would match the offer which instigated a salary raise for NHL players br The Avalanche sent players representing seven countries as well as head coach Marc Crawford

and Jari Kurri won bronze with Finland br In the following season Colorado won the Pacific Division with a record for points The team lost in the Western Conference Quarterfinals against the Edmonton

since requested a trade to a contender for a chance to win the Stanley Cup However Colorado lost in the Conference Finals against the Dallas Stars in seven games after defeating the Phoenix Coyotes and Detroit Red Wings in five games br The Avalanche s success came amid considerable turmoil in the front office COMSAT s diversification into sports ownership was proving a drain on the company Cost overruns associated with the construction of Pepsi Center had shareholders up in arms Finally in COMSAT agreed in principle to sell Ascent to Liberty Media However Liberty was not interested in sports ownership at the time though it has since purchased Major League Baseball s Atlanta Braves and made the deal contingent upon Ascent selling both the Avalanche and Nuggets br After almost two years Ascent sold the teams to Wal Mart heirs Bill and Nancy Laurie for million However a group of Ascent shareholders sued claiming the sale price was several million dollars too low Ascent then agreed to sell the teams to Denver banking tycoon Donald Sturm for million br A new wrinkle appeared when the City of Denver refused to transfer the parcel of land on which Pepsi Center stood unless Sturm promised to keep the Avalanche and Nuggets in Denver for at least years Sturm had made his bid in his own name and the city wanted to protect taxpayers in the event Sturm either died or sold the teams While Sturm was willing to make a long term commitment to the city he was not willing to be held responsible if he died or sold the teams After negotiations fell apart Liberty bought all of Ascent but kept the Nuggets and Avalanche on the market br Finally in July the teams and the Pepsi Center were bought by real estate entrepreneur Stan Kroenke and brother in law to the Lauries in a million deal

the Vancouver Canucks In the Western Conference Semi finals the Avalanche defeated the Los Angeles Kings in seven games after having wasted a lead After the last game of the series Peter Forsberg

devastating to the Colorado Avalanche The team would overcome Forsberg s injury in the Western Conference Finals Colorado defeated the St Louis Blues and progressed to the Stanley Cup Finals where they faced the defending champion New Jersey Devils The Avalanche came back from a series deficit and won the series marking the second year in a row that defending champions lost in the Finals as the

goaltender David Aebischer could perform at the top level the team was used to while having Roy Having nine elite players the most talented top six forwards on one team since the days of the Edmonton Oilers was not good enough as the franchise failed to win the Northwest Division title ending the NHL record streak The record was good enough for points one less than the Northwest Division champion Vancouver Canucks This ended a streak of nine consecutive division titles dating to the team s last year in Quebec br During a game against Vancouver on March Canucks player Todd Bertuzzi punched Colorado s Steve Moore from behind leaving Moore unconscious It was said to be retaliation for a hit Moore had delivered to Canucks captain Markus Naslund the month before Moore sustained three fractured neck vertebrae among other injuries caused by the hit and subsequent pile up ending his career Bertuzzi was away from professional hockey for months as a result of suspensions In Denver
