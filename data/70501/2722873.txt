professional team in Quebec senior men s leagues until The Senior Senators would win three Allan Cup titles br When the current Ottawa Senators debuted in they adopted the original team s black red and white color scheme and the shortened Sens moniker as well br br br Team history br br br Early amateur era br br The Ottawa Hockey Club Ottawa HC was founded by a small group of like minded hockey enthusiasts A month after witnessing games of hockey at the Montreal Winter Carnival Halder Kirby Jack Kerr and Frank Jenkins met and founded the club Being the first organized ice hockey club in Ottawa and also the first in Ontario the club had no other clubs to play that season The only activities that winter were practices at the Royal Rink starting on March br The club first participated competitively at the Montreal Winter Carnival ice hockey tournament considered the Canadian championship at the time wearing red and black uniforms Future Ottawa mayor Nelson Porter is recorded as the scorer of the club s first ever goal at the Carnival Frank Jenkins was the first captain of the team he later became the president of the hockey club in and of the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada AHA or AHAC in br br For the season the club adopted gold and blue as its colours and returned to the Montreal tournament Ottawa earned its first ever victory at the tournament over the Montreal Victorias but lost its final match to the Montreal Hockey Club Montreal HC to place second in the tournament The Montreal tournament was cancelled due to an outbreak of smallpox and the club would not play an outside match again until br br br Formation of the AHAC br On December the first championship league the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada was founded in Montreal It was composed of several clubs from Montreal plus a Quebec City club and the Ottawa club Ottawa s Thomas D Green was named the first president of the league The league did not have a set schedule and instead games were played in challenge series whereby a team held the championship and entertained challengers until the end of the season a format the league employed until Under the format Ottawa lost the one challenge it played in that first season to the Montreal Victorias br After that season Ottawa HC became inactive The Royal Rink which had been their primary facility had been converted to a roller skating rink and ice rink facilities were at a shortage This changed with the opening of the Rideau Skating Rink in February One of the principal organizers in the restarting of the team was Ottawa Journal publisher P D Ross who also played on the team Returning as captain was Frank Jenkins and the other players were Halder Kirby Jack Kerr Nelson Porter Ross George Young Weldy Young Thomas D Green William O Dell Tom Gallagher Albert Low and Henry Ami In the club played only one match against an outside club an exhibition at the Rideau rink against the Montreal HC second team br In November the Ottawa Amateur Athletic Club OAAC was opened at the corner of today s Elgin and Laurier Streets on the site of today s Lord Elgin Hotel The Club building would also be the Hockey Club s headquarters The OAAC was affiliated with the Ottawa Amateur Athletic Association OAAA and the Hockey Club through the affiliation also became OAAA members When the club began outside competition again in it was with new sweaters of white with black stripes and the OAAA red triskelion logo It was during this period of affiliation with the OAAC that the club would become known by the nickname Generals attributed to the club s insignia The club is also referred to as the Capitals in literature although there was a rival Ottawa Capitals club organized by the Capital Amateur Athletics Association active at the time br br In the season Ottawa HC played two competitive games but this was to increase greatly the next season The season saw the club play games playing in three leagues Ottawa HC was a founding member of two new leagues the Ottawa City Hockey League OCHL and the Ontario Hockey Association OHA and also rejoined the AHAC Ottawa HC won the Ottawa and Ontario championships and two games against AHAC opponents but lost to the AHAC champion Montreal HC in its one challenge for the championship br br br OHA championships br The team was the OHA champion for that league s first three years The first championship was played on March at the Rideau rink and was won by Ottawa over Toronto St George s The championship was the only OHA final played in Ottawa as Ottawa played the final in Toronto defeating Osgoode Hall and in the Toronto Granites defaulted by not appearing for the championship match scheduled for Ottawa The club resigned from the OHA in February after the OHA refused the club s demand to have the final in Ottawa and ordered Ottawa HC to play the final in Toronto The dispute caused a permanent schism between Ottawa area teams competing in the Ottawa City Hockey League OCHL and the Ontario Hockey Association Ottawa and area teams remain unaffiliated with the OHA the official association under Hockey Canada is Hockey Eastern Ontario a descendant of the OCHL br It was at a dinner to honour the OHA champions at the Russell Hotel that the Governor General Lord Stanley announced his new Dominion Challenge Trophy now known as the Stanley Cup for the Canadian champions Former player and president of the club P D Ross was selected by Stanley to be a trustee of the Cup br br br Re entry into the AHAC br Ottawa HC did not win a game in its return to AHAC challenge play in but in the next season of AHAC play in the club won the league championship and held it for most of the season from January until March The club took the championship from Montreal HC who were previously undefeated and won five straight games before Montreal won the championship back by a score in the last challenge of the season Montreal s win in the final challenge was their only win of the season and their only one in four games against Ottawa br Lord Stanley who often attended Ottawa HC games felt the loss of the title after holding it all season was an unsuitable way to determine the championship In the letter announcing the Stanley Cup Stanley suggested that the AHAC start a round robin type regular season format which the AHAC implemented in the following season of The key match up in that season for Ottawa was a loss in the opening game of the season against the Montreal Victorias on January as Ottawa split its season series with eventual winner Montreal HC both teams otherwise winning all of their games This loss provided the one game margin in the standings that led to Lord Stanley awarding the initial Cup to Montreal HC br In Ottawa HC finished in a four way tie for first in the AHAC standings A playoff was arranged in Montreal for the championship between Ottawa Montreal HC and Montreal Victorias the other first place club Quebec having dropped out of the playoff These games would be the first Stanley Cup playoff games ever played As the away team Ottawa was given a bye to the final game On March at the Victoria Rink Ottawa and Montreal HC played for the championship Ottawa scored the first goal but Montreal would score the next three to win the game Ottawa captain Weldy Young fainted from exhaustion at the end of the game br br For the period of to the club did not win the league championship finishing as high as second several times and fifth last once For the season the Ottawa club unveiled the first use of the barber pole style sweaters of horizontal bars of black red and white This basic style would be used by the club until except for the and seasons when the team used a plain sweater with only the letter O on the front identical in design to the sweaters of the Ottawa Football Club also an OAAA affiliate br In the AHAC dissolved over the admission of the intermediate level team Ottawa Capitals of the rival Capital Amateur Association to the AHAC by a vote of the league executive The Capitals had won the intermediate championship of the AHAC and were eligible to join the senior ranks After they were outvoted by the intermediate level teams of AHAC which wanted to promote the Capitals to the senior level the senior level Ottawa Montreal HC Montreal Victorias and Quebec clubs left the AHAC and formed the Canadian Amateur Hockey League CAHL shutting out the Capitals br The club won the CAHL season title its first league championship since winning the OHA in It wished to challenge the Stanley Cup champion Winnipeg Victorias at first but chose not to after deliberating for a week after the season although it also had the option to challenge in the season According to hockey historian Charles L Coleman it was due to the lateness of the season The Ottawa Journal openly supported the idea stating that the players were racked and would be at a serious disadvantage to travel to Winnipeg br Notable players of this period included Albert Morel and Fred Chittick in goal leaders of the league several times in goaltending and future Hall of Famers Harvey Pulford Alf Smith Harry Westwick and brothers Bruce Stuart and Hod Stuart It was during this period that the nickname Senators was first used however from to the team is better known as the Silver Seven br br br Silver Seven era br br The first dynasty of the Ottawa HC was from until when the team was known as the Silver Seven The era started with the arrival of Frank McGee for the season and ended with his retirement after the season Having lost an eye in local amateur hockey he was persuaded despite the threat of permanent blindness to join the Senators The youngest player on the team and standing feet inches m tall he went on to score goals in games In a challenge against the Dawson City he scored goals in a win He retired in at the age of br In the CAHL season Ottawa and the Montreal Victorias both finished in first place with records The top scorers were the Victorias Russell Bowie who scored seven goals in one game and six in another and McGee whose top performance saw him score five goals in a game The two clubs faced off in a two game total goals series to decide the league championship and Stanley Cup The first game played in Montreal on slushy ice that made it a desperate struggle to score ended The return match in Ottawa witnessed by fans was on ice coated with an inch of water The conditions did not hinder Ottawa as they won with McGee scoring three goals and the other five shared among the three Gilmour brothers Dave Suddy and Bill to win their first Cup This started a period in which the team held the Stanley Cup and defeated all challengers until March br For that Stanley Cup win each of the team s players was given a silver nugget by team executive Bob Shillington an Ottawa druggist and mining investor He gave them nuggets instead of money since the players were still technically amateurs and to give them money would have meant disqualification from the league In a interview Harry Westwick recalled that at the presentation One of the players said We ought to call ourselves the Silver Seven and the name caught on right there At the time hockey teams iced seven men a goaltender three forwards two defencemen and a rover br The Silver Seven moved between three leagues during this time and for a time were independent of any league In February during the CAHL season Ottawa resigned from the league in a dispute over the replaying of a game The team had arrived late for a game in Montreal and the game had been called at midnight with a tied score The league demanded that the game be replayed The club agreed to play only if the game mattered in the standings The impasse led to Ottawa leaving the league For the rest of that winter the club played only in Cup challenge series Quebec went on to win the championship of the league and demanded the Stanley Cup but the Cup s trustees ruled that Ottawa still retained it The trustees offered to arrange a challenge between Ottawa and the CAHL champion but the CAHL refused to consider it The next season Ottawa joined the Federal Amateur Hockey League FAHL winning the league championship The club was only in the FAHL for one season and the Montreal Wanderers became their new rival For the season Ottawa along with the Wanderers and several of the CAHL teams formed the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association ECAHA unifying the top teams into one league br br br Style of play br The Silver Seven were well known for the number of injuries that they inflicted on other teams In a Stanley Cup challenge game in the Ottawas injured seven of the nine Winnipeg players and the Winnipeg Free Press called it the bloodiest game in Ottawa The next team to challenge the Ottawas the Toronto Marlboroughs were treated similarly According to the Toronto Globe br br The style of hockey seems to be the only one known and people consider it quite proper and legitimate for a team to endeavor to incapacitate their opponents rather than to excel them in skill and speed slashing tripping the severest kind of cross checking and a systematic method of hammering Marlboroughs on hand and wrists are the most effective points in Ottawa s style br According to one player the Marlboroughs got off very easily When Winnipeg Rowing Club played here most of their players were carried off on stretchers This style of hockey would continue for years to come br br br Dawson City challenge br br The Silver Seven participated in perhaps the most famous Stanley Cup challenge of all that of Dawson City of the Yukon Territory in Organized by Joe Boyle a Toronto born prospector who had struck it rich in the Yukon gold rush of The Dawson City Nuggets had Lorne Hanna who had played for Brandon against Ottawa in a challenge and two former elite hockey players Weldy Young who had played for Ottawa in the s and D R McLennan who had played for Queen s College against the Montreal Victorias in an challenge The remaining players were selected from other Dawson City clubs Dawson City s challenge was accepted in the summer of by the Stanley Cup trustees and scheduled to start on Friday January The date of the challenge meant that Young had to travel separately to Ottawa as he had to work in a federal election that December and would meet the club in Ottawa br br To get to Ottawa several thousand miles away the club had to get to Whitehorse by overland sleigh catch a train from there to Skagway Alaska then catch a steamer to Vancouver B C and a train from there to Ottawa On December several players set out by dog sled and the rest left the next day by bicycle for a mile trek to Whitehorse At first the team made good progress but the weather turned warm enough to thaw the roads forcing the players to walk several hundred miles The team spent the nights in police sheds along the road At Whitehorse the weather turned bad causing the trains not to run for three days and the Nuggets to miss their steamer in Skagway The next one could not dock for three days due to the ice buildup The club found the sea journey treacherous and it caused seasickness amongst the team When the steamer reached Vancouver the area was too fogged in to dock and the steamer docked in Seattle The team from there caught a train to Vancouver from which it left on January arriving in Ottawa on January br Despite the difficult journey the Ottawas refused to change the date of the first game only two days away Ottawa arranged hospitable accommodations for the Dawson City team The Yukoners received a huge welcome at the train station had a welcoming dinner and used the Ottawa Amateur Athletic Club s rooms for the duration of their stay Young did not arrive in time to play for Dawson br The first game was close at the halfway point Ottawa leading Dawson three to one In the second half the play became violent Norman Watt of Dawson tripped Ottawa s Art Moore who retaliated with a stick to the mouth of Watt Watt promptly knocked Moore out hitting him on the head with his stick The game ended for Ottawa The game left a poor taste in the mouth for the Yukoners who complained that several goals were offside br After the game Watt was quoted as saying Frank McGee doesn t look like too much as he had only scored once in the first game McGee scored four goals in the first half of the second match and in the second half leading Ottawa to a score his goals remains a record for a single game of major senior hockey Eight of those goals were scored consecutively in a span of less than nine minutes Despite this high score the newspapers claimed that Albert Forrest the Dawson City goalie had played a really fine game otherwise the score might have been doubled Ottawa celebrated by hosting Dawson at a banquet After this the players took the Cup and attempted to drop kick it over the Rideau Canal The stunt was unsuccessful as the Cup landed on the frozen ice and had to be retrieved the next day br Considering the lopsided score of the series historians such as Paul Kitchen question why Dawson City was even granted a chance at the Cup Dawson City had won no championships and did not belong to any recognized senior league While team official Weldy Young knew Stanley Cup trustee P D Ross personally through their joint connection with the club it may have been the political connections that Joe Boyle had with the government Interior Minister of the time Clifford Sifton that got Dawson City the series br Future Ottawa Senators owner Frank Ahearn later stated that Weldy Young had asked Ahearn to ask the Ottawa players to not rub it in as Dawson City did not expect to win Ahearn mentioned this to McGee who had had a row with Boyle when both were members of the Ottawa Rowing Club and had not forgotten it br br br Stanley Cup Challenge win streak br The Ottawas were the dominant team for three years br br The end of the streak came in March Ottawa and the Montreal Wanderers tied for the ECAHA league lead in forcing a playoff series for the league championship and the Cup Montreal won the first game in Montreal by a score of In the return match Ottawa replaced their goaltender Billy Hague and used goaltender Percy LeSueur formerly of Smiths Falls In the return match in Ottawa Ottawa overcame the eight goal deficit getting a lead to tie the series by the midway point of the second half Harry Smith then scored to put Ottawa ahead only to have the goal ruled offside It was then that Lester Patrick of the Wanderers took it upon himself scoring two goals to win the series This was Frank McGee s last game and he scored two goals br br The players br Besides McGee future Hall of Fame players Billy Gilmour Percy LeSueur Harvey Pulford Alf Smith Bouse Hutton and Harry Westwick played for the Ottawas Alf Smith was also the coach Other players of the Seven included Angus Bones Allen Dave Finnie Arthur Fraser Horace Gaul Dave Gilmour Suddy Gilmour Jim McGee Art Moore Percy Sims Hamby Shore Charles Spittal Fred White and Frank Wood br The club was able to continue the streak despite the death of one of its members Jim McGee Frank McGee s brother died after the season in a horseback riding accident He was also the Ottawa Football Club s captain at the time The funeral cortege was estimated at a half mile in length and it included Canadian prime minister Wilfrid Laurier br br br Early professional era br br br Transition to professional br Until the season the players were not paid to play hockey as the team was abiding by the principles of amateur sports Ottawa HC had an advantage in attracting top players to its squad The players could work for the government and the work allowed the players to play for the team Meanwhile in the United States the International Professional Hockey League IPHL was paying players In response to this the ECAHA while still having several purely amateur teams started to allow professional players The top teams could therefore compete for the top players and the gate attractions that they were The only restriction was that the status of each and every player had to be publicized br The period saw the rivalry between the Senators and the Wanderers continue and at times it was brutally contested On January a full scale donnybrook took place between the two teams at a game in Montreal Charles Spittal of Ottawa was described as attempting to split Blachford s skull Alf Smith hit Hod Stuart across the temple with his stick laying him out like a corpse and Harry Smith cracked his stick across Ernie Johnson s face breaking Johnson s nose Discipline was first attempted by the league at a meeting on January in which the Victorias proposed suspending Spittal and Alf Smith for the season but this was voted down and the president of the league resigned The police arrested Spittal Alf and Harry Smith on their next visit to Montreal leading to fines for Spittal and Alf Smith and an acquittal for Harry Smith The tactics did not work on the Wanderers they won the return match in Ottawa in March and went undefeated for the season leaving Ottawa in second place However it may have affected the Wanderers in another way they lost the Stanley Cup a week after the donnybrook in a Stanley Cup challenge series to the Kenora Thistles br br The season was a season of change for Ottawa Harry Smith and Hamby Shore left to join Winnipeg Ottawa hired several free agents including Marty Walsh Tommy Phillips and Fred The Listowel Whirlwind Taylor Taylor was hired away from the IPHL for the season for a salary and a guaranteed federal civil service job He was an immediate sensation and earned a new nickname of Cyclone for his fast skating and end to end rushes the nickname attributed to the Canadian governor general Earl Grey Phillips was signed from Kenora to an even higher salary of for the season partially paid for by Ottawa sportsmen br Ottawa moved into their new arena simply dubbed The Arena with seating for and standing room for With the free agent signings and the new arena Ottawa started selling season tickets the first of their kind for five games eventually selling The capacity was topped with a crowd of in the home opener attending a game against the Wanderers on January which Ottawa won However Ottawa started the season with two losses out of three games and ended in second place behind the Wanderers again Walsh tied for the scoring lead with goals in games including seven in one match while Phillips was close behind at goals in games br In the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association became completely professional and changed its name to the Eastern Canada Hockey Association ECHA This led to the retirement of several stars including Ottawa s Harvey Pulford and Montreal s Russell Bowie who insisted on keeping their amateur status The Montreal Victorias and Montreal HC founded the Interprovincial Amateur Hockey Union leaving only Ottawa Quebec Montreal Wanderers and Montreal Shamrocks in the ECHA It was another season of player turn over for Ottawa Besides Pulford Ottawa lost Alf Smith who formed a competing Ottawa Senators professional team in the Federal League and Tommy Phillips who joined Edmonton The club picked up Bruce Stuart from the Wanderers Fred Lake from Winnipeg and Dubby Kerr from Toronto This lineup had a successful season winning out of games Walsh led all scorers with goals in games while Stuart had and Kerr had The season was clinched with a win against the Wanderers on March in Ottawa as Ottawa won the league and Stanley Cup br Notable players of this time period include future Hall of Famers Percy LeSueur in goal Dubby Kerr Tommy Phillips Harvey Pulford Alf Smith Bruce Stuart Fred Cyclone Taylor and Marty Walsh br br br National Hockey Association br The hockey season saw major changes in the hockey world as the ECHA organization split and created two organizations the Canadian Hockey Association CHA and the National Hockey Association NHA The CHA was formed to freeze out the Wanderers whose ownership change led the team to move to a smaller arena At the same time millionaire businessman J Ambrose O Brien who wanted his Renfrew Creamery Kings to challenge for the Stanley Cup saw his Renfrew application to join the CHA rejected Together with the Wanderers O Brien instead decided to form the NHA and founded the Montreal Canadiens The NHA became the fore runner of today s National Hockey League br Ottawa was one of the founders of the CHA and one of the teams that had rejected Renfrew However after a few poorly attended games showed that fans had no interest in the league Ottawa and the Montreal Shamrocks abandoned the CHA to join the NHA Ottawa the defending Stanley Cup champion and Wanderers rival was readily accepted by the NHA This enabled Ottawa to continue the rivalry with the Wanderers and take in the gate revenues those games provided The Wanderers won the championship in and Ottawa won in and br It is during the NHA period that the nickname Ottawa Senators came into common usage Although there had been a competing Senators club in and there had been mention of the Senators nickname as early as the nickname was not adopted by the club The official name of the Ottawa Hockey Club remained in place until ownership changes in the s br Star player Cyclone Taylor had defected to Renfrew and despite a salary war with Renfrew Ottawa managed to re sign their other top players Dubby Kerr Fred Lake and Marty Walsh for the season On Taylor s first return in February he made a promise to score a goal while making a rush backwards against Ottawa This led to incredible interest with over in attendance A bet of was placed at the King Edward Hotel against him scoring at all Ottawa won scoring goals in overtime and kept Taylor off the scoresheet Later in the season at the return match in Renfrew Taylor made good on his boast with a goal scored backwards although it was simply a goal scored on a backhand shot This was the final game of the season and Ottawa had no chance at the league title and did not appear to have put in an effort in a loss considered the worst trimming ever handed to a team wearing the Ottawa colors br br In the NHA contracted and imposed a salary cap leading many of the Ottawa players to threaten to form a competing league However team owners controlled the rinks and the players accepted the new conditions For Ottawa players conditions did not deteriorate much as the club provided bonuses after the season Ottawa gained revenge for the previous loss to Renfrew by defeating Renfrew The team went to win the NHA and inherit the Stanley Cup Marty Walsh and Dubby Kerr led the goal scoring with and goals in games After the season Ottawa played two challenges against Galt winning and against Port Arthur winning In the Port Arthur game Marty Walsh came close to matching Frank McGee s total scoring ten goals was the debut season of right wing Jack Darragh who scored goals in games br The through seasons saw a decline for both Ottawa and the Wanderers After the withdrawal of O Brien s Renfrew team in the two clubs fought over the rights to Cyclone Taylor who wanted to return to Ottawa where his fianc lived and he still had a government job The NHA had given the Wanderers the rights to Taylor in a dispersal of the Renfrew players Trade talks were unfruitful Ottawa insistent in their claim for Taylor played him in one game for Ottawa against the Wanderers The Senators won the game however Taylor was ineffectual The move backfired on the Senators as the league ruled that the game could not stand and would have to be replayed The Senators lost the replay and it was the difference in the league championship as the defending champion Senators placed second by one game behind Quebec Quebec s Bulldogs won the only two Stanley Cup championships in the club s history that season and the next and the Toronto Blueshirts won in Taylor did not play in the NHA again as he joined Vancouver in the off season The Senators finished fifth in and fourth in saw the debut of right wing Punch Broadbent who scored goals in games br br In both Ottawa and the Wanderers bounced back to the top of the league tying each other for the NHA season title This was also the season that future Hall of Famer Clint Benedict became the Senators top goaltender taking over from Percy LeSueur Former Wanderer Art Ross joined the Senators and helped Ottawa win in a two game playoff The Senators then played in the first inter league Stanley Cup Finals playoff series with the Vancouver Millionaires of the Pacific Coast PCHA league Cyclone Taylor now of the Millionaires haunted his old team scoring six goals in three games as Ottawa lost three straight in Vancouver Future Senator centreman Frank Nighbor played in this series for Vancouver and scored five goals br In the Senators placed second to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Montreal Canadiens Punch Broadbent left the team to fight in World War I while Frank Nighbor joined the Senators in his place and became the team s leading scorer Nighbor had been signed away from Vancouver for the salary of making him the highest paid player on the club ahead of Art Ross and Eddie Gerard Benedict led the league as the top goaltender for the first time With the wartime shortage of players Rat Westwick and Billy Gilmour of Silver Seven days attempted comebacks with the club but both played only two games before retiring for good br In the off season Ottawa s president Llewellyn Bate proposed to suspend the team s operations until the end of the war Gate receipts had declined percent The other NHA owners refused to suspend the league Rather than simply cease operations Bate and the other directors of the team turned it over to Ted Dey owner of the Arena Dey cut player salaries and let players go including Art Ross to the Wanderers Dey also fired manager Alf Smith saving on his salary br In the last season of the NHA Ottawa won the second half of the split schedule An Army team the Toronto th Battalion composed of enlisted professional players joined the league before leaving for war after the first half season When the Battalion left the other Toronto team the Blueshirts was suspended by the league and its players dispersed including Corb Denneny brother of Cy Denneny who joined the Senators Future Hall of Famer Cy had been picked up in a trade with Toronto earlier that season and he would be a member of the Senators until Benedict was the NHA s top goaltender once again and Nighbor tied for the scoring lead with goals in games As second half winners the Senators played off in a series with the Canadiens the first half winners The Senators ended their play in the NHA by losing a two game total goals playoff series to the Canadiens who eventually lost to Seattle in the Stanley Cup Finals This season saw the final decline of Ottawa s old rivals the Wanderers who finished at the bottom of the standings The next year the Wanderers played only four games in the NHL winning only one before folding the franchise after their home arena burned down br While World War I affected all NHA teams Ottawa was able to retain players and be competitive The club finished no worse than second during the wartime seasons of to br br br Stanley Cup champions in and Historians debate br Due to the challenge format of Stanley Cup play before there is often confusion about how many Stanley Cup championships the Senators should be given credit for nine ten or eleven The Senators were Stanley Cup champions at the end of nine hockey seasons without dispute In another two seasons and the Senators won Stanley Cup challenges but were not champions at the end of the season The Hockey Hall of Fame and the National Hockey League agree that the Senators of were champions but disagree on whether the Senators were champions in In both seasons the Senators were the undisputed defending champions and during that year s hockey season the Senators won Stanley Cup challenges However by the end of both hockey seasons they were no longer holders of the Stanley Cup br In Ottawa defeated OHA champions Queen s University and FAHL champions Smiths Falls in Stanley Cup challenges However Ottawa tied the Montreal Wanderers for the ECAHA regular season championship To decide the ECAHA championship and the Stanley Cup the Senators played a two game total goals series against the Wanderers in March and lost The hockey season ended with the Wanderers as the Stanley Cup champions The Hockey Hall of Fame recognizes both Ottawa and the Wanderers as champions for that year as does the NHL br In January Ottawa defeated Galt champions of the OPHL during the CHA regular season as well as Edmonton of the AAHA during the NHA regular season the Senators switched leagues in between At the end of the season Ottawa gave up the Cup to the Montreal Wanderers regular season champions of the new NHA league Unlike the case the Hockey Hall of Fame does not recognize the Senators as champions for January although the NHL does br In October at the first game of the current Ottawa Senators NHL club banners were raised to commemorate Stanley Cup wins in nine seasons excluding and In media guides published by the club they listed the original Senators as nine time winners This changed in March when the team raised banners for the and years to join the other nine banners hanging at the Corel Centre The club and the NHL now list the original Senators as time winners br br br NHL years br br After struggling through the war years the Ottawa Hockey Association put the club up for sale for in the fall of Montreal Canadiens owner George Kennedy was leading an effort to get rid of Toronto Blueshirts owner Eddie Livingstone and he needed the Senators in his corner He loaned Ottawa Citizen sports editor Tommy Gorman who also doubled as a press representative for the Canadiens to help buy into the Senators Gorman along with Martin Rosenthal and Ted Dey owner of The Arena bought the club At a meeting held at Montreal s Windsor Hotel the Senators Canadiens Wanderers and Bulldogs formed a new league the National Hockey League effectively leaving Livingstone in the NHA by himself Gorman represented the Senators at the meeting A great day for hockey he was quoted as saying Without Livingstone we can get down to the business of making money Within a year Gorman and partner Ted Dey had made enough money to pay back Kennedy Gorman also attended the following year s meeting of the NHA owners in which the final vote to suspend the league was made br The Senators first season in the NHL did not go well Salary squabbles delayed the home opener on the league s first night December as players protested that their contracts were for games while the season schedule was for Enough players were appeased that the game started minutes late while two players Hamby Shore and Jack Darragh stayed in the dressing room while negotiations went on The Senators lost their home opener The Senators lost their previous top rival the Wanderers after five games The team struggled and finished in third place after the first half of the season The club made player changes in the second half getting Horace Merrill out of retirement and releasing Dave Ritchie It was Shore s last season as he would die of pneumonia in October Shore s last career game was in the third last game of the season and he was sat out for the last two games In the end the team placed second in the second half and missed the playoffs Cy Denneny led the team coming second overall in scoring in the league with goals in games br Prior to the season ownership of the Senators changed While Ted Dey negotiated with Percy Quinn for a lease for The Arena Dey was also negotiating with Rosenthal over the lease causing Rosenthal to seriously consider moving the team from The Arena back to Aberdeen Pavilion However it turned out that Dey was engineering a takeover of the club and Rosenthal ended up selling his share of the club to Dey making Dey the majority owner in both the Arena and the hockey club Rosenthal a prominent local jeweller had been involved with the club since Dey s machinations also helped the NHL in its continuing fight against Blueshirts owner Livingstone The Senators instigated an agreement with the other NHL clubs binding them to the NHL for the next five years and locking out any rival league from their arenas br In the Senators won the second half of the split schedule Clint Benedict had the top goalkeeper average and Cy Denneny and Frank Nighbor placed third and fourth in scoring with and goals in games respectively The schedule was abbreviated by the Toronto Arenas club suspending operations so the Senators and Canadiens played off in the first best of seven series Due to a family bereavement Ottawa was without star centre Frank Nighbor for the first three games and lost all three Ottawa asked to use Corb Denneny of Toronto but the Canadiens turned down the request Nighbor returned for the fourth game in Ottawa which Ottawa won The series ended in five games as the Canadiens won the final match to win the series The Stanley Cup Finals between Montreal and Seattle was left undecided as an influenza outbreak suspended the final br br br The Super Six br The Super Six Senators of the s are considered by the NHL to be its first dynasty The club won the Stanley Cup four times and placed first in the regular season seven times The team s success was based on the timely scoring of several forwards including Frank Nighbor and Cy Denneny and a defence first policy which led to the NHL changing the rules in to force defencemen to leave the defensive zone once the puck had left the zone The talent pool in Ottawa and the Ottawa valley was deep the Senators traded away two future Hall of Famers Clint Benedict and Punch Broadbent in to make way for two prospects Alex Connell and Hooley Smith who would also become Hall of Famers Benedict and Broadbent led the Montreal Maroons to a playoff defeat of the Senators on the way to a Stanley Cup win in br In the season the NHL reactivated the Quebec Bulldogs NHA franchise with this addition the NHL played with four teams again There were no playoffs as Ottawa won both halves of the schedule the undisputed NHL championship and the O Brien Cup Clint Benedict again led the league in goalkeeper goals against average and Frank Nighbor came third in the league scoring race with goals in games br The Senators then played the Seattle Metropolitans of the PCHA for the Stanley Cup Because Seattle s red white green striped uniforms were nearly the same as Ottawa s red white black sweaters the Senators played in simple white sweaters adorned with a large red O for this series The first three games were held in Ottawa the first Stanley Cup games played in Ottawa since and ended with scores of and for Ottawa and for Seattle The first three games had been played on ice covered with water and slush due to warm weather in Ottawa At this point NHL president Calder moved the series to the Arena Gardens in Toronto which had an artificial ice rink the only one in eastern Canada at that time Seattle won to tie the series cheered on by the Toronto fans In the fifth and
