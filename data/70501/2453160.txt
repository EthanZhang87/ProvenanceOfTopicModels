id: 2453160
The Cleveland Barons were a professional ice hockey team in the National Hockey League NHL from to They were a relocation of the California Golden Seals franchise that had played in Oakland since After just two seasons the team merged with the Minnesota North Stars now the Dallas Stars As a result the NHL operated with teams during the season br The Barons remained the last franchise in the four major North American sports leagues to cease operations until Arizona Coyotes in Ohio did not have another NHL team until the Columbus Blue Jackets joined the league years later in br br br History br br The Barons originated as the California Golden Seals in the NHL expansion Based at the Oakland Alameda Coliseum Arena in Oakland California they were the least successful of the six teams added as part of that expansion They never had a winning record and only made the playoffs twice Those two seasons were the only times that the franchise came close to contention br However the Seals on ice struggles were the least of their concerns The team was sold three times and spent much of and as wards of the league The team never drew well attendance was so poor that talk of relocation began as early as the inaugural season However the league s U S television contract with CBS required two teams in California Even after the NHL and CBS parted ways the league was reluctant to abandon a market as large as the Bay Area br San Francisco hotel magnate Melvin Swig bought the Seals from the league in for million Soon afterward he hammered out a deal with San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto to move the Seals to a new seat arena in San Francisco However when those plans fell through later in the NHL dropped its remaining objection to moving the team Minority owner George Gund III persuaded Swig to move the team to his hometown of Cleveland for the season The team was named Barons in honor of the successful team in the American Hockey League AHL that played in the city from to winning nine Calder Cups The AHL Barons owner Nick Mileti moved that team to Florida in favor of his Cleveland Crusaders team in the new World Hockey Association WHA br The Barons played in the suburban Richfield Coliseum in Richfield Ohio halfway between Cleveland and Akron It had originally been built for the WHA s Crusaders who left to become the second incarnation of the Minnesota Fighting Saints for the WHA season on the Barons arrival and the NBA s Cleveland Cavaliers At the time the Richfield Coliseum had the largest seating capacity in the NHL at br On paper the move to Cleveland should have been a shot in the arm for the franchise Cleveland had been mentioned as a possible NHL city as early as when the then struggling Montreal Canadiens considered moving there It had also been turned down for an NHL expansion team on three previous occasions in the s and s Additionally the Barons and their previous incarnations the Indians and Falcons had been one of the pillars of the AHL and its predecessors for years br The NHL approved the move to Cleveland on July but details were not finalized until late August less than six weeks before the season opener There was little time or money for promotion of the new team and the Barons never recovered from this lack of visibility They never came close to filling the Coliseum in their two years in Cleveland The team s home opener on October drew only fans They drew or more fans in only seven out of home games Attendance was worse than it had been in Oakland and the team did not draw as many fans as the WHA s Crusaders had The Barons were also troubled by an unfavorable lease with the Coliseum br During the All Star Break in January Swig hinted the team might not finish the season because of payroll difficulties He asked the board of governors for a bailout The board turned down Swig s request almost out of hand At the time no one in the NHL offices believed that the Barons situation was nearly as dire as Swig claimed No NHL team had folded since the Montreal Maroons had their franchise formally canceled in after not icing a team since No team had folded in mid season since the Montreal Wanderers disbanded during the NHL s inaugural season in after their arena burned down The situation quickly deteriorated Amid million in losses team workers went unpaid for two months The bottom fell out in February when Swig asked the players to take a percent pay cut The players turned this request down and the team missed two payrolls The league seriously considered folding the team and holding a dispersal draft for the players by then some of the Barons players were actively being courted by other teams By February the players had lost their patience and threatened to not take the ice for their game against the Colorado Rockies Wanting to avoid the embarrassment of a player strike as well as a team folding at mid season the latter had previously happened in the rival WHA Swig the league and the NHLPA reached a last minute deal to cover the players salaries for the rest of the season Swig contributed the other owners put up each and the NHLPA lent the team After the team finished last in the Adams Division again Swig sold his interest to Gund and his brother Gordon br For the Gunds poured money into the team and it seemed to make a difference at first The Barons stunned the defending Stanley Cup champion Montreal Canadiens on November before a boisterous crowd of After a brief slump general manager Harry Howell pulled off several trades in an attempt to make the team tougher It initially paid off and the Barons knocked off three of the NHL s top teams the Toronto Maple Leafs New York Islanders and Buffalo Sabres in consecutive games in January A few weeks later a record crowd of saw the Barons tie the Philadelphia Flyers It did not last they only won a total of four games in February and March crumbling to last place again br br br Merger and aftermath br The Gunds aggressively marketed the team but got little to show for it The Barons only attracted a total of fans during their three game winning streak in January They were also unable to get favorable deals for radio or television denying them another potential revenue stream After the season the Gunds tried to buy the Coliseum but failed They would later succeed in buying the Coliseum and eventually bought the Cavaliers from Ted Stepien in br With the Barons barely registering on Cleveland s sports landscape the Gunds reluctantly decided to write them off as a lost cause and search for a way out Years later Gordon Gund recalled that the decision to disband the team was especially painful given his family s roots in Cleveland Kenneth Schnitzer owner of the WHA s Houston Aeros who were not being included as part of any proposed merger between the two leagues at the time offered to buy the Barons and relocate them to Houston but nothing came of it br Meanwhile the Minnesota North Stars were also having financial difficulties similar to those faced by the Barons but unlike the Gunds their owners lacked the resources to absorb the losses The Gunds began talks with the North Stars and broached the possibility of merging both teams The league was initially cool to the idea but ultimately concluded that it would be far better for its image to announce a transaction that could be called a merger than risk two teams folding The league granted final approval for the merger on June The amalgamated team retained the North Stars name colors and history with the wealthier Gunds as majority owners The Barons became the last team to fold in the NHL until when Arizona Coyotes owner Alex Meruelo folded the team after giving up control of his assets to the Utah Hockey Club br The NHL finally agreed to absorb the WHA one year later a development which resulted in a two decade absence of major league hockey in Ohio since the WHA s Cincinnati Stingers were not included in the merger However the NHL worked to keep interest in hockey alive in the state The Pittsburgh Penguins who from to were owned by Northeast Ohio native Edward J DeBartolo Sr played two designated home games at the Richfield Coliseum in the early s before the arena was demolished and the land added to Cuyahoga Valley National Park The NHL finally returned to Ohio in with the expansion Columbus Blue Jackets br Dennis Maruk was the last Baron and last Golden Seal as well to be active in the NHL retiring from the North Stars after the season with goals in games br With the North Stars continuing to struggle financially the Gunds began looking to bring NHL hockey back to the Bay Area By the late s they sought to relocate the North Stars but were blocked by the league In the Gunds were granted an expansion franchise in San Jose which became the San Jose Sharks in return for selling their stake in the North Stars to a group led by Hartford Whalers founder Howard Baldwin As a compromise the league arranged a special dispersal and expansion draft in which the Sharks claimed North Stars players in a dispersal draft with both teams then allowed to choose players in an expansion draft br Although the Sharks are officially a separate franchise from the Seals Golden Seals Barons the arrangement effectively reversed the original Barons North Stars merger with the Sharks occupying the same market as the Golden Seals prior to their move to Cleveland The new North Stars owners ultimately moved their team to Dallas as the Dallas Stars in The Gunds also later moved an existing American Hockey League team from Lexington Kentucky to Cleveland operating the Cleveland Barons from to as the Sharks minor league affiliate br br br Season by season record br Note GP
