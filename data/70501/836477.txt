Violence has been a part of ice hockey since at least the early s According to the book Hockey A People s History in alone four players were killed during hockey games from the frequent brawls and violent stickwork br More modern examples of violence include brawls bench clearing brawls fighting fan involvement physical abuse of officials and deliberately injuring opponents Violent actions such as kicking hitting from behind and prohibited stickwork are penalized with suspensions or fines Fighting or fisticuffs is also penalized but is considered by many hockey enthusiasts particularly in North America to be quite distinct from stick swinging or other violent acts They regard fighting as an entrenched acceptable and integral part of the game br On the ice referees may impose penalties for prohibited activities Off the ice the National Hockey League NHL sometimes fines suspends or expels players The criminal justice system has also occasionally charged and convicted players As a result hockey has become much more regulated and the violent element much more controlled This has been aided in no small part by dramatic increases in disciplinary processes and technology allowing for a high level of scrutiny of any event which occurs br br br History br Early hockey in particular was noted for its extreme violence to the point where two players were killed in three years during brawls In both cases the accused assailants were acquitted but these and other bloody incidents led to calls for the sport to clean up its act or be banned along with the likes of cockfighting
