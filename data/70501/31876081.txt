Sports Entertainment then bought the team in May and relocated the Jets to Winnipeg prior to the season making them the first NHL franchise to relocate since the Hartford Whalers became the Carolina Hurricanes in The team was renamed the Jets after Winnipeg s original WHA NHL team which relocated after the season due to financial issues to become the Phoenix later Arizona Coyotes br br br History br br br Original Winnipeg Jets br br On December Winnipeg was granted one of the founding franchises in the World Hockey Association WHA By many of the WHA s teams had folded but the Jets were absorbed into the NHL along with the Quebec Nordiques Edmonton Oilers and Hartford Whalers as part of the WHA NHL merger In team owner Barry Shenkarow sold the team to American businessmen Steven Gluckstern and Richard Burke Burke and Gluckstern originally planned to move the team to Minnesota which had lost the North Stars to Dallas in but eventually reached an agreement with Phoenix businessman Jerry Colangelo that would see the team move to Arizona and become the Phoenix Coyotes The original Winnipeg Jets played their last game on April br br br Atlanta Thrashers br br The city of Atlanta was awarded an NHL expansion franchise named the Atlanta Thrashers on June It was the second NHL franchise for Atlanta their first being the Atlanta Flames established in who departed for Calgary in to become the Calgary Flames The Thrashers began play in the season br In the years in Atlanta the Thrashers qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs once during the season and never won a playoff game Partially due to their lack of playoff success the team had difficulty drawing fans to attend their games in their final seasons br br br Winnipeg Jets present br Although they moved for financial reasons the Coyotes have never been profitable in Arizona Mounting losses eventually compelled the franchise to file for bankruptcy after the season The team was taken over by the league before the next season began As early as October there were rumours that True North Sports Entertainment the company that owns both Winnipeg s Canada Life Centre then known as MTS Centre and the American Hockey League AHL s Manitoba Moose had been invited to bid on the city s former franchise TNSE submitted a series of bids for the Coyotes which were taken seriously enough that the league drew up a tentative schedule with Winnipeg in place of Phoenix TNSE were minutes away from getting the Coyotes before he NHL shelved the bid after securing a large subsidy from the Coyotes municipal government In contrast to aggressive public bids by Jim Balsillie who had unsuccessfully attempted to use bankruptcy laws to skirt NHL rules and move the Coyotes to Hamilton the low key approach by TNSE and its chairman Mark Chipman was praised by NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and other owners raising their profile when the question of the Thrashers relocation came up br br On May the Winnipeg Sun confirmed that an agreement in principle had been reached for True North to purchase the Thrashers while Winnipeg Mayor Sam Katz announced that he was confident that the Thrashers relocation to Winnipeg would soon be officially announced On May at a press conference at the MTS Centre Bettman confirmed that the Atlanta Thrashers had been sold to True North and would relocate to Winnipeg for the season pending the approval of the sale and relocation by the NHL s Board of Governors which came at their June meeting The reported purchase price was million with million going to the NHL as a relocation fee After the announcement True North made preparations to move the Moose franchise to St John s Newfoundland and Labrador br Season ticket sales began June with Manitoba Moose season

holders Season tickets opened to the general public on June and sold out in minutes Once the Drive to was completed True North started a season ticket waiting list which was shut down after people signed up in two hours In July tickets for October home opener against the Montreal Canadiens were listed for an average price of on StubHub with an average selling price of br True North said the team s name would not be announced until after the successful completion of the season ticket drive at the earliest The team was not to be named the Thrashers since True North did not acquire the name in the transaction and the rights to that name and the Thrashers logo were retained by the ownership group in Atlanta br There was considerable support in Winnipeg to reuse Winnipeg Jets the name of the city s original WHA and NHL franchise though rumours spread that True North preferred Manitoba Moose Whiteout and Falcons were also considered but the latter was quickly rejected in deference to Atlanta which has another professional sports team by that name True North kept their selection secret until the NHL Entry Draft in St Paul Minnesota on June when Chipman introduced General Manager Kevin Cheveldayoff to make our first pick on behalf of the Winnipeg Jets br Before the franchise relocation was officially completed True North bought out the remaining years of General Manager Rick Dudley s contract on June Thrashers President Don Waddell who had been with the franchise since its inception had earlier announced he would not be moving with the team Kevin Cheveldayoff a former GM of the Chicago Wolves and former assistant GM of the Chicago Blackhawks was hired to replace Dudley four days later The team also retained Marcel Comeau the director of amateur scouting On June

Nashville were the defending holders of the Campbell Bowl Trophy from the previous season and holders of the Presidents Trophy for most points in the league during the NHL season This would also mark the first time that either iteration of the Winnipeg Jets had advanced beyond the second round of the playoffs Facing the Vegas Golden Knights in the Western Conference finals the Jets defeated the Golden Knights in the first game of the series However the Jets went on to lose the Western Conference finals with the Golden Knights defeating the Jets in the following four games in the series In the Jets clinched the playoffs but lost to the eventual Stanley Cup champion St Louis Blues in six games in the First Round br The Jets struggled in the season due to the departure of many high profile defencemen such as Jacob Trouba Tyler Myers and Dustin Byfuglien but were still in contention for a wild card spot when the league shut down due to the COVID pandemic The Jets were awarded a playoff spot as part of the expanded format but injuries to star forwards Mark Scheifele and Patrik Laine in the first game of their series against the Calgary Flames in the Qualifying Round handicapped the team and they were eliminated three games to one in the best of five series Goaltender Connor Hellebuyck was also awarded the Vezina Trophy for being the league s best goaltender The Jets won their fourth consecutive playoff berth in the season and swept the Edmonton Oilers in the First Round but were themselves swept in the Second Round by the Montreal Canadiens br In the season
