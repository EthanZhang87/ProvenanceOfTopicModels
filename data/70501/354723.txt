The Sports Network TSN is a Canadian English language discretionary sports specialty channel owned by CTV Specialty Television owned jointly by Bell Media and ESPN Inc itself a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company TSN was established by the Labatt Brewing Company in as part of the first group of Canadian specialty cable channels TSN is the largest specialty channel in Canada in terms of gross revenue with a total of CA million in revenue in br TSN broadcasts primarily from studio facilities located at Bell Media Agincourt in the Scarborough neighbourhood of Toronto Ontario Stewart Johnston currently serves as president of TSN a position he has held since TSN s networks focus on sports related programming including live and recorded event telecasts sports talk shows and other original programming br br br History br br br Early history br br Licensed by the Canadian Radio television and Telecommunications Commission CRTC on April as the Action Canada Sports Network the channel was launched by the Labatt Brewing Company on September of the same year as The Sports Network or TSN The network was founded under the leadership of Gordon Craig a former employee of CBC Sports alongside coverage of the then co owned Toronto Blue Jays TSN also reached a deal with ESPN itself only years old shortly before launch to provide additional programs Although reaching around subscribers TSN s early years were hindered by its initial status as a premium service bundled in a high cost package with movie channels such as First Choice and Superchannel alongside competition with free to air sports broadcasts by CBC Television among others br To improve the prominence of the network TSN sought to obtain the national cable rights to the National Hockey League rights that according to the league were not sold under the current arrangement with CBC However the task was complicated by claims by CBC that it owned the cable rights to the NHL along with the involvement of competing beer company Molson in Canadian NHL rights at the time With the help of a Molson employee who was a friend of Gordon a deal was reached between TSN Molson and the NHL to allow the network to broadcast games on cable br By December TSN had reached one million subscribers but the network s staff sought wider distribution for the channel as part of basic cable service the CRTC approved the network s request for permission to allow TSN to be carried as part of a basic cable lineup Mike Day producer of TSN s daily sports news program SportsDesk lamented about the shift to basic cable and the larger audience it would bring commenting that one night you re doing a news show that potentially has an audience of one million people and the next day the potential is five million people br In TSN acquired rights to the IIHF World Junior Championship otherwise known as the World Juniors which were previously broadcast by CBC TSN s coverage along with the recent Punch up in Piestany incident and a strong performance by Canada at the tournament in the mid s helped to significantly heighten the profile of the tournament in the country even more so than in other participating countries to the point that it is alongside U S college football bowl games regarded as a traditional sporting event of the holiday season in Canada br Due to CRTC regulations on the foreign ownership of broadcasters Labatt was forced to sell TSN and RDS upon its acquisition by Interbrew in Labatt s broadcasting assets were sold to a privately held consortium named NetStar Communications the investors of which included a number of Canadian firms as well as ESPN Inc which held an interest of about percent The same CRTC regulations prevented ESPN from establishing its own separate Canadian sports network outright so acquiring a minority stake in TSN became ESPN s alternative plan to get into the Canadian market The Sports Network launched its website TSN ca on October br In the CRTC began permitting TSN to offer an alternate feed which could be used to provide a regional opt out of the main TSN service for programming that must be blacked out in the rest of the country Alternate programming could make up a maximum of of the TSN schedule an average of hours a day br br br Acquisition by CTV expansion br In after ESPN blocked two attempts by the Canadian partners to sell NetStar to Canwest CTV Inc acquired the Canadian partners shares CTV Inc was acquired by Bell Canada and The Woodbridge Company publisher of The Globe and Mail newspaper as part of the joint venture Bell Globemedia in As a result of its purchase of TSN CTV would be forced to sell its regional sports network CTV Sportsnet eventually selling it to minority shareholder Rogers Media Following the acquisition TSN would move its operations to CTV s Agincourt complex in the Toronto district of Scarborough This oddity would become an inside joke between personalities on both networks who commonly referred to jumping between the two networks as crossing the parking lot br Following the sale TSN began to closer align its on air imaging with that of ESPN the most prominent effect of these changes came with the introduction of a new logo similar to that of ESPN and the re branding of TSN s flagship sports news program SportsDesk as SportsCentre a Canadian version in both format and spelling of ESPN s SportsCenter The CRTC however objected to plans to rename TSN as ESPN Canada citing concerns that it would make it appear that ESPN had de facto majority control or at the very least that TSN was ESPN s Canadian affiliate br TSN also launched a number of digital specialty channels in including a local version of ESPN Classic the NHL Network a network devoted to ice hockey and the National Hockey League and WTSN a channel dedicated to women s sports On August TSN became one of the first two specialty television services in Canada the other being fellow Bell property Discovery Channel to be available in high definition TSN s first live HD broadcast was of a Canadian Football League game between the Montreal Alouettes and Hamilton Tiger Cats it was to occur on the same day but was delayed to August due to a major electrical power failure that occurred the day prior br Beginning in the CRTC officially allowed TSN to operate national secondary digital feeds with limited amounts of alternative programming Following this development TSN began to use such a feed to broadcast additional programming that could not be aired on TSN due to scheduling conflicts or other events On August the feed evolved into a new hour channel similar to ESPN known as TSN Upon its launch TSN was legally considered a west coast timeshift feed of TSN although soon after TSN was launched the CRTC announced a proposal to remove genre exclusivity protections for mainstream sports and national news channels in the near future As a byproduct of the decision TSN would be allowed to use streamlined conditions of licence legally referred to as a Category C license as of September which state that the service may offer multiple feeds consistent with their licensed programming format without any restrictions on alternate programming TSN was officially permitted to use these streamlined conditions of licence on February br br br Acquisition by Bell TSN Radio br On September Bell Canada announced plans to re acquire of CTVglobemedia s broadcasting arm including its majority control of TSN Under the deal Woodbridge Company Limited Torstar and the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan would together receive billion in either cash or equity in BCE while BCE would also assume billion in debt BCE s existing equity interest is million for a total transaction value of billion Woodbridge has since simultaneously regained majority control of The Globe and Mail with Bell retaining a interest in December The deal closed on April after the CRTC approved the sale on March the new company became known as Bell Media br br After a longstanding speculation about TSN s interest in launching its own TSN branded radio network similarly to its U S counterpart TSN entered radio broadcasting with the launch of the first TSN Radio station a relaunch of AM station CHUM in Toronto on April Bell Media s Bell Media Radio division already operated several sports radio stations elsewhere in Canada most of which were branded as The Team a name introduced by previous owner CHUM Limited in its own failed attempt at establishing a national sports radio network it was reported that Bell could theoretically relaunch these other stations under the TSN Radio brand in the future br Also in TSN acquired broadcast rights to the new Winnipeg Jets TSN would establish another part time feed TSN Jets to broadcast the games Additionally co owned CFRW would also gain radio rights to the new Jets CFRW along with Montreal station CKGM also migrated to the TSN Radio brand on October Additionally Bell would also launch TSN Mobile TV streaming versions of TSN and TSN offered through Bell Mobility s Mobile TV services br On December the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan announced that it would sell its majority stake in Maple Leaf Sports Entertainment to two major telecommunications companies Bell Canada TSN s main parent company and Rogers Communications owners of the competing Sportsnet chain of sports channels with a share each Larry Tanenbaum increased his ownership to a quarter of the company as well in a deal expected to be valued at around billion in total The deal was completed in summer following the approval of Canada s Competition Bureau the Canadian Radio television and Telecommunications Commission with regards to MLSE s television channels as well as the leagues for each of MLSE s main sports franchises The deal was expected to have a major impact on future broadcast rights for MLSE s teams including the Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Raptors as their ownership of the teams will offer enhanced coverage for the team through new platforms such as mobile television br In March TSN launched its TV Everywhere service TSN Go allowing subscribers to TSN on participating service providers to stream TSN networks online or through a mobile app On launch TSN Go was available exclusively to Bell Satellite TV and Rogers Cable subscribers It has since been expanded to other providers such as Shaw br br br Loss of national NHL rights expansion into regional service br Following the announcement of Bell and Rogers acquisition of MLSE concerns were again raised by critics speculating that Bell Media could attempt to acquire full rights to the NHL after CBC s current contract with the league expires following the season using their ownership of the Toronto Maple Leafs the NHL s highest valued franchise as an impetus for such a coup Concerns were also raised that such an arrangement could prevent wireless service providers other than Bell and Rogers from accessing its content the CRTC had ruled in favour of Telus in a decision requiring Bell and other media companies to allow other competing wireless providers access to its content and not exclusively tie it to their own service as they had attempted to do with TSN Mobile TV However in November Rogers Communications announced that it had reached a year deal to become the sole national television rightsholder of the NHL beginning in the season br Critics considered Rogers move to be a major blow against Bell and TSN showing concerns for how the network could sustain itself without what is considered a key property in Canadian sports broadcasting However they also acknowledged the network s continuing rights to IIHF hockey tournaments including the popular World Junior Hockey Championships the Canadian Football League who renewed their contract with TSN without allowing any outside bidders in and whose current contract lasts through and TSN s growing regional NHL rights portfolio including the Maple Leafs which would beginning in the same season air games on TSN per season In a series of Twitter posts by TSN personality Bob McKenzie he explained that even with the loss of national NHL rights TSN s goal was to remain THE source for all things hockey through its analysis programs and regional coverage and that this was not the first time that TSN had lost its cable rights to the NHL having lost them to CTV Sportsnet for a period upon its launch in br On May TSN announced that it would launch three new channels TSN TSN and TSN in September to coincide with the network s th anniversary TSN president Stewart Johnston described the expansion as an important evolution for the network as it would allow TSN to make more efficient use of its portfolio of sports properties the network promoted that these new channels would allow TSN to broadcast a larger amount of ESPN content and live events particularly including expanded coverage of major events such as Grand Slam tennis curling tournaments and the NCAA basketball tournament with multiple games occurring simultaneously Although the expansion was discussed by TSN staff as early as critics considered the loss of NHL rights to Rogers which had recently launched its seventh Sportsnet branded television service with its acquisition of The Score now Sportsnet to be a catalyst for the move as TSN attempts to defend its position as the largest specialty television service in Canada in terms of total revenue The launch date of these new channels were pushed up to August in order to allow multi court coverage of the US Open tennis tournament which began the same day TSN also announced that it would use these new channels to house regional NHL games beginning in the season featuring the Jets Maple Leafs and Ottawa Senators At the same time Dave Krikst created BarDown a segment on TSN s YouTube page focused on attracting a younger audience Made up of TSN producers Jesse Pollock Corwin McCallum Daniel Zakrzewski Luca Celebre and others they post hockey focused quizzes and beer league content br On January TSN announced that it would present its first telecast in K ultra high definition a Toronto Raptors basketball game on January It was followed by a slate of regional NHL games and other Raptors games in the format br On June TSN announced that it would offer its channels as part of an over the top subscription service branded as TSN Direct By late this service had been rebranded to simply TSN br On January TSN announced a separate direct to consumer service called TSN which launched the same day with a limited time free preview The service which is comparable but not entirely equivalent to ESPN initially includes Canadian rights to PGA Tour Live acquired after Warner Bros Discovery s GolfTV ceased operations the NTT IndyCar Series previously on Sportsnet the relaunching XFL as well as various other properties such as La Liga and AEW Rampage which were previously available as bonus streams to subscribers of the regular TSN service br br br Channels br br As is permitted for all Category C sports services the TSN licence is permitted to have multiple channels and currently encompasses all of the channels listed in the table below However unlike premium services like Crave subscribers receiving one TSN channel are not necessarily automatically entitled to receive all additional channels and in many cases they are or previously were only available by paying a separate charge to a service provider For example until Rogers Cable customers were required to subscribe to the HD Specialty Pack add on in order to receive TSN HD whereas most other HD simulcast channels were provided at no additional charge On many providers including Rogers TSN and were included in a single package when those feeds launched but TSN was provided only as part of a separate higher tier package br On May TSN announced plans to launch three additional multiplex channels for a total of five hour national channels The existing TSN service was replaced by four regionally focused channels referred to as feeds TSN and similar to the Sportsnet regional channels All five channels are available nationally but on most local providers the channel location previously occupied by TSN s primary service was filled by the appropriate regional feed While major sports telecasts are simulcast across TSN and to ensure national coverage alternative studio shows and live events can also be split across the channels The feeds carry a small amount of programming tailored towards their respective regions including simulcasts of lunch hour shows from TSN Radio stations in their relevant region and regional NHL coverage When TV listings and promotions make a reference to a program airing on the TSN network or simply TSN without disambiguation it can normally be assumed that the program will be simulcast on TSN and br Their launch date was originally announced as September to coincide with the th anniversary of TSN s launch but was moved up to August in order to accommodate multiple court coverage throughout the US Open Prior to the launch of the additional feeds Bell executives stated that the expanded five channel service would be offered for the same rate as was charged at the time for TSN and TSN together Notwithstanding this claim some providers including Shaw Cable have elected to charge extra for some of the new feeds Most major Canadian television providers carried the new channels upon their launch including Bell Cogeco Eastlink MTS SaskTel Shaw Source Cable Rogers and Telus br Videotron a cable provider which primarily serves the province of Quebec was a notable hold out for the new feeds On October a Monday Night Football game was left unavailable in English due to a rained out MLB playoff game RDS was able to carry the game in French to Videotron subscribers because TSN the only feed it carried was airing a regional Ottawa Senators Florida Panthers NHL game a game which also attracted infamy for having the lowest attendance of any Panthers game in team history On October Videotron president Manon Brouillette responded to complaints by subscribers surrounding the incident and confirmed that it had reached a deal in September to carry the new feeds the addition of TSN to the lineup was accelerated to October to ensure the availability of that week s Monday Night Football game with the remainder added on October On November a one time overflow channel was used to broadcast a regional Ottawa Senators game due to conflicts with the th Grey Cup which featured the Ottawa RedBlacks and was being simulcast across all TSN regional feeds br The current TSN feeds and any programming unique to each feed as per TSN
