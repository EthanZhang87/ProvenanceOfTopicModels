id: 502359
In ice hockey the captain is the player designated by a team as the only person authorized to speak with the game officials regarding rule interpretations when the captain is on the ice At most levels of play each team must designate one captain and a number of alternate captains usually two or three who speak to the officials when the captain is on the bench Captains wear a C on their sweaters while alternate captains wear an A br Officially captains have no other responsibility or authority although they may depending on the league or individual team have various informal duties such as participation in pre game ceremonies or other events outside the game As with most team sports that designate captains the captain is usually a well respected player and a team leader br br br Responsibilities and importance br br According to International Ice Hockey Federation IIHF and National Hockey League NHL rules the only player allowed to speak with referees about rule interpretations is the captain or if the captain is not on the ice an alternate captain br Although the rules do not specify any other distinction between the captain and their teammates the captain has numerous responsibilities to the team particularly in North American professional hockey The captain is a dressing room leader and also represents the players concerns to management br The captain is often considered the primary representative of the team to the public and sometimes is responsible for organizing the team s social functions and performing ceremonial on ice functions such as award presentations or ceremonial faceoffs br br br Selection br NHL teams need not designate the same player as captain from game to game though most teams do When Boston Bruins captain Terry O Reilly retired Ray Bourque and Rick Middleton were named as co captains of the team for the season Middleton wore the C during home games and Bourque for road games during the season s first half and the two switched for the second half This arrangement continued until Middleton retired in and Bourque became the sole captain Some teams name two such as the Buffalo Sabres during the and NHL seasons or three such as the Vancouver Canucks during the season captains for a season Some teams rotate captains rather than keep one for an extended period of time the Minnesota Wild rotated captaincy every one or two months until the season when Mikko Koivu was named the first permanent captain since the franchise s inception During each NHL game however only one player can officially be designated as captain br Captains are usually veteran players though on occasion younger players are chosen The selection is often seen as an important moment for a team and one that can affect the team s and newly appointed captain s performance Captains are selected by different means in some instances teams have held votes among their players to choose a team captain while on other occasions the choice was made by team management Captains are often chosen due to their seniority in the game and years of service with their current club However franchise players current or emerging stars have also been named captains Though not required many captains have previously served as alternate captains of their team Some selections or removals of NHL captaincies have been controversial more so than the other North American professional sports leagues For instance in Canada men s national ice hockey team then General Manager Bobby Clarke selected Eric Lindros for the Winter Olympics considered somewhat controversial as Lindros was chosen over longer tenured NHL captains such as Steve Yzerman Ray Bourque and Wayne Gretzky Clarke was also general manager of the Philadelphia Flyers whom Lindros played for professionally In when the relationship between Clarke and Lindros deteriorated during contentious contract negotiations and the team s handling of Lindros injuries the team captaincy was issued to Eric Desjardins Tampa Bay Lightning head coach John Tortorella stripped the captaincy from Vincent Lecavalier after disagreements about the player s skills and conditioning practices In Darryl Sittler angrily resigned the captaincy by cutting off the C from his Toronto Maple Leafs jersey with scissors in protest of Harold Ballard s trade of his best friend Lanny McDonald Ballard likened Sittler s actions to flag burning br The rules of the IIHF NHL and Hockey Canada do not permit goaltenders to be designated as on ice captains due to the logistical challenge of having the goaltender relay rules discussions between referees and coaches and then return to the crease The NHL introduced a rule prohibiting the goaltender from being a captain following the season see Goaltender captains below br br br Alternate captains br br Teams may designate alternate captains often erroneously called assistant captains Alternate captains wear the letter A on their jerseys in the same manner that team captains wear the C br In the NHL teams may appoint a captain and up to two alternate captains or they may appoint three alternate captains and thus no captain A team with a player coach may also have no captain or alternate captains A team commonly has three alternate captains when the team has not selected a captain or when the serving captain is injured and misses a game In the National Hockey League it is common for a team to have three alternate captains if no one is assigned captain the current captain is absent or a goaltender is named as the captain International and USA amateur rules do not allow this they stipulate that each team must appoint a captain and not more than two alternate captains In the Ontario Hockey League OHL Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League QMJHL Western Hockey League WHL and minor leagues under the jurisdiction of Hockey Canada teams are allowed to have a captain with up to three alternate captains br If the team chooses to not appoint a captain they are not permitted to appoint a fourth alternate captain When the captain is off the ice or unavailable for the game any alternate captain on the ice is responsible for fulfilling the captain s official role as liaison to the referees br NHL teams may choose alternate captains from game to game or appoint regular alternate captains for the season In North America alternate captains perform many of the same leadership and team building roles as the captain In the season the Boston Bruins had three alternate captains Johnny Bucyk Phil Esposito and Ed Westfall instead of a captain sporting the C However as Bucyk was the most senior of the alternate captains he was first one to be presented the Stanley Cup when the team won the championship in and br In the NCAA a team can designate a single alternate captain to assume the role of captain should the captain be unavailable due to injury or penalty br br br Designation on uniform br br The letter C or A is attached to the jersey of the team s captain and alternate captains commonly sewn at higher levels of play though removable insignia exist so the C or A designation can be easily changed The designation is traditionally placed on the left side of the sweater though the IIHF NHL and NCAA rules specify only that it must be in a conspicuous location on the front of the player s sweater Four teams in the NHL have sweaters where the positioning of the crest on the front leaves insufficient space on the left for the letter the Detroit Red Wings who place the letter on the right side of the home and road jerseys since the season while the Arizona Coyotes Carolina Hurricanes and New Jersey Devils all have alternate jerseys where the captain s patch is on the right br In the
