title: Blood alcohol content
id: 4845
Blood alcohol content BAC also called blood alcohol concentration or blood alcohol level is a measurement of alcohol intoxication used for legal or medical purposes br BAC is expressed as mass of alcohol per volume of blood In the US and many international publications BAC levels are written as a percentage such as meaning that there is g of alcohol for every mL of blood In different countries the maximum permitted BAC when driving ranges from the limit of detection zero tolerance to BAC levels above are potentially fatal br br br Units of measurement br BAC is generally defined as a fraction of weight of alcohol per volume of blood with an SI coherent derived unit of kg m or equivalently grams per liter g L Countries differ in how this quantity is normally expressed Common formats are listed in the table below For example the US and many international publications present BAC as a percentage such as This would be interpreted as grams per deciliter of blood This same concentration could be expressed as or mg in other countries br br It is also possible to use other units For example in the s Widmark measured alcohol and blood by mass and thus reported his concentrations in units of g kg or mg g weight alcohol per weight blood mL of blood has a mass of approximately grams thus a mass volume BAC of g L corresponds to a mass mass BAC of mg g Sweden Denmark Norway Finland Germany and Switzerland use mass mass concentrations in their laws but this distinction is often skipped over in public materials implicitly assuming that L of blood weighs kg br In pharmacokinetics it is common to use the amount of substance in moles to quantify the dose As the molar mass of ethanol is g mol a BAC of g L is mmol L mM br br br Effects by alcohol level br br The magnitude of sensory impairment may vary in people of differing weights The NIAAA defines the term binge drinking as a pattern of drinking that brings a person s blood alcohol concentration BAC to grams percent or above br br br Estimation br br br Direct measurement br Blood samples for BAC analysis are typically obtained by taking a venous blood sample from the arm A variety of methods exist for determining blood alcohol concentration in a blood sample Forensic laboratories typically use headspace gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry or flame ionization detection as this method is accurate and efficient Hospitals typically use enzyme multiplied immunoassay which measures the co enzyme NADH This method is more subject to error but may be performed rapidly in parallel with other blood sample measurements br In Germany BAC is determined by measuring the serum level and then converting to whole blood by dividing by the factor This calculation underestimates BAC by to compared to other methods br br br By breathalyzer br br The amount of alcohol on the breath can be measured without requiring drawing blood by blowing into a breathalyzer resulting in a breath alcohol content BrAC The BrAC specifically correlates with the concentration of alcohol in arterial blood satisfying the equation BACarterial BrAC Its correlation with the standard BAC found by drawing venous blood is less strong Jurisdictions vary in the statutory conversion factor from BrAC to BAC from to Many factors may affect the accuracy of a breathalyzer test but they are the most common method for measuring alcohol concentrations in most jurisdictions br br br By intake br br Blood alcohol content can be quickly estimated by a model developed by Swedish professor Erik Widmark in the s The model corresponds to a pharmacokinetic single compartment model with instantaneous absorption and zero order kinetics for elimination The model is most accurate when used to estimate BAC a few hours after drinking a single dose of alcohol in a fasted state and can be within CV of the true value It is not at all realistic for the absorption phase and is not accurate for BAC levels below g L alcohol is not eliminated as quickly as predicted and consumption with food overestimating the peak BAC and time to return to zero The equation varies depending on the units and

example grams of ethanol br br br By training br If individuals are asked to estimate their BAC then given accurate feedback via a breathalyzer and this procedure is repeated a number of times during a drinking session studies show that these individuals can learn to discriminate their BAC to within a mean error of mg mL BAC The ability is robust to different types of alcohol different drink quantities and drinks with unknown levels of alcohol Trained individuals can even drink alcoholic drinks so as to adjust or maintain their BAC at a desired level Training the ability does not appear to require any information or procedure besides breathalyzer feedback although most studies have provided information such as intoxication symptoms at different BAC levels Subjects continue to retain the ability one month after training br br br Post mortem br After fatal accidents it is common to check the blood alcohol levels of involved persons However soon after death the body begins to putrefy a biological process which produces ethanol This can make it difficult to conclusively determine the blood alcohol content in autopsies particularly in bodies recovered from water For instance following the Moorgate tube crash the driver s kidneys had a blood alcohol concentration of mg mL but it could not be established how much of this could be attributed to natural decomposition Newer research has shown that vitreous eye fluid provides an accurate estimate of blood alcohol concentration that is less subject to the effects of decomposition or contamination br br br Legal limits br br For purposes of law enforcement blood alcohol content is used to define intoxication and provides a rough measure of impairment Although the degree of impairment may vary among individuals with the same blood alcohol content it can be measured objectively and is therefore legally useful and difficult to contest in court Most countries forbid operation of motor vehicles and heavy machinery above prescribed levels of blood alcohol content Operation of boats and aircraft is also regulated Some jurisdictions also regulate bicycling under the influence The alcohol level at which a person is considered legally impaired to drive varies by country br br br Test assumptions br br br Extrapolation br Retrograde extrapolation is the mathematical process by which someone s blood alcohol concentration at the time of driving is estimated by projecting backwards from a later chemical test This involves estimating the absorption and elimination of alcohol in the interim between driving and testing The rate of elimination in the average person is commonly estimated at to grams per deciliter per hour g dL h although again this can vary from person to person and in a given person from one moment to another Metabolism can be affected by numerous factors including such things as body temperature the type of alcoholic beverage consumed and the amount and type of food consumed br In an increasing number of states laws have been enacted to facilitate this speculative task the blood alcohol content at the time of driving is legally presumed to be the same as when later tested There are usually time limits put on this presumption commonly two or three hours and the defendant is permitted to offer evidence to rebut this presumption br Forward extrapolation can also be attempted If the amount of alcohol consumed is known along with such variables as the weight and sex of the subject and period and rate of consumption the blood alcohol level can be estimated by extrapolating forward Although subject to the same infirmities as retrograde extrapolation guessing based upon averages and unknown variables this can be relevant in estimating BAC when driving and or corroborating or contradicting the results of a later chemical test br br br Metabolism br br The pharmacokinetics of ethanol are well characterized by the ADME acronym absorption distribution metabolism excretion Besides the dose ingested factors such as the person s total body water speed of drinking the drink s nutritional content and the contents of the stomach all influence the profile of blood alcohol content BAC over time Breath alcohol content BrAC and BAC have similar profile shapes so most forensic pharmacokinetic calculations can be done with either Relatively few studies directly compare BrAC and BAC within subjects and characterize the difference in pharmacokinetic parameters Comparing arterial and venous BAC arterial BAC is higher during the absorption phase and lower in the postabsorptive declining phase br br br Highest levels br br There have been reported cases of blood alcohol content higher than br br In a year old woman was admitted to the UCLA emergency room with a serum alcohol content of corresponding to a blood alcohol content of She was alert and oriented to person and place and survived Serum alcohol concentration is not equal to nor calculated in the
