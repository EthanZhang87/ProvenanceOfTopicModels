an save percentage br Malarchuk made his NHL debut with the Nordiques on December getting the start in goal in a road game against the Buffalo Sabres The Nordiques were dissatisfied with back up goaltender Michel Plasse at the time and decided to give Malarchuk a look in spite of his young age he had just turned a few months earlier He did well enough in his first game a tie but the second one two days later was a lot tougher as he faced the defending Stanley Cup champions the New York Islanders The Nordiques favored a wide open style of play at the time and Malarchuk was left largely to his own devices and faced shots letting goals past him in a wild loss in what was the highest scoring game in the history of the Nassau Coliseum Having failed his audition he was returned to the American Hockey League after that game and did not come back until the following season Quebec traded Plasse to the Hartford Whalers later that season in return for John Garrett addressing the team s need for a reliable back up goaltender for Dan Bouchard br Malarchuk played sparingly in the NHL the next two seasons then not at all in as he spent the majority of these three years with the Fredericton Express in the AHL He became the Nordiques primary goaltender in keeping the job for two seasons although there was continual controversy over whether he or local favorite Mario Gosselin should be the starter In a statistical quirk during the NHL Playoffs he was not credited with a game played but still was assessed with penalty minutes In Game of the Adams Division Finals against the Montreal Canadiens on April he was handed both a major penalty and a game misconduct for leaving his team s bench to take part in an on ice brawl He was traded to the Washington Capitals after the season alongside Dale Hunter in return for Ga tan Duchesne Alan Haworth and a first round choice in the NHL Entry Draft that eventually landed the Nordiques Joe Sakic serving as the Capitals starting goaltender for the next season and a half Then on March Malarchuk was traded to the Buffalo Sabres along with Grant Ledyard and a sixth round pick Brian Holzinger in exchange for Calle Johansson and a second round pick Byron Dafoe It was sixteen days later in just his sixth game with the Sabres that Malarchuk would suffer his notorious life threatening neck injury br br br Neck injury br During a game between the visiting St Louis Blues and Malarchuk s Buffalo Sabres on March Steve Tuttle of the Blues and Uwe Krupp of the Sabres crashed hard into the goal crease during play As they collided

able to leave the ice on his own feet with the assistance of his team s athletic trainer Jim Pizzutelli Many spectators were physically sickened by the sight The excessive amount of blood that Malarchuk lost caused eleven fans to faint two more to have heart attacks and three players to vomit on the ice Local television cameras covering the game cut away from the sight of Malarchuk bleeding after noticing what had happened and Sabres announcers Ted Darling and Mike Robitaille were audibly shaken At the production room of the national cable sports highlight show a producer scrolled his tape back to show the event to two other producers who were both horrified by the sight br Malarchuk meanwhile believed that he was going to die All I wanted to do was get off the ice said Malarchuk My mother was watching the game on TV and I didn t want her to see me die Aware that his mother had been watching the game on TV he had an equipment manager call and tell her he loved her Then he asked for a priest br Malarchuk s life was saved due to quick action by the Sabres athletic trainer Jim Pizzutelli a former US Army combat medic who had served in the Vietnam War He gripped Malarchuk s neck and pinched off the blood vessels not letting go until doctors arrived to begin stabilizing the wound He led Malarchuk off the ice then applied extreme pressure by kneeling on his collarbone a procedure designed to produce a low breathing rate and low metabolic state which is preferable to exsanguination Malarchuk was conscious and talking on the way to the hospital and jokingly asked paramedics if they could bring him back in time for the third period The game resumed when league personnel received word that Malarchuk was in stable condition br Malarchuk lost litres imp gal US gal

suffered an injury similar to Malarchuk s after Olli Jokinen s skate blade cut the front of Zedn k s neck lacerating his common carotid artery causing immediate massive blood loss Although Malarchuk initially refused to view the footage of Zedn k s injury upon viewing it he was taken aback saying that he did not think his memory of his own incident would come back after nearly years He sought
