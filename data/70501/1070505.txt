The Quebec Nordiques French Nordiques de Qu bec pronounced n dz k in Quebec French nor DEEKS in Canadian English translated Northmen or Northerners were a professional ice hockey team based in Quebec City The Nordiques played in the World Hockey Association and the National Hockey League The franchise was relocated to Denver in May and renamed the Colorado Avalanche They played their home games at the Colis e de Qu bec from to br The Nordiques were the only major professional sports team based in Quebec City in the modern era and one of two ever the other the Quebec Bulldogs played in the National Hockey Association NHA from to and one season in the NHL in br br br History br br br Beginnings in the WHA br br The Quebec Nordiques formed as one of the original World Hockey Association teams in The franchise was originally awarded to a group in San Francisco and sold to a consortium of Quebec City based businessmen who owned the highly profitable Quebec Remparts junior team They bought the team after the American Hockey League team the Quebec Aces moved south to Richmond Virginia br The team was renamed the Quebec Nordiques because they were one of the northernmost teams in professional sports in North America Quebec City is located at degrees north latitude Nordiques translated from French to English means Northerners or Northmen The only WHA teams located farther north were the Alberta Oilers who changed their name to the Edmonton Oilers after one season Calgary Cowboys Vancouver Blazers and Winnipeg Jets br The Nordiques first head coach was the legendary Maurice Rocket Richard but he only lasted two games a loss to the Cleveland Crusaders and a win against the Alberta Oilers Richard decided coaching was not his forte and stepped down br The Nordiques first star was two way defenceman J C Tremblay who led the WHA in assists in the league s first season and would be named a league All Star for his first four years in Quebec The next season Serge Bernier and Rejean Houle joined the Nordiques In season they finally made the playoffs with the help of the high scoring Marc Tardif the year also saw the debut of Real Cloutier who would be one of the WHA s stars They beat the Phoenix Roadrunners and the Minnesota Fighting Saints to reach the finals where they were swept in four games by the Gordie Howe led Houston Aeros br The next season saw the squad become a high flying offensive juggernaut becoming the only team in major professional history to have five players break points Tardif Cloutier Chris Bordeleau Bernier and Houle a mark which still stands as of The season ended in disappointment as the Nordiques lost to the Calgary Cowboys in the first round of the playoffs after losing Marc Tardif to injury after a controversial hit by the Cowboys Rick Jodzio br Despite injuries to Tardif and an aging Tremblay the Nordiques finally captured the Avco World Trophy in as they took out the New England Whalers and the Indianapolis Racers in five games before beating the Winnipeg Jets in seven behind Bernier s record points in playoff games They represented Canada at the Izvestia Hockey Tournament in Moscow finishing last with an record br By the WHA was in crisis and Marcel Aubut by then the team s president under ownership of the Carling O Keefe Brewery began checking on interest in the NHL The Nordiques were unable to defend their title and fell in the playoffs to the New England Whalers The season would be the final one for the WHA and for J C Tremblay who retired at the end of the season and had his jersey retired br br br s br br As part of the NHL WHA merger the WHA insisted on including all of its surviving Canadian teams including the Nordiques among the teams taken into the NHL at the end of the season As a result the Nordiques entered the NHL along with the Whalers Oilers and Jets The Nordiques were placed in the Adams Division of the Wales Conference br Forced to let all but three players go in a dispersal draft the Nordiques sank to the bottom of the standings They finished the NHL season with the second worst record in the league despite the play of promising rookie left winger Michel Goulet An early highlight to the otherwise dreary season came when Real Cloutier became the second NHL player following Alex Smart ever to score a hat trick in his first NHL game br In August the Nordiques announced that they signed newly defected brothers Peter and Anton Stastny members of the Czechoslovak national team since they drafted Anton in the amateur draft Their brother Marian would follow and sign with Quebec in the summer of The following season led by Peter Stastny s point Calder Memorial Trophy winning performance the Nordiques made the NHL playoffs for the first time but fell in the best of five opening round in five games to the Philadelphia Flyers br Led by Goulet and Peter Stastny the Nordiques made the playoffs seven years in a row However due to the playoff structure during most of the s the Nordiques faced the near certainty of having to get past either the Montreal Canadiens or Boston Bruins or both to make it to the conference finals In despite notching only points in the regular season they defeated the Canadiens and Bruins both in winner take all games on the road Their Cinderella run ended when they were swept by the defending champion New York Islanders in the conference finals br The intraprovincial rivalry with the Canadiens intensified during the NHL season culminating in the infamous Good Friday Massacre or Vendredi Saint as it is called in francophone Canada during the playoffs The Canadiens scored five unanswered goals in the third period of Game at the Montreal Forum to eliminate the Nordiques The goals all came after Peter Stastny and Dale Hunter were ejected in the brawl br In Montreal and Quebec battled for the Adams Division championship The Nordiques finished with points at the time their highest point total as an NHL team However the Canadiens won the division by three points solidified by a Canadiens thrashing of the Nordiques at The Forum in the final week of the regular season This was still enough however for the Nordiques to garner home ice advantage for the first time ever as an NHL team After being pushed to five games by the Buffalo Sabres they exacted revenge on the Canadiens in the Adams finals by ousting them in seven games Peter Stastny clinched the series with an overtime goal in the seventh game at the Forum They then took the powerful Philadelphia Flyers who had the league s best record to six games br br They won their first NHL division title in and as it turned out one of their two in Quebec the other in the season but a defensive collapse in the playoffs allowed the Hartford Whalers to sweep the Nordiques in three games br The next season the Nordiques met the Whalers in the playoffs for the second straight season this time the Nords got their revenge beating Hartford in six games The next round saw more of the Nordiques Canadiens rivalry as the playoff series went to seven games with the Canadiens coming out on top after that the Nords would not return to the playoffs again until In that same season when Quebec hosted Rendez Vous an alteration of the All Star Game to include the Soviet national team a costumed mascot Badaboum a fuzzy roly poly blue creature began entertaining fans at the Colis e with his bizarre dance routines Badaboum was created just for Rendez Vous but generated such a following that the Nordiques made him a permanent fixture at home games br Decline began the following season The Nordiques finished last in their division the first of five straight years of finishing at the bottom of the Adams Division and missed the playoffs for the first time in eight years The slide continued in they had the league s worst record br Michel Bergeron who had coached the team from to returned for The season was also highlighted by the arrival of Hall of Famer Guy Lafleur who turned down a lucrative offer from the Los Angeles Kings and chose instead to finish his career in his home province It soon became clear Lafleur s best years were far behind him The Flower managed only goals in games with Quebec over two seasons The season saw the Nordiques bottom out with a record of points easily the worst record in the league and not even half the point total of the next worst team the Vancouver Canucks It is still the worst record in Nordiques Avalanche history both NHL and WHA and one of the worst for a non expansion team since It was also the second of three straight seasons with the worst record in the league br Michel Goulet and Peter Stastny were traded in winding up with the Chicago Blackhawks and New Jersey Devils respectively Despite the stellar play of young forward Joe Sakic the Nordiques struggled throughout the late s and early s However in the NHL Entry Draft they drafted Swedish prospect Mats Sundin making him the first European to be selected first overall in the NHL draft The following year Quebec chose first again taking Owen Nolan br br br s br br br Lindros draft and trade br br In the Nordiques once again had the first overall pick in the NHL Entry Draft They picked junior star Eric Lindros even though he had let it be known well in advance that he would never play for Quebec Among the reasons Lindros cited distance lack of marketing potential and having to speak French After the Nordiques selected him anyway Lindros then refused to wear the team jersey on Draft Day and only held it for press photographs Lindros on advice of his mother Bonnie refused to sign with the team and began a holdout that lasted over a year The Nordiques president publicly announced that they would make Lindros the centrepiece of their franchise turnaround and refused to trade Lindros saying that he would not have a career in the NHL as long as he held out Some of the Nordiques wanted to move on without Lindros as Joe Sakic commented We only want players here who have the passion to play the game I m tired of hearing that name He s not here and there are a lot of others in this locker room who really care about the game Meanwhile the Nordiques finished with another dreadful season in missing the point barrier for the fifth year in a row For the first time since the Nordiques did not finish with the NHL s worst record as they finished ahead of the expansion San Jose Sharks in the overall standings br On June after confusion over whether Quebec had traded Lindros rights to the Philadelphia Flyers or New York Rangers was settled by an arbitrator the Nordiques sent Lindros to the Flyers in exchange for forwards Peter Forsberg and Mike Ricci goaltender Ron Hextall defencemen Steve Duchesne and Kerry Huffman future considerations which eventually became enforcer Chris Simon two first round picks and US million One of the draft picks was used by the Nordiques to select goaltender Jocelyn Thibault the other was traded twice and ultimately used by the Washington Capitals to select Nolan Baumgartner br After the trade Lindros said that his refusal to play for the Nordiques had nothing to do with the language question and more to do with what he saw as a lack of winning spirit in the Nordiques organization However in Lindros said that he simply did not want to play for a team owned by Aubut br The deal transformed the Nordiques from league doormats to a legitimate Stanley Cup contender almost overnight Forsberg won the Calder Memorial Trophy in his first season with the Nordiques and would be one of the cornerstones of the Nordiques Avalanche franchise for almost a decade with his playmaking and physical presence albeit being out with injury for periods of time like Lindros winning the Hart and Art Ross trophies in Ricci would give six useful seasons to the franchise before being traded Hextall was moved after a single season to the New York Islanders and in return the Nordiques got Mark Fitzpatrick who would go on to be left unprotected in the NHL Expansion Draft in which he was claimed by the Florida Panthers and a first round pick which the Nordiques used to select Adam Deadmarsh who would be a key member of the Avalanche Cup winning teams Thibault would be traded for Montreal goalie Patrick Roy after the franchise moved to Denver br br br br br During the NHL season these new players along with Sakic now a bona fide NHL All Star and the rapidly developing Sundin and Nolan led Quebec to the biggest single season turnaround in NHL history They leaped from points in the previous season to in the process going from the second worst record in the league to the fourth best behind only Pittsburgh Boston and Chicago as well as notching the franchise s first point season as an NHL team They made the playoffs for the first time in six seasons and also garnered home ice advantage in the first round for only the third time ever as an NHL team However they fell to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Canadiens in the first round winning the first two games but then losing the next four due to inspired goaltending from Montreal s Patrick Roy Sakic and Sundin both scored over points each and head coach Pierre Page was a finalist for the Jack Adams Award br In the NHL renamed their conferences and divisions to better reflect geography the Nordiques would be situated in the Northeast Division of the Eastern Conference for their last two seasons of play in Quebec The Nordiques missed the playoffs in as they struggled with injuries After that season Sundin was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in return for Wendel Clark This trade was controversial for both teams as Sundin was one of the Nordiques rising talents while Clark was the Leafs captain and fan favourite While Clark performed respectably he then became embroiled in a contract dispute after the season ended and was sent to the New York Islanders br br br Final season and move to Colorado br br For the season Marc Crawford was hired as the new head coach and Forsberg was deemed ready to finally join the team but first there was the problem of a lockout In the shortened season of games the Nordiques finished with the best record in the Eastern Conference However the team faltered in the postseason and was eliminated in the first round by the defending Stanley Cup champion New York Rangers in six games br The playoff loss proved to be the Nordiques swan song as the team s financial troubles increasingly took centre stage even in the face of renewed fan support over the previous three years The league s Canadian teams found it difficult to compete in a new age of rising player salaries and a weakening Canadian dollar Quebec City was by far the smallest market in the NHL it was also the second smallest major league city in North America behind only Green Bay Wisconsin home of the National Football League s Green Bay Packers However the Packers had long drawn support from the nearby major market of Milwaukee a luxury the Nordiques did not have br The Nordiques also faced a unique disadvantage due to Quebec City s status as a virtually monolingual francophone city There were no privately owned anglophone radio stations and only one privately owned anglophone television station The only anglophone newspaper was a weekly The near total lack of English language media limited the Nordiques marketability even in their best years and made many non French speaking players wary of playing for them br While Aubut never lost money on the Nordiques he feared unsustainable losses without a bailout from Quebec s provincial government However Premier Jacques Parizeau turned the request down as few in Quebec were willing to be seen as subsidizing a hockey club that paid multimillion dollar salaries Finally in May shortly after the Nordiques were eliminated from the playoffs Aubut announced the acceptance of an offer from COMSAT Entertainment Group owner of the National Basketball Association s Denver Nuggets to move the team to Denver where it was renamed the Colorado Avalanche br Maintaining their momentum from their successful last season as the Nordiques the Avalanche won the Stanley Cup in their first season after the move added another in and recently in They would also win their division every year in their first eight years in Denver for a total of nine consecutive division titles the second most in the expansion era br The last active NHL player who played for the Nordiques was Adam Foote who announced his retirement after the season The last active player in any league was Martin Rucinsky who announced his retirement after the season while playing in the Czech Extraliga br br br Uniforms br Throughout their history the Nordiques were famous for their iconic powder blue and white uniforms But for their first WHA season the Nordiques uniforms featured splashes of red on the shoulders waist and numbers From to the blue on the Nordiques uniforms briefly reverted to a dark royal blue shade Contrasting nameplates were used in then the fleur de lis symbol was added to the shoulders the following season which was modeled after the flag of Quebec br Prior to the season the Nordiques unveiled what was now their standard look returning to a powder blue base and adding three fleur de lis symbols on the waist Red was only used on the logo For the first season the Nordiques wore red pants but switched to powder blue pants afterwards This look would be carried over upon joining the NHL in and other than some minor trim changes on the logo and numbers remained basically the same until the relocation br The Colorado Avalanche unveiled the Reverse Retro design based on the Nordiques uniforms on November honouring the legacy of the franchise br br br Uniform change br Aubut intended to change the team s entire look had he won enough financing to keep the Nordiques in Quebec City for the season The Nordiques would have abandoned the blue white and red palette they had worn throughout their history in favour of a teal black and navy scheme The team would also have abandoned the igloo holding a hockey stick logo they had used for their entire existence in favour of a fierce looking Siberian husky with NORDIQUES in grey block letters below it and the I in the team s name fashioned to look like an icicle These designs were published in local papers before the team ultimately decided to move Due to the team missing an NHL deadline the logo and uniforms would not have taken effect until the season br br br
