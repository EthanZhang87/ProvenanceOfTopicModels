Pacific Coast Hockey Association It was not until that the NHL took sole ownership of the Stanley Cup By that time the league began expanding into the United States and new rivalries were created

Stanley Cup After the Senators NHL franchise was disbanded an amateur Ottawa Senators team continued the rivalry by playing Montreal teams in the Quebec Senior League until br The Canadiens and the

Line and Draper s best friend brutally beating up Lemieux as revenge for the incident with Draper as well as a vicious goaltender fight between Patrick Roy and Mike Vernon Both of these events were
