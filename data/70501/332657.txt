debut with the Thrashers in leading all rookies in points and assists and was second in team goal scoring behind Ilya Kovalchuk He won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL s Rookie of the Year for which Kovalchuk was also nominated br In the season Heatley emerged as an NHL star recording goals and points in games and finishing ninth overall in league scoring br As a result of a car crash in September that seriously injured Heatley and claimed the life of Thrashers teammate Dan Snyder Heatley s season did not start until January and he ultimately appeared in only games A difficult season ended with Heatley recording only points as the Thrashers failed to earn a playoff spot br During the NHL lock out Heatley initially played for the Swiss team SC Bern He scored points in only games before an errant puck struck his left eye and broke his orbital bone As a result of this injury the pupil of his left eye became permanently dilated He finished the year with Thrashers teammate Kovalchuk on the Ak Bars Kazan of the Russian Superleague RSL recording points in eleven games br br br Ottawa Senators br Prior to the end of the lock out Heatley asked to be traded from Atlanta in hopes of leaving reminders of the tragic crash behind This was unpopular with Atlanta fans particularly as Snyder s father Graham noted that Heatley owed much to the Thrashers organization that had particularly been extremely supportive of him during his trial and ordeal On August the Thrashers sent him to the Ottawa Senators for Slovak star Mari n Hossa and veteran defenceman Greg de Vries Hossa had just re signed with the Senators after protracted and often contentious negotiations A restricted free agent at the time of the trade Heatley immediately signed a three year million contract with the Senators br In his first game for the Senators against the Toronto Maple Leafs on October Heatley played with Jason Spezza and Brandon Bochenski but when the Senators were down with five minutes to go Daniel Alfredsson who replaced Bochenski scored the tying goal As was the first year that the NHL implemented the shootout Heatley became the second player to score in an NHL shootout scoring against Leafs goalie Ed Belfour after Alfredsson Their sticks are now in the Hockey Hall of Fame Later that month on October Heatley scored four consecutive goals in an win over the Toronto Maple Leafs marking a career high for goals in a game br Heatley made a spectacular start with his new team registering points in the first games of the season breaking Mari n Hossa s previous franchise record of consecutive games Among players with new teams this was behind only Wayne Gretzky s game streak upon joining the Los Angeles Kings during the season br br In his first game back in Atlanta as a Senator he was frequently booed indicating that Thrashers fans felt snubbed by Heatley s previous trade request Despite scoring Heatley and the Senators suffered an defeat to his former Thrashers teammates br Heatley finished the season with goals and points fourth in the league Incidentally Heatley s first goal season also marked the first time any Senators player had achieved that mark setting a franchise record for goals in a season previously held by Mari n Hossa who scored goals in Heatley s points also tied Daniel Alfredsson for the team lead together surpassing Alexei Yashin s franchise record of points in a season achieved in br Catalyzed by a rejuvenated offence Ottawa finished the season with the best record in the Eastern Conference and the second best in the league With lofty expectations for the playoffs they were eliminated in the second round by the Buffalo Sabres Heatley recorded points in games At the end of the season Heatley was selected along with Alfredsson to the second All Star team br After a slow start to the season Heatley recorded goals once more second in the league to Vincent Lecavalier s goals and points fourth in the league By reaching the goal plateau for the second straight season he became the first NHL player to do so since Pavel Bure in Heatley s points broke the previous franchise record he shared with Alfredsson His performance earned him a spot on the first All Star team br Heatley and the Senators followed up another strong regular season going all the way to the Stanley Cup finals but finished short in five games against the Anaheim Ducks The Alfredsson Spezza and Heatley line was dominant leading the NHL in playoffs points all tied at br Fresh off the heels of a Stanley Cup finals appearance Heatley began the season with a new six year contract extension with the Senators worth million signed prior to the season opener against the Maple Leafs Since arriving in Ottawa from the Mari n Hossa trade Heatley had appeared in consecutive Senators games until suffering a separated shoulder on January in a collision with Detroit Red Wings forward Dallas Drake sidelining him for games He completed the season with goals and assists for points in games Ottawa was plagued with injuries to its superstars all season Seeding seventh overall in the East Ottawa met the Pittsburgh Penguins in the playoffs coincidentally the same first round match up of the previous year However Heatley and the Senators would not make a second run for the Cup and were swept in four games Heatley managed just one point br On October Heatley was named alternate captain to Daniel Alfredsson along with defenceman Chris Phillips The season however was met with decreased production for Heatley and the top line as well as an th place finish for the Senators in the Eastern Conference well out of playoff contention br br br Trade request br Coming off his lowest points total since his rookie season excluding his shortened game season in TSN reported that Heatley had filed a request for a trade on June despite being only one year into a six year contract extension signed in Heatley had reportedly become unhappy with his role with the Senators under new head coach Cory Clouston Despite his declining offensive numbers Heatley felt that his decreased ice time and his move from the first power play line to the second power play line were unfair to him Prior to the trade request these concerns had been brought to the attention of management during the Senators year end meetings br In an interview with reporters after the request had been made public Senators then General Manager Bryan Murray stated that he was shocked and disappointed at Heatley s request In addition Murray said that head coach Clouston was hurt by Heatley s remarks The frustrating part for us is we have gone through several coaches here that we couldn t win enough games with Murray stated We brought in a guy the results we were very happy with The team started to look like a real team again And then to be kind of blindsided in his way of thinking anyway by one of your players not wanting to fit in That s hard for a coach to accept br Senators fans were blindsided by the request and across the league observers were both puzzled and angry Sports writers across Canada criticized Heatley s behaviour calling him a brat pathetic and reprehensible I was surprised at it but I understood it Atlanta Thrashers GM Don Waddell said of Heatley s desire to leave Atlanta in the aftermath of Dan Snyder s death This one I really don t understand He asked to get out of Atlanta and he went to a team that he obviously approved of and had some success They went to the Stanley Cup finals What I can see is that he got a lot of support in Ottawa I don t think the trade request says a lot of positive things on the surface It sure doesn t show a good team attitude An Atlanta Thrashers employee cryptically told the Vancouver Sun We know Dany very well There is always a reason why these things happen Graham Snyder the father of Dan Snyder who played a significant role in helping Heatley avoid prison time after the crash that killed his son was confused by Heatley s decision to force a trade from Ottawa saying I m surprised because he signed a long term deal with Ottawa and was playing in a market that seemed to embrace him Snyder said there were a lot of ways Heatley could have dealt with the decision by Clouston to reduce his playing time and bump him down to the second power play unit rather than demanding a trade Certainly talking with Clouston behind the scenes would be a lot more effective and trying to work through it br Tom Molloy a close friend of the Heatley family stoked the fires in Ottawa with a letter published in the Ottawa Citizen criticizing the widespread negative reaction to the trade request Heatley s mother is very upset And the attacks are all personal stuff about his character Molloy lamented adding that Nobody mentions that this is a guy who gives up a month of his summer every year to play for Team Canada Molloy went as far as to blame the Senators organization for Heatley s decision claiming This is an organizational thing If I was the owner of the Senators I d be calling my manager in and saying why don t guys want to play here anymore br Trading Heatley was a challenge due to his large contract a contract that was to pay him approximately million for the upcoming season and few other NHL teams possessed the available salary cap space to accommodate it Further complicating matters was the partial no trade clause in Heatley s contract which limited the number of teams Ottawa could negotiate a potential deal with A trade was worked out to send Heatley to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for Andrew Cogliano Dustin Penner and Ladislav m d on June but Heatley again surprised the hockey world when he refused to waive the no trade clause which would have finalized the deal further angering fans in both Ottawa and Edmonton NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly suggested that the Senators may have grounds to file a grievance as Heatley s contract stipulated the team pay a bonus due July of US million as the Edmonton trade if completed would have spared the Senators that expense Melnyk later filed a lawsuit against Heatley as the team shouldn t have paid a hefty roster bonus to a player who was seeking a trade which was settled out of court in the fall of without the terms being publicized br As Ottawa GM Murray began again to try to accommodate the trade demand Heatley was still a member of the Senators as the team opened training camp on September Heatley had little choice but to report for training camp and the atmosphere between him and his Senators teammates was described as awkward tense and untenable Team captain Daniel Alfredsson admitted days earlier that a scenario in which Heatley showed up in Ottawa as an unhappy camper would create a massive media headache for the rest of the team If he comes back there s going to be a lot of focus and attention Alfredsson said at the time adding If somebody hits him in practice or something occurs everything is going to get blown out proportion Heatley himself sneaked back into Scotiabank Place avoiding the cameras and throng of media awaiting some clarification regarding his desire to leave Ottawa When I looked Heatley in the eye I knew the minute he walked out the door that I had to trade him GM Bryan Murray said a short time later I didn t think there was any chance I just felt that we had to move him br br br San Jose Sharks br br On September Heatley was traded to the San Jose Sharks along with a fifth round pick in for Milan Mich lek Jonathan Cheechoo and a second round pick in Heatley made million that year br In the Sharks fourth game of the season their home opener against the Columbus Blue Jackets and Heatley s first game in front of the San Jose fans Heatley capped a hat trick with a penalty shot goal in the third period bringing his season totals to four goals and five assists nine points in the first four games of the season br On November

Conference Finals as with Dany Heatley in the penalty box the Chicago Blackhawks scored the game winning goal sweeping the series However Head Coach Todd McLellan revealed that Heatley had been playing the entire playoffs with a torn groin muscle br On December in his first return to Ottawa Heatley was frequently booed Though he had said that the city of Ottawa and the fans there had nothing to do with his desire to be moved Senators fans were in no mood to forgive Several fans who attended the game held up their Heatley jerseys with certain letters covered up so the name plate would spell out the word H A T E Late in the game a group of fans came down to ice level and simultaneously threw their Heatley jerseys onto the ice in a coordinated protest Another fan held up a sign
