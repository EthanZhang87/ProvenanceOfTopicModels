Scouts shared Kemper Arena with the Kansas City Kings the Kings were officially the Kansas City Omaha Kings from of the National Basketball Association The arrival of the Scouts and Washington Capitals resulted in the NHL creating four divisions and renaming the conferences and the Scouts were placed in the Smythe Division of the Campbell Conference with Missouri s other NHL franchise the St Louis Blues br br The owners of the new Kansas City franchise originally wanted to call their team the Kansas City Mohawks since the Kansas City metropolitan area includes portions of Missouri and Kansas The name would have combined Missouri s postal abbreviation MO and the Kansas nickname of Jayhawkers However the Chicago Black Hawks objected because of the similarity of Mohawks to their own name br The team then held a contest for people to name the new team The name Scouts was chosen named after The Scout which is located in Penn Valley Park and overlooks downtown The iconic statue was featured on the team s logo The hockey club s logo was designed by lettering artist Gary Sartain of Kansas City based Hallmark Cards in on a free lance basis Sartain s daughter Sheila Snyder told

Paiement scored the first Scouts goal br The following day the team s first victory came against the Washington Capitals by a score of at Capital Centre in Landover Maryland Peter McDuffe was the winning goaltender for Kansas City br Like many other expansion teams the Scouts performed poorly garnering only points with a record of in their inaugural season though this would be the better result of their two season history br The team s second season started out with some promise Near the midway point of the season the team was competing for a playoff spot with a win over the California Golden Seals on December placing them just one point behind the St Louis Blues and a playoff position in the weak Smythe Division However the Scouts went into free fall for their remaining games After going winless from December to February they finally won a game against the Capitals on February before going for the rest of the season The Scouts second half crash left them with a season result of and points still the worst record in the Scouts Rockies Devils franchise s history br The last four games the Scouts ever played took place in Japan Following the conclusion of the regular season Kansas City and Washington participated in an exhibition series with the first two games played in Sapporo site of the Winter Olympics the third and fourth in Tokyo at Yoyogi National Gymnasium site of the swimming and diving competition at the Summer Olympics The Capitals won the first three contests On April the Scouts defeated Washington Thus Kansas City won its final game but

following a dispute with management over player personnel br The team had two captains Simon Nolet and Guy Charron Steve Durbano led the league in penalty minutes during the season The franchise failed to make the playoffs in either season in Kansas City and won only of games including a mark away from home br With the startup of the rival World Hockey Association WHA resulting in a combined teams between the NHL and the WHA the talent available to stock the new teams in Kansas City and Washington was stretched thin In their first season the Capitals set an NHL record for futility losing of games and winning only one on the road The Scouts fared only marginally better losing games and the NHL expansion was widely seen as having been a mistake Attendance tailed off so much that the NHLPA wondered if the Scouts would make payroll br br br Relocation to Denver br The Scouts suffered from inflated player costs undercapitalized ownership an economic downturn in the Midwest poor performances on the ice and weak attendance The Scouts averaged just per game during their two years in the seat Kemper Arena at a time when the league average was approximately The team s group of owners buried in debt mounted a season ticket drive to raise more revenue When only more season tickets sold they concluded that the Scouts were not a viable venture and opted to sell While the Capitals were far worse on the ice their owner Abe Pollin had the financing and the patience to absorb the typical struggles of a s expansion team br The Scouts were put up for sale with a Denver based group led by oilman Jack A Vickers looking to buy the club A local group according to author Troy Treasure led by Scouts limited partners Gene Novorr and George Shore was also interested but when the NHL informed the Scouts owners that they would be on the hook of over a million dollars in expansion and territorial fees owed the St Louis Blues if they didn t sell to Vickers they reluctantly did so on July br After just two seasons in Kansas City the club became the Colorado Rockies They played six NHL seasons in Denver then relocated to the East Coast and became the New
