The Presidents Trophy French Troph e des pr sidents is an award presented by the National Hockey League NHL to the team that finishes with the most points i e best overall record during the regular season If two teams are tied for the most points then the Trophy goes to the team with the most regulation wins RW The Presidents Trophy has been awarded times to different teams since its inception during the NHL season br As the team with the best regular season record the Presidents Trophy winner is normally guaranteed home ice advantage throughout the entire Stanley Cup playoffs However winning the award does not assure playoff success as there have been only eight instances where the Presidents Trophy winner has gone on to win the Stanley Cup in the same season while three Presidents Trophy winners have been defeated in the Stanley Cup Finals The most recent team to win both the Presidents Trophy and the Stanley Cup in the same season is the Chicago Blackhawks The only team to accomplish this feat more than once is the Detroit Red Wings br br br History br The Trophy was introduced at the start of the season by the League s Board of Governors to recognize the best team in the regular season informally known as the regular season championship Prior to this the team that finished in first place when the regular season concluded was allowed to hang a banner reading NHL League Champions br A total of teams have won the Presidents Trophy The Detroit Red Wings have won six Presidents Trophies the most of any team The Boston Bruins and New York Rangers are tied for second with four The Colorado Avalanche and Washington Capitals are tied for third with three Five teams Calgary Flames Chicago Blackhawks Dallas Stars Edmonton Oilers Vancouver Canucks are tied for fourth most with two Presidents Trophy wins apiece Among these multiple winners Calgary Dallas Detroit Edmonton Vancouver and Washington have won it in consecutive seasons Out of these teams Edmonton Calgary and Dallas have captured a Stanley Cup along with their second straight Presidents Trophy br If there are two or more teams tied for first in points in the League then the NHL s standard tiebreaking procedure is applied with the first tiebreaker being the team with the most regulation wins that is all games won except those won in overtime or in a shootout During the shortened season both the Colorado Avalanche and Vegas Golden Knights finished tied for first with points in games with Colorado winning the trophy since they had regulation wins while Vegas had From the through seasons the first tiebreaker was most regulation and overtime wins Before the first tiebreaker was the most wins including both overtime and shootout wins The most notable of the pre protocol is from the season where both the Buffalo Sabres and Detroit Red Wings finished tied first with points with the Sabres winning the Trophy since they had wins three more than Detroit who had br br br Past trophies br From to the same criterion now observed for winning the Presidents Trophy was used to award the Prince of Wales Trophy With the Modern Era expansion in the season and the creation of the West Division the Wales Trophy was awarded to the team that finished in first place in the East Division during the regular season However no trophy was awarded to the team that finished with the best overall record in the entire League during this period and no trophy at all was awarded based on the results of the regular season from the through seasons A cash bonus of was awarded to the winning team with the NHL s best regular season record during these years to which the Presidents Trophy was added in The cash bonus is split amongst the players on the active roster of the winning team br Factoring all NHL seasons prior to the introduction of the Presidents Trophy the Montreal Canadiens have finished first overall times the most times in League history although this was most recently accomplished in before the Trophy was introduced since its inception the Canadiens have been Presidents runners up three times in and Detroit is second with first overall finishes br br br Playoff implications br br The Presidents Trophy winner is normally guaranteed home ice advantage throughout the Stanley Cup playoffs This does not necessarily correlate to success in the playoffs however The Trophy has been awarded times but only eight of the winners have gone on to win the Stanley Cup in their respective years leading to a popular superstition that the Trophy may be cursed In addition eight Presidents Trophy winners have been eliminated in the first round of the playoffs with first round upsets being common in the NHL compared to other major professional sports Since the salary cap era of the NHL from onwards the first placed NHL team has had the lowest probability of winning the playoff championship compared to the other three North American major professional sports leagues NBA MLB and NFL br NHL broadcaster Darren Eliot attributes the apparent lack of playoff success to the different style of competition compared to the regular season instead of playing different teams every night the goal is to advance through four best of seven playoff series The Presidents Trophy winner may have to go through other playoff clubs who might have a hotter goaltender a better defensive team or other players that pose match up problems If the regular season champion s primary success was merely outscoring others they may be out of luck facing goaltenders that can shut them out The lack of playoff experience may have been to blame in the examples of the St Louis Blues and San Jose Sharks as neither team had advanced past the second round for five or more seasons Teams have often given up pursuit of finishing first in the League in order to avoid injuries and rest key players for the postseason br Ian Cooper writing for the Toronto Star noted that of Presidents Trophy winners to lose in the first two rounds seven came from divisions that were among the league s weaker half If a team dominates a weak division its shortcomings should become apparent once it faces stiffer competition from the rest of the conference Jonathan Weiss writing for the Bleacher Report in also noted that of the teams between and that led the League in points during the regular season of them per cent reached the Cup Finals while of the other teams during that same time period only per cent advanced to the final round concluding that the team that leads the NHL in regular season points is four to five times more likely than any other team in the playoffs to make it into the Stanley Cup finals and seven to eight times more likely to win the Cup br The Red Wings were considered a cursed team as their record setting season was cut short by the newly relocated Colorado Avalanche in the Conference Finals sparking a particularly vicious rivalry between the two teams in subsequent seasons In the season the Avalanche were the defending Cup champions and won the Presidents Trophy but lost the Conference Finals which was a rematch against the Red Wings the Red Wings went on to win the Cup The Red Wings would go onto the defeat the Presidents Trophy winning Dallas Stars in en route to the Red Wings second straight Cup win Thereafter in three of four seasons the Presidents Trophy winning team went on to win the Stanley Cup Stars in Avalanche in and Red Wings in br Since the Blackhawks won the Presidents Trophy and Stanley Cup in the lockout shortened season the curse has been more pronounced The Tampa Bay Lightning were swept in the first round by the Wild Card Columbus Blue Jackets after a dominant season in which they tied the Detroit Red Wings record for regular season wins becoming the first Presidents Trophy winner to suffer this fate Adding to the ignominy was the Blue Jackets previous lack of postseason success as their sweep of the Lightning was their first playoff series victory in franchise history with only four previous playoff qualifications By contrast the Lightning had made several deep playoff runs in the previous seasons including a Cup Finals appearance in Over the next three years the Lightning did not win the Presidents Trophy but nevertheless won two consecutive Stanley Cups while reaching a third consecutive Stanley Cup Finals For the Boston Bruins after setting new records for single season wins and points they proceeded to lose in the first round in seven games to the Florida Panthers after having led the series three games to one The Panthers were incidentally the previous season s Presidents Trophy winners where their season ended when they were swept in the second round by the Lightning en route to the Lightning s third consecutive Finals appearance br Only three times in the history of the Presidents Trophy has a team missed the playoffs the season after winning the award the New York Rangers who won the Trophy in the season and missed the playoffs in and then rebounded to win both the Presidents Trophy and Stanley Cup in the Buffalo Sabres who won the Trophy in the season and missed the playoffs in and the Boston Bruins who won the Trophy in the season and missed the playoffs in despite having a winning record br br br Winners br br Bold Team with the most
