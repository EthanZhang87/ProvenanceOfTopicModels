system to the American Hockey League AHL After years of operation financial instability led to the league s demise Six of the surviving seven teams merged into the AHL in br br br History br br br Early years br The IHL was formed on December in a three hour meeting at the Norton Palmer Hotel in Windsor Ontario In attendance were Jack Adams coach of the Detroit Red Wings Fred Huber Red Wings public relations Frank Gallagher amateur hockey organizer in Detroit and Windsor Lloyd Pollock Windsor hockey pioneer Gerald McHugh Windsor lawyer Len Hebert Len Loree and Bill Beckman The league began operations in the IHL season with four teams in Windsor and Detroit and operated as semi professional league br In a team from Toledo Ohio joined the league and the following year the IHL expanded significantly with teams in four additional U S cities The expansion did not take hold and for the league was back down to teams in Detroit and Windsor as well as two nearby Canadian cities Sarnia Ontario and Chatham Ontario Windsor dropped out in and expansion into the U S began again with Toledo rejoining the league and new teams in Grand Rapids Michigan Troy Ohio Cincinnati Fort Wayne Indiana and Milwaukee At the same time the last Canadian team left the league in when the Chatham Maroons pulled out Three new U S cities were added in The league would expand and shrink between five and nine teams through the s with another major expansion in In the season the IHL played an interlocking schedule with the NHL owned Eastern Professional Hockey League which itself folded after its season After seasons as a strictly U S based league the IHL admitted two Canadian teams in with the Windsor Bulldogs and the return of the Chatham Maroons Both teams dropped out after one season however and the league would not have a Canadian team again until br br br Major market expansion br Bill Beagan served as commissioner of the IHL from to The Canadian Press cited him for turning around the league s financial situation and making it a top tier development system for future NHL talent br Starting in the late s the IHL s quality of play significantly improved By the mid s it was on par with the American Hockey League AHL the longtime top feeder league for the National Hockey League Many IHL teams became the top farm teams of NHL teams In the league swallowed up a few surviving members of the Central Hockey League which had ceased operations br In the league adopted the shootout to determine tie games in place of traditional overtime The NHL would begin using the shootout to avoid tie games in br Beginning in the late s and continuing into the mid s the IHL expanded or re located existing franchises into major U S markets such as Atlanta Cincinnati Cleveland Denver Houston Indianapolis Kansas City Las Vegas Minneapolis Saint Paul Orlando Phoenix Salt Lake City San Antonio San Diego and San Francisco Many of these markets had been previously served by the defunct World Hockey Association or abandoned by the NHL The IHL also entered markets that had existing NHL teams such as Chicago Detroit and Los Angeles In the IHL moved its Atlanta and Minneapolis Saint Paul franchises to Quebec City and Winnipeg respectively restoring the league s Canadian presence and filling the void left by the departure of the NHL s Quebec Nordiques and the original Winnipeg Jets br The minimum requirements for an IHL expansion team in were a seat arena a population base of one million and a million franchise fee As the league expanded into larger markets many of the smaller market teams such as Fort Wayne Peoria Muskegon Kalamazoo and Flint left the IHL and joined lower level leagues br br br Decline and collapse br The IHL s expansion into NHL markets put a strain on relationships between the leagues There was some speculation that the IHL was intending to compete directly with the NHL especially when a lockout in threatened to wipe out the NHL season However in the season the IHL s soft salary cap was just million while the lowest NHL team payroll that season was million A Fall article in Sports Illustrated praising the IHL and mocking the NHL only fueled the fire In said article IHL officials detailed plans to continue expanding the league to large markets in North America as well as a six team European league with franchises in England Switzerland Italy Austria Sweden and France br In response many NHL clubs shifted their affiliations to the AHL and by only four of IHL teams had NHL affiliations With the loss of subsidized salaries high expansion fees by the end the league was charging as much as million US for new teams exploding travel costs and the NHL itself moving back into some of its markets the league s rapid expansion proved a critical strain and it folded after the season br Six IHL franchises the Chicago Wolves Grand Rapids Griffins Houston Aeros Utah Grizzlies Milwaukee Admirals and Manitoba Moose were admitted into the AHL as expansion teams for the season Between them they have played for the AHL Calder Cup seven times winning four including three in a row after their arrival As well the Cincinnati Cyclones was readmitted to the East Coast Hockey League which hosted the team from to before it moved to the IHL The Orlando Solar Bears the final IHL playoff champions and the Kansas City Blades were not admitted into the AHL because their owner Rich DeVos who also owned the Griffins was allowed to own only one AHL franchise The league s other two teams the Cleveland Lumberjacks and Detroit Vipers ceased operations along with the league br Two former IHL teams that moved to the AHL have since relocated the Utah Grizzlies moved to Cleveland Ohio to become the Lake Erie Monsters rebranded as Cleveland Monsters in in and the Houston Aeros moved to Des Moines Iowa to become the Iowa Wild in A third team the Manitoba Moose temporarily relocated to St John s Newfoundland and Labrador to become the St John s IceCaps from to Three former franchises have been relaunched in lower tier leagues since the IHL s demise The Utah Grizzlies name was revived by the former Lexington Men O War of the ECHL when they moved and the Orlando Solar Bears restarted as an ECHL expansion team The Peoria Rivermen have had three more franchises with an expansion team in the East Coast Hockey League from
