Huizenga was awarded an NHL franchise for Miami on December the same day The Walt Disney Company earned the rights to start a team in Anaheim that would become the Mighty Ducks At the time Huizenga owned both the newly founded Florida Marlins of Major League Baseball and a share of the National Football League NFL s Miami Dolphins The entry fee was million Huizenga announced the team would play at the Miami Arena sharing the building with the National Basketball Association s Miami Heat until a new arena was built Offices for the team were only established in June while vice president of business operations Dean Jordan conceded that none of the business people myself included knew anything about hockey The new franchise would be the first professional ice hockey team in Miami since the folding of the Tropical Hockey League in br br On April a press conference in Ft Lauderdale announced that the team would be named Florida Panthers with former New York Islanders general manager Bill Torrey as president and Bobby Clarke as general manager The team is named for the Florida panther an endangered species of large cat endemic to the nearby Everglades region Once the logos and uniforms were unveiled on June the team also announced its financial commitment to the panther preservation cause Huizenga had held the Panthers trademark since when he purchased it from a group of Tampa investors who sought to create an MLB team in the Tampa Bay area br The new franchise joined the NHL for participation in the season along with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim The Panthers and Ducks rosters were filled in both the expansion draft and the NHL Entry Draft in June hosted by Quebec City that draft produced ten players who would eventually be a part of the Eastern Conference winning team br The Panthers first major stars were former New York Rangers goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck rookie Rob Niedermayer and forward Scott Mellanby who scored goals in Florida s inaugural season Their first game was a tie on the road against the Chicago Blackhawks while their first win was a shutout of the Tampa Bay Lightning in the Thunderdome before a then NHL record crowd of The Panthers had one of the most successful first seasons of any expansion team in league history finishing just two points below and narrowly missing out on the final playoff spot in the East Their first year success was attributed mainly to the trap defense that first year coach Roger Neilson implemented This conservative style was widely criticized by NHL teams some even suggested that the Panthers were ruining the game While the team executives expected the audience to consist of mostly snowbird Canadians living in Florida the Floridians soon embraced the Panthers Helped by Miami s other teams having middling performances the club averaged capacity at the seat Miami Arena and sold season tickets in days br In August general manager Clarke left to work for the Philadelphia Flyers Bryan Murray was brought in from the Detroit Red Wings as his replacement After another close brush with the playoffs finishing the lockout shortened season again in ninth Neilson was fired following an argument with Murray

then acquired Ray Sheppard from the San Jose Sharks at the NHL trade deadline and looked toward the playoffs for the first time br br br The Rat Trick and a trip to the Stanley Cup Finals br A very unusual goal celebration developed in Miami during the season On the night of the Panthers home opener a rat scurried across the team s locker room Scott Mellanby reacted by one timing the rat against the wall killing it That night he scored two goals which Vanbiesbrouck quipped was a rat trick Two nights later as the story found its way into the world a few fans threw rubber rats on the ice in celebration of a goal The rubber rat count went from for the third home game to over during the playoffs br In the playoffs as the fourth seed in the East the Panthers faced the Boston Bruins in the first round and won in five games Bill Lindsay s series clinching goal is still a trademark image for the run the third year franchise went on The Panthers went on to upset the top seeded Philadelphia Flyers in six games followed by the second seeded Pittsburgh Penguins in seven with Tom Fitzgerald scoring what would end up being the game winning goal to reach the Stanley Cup Finals against the Colorado Avalanche another team making its first Finals appearance The Avalanche however swept the Panthers in four games Despite losing in the Finals the Panthers set a record for most wins by an expansion team in their first postseason appearance with victories this record would later be broken by the Vegas Golden Knights during their inaugural season in For his team s surprising success

right to trade first round selections with the Blue Jackets in the Draft a right which was not exercised when the Panthers received the first overall selection in as well The Atlanta Thrashers after picking goaltender Kari Lehtonen second overall announced that the Panthers had given them two draft picks to guarantee that Bouwmeester would still be available for Florida s selection Bouwmeester

honors in his first All Star appearance br On June the Panthers were again involved in a blockbuster trade with Vancouver sending Roberto Luongo Lukas Krajicek and a sixth round draft pick Sergei Shirokov in exchange for Todd Bertuzzi Alex Auld and Bryan Allen This trade has been regarded by some as one of the worst trades in professional sports history Luongo who was at the prime of his career was one of the League s top goaltenders while Bertuzzi played just a handful of games for Florida before getting injured He would later be traded to Detroit Red Wings at the trade deadline for
