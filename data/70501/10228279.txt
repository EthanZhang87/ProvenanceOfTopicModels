id: 10228279
Players in the National Hockey League wear equipment which allows their team affiliation to be easily identified unifying the image of the team An NHL uniform consists of a hockey jersey hockey pants socks gloves and a helmet br br br Background br br Historically the only standardized piece of the equipment has been the sweater jersey which has to be of identical design by the same company for all members of a team Other elements merely have a number scheme allowing individual players to select their own brand and model coloured to match the uniform but not necessarily identical in appearance Sticks and other equipment worn under the clothes have no requirements in terms of matching a team s colours teams will sometimes provide players with team brand undershirts or other under clothing but players are not required or limited to wearing them br Goaltenders often have their pads and gloves and masks coloured to match the team s colour scheme but there is no requirement for this equipment to match and goaltenders who transfer to a new team often play in their old equipment until new colours can be obtained Alternatively players who transfer teams have sometimes had their gloves painted temporarily to match the required colours and are given new helmets br Each team is required to have two sweater designs One with a white base or historically a yellow colour and one with a darker coloured base Between the and seasons NHL teams wore white or yellow uniforms at home and dark uniforms on the road which is the current convention in some low level ice hockey leagues Since the season NHL teams typically wear the dark colour at home and the white for road games there are occasional single game exceptions The only elements allowed by NHL rules to be interchangeable between the two sets of equipment are the pants and gloves br br br Third Sweater Program br Starting in excluding a few prior isolated instances some teams began to design a third sweater or alternate sweater which allowed them to experiment with new designs or throwback to a vintage design Though they are termed third sweaters they can actually entail an entirely separate look from the primary equipment often including alternate socks and sometimes alternate helmets and other equipment Some third sweaters have eventually become the bases for new primary sweater designs br Third sweaters are typically worn only a few times a season by special permission of the league based on a list of requested games They can also be worn during selected playoff games The third sweater program as the NHL came to call it was temporarily suspended on two occasions for the season due to logistical problems with the introduction of the Reebok Edge sweater that was unveiled at the NHL All Star Game and for the season due to the introduction of the Adidas sweater br A team s desire to wear their third sweater sometimes requires the opposing team to wear their home or road sweater when the opposite would be normally worn due to the colour of the third sweater This can occur when a road team wishes to wear a coloured third sweater or a home team wishes to wear a white third sweater as there must be one team each wearing white and coloured uniforms in a game This can require a team to carry two sets of uniforms and equipment on the road whether they are using their third sweaters or are playing against a team who is br For the season the Buffalo Sabres wore a white commemorative jersey for home games featuring gold trim to celebrate years of NHL hockey in Buffalo In the season the New Jersey Devils sweater modeled after the home sweater the team wore from to were the only team to wear a white third sweater The Washington Capitals NHL Winter Classic sweater modeled after the sweater the team wore from to were the only NHL team to have a white third sweater from the season to the season when they were replaced by red sweaters of the same design The Philadelphia Flyers used a special white third sweater for their th anniversary in the season br br br Sweaters br br As hockey originates as an outdoor winter sport where players wore sweaters this terminology has been retained to describe what is probably the most recognized element of a team s equipment which is the only element which is mass marketed to the public br Most NHL sweaters jerseys display the team s primary logo in the center of the chest while some also display secondary logos on the shoulders Each player in a team s lineup for a game must have a different number displayed on the back of their sweater as well as the player s surname above their number on the back of their sweater While not required teams typically place their numbers on each upper arm as well Team captains and alternate captains wear the letters C and A respectively on the front of their sweaters Sweaters have a loop of fabric sewn into the inside back called a fight strap or tie down which must be secured to the player s pants during a game to prevent the sweater from being pulled over the player s head in a fight In recent years NHL teams generally give players sets of white and dark jerseys annually with special sets being introduced for alternate heritage designs or special games br In recent years teams have sold both pro model sweaters ostensibly identical to those worn by players and replica quality sweaters which are cheaper versions that typically use cheaper production methods and lower quality materials Replica versions typically lack the fight strap and in recent years have been created by Fanatics br br br History br Prior to different NHL teams had contracts with different manufacturers for their sweaters Manufacturers included CCM Koho Nike Starter and Pro Player br br br br From the season up to the season all team sweaters were made by The Hockey Company in an NHL wide deal and were branded with subsidiary brands The Koho brand was on dark sweaters and third sweaters while the CCM brand was on the white sweaters The Hockey Company began the practice of putting the manufacturer s logo on the back of the sweater below the neck rather than on the back of the waist hem as had previously been the practice Jofa another subsidiary made the sweaters for referees and linesmen until the season when they were re branded CCM which they remain as of br Following Reebok s purchase of The Hockey Company all official NHL team sweaters were switched to the Reebok Rbk Hockey brand while cheaper replica sweaters sold to fans retained the CCM branding Reebok logos were on the side boards in all NHL arenas for marketing purposes just above the blue and red lines br br br Reebok Edge br The Rbk Edge or simply Edge was a newer line of sweaters designed by Reebok They were announced by Reebok after nearly three years of development The new sweaters were tighter fitting were less water absorbent and were more flexible than earlier sweaters It was intended to make players more maneuverable on the ice The Edge sweaters were unveiled at the th National Hockey League All Star Game and began to be worn league wide from the season Almost every team in the league made at least minor changes to their equipment design in conjunction with implementing the new sweater style The San Jose Sharks Tampa Bay Lightning Ottawa Senators Vancouver Canucks Dallas Stars and Washington Capitals redesigned their equipment altogether with a new or updated logo The Columbus Blue Jackets and Minnesota Wild used their alternate sweater from the previous three seasons as the basis for their new look complete with the team adopting the alternate logo from their alternates as their primary logo br Five of the Original Six teams excluding the Boston Bruins as well as the New Jersey Devils kept their previous styles intact when possible with the Devils going as far as to issue a press release saying that the team had no plans for an event unveiling the Rbk Edge design because there was nothing new to see The Anaheim Ducks and Buffalo Sabres who both had just redesigned their sweaters the year before the implementation of the Edge sweaters also left theirs mostly unchanged But the Sabres made the logo on the front of their sweater smaller and took away the silver outline on their white away sweater and the Ducks added orange piping to their sweater s neckline br Along with the traditional differences between the replica and authentic versions of NHL sweaters the replica billed as premier versions of the Edge sweater sold to the public have a jock tag on the left side of the front near the waist with the Reebok vector NHL logo and sweater size br Citing player complaints Reebok later modified the Edge sweaters during the season removing the play dry material in the front and making the sleeves bigger The modified sweaters dubbed the Edge made their debut at the NHL Winter Classic on January On that occasion the participating Buffalo Sabres and Pittsburgh Penguins both used throwback designs for the jerseys Other teams followed suit with some players wearing the original Edge design for a few years afterward br br br Adidas ADIZERO br In September the NHL and Adidas announced plans for Adidas to begin manufacturing official NHL jerseys starting in the season All jerseys are owned by the NHL On June the NHL unveiled new ADIZERO sweaters for each of the teams including the first uniform for the league s newest team the Vegas Golden Knights The new sweaters are advertised as being lighter cooler and stronger than previous jerseys Due to the change there were no third alternate jerseys for any NHL teams for the season When the third jersey program resumed the next season teams were given the option of wearing either one off Heritage uniforms normally throwback designs of past sweaters full time third jerseys or either a combination as is the case for the Heritage third jerseys worn by the Arizona Coyotes Calgary Flames St Louis Blues and Winnipeg Jets or both sets br Beginning in the season the NHL began partnering with Adidas to introduce the Reverse Retro program where all teams developed special uniforms combining traditional or throwback designs with new colour schemes The introduction of the Reverse Retro jerseys which were planned to be worn in specific rivalry matchups a plan hindered by the realignment of divisions due to Covid marks the first time in history that all teams have at least three jerseys For the season Reverse Retro designs made a return including the newly added Seattle Kraken br In the season Adidas introduced the Primegreen jerseys The new line is intended to be more environmentally friendly being manufactured with a minimum of percent of recycled materials These jerseys will be used in game and sold commercially br As of the NHL was the only one of the four major professional American sports leagues whose uniforms are not outfitted by Nike br It was reported on July by ESPN s Greg Wyshynski that the Adidas would no longer supply jerseys for the NHL after the conclusion of the season br br br Fanatics beyond br On March the NHL introduced Fanatics as the new supplier of sweaters starting in the season after agreeing to a year deal with the NHL br br br Other equipment br br A team s gear also includes colour requirements for other equipment while not requiring players to use a specific brand or model so they may select equipment to their preferences This includes a player s gloves pants and helmet Socks are also part of the design historically with some pattern of horizontal stripes CCM Bauer Warrior and True have been a frequent supplier of player equipment and skates br There is a sock and pant design by CCM with similar
