The medial collateral ligament MCL also called the superficial medial collateral ligament sMCL or tibial collateral ligament TCL is one of the major ligaments of the knee It is on the medial inner side of the knee joint and occurs in humans and other primates Its primary function is to resist valgus inward bending forces on the knee br br br Structure br It is a broad flat membranous band situated slightly posterior on the medial side of the knee joint It is attached proximally to the medial epicondyle of the femur immediately below the adductor tubercle below to the medial condyle of the tibia and medial surface of its body br It resists forces that would push the knee medially which would otherwise produce valgus deformity It provides up to of the restraining force that resists valgus inward pressing loads on the knee br The fibers of the posterior part of the ligament are short and incline backward as they descend they are inserted into the tibia above the groove for the semimembranosus muscle br The anterior part of the ligament is a flattened band about centimeters long which inclines forward as it descends br It is inserted into the medial surface of the body of the tibia about centimeters below the level of the condyle br Crossing on top of the lower part of the MCL is the pes anserinus the joined tendons of the sartorius gracilis and semitendinosus muscles a bursa is interposed between the two br The MCL s deep surface covers the inferior medial genicular vessels and nerve and the anterior portion of the tendon of the semimembranosus muscle with which it is connected by a few fibers it is intimately adherent to the medial meniscus br br br Development br Embryologically and phylogenically the ligament represents the distal portion of the tendon of adductor magnus muscle In lower animals adductor magnus inserts into the tibia Because of this the ligament occasionally contains muscle fibres This is an atavistic variation br br br Clinical significance br br br Injury br br An MCL injury can be very painful and is caused by a valgus stress to a slightly bent knee often when landing bending or on high impact It may be difficult to apply pressure on the injured leg for at least a few days br It can be caused by a direct blow to lateral side of knee br The most common knee structure damaged in skiing is the medial collateral ligament although the carve turn has diminished the incidence somewhat MCL strains and tears are also fairly common in American football The center and the guards are the most common victims of this type of injury due to the grip trend on their cleats although sometimes it can be caused by a helmet striking the knee The number of football players who get this injury has increased in recent years Companies are currently trying to develop better cleats that will prevent the injury MCL is also crucially affected in breaststroke and many professional swimmers suffer from chronic MCL pains br There are three distinct levels in a MCL injury Grade is a minor sprain grade in a major sprain or a minor tear and grade is a major tear Based on the grade of the injury treatment options will vary br br br Treatment br br Depending on the grade of the injury the lowest grade grade can take between and weeks for the injury to fully heal Recovery times for grades and can take several weeks to several months br Treatment of a partial tear or stretch injury is usually conservative Most injuries that are partial and isolated can be treated without surgery This includes measures to control inflammation as well as bracing Kannus has shown good clinical results with conservative care of grade II sprains but poor results in grade III sprains As a result more severe grade III and IV injuries to the MCL that lead to ongoing instability may require arthroscopic surgery However the medical literature considers surgery for most MCL injuries to be controversial Isolated MCL sprains are common br br br Additional images br br br br br br br br See also br br br
