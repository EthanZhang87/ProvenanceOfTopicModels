The World Hockey Association French Association mondiale de hockey was a professional ice hockey major league that operated in North America from to It was the first major league to compete with the National Hockey League NHL since the collapse of the Western Hockey League in Although the WHA was not the first league since that time to attempt to challenge the NHL s supremacy it was by far the most successful in the modern era br The WHA tried to capitalize on the lack of hockey teams in a number of major American cities and mid level Canadian cities and also hoped to attract the best players by paying more than NHL owners would The WHA successfully challenged the NHL s reserve clause which had bound players to their NHL teams even without a valid contract allowing players in both leagues greater freedom of movement Sixty seven players jumped from the NHL to the WHA in the first year led by star forward Bobby Hull whose ten year million contract was a record at the time The WHA took the initiative to sign European players ushering in a new era in North American hockey br The WHA was chronically unstable with franchises occasionally relocating or folding in the middle of the season It had an acrimonious relationship with the NHL resulting in numerous legal battles as well as competition for control of players and markets In spite of this merger talks began almost immediately NHL owners voted down a plan to merge six WHA teams the Edmonton Oilers New England Whalers Quebec Nordiques Cincinnati Stingers Houston Aeros and Winnipeg Jets into the NHL before a merger was approved br As a result the WHA ceased operations and four teams joined the NHL for the season the Edmonton Oilers New England renamed Hartford Whalers Quebec Nordiques and Winnipeg Jets Of these four teams two of the three Canadian teams the Nordiques and Jets eventually moved south to Denver and Phoenix respectively although the NHL would return to Winnipeg with the relocation of the Atlanta Thrashers who would rename themselves to become the second incarnation of the Winnipeg Jets The Arizona Coyotes suspended operations following the season with the team s hockey assets being sold to the expansion Utah NHL team The Whalers later moved from Hartford to Raleigh North Carolina and were renamed the Carolina Hurricanes The Oilers are the only WHA merger team to retain both their original nickname and city The final WHA game was played on May as the Jets defeated the Oilers to win their third Avco World Trophy br br br History br br br Founding br The World Hockey Association was founded in by American promoters Dennis Murphy and Gary Davidson The men had previously been the founder and first president of the American Basketball Association respectively They quickly recruited Bill Hunter president of the junior Western Canada Hockey League Hunter and Murphy traveled across North America recruiting franchise owners and by September had announced that the league would begin in with ten teams each having paid for their franchise br The average NHL salary in was the lowest of the four major sports while each player was bound by a reserve clause that automatically extended their contract by one year when it expired tying them to their team for the life of their career In October the WHA announced that it would not use the reserve clause stating that The reserve clause won t stand up to the scrutiny of players players associations the United States Congress the public and the Supreme Court The WHA also promised much higher salaries than the NHL offered and by the time the league began play it had lured former NHL players to its league including Bernie Parent Gerry Cheevers Derek Sanderson J C Tremblay and Ted Green The biggest name signed was former Chicago Black Hawks star Bobby Hull who agreed to a ten year million contract with the Winnipeg Jets the largest in hockey history at the time and one that lent the league instant credibility br The NHL tried to block several of the defections The Boston Bruins attempted to restrain Sanderson and Cheevers from joining the WHA though a United States federal court refused to prohibit the signings The Black Hawks were successful in having a restraining order filed against Hull and the Jets pending the outcome of legal action the Black Hawks were taking against the WHA The new league was eager for the court action intending to challenge the legality of the reserve clause br In November Judge A Leon Higginbotham Jr of the U S District Court in Philadelphia placed an injunction against the NHL preventing it from enforcing the reserve clause and freeing all players who had restraining orders against them including Hull to play with their WHA clubs The decision effectively ended the NHL s monopoly on major league professional hockey talent br br br Teams br On November twelve teams were formally announced They included cities without NHL teams such as the Miami Screaming Eagles as well as teams in cities where the league s promoters believed there was room for more than one team such as the Los Angeles Aces Chicago Cougars and New York Raiders Two of the original twelve teams moved before the first season started the Dayton Arrows became the Houston Aeros and the San Francisco Sharks became the Quebec Nordiques The Los Angeles franchise then took the nickname Sharks to replace Aces The Calgary Broncos and the Screaming Eagles folded outright replaced by the Philadelphia Blazers and the Cleveland Crusaders br Although the league had many players under contract by June including a few NHL stars such as Bernie Parent many of them were career minor league and college players The new league was not considered much of a threat until Bobby Hull arguably the NHL s top forward at the time jumped over Hull had not been thought to be seriously considering signing with the WHA even though he was in contentious salary negotiations with the Chicago Black Hawks and when he told reporters that he would only move to the WHA for a million dollars it was both intended by Hull and taken by his audience to be a joke since a million dollars at that time was considered to be a ridiculous amount of money for a hockey player Nevertheless the Winnipeg Jets offered Hull a five year one million dollar contract with a one million dollar signing bonus Hull accepted the Jets offer sealing the deal in an elaborate signing ceremony at Portage and Main Hull s move to the upstart league attracted a few other top stars such as Cheevers Sanderson and Tremblay br The WHA officially made its debut on October at the Ottawa Civic Centre when the Alberta Oilers defeated the Ottawa Nationals Although the quality of hockey in the early years was predictably below that of the NHL the WHA had indeed made stars out of many players that had little or no playing time in the NHL br The New England Whalers eventually won the WHA s inaugural championship later renamed the Avco World Trophy when the Avco Financial Services Corporation became its main sponsor However the trophy had not yet been completed and the Whalers skated their divisional championship trophy around the ice surface much to the embarrassment of the WHA office br br br Problems br Right from the start the league was plagued with problems Many teams often found themselves in financial difficulty folding or moving from one city to another sometimes mid season Citing arena troubles two of the original twelve teams the Dayton Arrows and the San Francisco Sharks relocated before the first season began becoming the Houston Aeros and Quebec Nordiques respectively The Calgary Broncos and the Miami Screaming Eagles folded outright before the first puck dropped being replaced by the Philadelphia Blazers and the Cleveland Crusaders br The New York Raiders initially intended to be the WHA s flagship team suffered from numerous problems While they planned to play in the brand new Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum Nassau County did not consider the WHA a major league and wanted nothing to do with the Raiders The county recruited William Shea leader of New York City s successful lobbying campaign to get baseball s National League to expand following the departures of the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants Working with the NHL Shea swiftly won over the initially reluctant president of the New York Rangers Bill Jennings who was persuaded that it would be better to accept competition from an NHL team that would at least be willing to pay his club compensation for sharing the Rangers territory as opposed to a WHA team that would owe his franchise nothing The NHL quickly awarded a franchise to Long Island the New York Islanders who locked up the Coliseum for their own use from onwards The Raiders were first forced to rent space at Madison Square Garden where they were tenants to the Rangers The situation rapidly became untenable with an onerous lease and poor attendance so the three original owners defaulted and the league ended up taking control of the team midway through the season The Raiders were sold after their inaugural season They were renamed the New York Golden Blades for the season but were forced into a Sundays only home schedule due to the high price of rent and scheduling conflicts with other events at Madison Square Garden This was not enough to save the team and the league was forced to take over the franchise again games into the second season Realizing that it could not hope to compete with both the Rangers and the Islanders the WHA moved the Golden Blades to New Jersey soon after taking control Renamed the Jersey Knights they played at the Cherry Hill Arena which had a slope in the ice surface causing pucks to shoot upward from results of a pass or shot chain link fencing instead of Plexiglas surrounding the rink and inadequate cramped changing and dressing facilities br Ahead of the season Toronto Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard deliberately made the Toronto Toros lease terms at Maple Leaf Gardens as difficult as possible after they moved from Ottawa The Toros were owned by John F Bassett son of Canadian media mogul John Bassett The older Bassett had formerly been part owner of the Leafs with Ballard and Stafford Smythe before falling out with his two partners At the time of the Toros lease at Maple Leaf Gardens Ballard was serving a lengthy prison term for fraud and tax evasion and was unable to intervene but by the time the Toros played their first game Ballard had been paroled and had regained control of the Gardens Much to Bassett s outrage the arena was dim for the first game Ballard also ordered the cushions from the home bench removed for Toros games he told an arena worker Let em buy their own cushions It was obvious that Ballard was angered at the WHA being figuratively in his backyard and took out his frustration with the renegade league on the Toros These terms compelled Bassett to move the team to Birmingham after three seasons br The league bottomed out in with its third expansion team the Spurs A mainstay of the minor Western Hockey League they were originally supposed to join the NHL in the same way the Vancouver Canucks and California Golden Seals had in the preceding decade When the NHL reneged on the agreement and Spurs owner Ivan Mullenix was unable to negotiate an early entry into the NHL he accepted an offer to join the WHA for the season However Denver residents felt betrayed after three years of hype for an NHL team They did not consider the WHA a major league and stayed away from Spurs games br However halfway through the season the NHL s Kansas City Scouts began serious talks about moving to Denver Knowing he could not even begin to compete with an NHL team Mullenix began talks with a group of Ottawa businessmen who insisted the Spurs move immediately as a condition of further talks As a result the Spurs abruptly moved to become the Ottawa Civics while on a road trip After only seven games as the Civics the franchise folded when it became clear that the Ottawa group did not have nearly enough financing to buy the team The Spurs Civics franchise only played games total making them easily the shortest lived franchise in WHA history The NHL soon fulfilled its promise to Denver by moving the Scouts there to become the Colorado Rockies in the offseason br Part of the financial trouble was attributed to the high player salaries For instance the Philadelphia Blazers signed Derek Sanderson for million which surpassed that of Brazilian soccer star Pel making him the highest paid athlete in the world at the time Unfortunately his play did not live up to the expectations of his salary and between an early season injury intemperate remarks to the press and Blazer financial troubles Sanderson s contract was bought out before the end of the season br As well big stars lacked supporting players and the quality of the on ice product suffered br br br Competing for talent br The WHA won several key victories including a court ruling that prevented the NHL from binding players to its teams via the reserve clause and the signings of more NHL stars such as Gordie Howe Andre Lacroix Marc Tardif and in later years Frank Mahovlich and Paul Henderson Howe had been lured out of a two year retirement for the chance to play alongside his sons Mark and Marty who opted to turn pro a year ahead of their NHL draft eligibility br In the season to broaden a depleted talent pool the WHA began signing European players which the NHL had largely ignored up to that time in serious numbers including stars such as Swedish Anders Hedberg and Ulf Nilsson and Czech center Vaclav Nedomansky who had just defected from Czechoslovakia Winnipeg especially loaded up with Scandinavian players and became the class of the league with Hedberg and Nilsson combining with Bobby Hull to form one of hockey s most formidable forward lines Along with the mass import of European stars Vancouver attempted unsuccessfully to lure Phil Esposito away from the NHL by offering a contract similar to that of Bobby Hull with a million dollars upfront br br br International play br The Summit Series which pitted Team Canada against the Soviets did not permit WHA players due to the decision of series organizer Alan Eagleson an NHL agent who was influential in forming the Canadian team Bobby Hull one of the best WHA players was ruled ineligible to play because of his defection from the NHL despite being initially selected by coach Harry Sinden Dennis Hull initially planned to boycott the event as well as a show of support for his older brother but Bobby persuaded him to stay on Team Canada Other WHA stars turned down included Gerry Cheevers J C Tremblay and Derek Sanderson Some NHL owners also threatened not to free their players to participate if WHA players were permitted br The WHA organized the Summit Series against the Soviets giving an opportunity for Hull and year old Gordie Howe to play for Canada against the Soviet team which the Soviets won br In the Canada Cup the NHL and NHLPA broadened the scope of the competition inviting to the tournament a number of hockey countries and allowing each invited country to send the best possible team they could muster so this time WHA players were permitted WHA players played on four of the tournament s six teams br In December and January the Super Series tournament took place opposing the HC CSKA Moscow Red Army and WHA teams The Red Army won the series br br br Decline and merger br br By the season it had become evident that many of the WHA s franchises were teetering on the verge of financial collapse and that the at one time combined teams of the NHL and WHA had badly strained professional hockey s talent pool br In merger discussions with the National Hockey League were first initiated with Houston Cincinnati Winnipeg New England Quebec and Edmonton applying for entry to the NHL who voted the proposal down Merger discussions resumed in but Houston was not part of the proposal this time During the final series of talks Aeros owner Kenneth Schnitzer suggested to the NHL that either his team be admitted as an expansion team independent of a merger or he would attempt to purchase an existing club and relocate it to Houston Neither came to fruition and as a result the Aeros elected to fold on July Another proposal had the Edmonton Oilers and the New England Whalers moving to the NHL with the Winnipeg Jets following a year later but this was also not accepted by the NHL br The final two seasons of the WHA saw the debut of many superstars some of whom became hockey legends in the NHL including Wayne Gretzky Mark Messier Mike Liut and Mike Gartner The Birmingham Bulls alone featured future NHLers Rick Vaive Michel Goulet Rob Ramage Ken Linseman Craig Hartsburg Rod Langway Mark Napier Pat Riggin and Gaston Gingras br By the end of the final season only six teams remained Facing financial difficulty and unable to meet payrolls the WHA finally came to an agreement with the NHL in early Under the deal four WHA clubs the Edmonton Oilers New England Whalers renamed the Hartford Whalers Quebec Nordiques and Winnipeg Jets joined the NHL The other two WHA teams the Cincinnati Stingers and Birmingham Bulls were paid million apiece in compensation The NHL treated the new clubs arrival as an expansion not a merger and refused to recognize any WHA records While the four new clubs were allowed to stock their rosters through the expansion draft NHL teams were allowed to reclaim players who had jumped to the WHA br The WHA was able to extract three key concessions First the WHA teams were allowed to protect two goaltenders and two skaters to keep their rosters from being completely stripped clean by the NHL teams Second the NHL allowed all of the WHA s Canadian teams to be part of the deal The NHL had originally been willing to take only the Oilers Whalers and Jets but the WHA insisted that the Nordiques be included as well Third although the NHL had insisted on treating the deal as an expansion it agreed to freeze the expansion fee for each team at million U S the same fee paid by every other team that had joined the NHL in the s By comparison when the Atlanta Flames were sold and moved to Calgary one year later the sale was million U S br The deal came up for a vote at the NHL Board of Governors meeting in Key Largo Florida on March The final tally was one vote short of passage as a three quarters majority was required to permit a merger The Boston Bruins Los Angeles Kings Montreal Canadiens Toronto Maple Leafs and Vancouver Canucks voted against the deal The Bruins were not pleased with having to share New England with the Whalers Los Angeles and Vancouver feared losing home dates with NHL teams from the East Montreal and Toronto were not enamored at the prospect of having to split revenue from Hockey Night in Canada broadcasts six ways rather than three br When a second vote was held in Chicago on March Montreal and Vancouver changed their votes allowing the deal to go forward Vancouver and Los Angeles were won over by the promise of a balanced schedule with each team playing the others twice at home and twice on the road The Canadiens owners Molson Breweries were feeling the effects of a massive boycott that originated in Edmonton Quebec City and Winnipeg and spread across Canada With the boycott severely hurting Molson s sales the brewer reached agreement with the owners of the three Canadian WHA teams to have Molson replace their competitors and Nordiques owners Carling O Keefe as the exclusive beer supplier for the Oilers and Jets arenas it is probable that this concession was made in exchange for the Canadiens vote br The agreement officially took effect on June three months to the day after the deciding vote On that day the WHA folded and the NHL formally granted expansion franchises to Edmonton Hartford Quebec City and Winnipeg br br br Legacy of the WHA br On the ice the WHA teams had proven themselves to be the NHL s competitive equals winning more games than they lost in interleague exhibition games br The WHA had many lasting effects on NHL hockey The NHL used to recruit virtually all its players from Canada but following the success of the Jets Hedberg and Nilsson scouts began looking overseas for the best players that Europe could offer Teams such as the Whalers and Fighting Saints offered excellent opportunities for young American players and several U S born or raised NHL stars of the early s such as Mark Howe Rod Langway Dave Langevin Robbie Ftorek and Paul Holmgren had begun their pro careers in the WHA As a result the NHL evolved into a truly cosmopolitan league during the s br The WHA ended the NHL policy of paying its players only a fraction of the league s profits and combined with the abolition of the reserve clause led to much higher player salaries Many great stars began their careers in the WHA including Mark Howe Wayne Gretzky Mike Gartner Mike Liut and Mark Messier who was the last WHA veteran to play in the NHL he opened his professional career with games with the Indianapolis Racers and Cincinnati Stingers in and played his last NHL game on April The final active player and official in any on ice capacity for the league was referee Don Koharski who started as a linesman for the WHA and retired at the end of the NHL season br The WHA instituted sudden death overtime for regular season games to break ties If no team scored during a minute overtime period the game ended in a tie In the season the NHL then instituted a minute sudden death overtime period to break regular season ties br The WHA had experimented with blue colored pucks which were supposedly easier for fans to see The NHL did not adopt the blue pucks but any remaining blue WHA pucks are highly sought after collectors items br br br Fate of surviving teams br The former WHA clubs by the terms of the expansion could protect only two goalies and two skaters each in the player dispersal draft The Jets posted a dismal nine wins in their second season second fewest all time for a season in the NHL and finished last The other WHA teams did respectably well in their first year with the Whalers and Oilers earning playoff berths The Oilers chose to protect Wayne Gretzky in the dispersal draft which would prove fortuitous Gretzky and the Whalers Gordie Howe were selected to the mid season All Star Game respectively the second youngest and the oldest ever to play in the match br The s was a successful period for the former WHA teams The Oilers shattered numerous NHL records and amassed a Stanley Cup dynasty winning five Cups in its first eleven seasons The Jets of the s decimated by the dispersal draft developed a solid nucleus of players that helped the club achieve respectable regular season finishes After missing the playoffs in their first NHL season the Nordiques quickly became competitive advancing as far as the third round of the playoffs in their third season Quebec developed an intense rivalry with the Montreal Canadiens The Whalers had similar rivalries with the Boston Bruins and New York Rangers and skated to the Adams Division title br In the s the former WHA clubs suffered from escalating player salaries ironically the same trend that was instigated by the WHA The ex WHA clubs based in Canada were also hit hard by the declining value of the Canadian dollar The Nordiques moved to Denver in and became the Colorado Avalanche where they have won the Stanley Cup three times the Winnipeg Jets moved to Phoenix in and became the Phoenix Coyotes and the Hartford Whalers moved to North Carolina in and became the Carolina Hurricanes where they have won the Stanley Cup in To date the Oilers remain as the last ex WHA team still in its original city where they have won the Stanley Cup five times Only the Jets current Arizona Coyotes franchise has not yet won the Cup with their furthest advance in the Stanley Cup playoffs being the Western Conference Finals in Due to ongoing arena issues the Jets Coyotes franchise suspended operations in if the franchise obtains a new arena by no later than they can rejoin the
