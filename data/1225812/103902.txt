title: Emergency position-indicating radiobeacon
id: 103902
An emergency position indicating radiobeacon EPIRB is a type of emergency locator beacon for commercial and recreational boats a portable battery powered radio transmitter used in emergencies to locate boaters in distress and in need of immediate rescue In the event of an emergency such as a ship sinking or medical emergency onboard the transmitter is activated and begins transmitting a continuous MHz distress radio signal which is used by search and rescue teams to quickly locate the emergency and render aid The signal is detected by satellites operated by an international consortium of rescue services COSPAS SARSAT which can detect emergency beacons anywhere on Earth transmitting on the distress frequency of MHz The satellites calculate the position or utilize the GPS coordinates of the beacon and quickly passes the information to the appropriate local first responder organization which performs the search and rescue As Search and Rescue approach the search areas they use Direction Finding DF equipment to locate the beacon using the MHz homing signal or in newer EPIRBs the AIS location signal The basic purpose of this system is to help rescuers find survivors within the so called golden day the first hours following a traumatic event during which the majority of survivors can usually be saved The feature distinguishing a modern EPIRB often called GPIRB from other types of emergency beacon is that it contains a GPS receiver and broadcasts its position usually accurate within m ft to facilitate location Previous emergency beacons without a GPS can only be localized to within km mi by the COSPAS satellites and relied heavily upon the MHz homing signal to pin point the beacons location as they arrived on scene br The standard frequency of a modern EPIRB is MHz It is an internationally regulated mobile radiocommunication service that aids search and rescue operations to detect and locate distressed watercraft aircraft and people br The first form of these beacons was the MHz ELT which was designed as an automatic locator beacon for crashed military aircraft These beacons were first used in the s by the U S military and were mandated for use on many types of commercial and general aviation aircraft beginning in the early s The frequency and signal format used by the ELT beacons was not designed for satellite detection which resulted in a system with poor location detection abilities and long delays in detection of activated beacons The satellite detection network was built after the ELT beacons were already in general use with the first satellite not being launched until and even then the satellites only provided detection with location accuracy being roughly km mi The technology was later expanded to cover use on vessels at sea EPIRB individual persons PLB and starting in maritime survivor locating devices MSLD All have migrated from using MHz as their primary frequency to using MHz which was designed for satellite detection and location br Since the inception of Cospas Sarsat in distress radio beacons have assisted in the rescue of over people in more than distress situations In alone the system provided information used to rescue persons in distress situations br br br Types of emergency locator beacons br The several types of emergency locator beacons are distinguished by the environment for which they were designed to be used br br ELT emergency locator transmitters are carried on aircraft and are activated in the event of a crash br Activated by G switch crash sensor or manually by cockpit remote switch or ON switch on ELT br EPIRB emergency position indicating radio beacons are carried on ships and boats and signal maritime distress br Activated by water when the beacon is out of the bracket or manually by the ON switch on the EPIRB br SEPIRB submarine emergency position indicating radio beacons are EPIRBs designed only for use on submarines br SSAS ship security alert systems are used to indicate possible piracy or terrorism attacks discreetly on sea going vessels br Activated by discreet switch button in the ship s bridge or cabin or manually on the SSAS br PLB personal locator beacons are carried by individuals and intended to indicate a person in distress who is away from normal emergency services e g They are also used for crew saving applications in shipping and lifeboats at terrestrial systems In New South Wales some police stations and the NSW National Parks Wildlife Service provide personal locator beacons to hikers for no charge br Activated manually by deploying antenna and pressing the ON button switch br Distress alerts transmitted from ELTs EPIRBs SSAS and PLBs are received and processed by the International Cospas Sarsat Programme the international satellite system for search and rescue SAR These beacons transmit a MHz distress signal every seconds varying over a span of seconds to avoid multiple beacons always transmitting at the same time br When manually activated or automatically activated upon immersion or impact such beacons send out a distress signal The signals are monitored worldwide and the location of the distress is detected by non geostationary satellites using the Doppler effect for trilateration and in more recent EPIRBs also by GPS br Loosely related devices including search and rescue transponders SART AIS SART avalanche transceivers and RECCO do not operate on MHz thus are covered in separate articles br br br International COSPAS SARSAT Programme br Cospas Sarsat is an international organization that has been a model of international cooperation even during the Cold War SARSAT means search and rescue satellite aided tracking COSPAS is an acronym for the Russian words COsmicheskaya Sistema Poiska Avariynyh Sudov which translates to space system for the search of vessels in distress A consortium of USSR the U S Canada and France formed the organization in Since then other countries have joined br The satellites used in the system include br br LEOSAR or Low Earth Orbiting Search and Rescue Satellites br The LEOSAR system calculates the location of distress events using Doppler processing techniques Doppler processing is based upon the principle that the frequency of the distress beacon as heard by the satellite instrument is affected by the relative velocity of the satellite with respect to the beacon By monitoring the change of the beacon frequency of the received beacon signal and knowing the exact position of the satellite the LUT is able to calculate the location of the beacon br GEOSAR or Geosynchronous Earth Orbiting Search and Rescue Satellites br As a GEOSAR satellite remains fixed relative to the Earth rotating with the earth around the equator GEOSAR satellites utilize the GPS provided by the EPIRB PLB or ELT to provide rescuers with beacon position information br MEOSAR or Mid Earth Orbiting Search and Rescue Satellites br The newest of the Cospas Sarsat satellites detect EPIRB PLB and ELT distress signals in almost real time i e within minutes including the beacons location with or without GPS br The new MEOSAR system also provides the framework along with the Galileo Global Navigation Satellite System GNSS for EPIRBs PLBs and EPIRBs to utilize the new Return Link Service or RLS that provides a confirmation message from Search and Rescue back to the beacon to let the survivors know their distress message was confirmed br Cospas Sarsat defines standards for beacons auxiliary equipment to be mounted on conforming weather and communication satellites ground stations and communications methods The satellites communicate the beacon data to their ground stations which forward it to main control centers of each nation that can initiate a rescue effort br Cospas Sarsat Monitoring include br br Local User Terminals LUTs br Mission Control Centers MCC br Rescue Coordination Center RCC br br br Detection and location br br A transmission is typically detected and processed in this manner br br The transmitter is activated either automatically in a crash or after sinking or manually by survivors of an emergency situation br At least one satellite picks up the beacon s transmission br The satellites transfer the beacon s signal to their respective ground control stations br The ground stations process the signals and forward the data including approximate location to a national authority br The national authority forwards the data to a rescue authority br The rescue authority uses its own receiving equipment afterwards to locate the beacon and commence its own rescue or recovery operations br Once the satellite data is received less than a minute is needed to forward them to any signatory nation The primary means of detection and location is by the COSPAS SARSAT satellites However additional means of location are frequently used For example the FAA requires that all pilots monitor MHz whenever possible and the USCG has a network of direction finder sites along the coastlines The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration maintains a near real time map that shows SARSAT U S Rescues br Several systems are in use with beacons of varying expense different types of satellites and varying performance Carrying even the oldest systems provides an immense improvement in safety over carrying none br The types of satellites in the network are br br LEOSAR br Support Doppler detection and reception of encoded position br Receivers are payloads on various Low Earth Orbit satellites br MEOSAR br Medium Earth Orbiting Search and Rescue br Receivers are payloads on the U S GPS satellites on the Russian GLONASS satellites and on the European GALILEO satellites br GEOSAR br Supports only reception of encoded position br Receivers are payloads on various geosynchronous satellites including some of the U S GOES weather satellites including GOES br When one of the COSPAS SARSAT satellites detects a beacon the detection is passed to one of the program s roughly Mission Control Centers such as USMCC in Suitland Maryland where the detected location and beacon details are used to determine to which rescue coordination centre for example the U S Coast Guard s PACAREA RCC in Alameda California to pass the alert br br br Beacon operation br br br GPS based registered br The MHz beacons with GPS track with a precision of m in the of the world closest to the equator and send a serial number so the responsible authority can look up phone numbers to notify the registrant e g next of kin in four minutes br The GPS system permits stationary wide view geosynchronous communications satellites to enhance the Doppler position received by low Earth orbit satellites EPIRB beacons with built in GPS are usually called GPIRBs for GPS position indicating radio beacon or global position indicating radio beacon br However rescue cannot begin until a Doppler track is available The COSPAS SARSAT specifications say that a beacon location is not considered resolved unless at least two Doppler tracks match or a Doppler track confirms an encoded GPS track One or more GPS tracks are not sufficient br br br High precision registered br An intermediate technology MHz beacon now mostly obsolete in favor of GPS enabled units has worldwide coverage locates within km km search area notifies kin and rescuers in hours maximum min average and has a serial number to look up phone numbers etc This can take up to two hours because it has to use moving weather satellites to locate the beacon To help locate the beacon the beacon s frequency is controlled to parts per billion and its power is five watts br Both of the above types of beacons usually include an auxiliary milliwatt beacon at MHz to guide rescue aircraft br br br Traditional ELT unregistered br The oldest cheapest beacons are aircraft ELTs that send an anonymous warble on the aviation band distress frequency at MHz The frequency is often routinely monitored by commercial aircraft but has not been monitored by satellite since Feb br These distress signals could be detected by satellite over only of the earth required up to hours for notification located within km mi search area of km were anonymous and could not be located well because their frequency is only accurate to parts per million and the signals were broadcast using only milliwatts of power Coverage was partial because the satellite had to be in view of both the beacon and a ground station at the same time the satellites did not store and forward the beacon s position Coverage in polar and Southern Hemisphere areas was poor br False alarms were common as the beacon transmitted on the aviation emergency frequency with interference from other electronic and electrical systems To reduce false alarms a beacon was confirmed by a second satellite pass which could easily slow confirmation of a case of distress to as much as hours although in rare circumstances the satellites could be positioned such that immediate detection becomes possible br br br Location by Doppler without GPS br The Cospas Sarsat system was made possible by Doppler processing Local user terminals LUTs detecting nongeostationary satellites interpret the Doppler frequency shift heard by LEOSAR and MEOSAR satellites as they pass over a beacon transmitting at a fixed frequency The interpretation determines both bearing and range The range and bearing are measured from the rate of change of the heard frequency which varies both according to the path of the satellite in space and the rotation of the earth This triangulates the position of the beacon A faster change in the Doppler indicates that the beacon is closer to the satellite s orbit If the beacon is moving toward or away from the satellite track due to the Earth s rotation it is on one side or other of the satellite s path Doppler shift is zero at the closest point of approach between the beacon and the orbit br If the beacon s frequency is more precise it can be located more precisely saving search time so modern MHz beacons are accurate to parts per billion giving a search area of only km compared to the older beacons accurate to parts per million that had km of search area br To increase the useful power and handle multiple simultaneous beacons modern MHz beacons transmit in bursts and remain silent for about seconds br Russia developed the original system and its success drove the desire to develop the improved MHz system The original system was a brilliant adaptation to the low quality beacons originally designed to aid air searches It used just a simple lightweight transponder on the satellite with no digital recorders or other complexities Ground stations listened to each satellite as long as it was above the horizon Doppler shift was used to locate the beacon s Multiple beacons were separated when a computer program analysed the signals with a fast Fourier transform Also two satellite passes per beacon were used This eliminated false alarms by using two measurements to verify the beacon s location from two different bearings This prevented false alarms from VHF channels that affected a single satellite Regrettably the second satellite pass almost doubled the average time before notification of the rescuing authority However the notification time was much less than a day br br br Satellites br Receivers are auxiliary systems mounted on several types of satellites This substantially reduces the program s cost The weather satellites that carry the SARSAT receivers are in ball of yarn orbits inclined at degrees The longest period that all satellites can be out of line of sight of a beacon is about two hours The first satellite constellation was launched in the early s by the Soviet Union Canada France and the United States br Some geosynchronous satellites have beacon receivers Since the end of there are four such geostationary satellites GEOSAR that cover more than of the surface of the earth As with all geosynchronous satellites they are located above the equator The GEOSAR satellites do not cover the polar caps Since they see the Earth as a whole they see the beacon immediately but have no motion and thus no Doppler frequency shift to locate it However if the beacon transmits GPS data the geosynchronous satellites give nearly instantaneous response br br br Search and rescue response br Emergency beacons operating on MHz transmit a unique or character serial number called a hex code When the beacon is purchased the hex code should be registered with the relevant national or international authority After one of the mission control centers has detected the signal this registration information is passed to the rescue coordination center which then provides the appropriate search and rescue agency with crucial information such as br br phone numbers to call br a description of the vessel aircraft vehicle or person in the case of a PLB br the home port of a vessel or aircraft br any additional information that may be useful to SAR agencies br Registration information allows SAR agencies to start a rescue more quickly For example if a shipboard telephone number listed in the registration is unreachable it could be assumed that a real distress event is occurring Conversely the information provides a quick and easy way for the SAR agencies to check and eliminate false alarms potentially sparing the beacon s owner from significant false alert fines br An unregistered MHz beacon still carries some information such as the manufacturer and serial number of the beacon and in some cases an MMSI or aircraft tail number ICAO bit address Despite the clear benefits of registration an unregistered MHz beacon is very substantially better than a MHz beacon because the hex code received from a MHz beacon confirms the authenticity of the signal as a real distress signal br Beacons operating on MHz and MHz only simply transmit an anonymous siren tone thus carry no position or identity information to SAR agencies Such beacons now rely solely on the terrestrial or aeronautical monitoring of the frequency br br br Responsible agencies br RCCs are responsible for a geographic area known as a search and rescue region of responsibility SRR SRRs are designated by the International Maritime Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization RCCs are operated unilaterally by personnel of a single military service e g an air force or a navy or a single civilian service e g a national police force or a coast guard br br br Americas br These international search and rescue points of contact receive SAR alerts from the USMCC br br br United States br The U S NOAA operates the U S Mission Control Center USMCC in Suitland Maryland br It distributes beacon signal reports to one or more of these RCCs br br The US Coast Guard web page for EPIRBs states You may be fined for false activation of an unregistered EPIRB The US Coast Guard routinely refers cases involving the nondistress activation of an EPIRB e g as a hoax through gross negligence carelessness or improper storage and handling to the Federal Communications Commission The FCC will prosecute cases based upon evidence provided by the Coast Guard and will issue warning letters or notices of apparent liability for fines up to br br br Canada br The Canadian Mission Control Centre receives and distributes

service br Because of the extremely high numbers of false alerts on the MHz frequency over of all COSPAS SARSAT alerts the IMO eventually requested for a termination of COSPAS SARSAT processing of MHz signals The ICAO Council also agreed to this phase out request and the COSPAS SARSAT Council decided that future satellites would no longer carry the MHz search and rescue repeater SARR Since February only MHz beacons are detected by the international Cospas Sarsat SAR satellite system This affects all maritime beacons EPIRBs all aviation beacons ELTs and all personal beacons PLBs In other words Cospas Sarsat has ceased satellite detection and processing of MHz beacons These older beacons are now only detectable by ground based receivers and aircraft br EPIRBs that do not transmit on MHz are banned on boats in the United States and in many other jurisdictions More information about the switch to MHz is available on Cospas Sarsat s Phase Out page br Despite the switch to MHz pilots and ground stations are encouraged to continue to monitor for transmissions on the emergency frequencies as most MHz beacons are required to be equipped with homers Furthermore the MHz frequency continues remains the official global VHF aircraft voice distress frequency br br br FAA transition status br In a Safety Recommendation released September the U S National Transportation Safety Board once again recommended that the U S FAA require all aircraft have MHz ELTs They first recommended this back in and after vigorous opposition by AOPA the FAA declined to do so Citing two recent accidents one with a MHz ELT and one with a MHz ELT the NTSB concludes that switching all ELTs to MHz is a necessary goal to work towards br NASA has conducted crash tests with small airplanes to investigate how ELTs perform br br br Emergency Locator Transmitters br br Emergency Locator Transmitters ELTs are fairly expensive aviation use Average cost is locator beacons In commercial aircraft a cockpit voice recorder or flight data recorder must contain an underwater locator beacon In the US ELTs are required to be permanently installed in most general aviation aircraft depending upon the type or location of operation br The specifications for the design of ELTs are published by the RTCA and in the specification the alarm signal is defined as an AM signal A X and or N N emissions containing a swept tone ranging from Hz to Hz downwards with sweeps per second When activated MHz units transmit a second watt digital burst every seconds varying within a span of seconds somewhat randomly so as to avoid multiple ELTs always having their beacons synchronized br As per CFR a ELTs built according to TSO C Archived at the Wayback Machine of the type described below as Traditional ELT unregistered have not been permitted for new installations since June the replacing standard was TSO C a Furthermore TSO C a ELTs are being replaced supplemented by the TSO C MHz ELT a far superior unit br ELTs are unique among distress radiobeacons in that they have impact monitors and are activated by g force br Although monitoring of and MHz Class B distress signals by satellite ceased in February the FAA has not mandated an upgrade of older ELT units to MHz in United States aircraft Transport Canada has put forward a proposed regulatory requirement that requires upgrade to Canadian registered aircraft to either a MHz ELT or an alternate means system however elected officials have overruled the recommendation of Transport Canada for the regulation and have asked for a looser regulation to be drafted by Transport Canada Recent information indicates Transport Canada may permit private general aviation flight with only an existing MHz ELT if there is a placard visible to all passengers stating to the effect that the aircraft does not comply with international recommendations for the carriage of the MHz emergency alerting device and is not detectable by satellites in the event of a crash br In the case of MHz beacons the frequency is known in aviation as the VHF Guard emergency frequency and all U S civilian pilots private and commercial are required by FAA policy to monitor this frequency when it is possible to do so The frequency can be used by Automatic Direction Finder ADF radionavigation equipment which is being phased out in favor of VOR and GPS but is still found on many aircraft ELTs are relatively large and would fit in a cube about cm in on a side and weigh to kg to lb br ELTs were first mandated in by FAA technical standard order TSO C The original TSO C and updated TSO C A were officially deprecated as of February when reception of the MHz signal was deactivated on all of the SAR satellite in favor of the C ELT models with their MHz Cospas Sarsat beacons However the MHz signal is still used for close in direction finding of a downed aircraft br br br ELT activation br Automatic ELTs have impact monitors activated by g force Numerous activities such as aerobatics hard landings movement by ground crews and aircraft maintenances can generate false alarms which can interfere with and cannot be distinguished from genuine emergency transmissions br br br ELT sub classification br Emergency locator transmitters ELTs for aircraft may be classed as follows br br A automatically ejected br AD automatic deployable br F Fixed br AF automatic fixed br AP automatic portable br W water activated br S survival br Within these classes an ELT may be either a digital MHz beacon or an analog beacon see below br br br Obsolete ELTs br Any ELT that is not a MHz ELT with a Hex Code became obsolete February br According to the U S Federal Aviation Administration ground testing of A B and S type ELTs is to be done within the first minutes of each hour Testing is restricted to three audio sweeps Type I and II devices those transmitting at MHz have a self test function and must not be activated except in an actual emergency br br

Recorder in the early s br In the UK by the first automatic beacon for liferafts had been produced by Ultra Electronics and at the same time Burndept produced the TALBE Talk and Listen Beacon Equipment VHF and SARBE Search And Rescue Beacon Equipment UHF range of beacons which were used by the Fleet Air Arm and later Royal Air Force Later SARBE beacons included a radio for voice communication by the survivor with the rescuing personnel br Jan FAA Advisory Circular investigated ELTs br Mar FAA Advisory Circular advised pilots to install ELTs br A Saturday Evening Post article covered the death of year old Carla Corbus who survived though badly injured along with her mother for days after the plane her step dad was flying crashed in the Trinity Alps of California in March He was lost and died in the woods looking for rescue br The winter search for the Hawthorne Nevada Airlines Flight Gamblers Special DC that crashed on February in the Sierra Nevada Mountains Five aircraft crashed and five searchers were killed while trying to find Flight br Carriage requirements for emergency locator beacons on most US non jet powered fixed wing civil aircraft became law on December with the signing of Senate bill S The Occupational Safety and Health Act of Public Law as a last minute rider to the Occupational Safety and Health Act Senator Peter Dominick R Colorado added the unrelated beacon language as a rider to the bill which became section of the law Earlier in the session he tried to add the requirements as an amendment to House bill H R the Airport and Airways Development Act of but was unsuccessful It required most general aviation aircraft to install ELTs by Dec and it preempted all the state ELT laws The federal ELT law left the matter of alerting vague although the initial idea was alerting by over flying aircraft which could receive an ELT s milliwatt signal from nautical miles away The law set the compliance dates as one year after passage for newly manufactured or imported aircraft December and three years for existing aircraft December In response to the law the Federal Aviation Administration FAA published on March Notice of Proposed Rule Making NPRM with the proposed amendments to the Federal Aviation Regulations FAR After public comment the final rules were published in the Federal Register on September br The disappearance of U S Congressmen Hale Boggs and Nick Begich in a general aviation aircraft on October sparked the then largest ever search and rescue effort which proved fruitless This high profile event further hastened the mandating of ELTs aboard aircraft br The RTCA published DO DO and DO which the FAA then adopted the three DO documents as Technical Standard Order TSO C br After problems with the C ELTs The FAA responded to the defective early ELTs by outlawing the installation of C ELTs and certifying C a ELTs with an improved gravity switch improved crash and fire worthy casing and batteries that work in colder temperatures br March AC Emergency Locator Transmitters and Receivers br Dec TSO C MHz Emergency Locator Transmitter ELT defines the MHz ELT br br br Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon br Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons EPIRBs are a development of the ELT designed specifically for use on boats and ships and basic models tend to be less expensive than ELTs average cost is As such instead of using an impact sensor to activate the beacon they typically use a water sensing device or a submerged sensing device that activates and releases a floating beacon after it has been submerged in between and meters of water In addition to the MHz signal mandated by C S T the IMO and ICAO require an auxiliary MHz at another frequency in order to support the large installed base of MHz direction finding equipment br The RTCM Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services maintains specifications specific to EPIRB devices The alarm signal is defined as an AM signal A X and or N N emissions containing a swept tone ranging from Hz to Hz either upwards or downwards with sweeps per second br EPIRBs with an AIS transmitter are allocated MMSI numbers in the range yyzzzz br br br EPIRB sub classification br Emergency position indicating radio beacons EPIRBs are sub classified as follows br Recognized categories br br Category I MHz Float free automatically activated EPIRB Detectable by satellite anywhere in the world Recognized by GMDSS br Category II MHz Similar to Category I except is manually activated Some models are also water activated br Obsolete classes br br Class A MHz Float free automatically activating Due to limited signal coverage and possible lengthy delays in signal recognition the U S Coast Guard no longer recommends use of this type These devices have been phased out by the U S Federal Communications Commission FCC and are no longer recognized br Class B MHz Manually activated version of Class A These devices have been phased out by the FCC and are no longer recognized br Class S MHz Similar to Class B except it floats or is an integral part of a survival craft lifeboat or survival suit These devices have been phased out by the FCC and are no longer recognized Their use is no longer recommended by the U S Coast Guard br Class C Marine VHF ch Manually activated these beacons operate on maritime channels only and therefore are not detectable by satellite or normal aircraft Designed for small crafts operating close to shore this type was only recognized in the United States Use of these units was phased out in These devices

beacons were float free automatically activated EPIRBs operated on MHz and were detectable by the Inmarsat geostationary satellite system and were recognized by GMDSS but not by the United States In September Inmarsat announced that it was terminating its Inmarsat E EPIRB service as of December due to a lack of interest in the maritime community br Furthermore the U S Coast Guard recommend that no EPIRB of any type manufactured before be used br EPIRBs are a component of the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System GMDSS Most commercial off shore working vessels with passengers are required to carry a self deploying EPIRB while most in shore and fresh water craft are not br As part of the United States efforts to prepare beacon users for the end of MHz frequency processing by satellites the FCC has prohibited the use of MHz EPIRBs as of January CFR See NOAA s statement on the phaseout Archived at the Wayback Machine br br br EPIRB activation br Automatic EPIRBs are water activated Some EPIRBs also deploy this means that they physically depart from their mounting bracket on the exterior of the vessel usually by going into the water br For a marine EPIRB to begin transmitting a signal or activate it first needs to come out of its bracket or deploy Deployment can happen either manually where someone must physically remove it from its bracket or automatically where water pressure will cause a hydrostatic release unit to separate the EPIRB from its bracket If it does not come out of the bracket it will not activate There is a magnet in the bracket which operates a reed safety switch in the EPIRB This prevents accidental activation if the unit gets wet from rain or shipped seas br Once deployed EPIRBs can be activated depending on the circumstances either manually crewman flicks a switch or automatically when water contacts the unit s sea switch All modern EPIRBs provide both methods of activation and deployment and thus are labelled Manual and Automatic Deployment and Activation br br br Automatic hydrostatic release unit br A hydrostatic release unit is designed to deploy automatically when submerged to a prescribed depth the pressure of

externally provided br PLB with no GPS data br All PLBs transmit in digital mode on MHz There are AIS PLBs that transmit on VHF br Personal locator beacons operating on MHz must be registered PLBs should not be used in cases where normal emergency response such as exists br br br Obsolete PLBs br U S Military forces at one time used MHz beacons such as the PRC which had a built in VHF radio The military is replacing them with modern MHz PLBs br br br Beacon content br The most important aspect of a beacon in classification is the mode of transmission There are two valid transmission modes digital and analog Where digital usually has a longer range analog is more reliable Analog beacons are useful to search parties and SAR aircraft though they are no longer monitored by satellite br br br Analog MHz homing signal br All ELTs all PLBs and most EPIRBs are required to have a low power homing signal that is identical to the original MHz VHF beacon signal However due to the extremely large number of false alarms that the old beacons generated the transmit power was greatly reduced and because the VHF transmitter typically uses the same antenna as the UHF beacon the radiated signal is further reduced by the inherent inefficiencies of transmitting with an antenna not tuned to the transmitted signal br br br Digital MHz beacons br MHz UHF beacons transmit bursts of digital information to orbiting satellites and may also contain a low power integrated analog MHz homing beacon They can be uniquely identified via GEOSAR Advanced beacons encode a GPS or GLONASS position into the signal All beacons are located by Doppler triangulation to confirm the location The digital data identifies the registered user A phone call by authorities to the registered phone number often eliminates false alarms false alarms are the typical case If there is a problem the beacon location data guides search and rescue efforts No beacon is ignored Anonymous beacons are confirmed by two Doppler tracks before beginning beacon location efforts br The distress message transmitted by a beacon contains the information such as br br Which country the beacon originates from br A unique digit hexadecimal beacon identification code a hex ID br The encoded identification of the vessel or aircraft in distress either as an MMSI value or as in the case of an ELT either the aircraft s registration or its ICAO bit address from its Mode S transponder br When equipped a GPS position br Whether or not the beacon contains a MHz homing transmitter br The digital distress message generated by the beacon varies according to the above factors and is encoded in hexadecimal characters The unique character digital identity the hex ID is hard coded in the firmware of the beacon The MHz carrier signal is modulated plus or minus radians with the data encoded using Manchester encoding which ensures a net zero phase shift aiding Doppler location br br br MHz beacon facts and transmission schedule br MHz beacons transmit for a quarter of a second immediately when turned on and then transmit a digital burst once every seconds thereafter Both GEOSAR and LEOSAR satellites monitor these signals br The repetition period shall not be so stable that any two transmitters appear to be synchronized closer than a few seconds over a minute period The intent is that no two beacons will have all of their bursts coincident The period shall be randomised around a mean value of seconds so that time intervals between transmission are randomly distributed on the interval to seconds specification for first generation beacons br Preliminary specification for second generation beacons From beacon activation a total of initial transmissions shall be made separated by fixed s s intervals The first transmission shall commence within seconds of beacon activation Transmissions shall then occur at nominally second intervals until minutes after beacon activation The repetition period between the start of two successive transmissions shall be randomised around the stated nominal value so that intervals between successive transmissions are randomly distributed over seconds Subsequent transmissions TBD br MHz beacons will be the only beacons compatible with the MEOSAR DASS system br MHz beacons must be registered see below br br br Hex codes br Example hex codes look like the following B BC FF br br A bit telling whether the message is short hex digits or long hex digits format br A country code which lets the worldwide COSPAS SARSAT central authority identify the national authority responsible for the beacon br Embedded Hex ID or hex transmitted distress message for example F FFBFF The hex ID is printed or stamped on the outside of the beacon and is hard coded into its firmware The hex ID can only be reprogrammed by certified distress radiobeacon technicians The national authority uses this number to look up phone numbers and other contact information for the beacon This is crucial to handle the large number of false alarms generated by beacons br A location protocol number and type of location protocol EPIRB or MMSI as well as all the data fields of that location protocol If the beacon is equipped with GPS or GLONASS a rough rounded latitude and longitude giving the beacon s current position In some aircraft beacons this data is taken from the aircraft s navigation system br When a beacon is sold to another country the purchaser is responsible for having the beacon reprogrammed with a new country code and to register it with their nation s beacon registry and the seller is responsible to de register the deprecated beacon ID with their national beacon registry br One can use the beacon decoder web page at Cospas Sarsat to extract the hex ID from the hex distress message br br br Frequencies br Distress beacons transmit distress signals on the following key frequencies the frequency used distinguishes the capabilities of the beacon A recognized beacon can operate on one of the three currently Cospas Sarsat satellite compatible frequencies In the past other frequencies were also used as a part of the search and rescue system br br

and aircraft operating under International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea SOLAS and International Civil Aviation Organization ICAO regulations must register their beacons Some national administrations including the United States Canada Australia and the UK also require registration of MHz beacons br br There is no charge to register MHz beacons br The U S Coast Guard warns that a user s life may be saved as a result of registered emergency information because it can respond more quickly to signals from registered beacons br Unless the national registry authority advises otherwise personal information contained in a beacon is used exclusively for SAR distress alert resolution purposes br The Cospas Sarsat Handbook of Beacon Regulations provides the status of MHz

mounted on the vessel on which the survivor was traveling br br br AIS SART br br These devices are distinct from traditional SAR radar transponders SART as they transmit AIS messages containing accurate GPS position information and include a GPS receiver and a transmitter on VHF AIS channels so they show up on ship AIS receivers They are lightweight and can be used to equip inflatable

Emergency Notification Device and examples include SPOT and inReach br br br APRS br br APRS is used by amateur radio operators to track positions and send short messages Most APRS packets contain a GPS latitude and longitude so they can be used for both normal and emergency tracking They also are routed to the Internet where they are archived for some period of time and viewable by others There are several emergency packet types that can indicate distress Since it is part of the amateur radio service it costs nothing to transmit on and uses the extensive network however one must be a licensed amateur radio operator There is also no guarantee that an APRS distress packet report would be seen or handled by emergency responders It would have to be seen by an amateur radio operator
