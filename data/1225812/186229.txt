A raft is any flat structure for support or transportation over water It is usually of basic design characterized by the absence of a hull Rafts are usually kept afloat by using any combination of buoyant materials such as wood sealed barrels or inflated air chambers such as pontoons and are typically not propelled by an engine Rafts are an ancient mode of transport naturally occurring rafts such as entwined vegetation and pieces of wood have been used to traverse water since the dawn of humanity br br br Human made rafts br br br Traditional or primitive rafts were constructed of wood bamboo or reeds early buoyed or float rafts use inflated animal skins or sealed clay pots which are lashed together Modern float rafts may also use pontoons drums or extruded polystyrene blocks Depending on its use and size it may have a superstructure masts or rudders br Timber rafting is used by the logging industry for the transportation of logs by tying them together into rafts and drifting or pulling them down a river This method was very common up until the middle of the th century but is now used only rarely br br Large rafts made of balsa logs and using sails for navigation were important in maritime trade on the Pacific Ocean coast of South America from pre Columbian times until the th century Voyages were made to locations as far away as Mexico and many trans Pacific voyages using replicas of ancient rafts have been undertaken to demonstrate possible contacts between South America and Polynesia br The type of raft used for recreational rafting is almost exclusively an inflatable raft manufactured of flexible materials for use on whitewater br br br Natural rafts br In biology particularly in island biogeography non manmade rafts are an important concept Such rafts consist of matted clumps of vegetation that has been swept off the dry land by a storm tsunami tide earthquake or similar event in modern times they sometimes also incorporate other kind of flotsam and jetsam e g plastic containers They stay afloat by its natural buoyancy and can travel for hundreds even thousands of miles and are ultimately destroyed by wave action and decomposition or make landfall br Rafting events are important means of oceanic dispersal for non flying animals For small mammals amphibians and reptiles in particular but for many invertebrates as well such rafts of vegetation are often the only means by which they could reach and if they are lucky colonize oceanic islands before human built vehicles provided another mode of transport br br br Image gallery br br br See also br br br br br br External links br br Rafting on the Drina River BH Film Official chanal br World of Boats EISCA Collection Australian Reed Raft br World of Boats EISCA Collection Brazilian Jangada br Homemade Raft Plans and Photos of Rafts br Neutrino Raft vessels made from scrap br Types of Whitewater Rafts
