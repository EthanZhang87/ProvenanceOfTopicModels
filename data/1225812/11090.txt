A forest is an ecosystem characterized by a dense community of trees Hundreds of definitions of forest are used throughout the world incorporating factors such as tree density tree height land use legal standing and ecological function The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization FAO defines a forest as Land spanning more than hectares with trees higher than meters and a canopy cover of more than percent or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban use Using this definition Global Forest Resources Assessment FRA found that forests covered billion hectares billion acres million square kilometres million square miles or approximately percent of the world s land area in br Forests are the largest terrestrial ecosystems of Earth by area and are found around the globe percent of forest land is in the tropical latitudes The next largest share of forests are found in subarctic climates followed by temperate and subtropical zones br Forests account for of the gross primary production of the Earth s biosphere and contain of the Earth s plant biomass Net primary production is estimated at gigatonnes of biomass per year for tropical forests for temperate forests and for boreal forests br Forests form distinctly different biomes at different latitudes and elevations and with different precipitation and evapotranspiration rates These biomes include boreal forests in subarctic climates tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests around the Equator and temperate forests at the middle latitudes Forests form in areas of the Earth with high rainfall while drier conditions produce a transition to savanna However in areas with intermediate rainfall levels forest transitions to savanna rapidly when the percentage of land that is covered by trees drops below to percent Research conducted in the Amazon rainforest shows that trees can alter rainfall rates across a region releasing water from their leaves in anticipation of seasonal rains to trigger the wet season early Because of this seasonal rainfall in the Amazon begins two to three months earlier than the climate would otherwise allow Deforestation in the Amazon and anthropogenic climate change hold the potential to interfere with this process causing the forest to pass a threshold where it transitions into savanna br Deforestation threatens many forest ecosystems Deforestation occurs when humans remove trees from a forested area by cutting or burning either to harvest timber or to make way for farming Most deforestation today occurs in tropical forests The vast majority of this deforestation is because of the production of four commodities wood beef soy and palm oil Over the past years the area of land covered by forest in Europe has been reduced from to Large areas of forest have also been cleared in China and in the eastern United States in which only of land was left undisturbed Almost half of Earth s forest area percent is relatively intact while percent is found in fragments with little or no connectivity Tropical rainforests and boreal coniferous forests are the least fragmented whereas subtropical dry forests and temperate oceanic forests are among the most fragmented Roughly percent of the world s forest area is found in patches larger than million hectares million acres The remaining percent is located in more than million patches around the world the vast majority less than hectares acres in size br Human society and forests can affect one another positively or negatively Forests provide ecosystem services to humans and serve as tourist attractions Forests can also affect people s health Human activities including unsustainable use of forest resources can negatively affect forest ecosystems br br Although the word forest is commonly used there is no universally recognised precise definition with more than definitions of forest used around the world Although a forest is usually defined by the presence of trees under many definitions an area completely lacking trees may still be considered a forest if it grew trees in the past will grow trees in the future or was legally designated as a forest regardless of vegetation type br There are three broad categories of definitions of forest in use administrative land use and land cover Administrative definitions are legal designations and may not reflect the type of vegetation that grows upon the land an area can be legally designated forest even if no trees grow on it Land use definitions are based on the primary purpose the land is used for Under a land use definition any area used primarily for harvesting timber including areas that have been cleared by harvesting disease fire or for the construction of roads and infrastructure are still defined as forests even if they contain no trees Land cover definitions define forests based upon the density of trees area of tree canopy cover or area of the land occupied by the cross section of tree trunks basal area meeting a particular threshold This type of definition depends upon the presence of trees sufficient to meet the threshold or at least of immature trees that are expected to meet the threshold once they mature br Under land cover definitions there is considerable variation on where the cutoff points are between a forest woodland and savanna Under some definitions to be considered a forest requires very high levels of tree canopy cover from to which excludes woodlands and savannas which have a lower canopy cover Other definitions consider savannas to be a type of forest and include all areas with tree canopies over br Some areas covered with trees are legally defined as agricultural areas for example Norway spruce plantations under Austrian forest law when the trees are being grown as Christmas trees and are below a certain height br br The word forest derives from the Old French forest also for s denoting forest vast expanse covered by trees forest was first introduced into English as the word denoting wild land set aside for hunting without necessarily having trees on the land Possibly a borrowing probably via Frankish or Old High German of the Medieval Latin foresta denoting open wood Carolingian scribes first used foresta in the capitularies of Charlemagne specifically to denote the royal hunting grounds of the king The word was not endemic to the Romance languages e g native words for forest in the Romance languages derived from the Latin silva which denoted forest and wood land cf the English sylva and sylvan the Italian Spanish and Portuguese selva the Romanian silv the Old French selve Cognates of forest in Romance languages e g the Italian foresta Spanish and Portuguese floresta etc are all ultimately derivations of the French word br br The precise origin of Medieval Latin foresta is obscure Some authorities claim the word derives from the Late Latin phrase forestam silvam denoting the outer wood others claim the word is a latinisation of the Frankish forhist denoting forest wooded country and was assimilated to forestam silvam pursuant to the common practice of Frankish scribes The Old High German forst denoting forest Middle Low German vorst denoting forest Old English fyrh denoting forest woodland game preserve hunting ground English frith and Old Norse f ri denoting coniferous forest all of which derive from the Proto Germanic furh sa furh ija denoting a fir wood coniferous forest from the Proto Indo European perkwu denoting a coniferous or mountain forest wooded height all attest to the Frankish forhist br Uses of forest in English to denote any uninhabited and unenclosed area are presently considered archaic The Norman rulers of England introduced the word as a legal term as seen in Latin texts such as Magna Carta to denote uncultivated land that was legally designated for hunting by feudal nobility see Royal Forest br These hunting forests did not necessarily contain any trees Because that often included significant areas of woodland forest eventually came to connote woodland in general regardless of tree density By the beginning of the fourteenth century English texts used the word in all three of its senses common legal and archaic Other English words used to denote an area with a high density of trees are firth frith holt weald wold wood and woodland Unlike forest these are all derived from Old English and were not borrowed from another language Some present classifications reserve woodland for denoting a locale with more open space between trees and distinguish kinds of woodlands as open forests and closed forests premised on their crown covers Finally sylva plural sylvae or less classically sylvas is a peculiar English spelling of the Latin silva denoting a woodland and has precedent in English including its plural forms While its use as a synonym of forest and as a Latinate word denoting a woodland may be admitted in a specific technical sense it is restricted to denoting the species of trees that comprise the woodlands of a region as in its sense in the subject of silviculture The resorting to sylva in English indicates more precisely the denotation that the use of forest intends br br The first known forests on Earth arose in the Middle Devonian approximately million years ago with the evolution of cladoxylopsid plants like Calamophyton Appeared in the Late Devonian Archaeopteris was both tree like and fern like plant growing to metres ft in height or more It quickly spread throughout the world from the equator to subpolar latitudes It is the first species known to cast shade due to its fronds and by forming soil from its roots Archaeopteris was deciduous dropping its fronds onto the forest floor the shade soil and forest duff from the dropped fronds creating the early forest The shed organic matter altered the freshwater environment slowing its flow and providing food This promoted freshwater fish br br Forests account for of the gross primary productivity of the Earth s biosphere and contain of the Earth s plant biomass Biomass per unit area is high compared to other vegetation communities Much of this biomass occurs below ground in the root systems and as partially decomposed plant detritus The woody component of a forest contains lignin which is relatively slow to decompose compared with other organic materials such as cellulose or carbohydrate The world s forests contain about gigatonnes of living biomass above and below ground and gigatonnes of dead wood The total biomass has decreased slightly since but biomass per unit area has increased br Forest ecosystems broadly differ based on climate latitudes north and south of the equator are mostly covered in tropical rainforest and the latitudes between N and N have boreal forest As a general rule forests dominated by angiosperms broadleaf forests are more species rich than those dominated by gymnosperms conifer montane or needleleaf forests although exceptions exist The trees that form the principal structural and defining component of a forest may be of a great variety of species as in tropical rainforests and temperate deciduous forests or relatively few species over large areas e g taiga and arid montane coniferous forests The biodiversity of forests also encompasses shrubs herbaceous plants mosses ferns lichens fungi and a variety of animals br Trees rising up to meters ft in height add a vertical dimension to the area of land that can support plant and animal species opening up numerous ecological niches for arboreal animal species epiphytes and various species that thrive under the regulated microclimate created under the canopy Forests have intricate three dimensional structures that increase in complexity with lower levels of disturbance and greater variety of tree species br The biodiversity of forests varies considerably according to factors such as forest type geography climate and soils in addition to human use Most forest habitats in temperate regions support relatively few animal and plant species and species that tend to have large geographical distributions while the montane forests of Africa South America Southeast Asia and lowland forests of Australia coastal Brazil the Caribbean islands Central America and insular Southeast Asia have many species with small geographical distributions Areas with dense human populations and intense agricultural land use such as Europe parts of Bangladesh China India and North America are less intact in terms of their biodiversity Northern Africa southern Australia coastal Brazil Madagascar and South Africa are also identified as areas with striking losses in biodiversity intactness br br A forest consists of many components that can be broadly divided into two categories biotic living and abiotic non living The living parts include trees shrubs vines grasses and other herbaceous non woody plants mosses algae fungi insects mammals birds reptiles amphibians and microorganisms living on the plants and animals and in the soil connected by mycorrhizal networks br br The main layers of all forest types are the forest floor the understory and the canopy The emergent layer above the canopy exists in tropical rainforests Each layer has a different set of plants and animals depending upon the availability of sunlight moisture and food br br The Forest floor is covered in dead plant material such as fallen leaves and decomposing logs which detritivores break down into new soil The layer of decaying leaves that covers the soil is necessary for many insects to overwinter and for amphibians birds and other animals to shelter and forage for food Leaf litter also keeps the soil moist stops erosion and protects roots against extreme heat and cold The fungal mycelium that helps form the mycorrhizal network transmits nutrients from decaying material to trees and other plants The forest floor supports a variety of plants ferns grasses and tree seedlings as well as animals such as ants amphibians spiders and millipedes br Understory is made up of bushes shrubs and young trees that are adapted to living in the shade of the canopy br Canopy is formed by the mass of intertwined branches twigs and leaves of mature trees The crowns of the dominant trees receive most of the sunlight This is the most productive part of the trees where maximum food is produced The canopy forms a shady protective umbrella over the rest of the forest br Emergent layer exists in a tropical rain forest and is composed of a few scattered trees that tower over the canopy br In botany and countries like Germany and Poland a different classification of forest vegetation is often used tree shrub herb and moss layers see stratification vegetation br br Forests are classified differently and to different degrees of specificity One such classification is in terms of the biomes in which they exist combined with leaf longevity of the dominant species whether they are evergreen or deciduous Another distinction is whether the forests are composed predominantly of broadleaf trees coniferous needle leaved trees or mixed br br Boreal forests occupy the subarctic zone and are generally evergreen and coniferous br Temperate zones support both broadleaf deciduous forests e g temperate deciduous forest and evergreen coniferous forests e g temperate coniferous forests and temperate rainforests Warm temperate zones support broadleaf evergreen forests including laurel forests br Tropical and subtropical forests include tropical and subtropical moist forests tropical and subtropical dry forests and tropical and subtropical coniferous forests br Forests are classified according to physiognomy based on their overall physical structure or developmental stage e g old growth vs second growth br Forests can also be classified more specifically based on the climate and the dominant tree species present resulting in numerous different forest types e g Ponderosa pine Douglas fir forest br The number of trees in the world according to a estimate is trillion of which trillion are in the tropics or sub tropics trillion in the temperate zones and trillion in the coniferous boreal forests The estimate is about eight times higher than previous estimates and is based on tree densities measured on over plots It remains subject to a wide margin of error not least because the samples are mainly from Europe and North America br Forests can also be classified according to the amount of human alteration Old growth forest contains mainly natural patterns of biodiversity in established seral patterns and they contain mainly species native to the region and habitat In contrast secondary forest is forest regrowing following timber harvest and may contain species originally from other regions or habitats br Different global forest classification systems have been proposed but none has gained universal acceptance UNEP WCMC s forest category classification system is a simplification of other more complex systems e g UNESCO s forest and woodland subformations This system divides the world s forests into major types which reflect climatic zones as well as the principal types of trees These major types can be reclassified into broader categories temperate needleleaf temperate broadleaf and mixed tropical moist tropical dry sparse trees and parkland and forest plantations Each category is described in a separate section below br br Temperate needleleaf forests mostly occupy the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere as well as some warm temperate areas especially on nutrient poor or otherwise unfavourable soils These forests are composed entirely or nearly so of coniferous species Coniferophyta In the Northern Hemisphere pines Pinus spruces Picea larches Larix firs Abies Douglas firs Pseudotsuga and hemlocks Tsuga make up the canopy but other taxa are also important In the Southern Hemisphere most coniferous trees members of Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae occur mixed with broadleaf species and are classed as broadleaf and mixed forests br br Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests include a substantial component of trees of the Anthophyta group They are generally characteristic of the warmer temperate latitudes but extend to cool temperate ones particularly in the southern hemisphere They include such forest types as the mixed deciduous forests of the United States and their counterparts in China and Japan the broadleaf evergreen rainforests of Japan Chile and Tasmania the sclerophyllous forests of Australia central Chile the Mediterranean and California and the southern beech Nothofagus forests of Chile and New Zealand br br There are many different types of tropical moist forests with lowland evergreen broad leaf tropical rainforests for example v rzea and igap forests and the terra firme forests of the Amazon Basin the peat swamp forests dipterocarp forests of Southeast Asia and the high forests of the Congo Basin Seasonal tropical forests perhaps the best description for the colloquial term jungle typically range from the rainforest zone degrees north or south of the equator to the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn Forests located on mountains are also included in this category divided largely into upper and lower montane formations on the basis of the variation of physiognomy corresponding to changes in altitude br br Tropical dry forests are characteristic of areas in the tropics affected by seasonal drought The seasonality of rainfall is usually reflected in the deciduousness of the forest canopy with most trees being leafless for several months of the year Under some conditions such as less fertile soils or less predictable drought regimes the proportion of evergreen species increases and the forests are characterised as sclerophyllous Thorn forest a dense forest of low stature with a high frequency of thorny or spiny species is found where drought is prolonged and especially where grazing animals are plentiful On very poor soils and especially where fire or herbivory are recurrent phenomena savannas develop br br Sparse trees and savanna are forests with sparse tree canopy cover They occur principally in areas of transition from forested to non forested landscapes The two major zones in which these ecosystems occur are in the boreal region and in the seasonally dry tropics At high latitudes north of the main zone of boreal forestland growing conditions are not adequate to maintain a continuously closed forest cover so tree cover is both sparse and discontinuous This vegetation is variously called open taiga open lichen woodland and forest tundra A savanna is a mixed woodland grassland ecosystem characterized by the trees being sufficiently widely spaced so that the canopy does not close The open canopy allows sufficient light to reach the ground to support an unbroken herbaceous layer that consists primarily of grasses Savannas maintain an open canopy despite a high tree density br br Forest plantations are generally intended for the production of timber and pulpwood Commonly mono specific planted with even spacing between the trees and intensively managed these forests are generally important as habitat for native biodiversity Some are managed in ways that enhance their biodiversity protection functions and can provide ecosystem services such as nutrient capital maintenance watershed and soil structure protection and carbon storage br br The annual net loss of forest area has decreased since but the world is not on track to meet the target of the United Nations Strategic Plan for Forests to increase forest area by percent by br br While deforestation is taking place in some areas new forests are being established through natural expansion or deliberate efforts in other areas As a result the net loss of forest area is less than the rate of deforestation and it too is decreasing from million hectares million acres per year in the s to million hectares million acres per year during In absolute terms the global forest area decreased by million hectares million acres square kilometres square miles between and which is an area about the size of Libya br br Forests provide a diversity of ecosystem services including br br Converting carbon dioxide into oxygen and biomass A full grown tree produces about kilograms lb of net oxygen per year br Acting as a carbon sink Therefore they are necessary to mitigate climate change br Aiding in regulating climate For example research from shows that forests induce rainfall If the forest is cut it can lead to drought and in the tropics to occupational heat stress of outdoor workers br Purifying water br Mitigating natural hazards such as floods br Serving as a genetic reserve br Serving as a source of lumber and as recreational areas br Serving as a source of woodlands and trees for millions of people dependent almost entirely on forests for subsistence for their essential fuelwood food and fodder needs br The main ecosystem services can be summarized in the next table br br Some researchers state that forests do not only provide benefits but can in certain cases also incur costs to humans Forests may impose an economic burden diminish the enjoyment of natural areas reduce the food producing capacity of grazing land and cultivated land reduce biodiversity reduce available water for humans and wildlife harbour dangerous or destructive wildlife and act as reservoirs of human and livestock disease br An important consideration regarding carbon sequestration is that forests can turn from a carbon sink to a carbon source if plant diversity density or forest area decreases as has been observed in different tropical forests The typical tropical forest may become a carbon source by the s An assessment of European forests found early signs of carbon sink saturation after decades of increasing strength The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC concluded that a combination of measures aimed at increasing forest carbon stocks andsustainable timber offtake will generate the largest carbon sequestration benefit br br The term forest dependent people is used to describe any of a wide variety of livelihoods that are dependent on access to forests products harvested from forests or ecosystem services provided by forests including those of Indigenous peoples dependent on forests In India approximately percent of the population belongs to forest dependent communities which live in close proximity to forests and practice agroforestry as a principal part of their livelihood People of Ghana who rely on timber and bushmeat harvested from forests and Indigenous peoples of the Amazon rainforest are also examples of forest dependent people Though forest dependence by more common definitions is statistically associated with poverty and rural livelihoods elements of forest dependence exist in communities with a wide range of characteristics Generally richer households derive more cash value from forest resources whereas among poorer households forest resources are more important for home consumption and increase community resilience br br Forests are fundamental to the culture and livelihood of indigenous people groups that live in and depend on forests many of which have been removed from and denied access to the lands on which they lived as part of global colonialism Indigenous lands contain or more of intact forest worldwide host more biodiversity and experience less deforestation Indigenous activists have argued that degradation of forests and indigenous peoples marginalization and land dispossession are interconnected Other concerns among indigenous peoples include lack of Indigenous involvement in forest management and loss of knowledge related for the forest ecosystem Since the amount of land that is legally owned by or designated for indigenous peoples has broadly increased but land acquisition in lower income countries by multinational corporations often with little or no consultation of indigenous peoples has also increased Research in the Amazon rainforest suggests that indigenous methods of agroforestry form reservoirs of biodiversity In the U S state of Wisconsin forests managed by indigenous people have more plant diversity fewer invasive species higher tree regeneration rates and higher volume of trees br br Forest management has changed considerably over the last few centuries with rapid changes from the s onward culminating in a practice now referred to as sustainable forest management Forest ecologists concentrate on forest patterns and processes usually with the aim of elucidating cause and effect relationships Foresters who practice sustainable forest management focus on the integration of ecological social and economic values often in consultation with local communities and other stakeholders br br Humans have generally decreased the amount of forest worldwide Anthropogenic factors that can affect forests include logging urban sprawl human caused forest fires acid rain invasive species and the slash and burn practices of swidden agriculture or shifting cultivation The loss and re growth of forests lead to a distinction between two broad types of forest primary or old growth forest and secondary forest There are also many natural factors that can cause changes in forests over time including forest fires insects diseases weather competition between species etc In the World Resources Institute recorded that only of the world s original forests remained in large intact tracts of undisturbed forest More than of these intact forests lie in three countries the boreal forests of Russia and Canada and the rainforest of Brazil br According to Food and Agriculture Organization s FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment an estimated million hectares billion acres of forest have been lost worldwide through deforestation since but the rate of forest loss has declined substantially In the most recent five year period the annual rate of deforestation was estimated at million hectares million acres down from million hectares million acres annually in br br The transition of a region from forest loss to net gain in forested land is referred to as the forest transition This change occurs through a few main pathways including increase in commercial tree plantations adoption of agroforestry techniques by small farmers or spontaneous regeneration when former agricultural land is abandoned It can be motivated by the economic benefits of forests the ecosystem services forests provide or cultural changes where people increasingly appreciate forests for their spiritual aesthetic or otherwise intrinsic value According to the Special Report on Global Warming of C of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to avoid temperature rise by more than degrees above pre industrial levels there will need to be an increase in global forest cover equal to the land area of Canada million square kilometres million square miles by br China instituted a ban on logging beginning in due to the erosion and flooding that it caused In addition ambitious tree planting programmes in countries such as China India the United States and Vietnam combined with natural expansion of forests in some regions have added more than million hectares million acres of new forests annually As a result the net loss of forest area was reduced to million hectares million acres per year between and down from million hectares million acres annually in the s In a study for Nature Climate Change showed that the trend has recently been reversed leading to an overall gain in global biomass and forests This gain is due especially to reforestation in China and Russia New forests are not equivalent to old growth forests in terms of species diversity resilience and carbon capture On September the FAO released a new study stating that over the last years the global deforestation rate has decreased by due to improved management of forests and greater government protection br br There is an estimated million hectares billion acres of forest in protected areas worldwide Of the six major world regions South America has the highest share of forests in protected areas at percent The area of such areas globally has increased by million hectares million acres since but the rate of annual increase slowed in br Smaller areas of woodland in cities may be managed as urban forestry sometimes within public parks These are often created for human benefits Attention Restoration Theory argues that spending time in nature reduces stress and improves health while forest schools and kindergartens help young people to develop social as well as scientific skills in forests These typically need to be close to where the children live br br Canada has about million square kilometres million square miles of forest land More than of forest land is publicly owned and about of the total forest area is allocated for harvesting These allocated areas are managed using the principles of sustainable forest management which include extensive consultation with local stakeholders About eight percent of Canada s forest is legally protected from resource development Much more forest land about percent of the total forest land base is subject to varying degrees of protection through processes such as integrated land use planning or defined management areas such as certified forests br By December over million square kilometres square miles of forest land in Canada about half the global total had been certified as being sustainably managed Clearcutting first used in the latter half of the th century is less expensive but devastating to the environment and companies are required by law to ensure that harvested areas are adequately regenerated Most Canadian provinces have regulations limiting the size of new clear cuts although some older ones grew to square kilometres sq mi over several years br The Canadian Forest Service is the government department which looks after Forests in Canada br br Latvia has about million hectares million acres square miles of forest land which equates to about of Latvia s total area of square kilometres sq mi million hectares million acres of forest land of total forest land is publicly owned and million hectares million acres of forest land of the total is in private hands Latvia s forests have been steadily increasing over the years which is in contrast to many other nations mostly due to the forestation of land not used for agriculture In there were only million hectares million acres of forest today this has increased by more than Birch is the most common tree at followed by pine spruce grey alder aspen black alder oak ash with other hardwood trees making up the rest br br In the United States most forests have historically been affected by humans to some degree though in recent years improved forestry practices have helped regulate or moderate large scale impacts The United States Forest Service estimated a net loss of about million hectares million acres between and this estimate includes conversion of forest land to other uses including urban and suburban development as well as afforestation and natural reversion of abandoned crop and pasture land to forest In many areas of the United States the area of forest is stable or increasing particularly in many northern states The opposite problem from flooding has plagued national forests with loggers complaining that a lack of thinning and proper forest management has resulted in large forest fires br br This article incorporates text from a free content work Licensed under CC BY SA license statement permission Text taken from
