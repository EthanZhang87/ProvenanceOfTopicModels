The Alaska moose Alces alces gigas or Alaskan moose in Alaska or giant moose and Yukon moose in Canada is a subspecies of moose that ranges from Alaska to western Yukon The Alaska moose is the largest subspecies of moose Alaska moose inhabit boreal forests and mixed deciduous forests throughout most of Alaska and most of Western Yukon Like all moose subspecies the Alaska moose is usually solitary but sometimes will form small herds Typically they only come into contact with other moose for mating or competition for mates Males and females select different home ranges during different seasons This leads to spatial segregation throughout much of the year While males and females are spatially separate the habitat that they occupy is not significantly different During mating season in autumn and winter male Alaska moose become very aggressive and prone to attacking when startled br br br Diet br br Alaska moose have a similar diet to other moose subspecies consisting of terrestrial vegetation forbs and shoots from trees such as willow and birch Moose have no problem feeding on willows in this way as the nutritional value of willow twigs does not differ between original growth and regrowth after browse Moose follow the same general migration routes every year often browsing on the same trees Alaska moose require a daily intake of kilocalories kg Alaska moose lack upper front teeth but have eight sharp incisors on their lower jaw They also have a tough tongue gums and lips to help chew woody vegetation br br br Size and weight br Alaska moose are sexually dimorphic with males being heavier than females Male Alaska moose can stand over m ft at the shoulder and weigh over kg lb When Alaska moose are born they weigh on average about pounds but by five months old they can weigh up to pounds The antlers on average have a span of m ft Antler size and conformation are influenced by genetics nutrition and age The antlers establish social rank and affect mating success Female Alaska moose stand on average m ft at the shoulder and can weigh close to kg lb The largest Alaska moose was shot in western Yukon in September it weighed kg lb and was m ft tall at the shoulder While the Alaska moose and the Asian Chukotka moose match the extinct Irish elk in size they are smaller than Cervalces latifrons the largest deer of all time br br br Habitat br Alaska moose are almost omnipresent in Alaska They range from Southeast Alaska to the Arctic slope in Northern Alaska and are most likely to be found in the Northern forests Alaskan moose are known as a Taiga species The habitat in which they can be found is correlated with how much winter forage is exposed above the snow in winter Since the late s the shrub to snowpack height ratio in Tundra regions surrounding boreal forests has increased by nearly one meter This has opened more areas for moose to inhabit In this time the Alaskan moose has seen an expansion of extending their range farther north While in the last century this species has extended its range they are still more densely concentrated along the major rivers in Alaska such as the Stikine or Yukon river They can also be found near areas that have recently experienced wildfires since that land generates dense willow birch and aspen shrubs Many moose move during mating and calving seasons and for winter This can take them up to miles away from their normal habitats br br br Social structure and reproduction br br Alaska moose have no social bonds with each other and only come into contact with each other to mate or for two bull moose to fight over mating rights Although a bull moose is not usually aggressive towards humans during mating season it may attack any creature it comes into contact with including humans wolves other deer or even bears Bull moose can get their antlers locked during a fight and if so both moose can die from severe injuries or starvation br However unlike deer fighting bull moose rarely lock horns as their antlers are palmated Bull moose call out a subtle mating call to attract female moose and to warn other males If a male moose loses to another male he has to wait another year to mate Alaska moose mate every year during autumn and winter and usually produce one or two offspring at a time At around months yearling Alaska moose leave their mothers and fend for themselves br br br Hunting br Alaska moose are hunted for food and sport every year during fall and winter People use both firearms and bows to hunt moose It is estimated that at least moose are harvested annually mostly by residents who eat the moose meat They are also hunted by animal predators wolves black bears and brown bears all hunt moose br br br br br br Further reading br br Van Ballenberghe Victor August Giants of the Wilderness Alaskan Moose National Geographic Vol no pp ISSN OCLC
