negative feedback for this decision with complaints centering on the recent quality problems with Chinese production of other consumer products China s human rights record exporting of jobs and China s less than friendly political relationship with the United States The customer backlash surprised Cessna and resulted in a company public relations campaign In early the company attracted further

Federal Aviation Administration FAA proposed a US million fine against the company for its failure to follow quality assurance requirements while producing fiberglass components at its plant in

of a ft m section of one Cessna s wing skin from the spar while the aircraft was being flown by an FAA test pilot The aircraft was landed safely The FAA also discovered other aircraft parts that had been incorrectly made and not detected by the company s quality assurance The investigation resulted in an emergency Airworthiness Directive that affected Cessna s br Since March Cessna has been pursuing building business jets in China as part of a joint venture with Aviation Industry Corporation of China AVIC The company stated that it intends to eventually build all aircraft models in China

marketing terms in an effort to differentiate its product line from their competitors br Other manufacturers and the aviation press widely ridiculed and spoofed many of the marketing terms but Cessna built and sold more aircraft than any other manufacturer during the boom years of the s and s br Generally the names of Cessna models do not follow a theme but there is usually logic to the numbering the series are the light singles the s are the heftier the s are light to medium twins the s have wide oval cabin class accommodation and the s are jets Many Cessna models have names starting with C for the sake of alliteration e g Citation Crusader Chancellor br br Cessna marketing terminology includes br br Para Lift Flaps Large Fowler flaps Cessna introduced on the B in replacing the narrow chord plain flaps then in use br Land O Matic In Cessna introduced sprung steel tricycle landing gear on the The marketing department chose Land O Matic to imply that these aircraft were much easier to land and take off than the preceding conventional landing gear equipped Cessna They even went as far as to say pilots could do drive up take offs and drive in landings implying that flying these aircraft was as easy as driving a car In later years some Cessna models had their steel sprung landing gear replaced with steel tube gear legs The retains the original spring steel landing gear today br br Omni Vision The rear windows on some Cessna singles starting with the and in and followed by the and in and respectively The term was intended to make the pilot feel visibility was improved on the notably poor visibility Cessna line The introduction of the rear window caused in most models a loss of cruise speed due to the extra drag while not adding any useful visibility br Cushioned Power The rubber mounts on the cowling of the model in addition to the rubber mounts isolating the engine from the cabin br Omni Flash The flashing beacon on the tip of the fin that could be seen all around br Open View This referred to the removal of the top section of the control wheel in models These had been rectangular they now became ram s horn shaped thus not blocking the instrument panel as much br Quick Scan Cessna introduced a new instrument panel layout in the s and this buzzword was to indicate Cessna s panels were ahead of the competition br Nav O Matic The name of the Cessna autopilot system which implied the system was relatively simple br Camber Lift A marketing name used to describe Cessna aircraft wings starting in when the aerodynamics designers at Cessna added a slightly drooped leading edge to the standard NACA airfoil used on most of the light aircraft fleet Writer Joe Christy described the name as stupid and added Is there any other kind of lift br Stabila Tip Cessna started commonly using wingtip fuel tanks carefully shaped for aerodynamic effect rather than being tubular shaped Tip tanks do have an advantage of reducing free surface effect of fuel affecting the balance of the aircraft in rolling maneuvers br br In October Textron Aviation was producing the following Cessna branded models br br Cessna Skyhawk high wing single piston engined four
