The Chelydridae is a family of turtles that has seven extinct and two extant genera The extant genera are the snapping turtles Chelydra and Macrochelys Both are endemic to the Western Hemisphere The extinct genera are Acherontemys Chelydrops Chelydropsis Emarginachelys Macrocephalochelys Planiplastron and Protochelydra br br br Fossil history br br The Chelydridae have a long fossil history with extinct species reported from North America as well as all over Asia and Europe far outside their present range The earliest described chelydrid is Emarginachelys cretacea known from well preserved fossils from the Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous of Montana Another well preserved fossil chelydrid is the Late Paleocene Protochelydra zangerli from North Dakota The carapace of P zangerli is higher domed than that of the recent Chelydra a trait conjectured to be associated with the coexistence of large turtle eating crocodilians Another genus Chelydropsis contains several well known Eurasian chelydrid species that existed from the Oligocene to the Pliocene In South America chelydrids C acutirostris only occupy the northwestern corner of the continent reflecting their recent arrival from Central America as part of the Great American Interchange br br br Gallery br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br See also br Reptiles portal br br br br br br Further reading br de Broin F Contribution a l etude des cheloniens Cheloniens continentaux du Cretace Superieur et du Tertiaire de France Memoires du Mus um National d Histoire Naturelle Vol C No XXVIII br Ericson B R A new chelydrid turtle Protochelydra zangerli from the late Paleocene of North Dakota Scientific Publications of the Science Museum of Minnesota New Series br Gaffney E S Phylogeny of the chelydrid turtles a study of shared derived characters in the skull Fieldiana Geology br Parham J F C R Feldman and J R Boore The complete mitochondrial genome of the enigmatic bigheaded turtle Platysternon description of unusual genomic features and the reconciliation of phylogenetic hypotheses based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA BMC Evol Biol Published online February doi br Whetstone K N A new genus of cryptodiran turtles Testudinoidea Chelydridae from the Upper Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation of Montana The University of Kansas Science Bulletin br br br External links br Media related to Chelydridae at Wikimedia Commons br Data related to Chelydridae at Wikispecies
