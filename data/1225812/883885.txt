OCLC Inc doing business as OCLC is an American nonprofit cooperative organization that provides shared technology services original research and community programs for its membership and the library community at large It was founded in as the Ohio College Library Center then became the Online Computer Library Center as it expanded In the name was formally changed to OCLC Inc OCLC and thousands of its member libraries cooperatively produce and maintain WorldCat the largest online public access catalog in the world OCLC is funded mainly by the fees that libraries pay around million annually in total as of for the many different services it offers OCLC also maintains the Dewey Decimal Classification system br br OCLC began in as the Ohio College Library Center through a collaboration of university presidents vice presidents and library directors who wanted to create a cooperative computerized network for libraries in the state of Ohio The group first met on July on the campus of Ohio State University to sign the articles of incorporation for the nonprofit organization and hired Frederick G Kilgour a former Yale University medical school librarian as first executive director br Kilgour and Ralph H Parker who was the head of libraries at the University of Missouri had proposed the shared cataloging system in a report as consultants to the Committee of Librarians of the Ohio College Association Kilgour and Parker wished to merge the latest information storage and retrieval system of the time the computer with the oldest the library They were inspired in part by the earlier Columbia Harvard Yale Medical Libraries Computerization Project an attempt at shared automated printing of catalog cards The plan was to merge the catalogs of Ohio libraries electronically through a computer network and database to streamline operations control costs and increase efficiency in library management bringing libraries together cooperatively to best serve researchers and scholars The first library to do online cataloging through OCLC was the Alden Library at Ohio University on August This was the first online cataloging by any library worldwide br Between and OCLC membership was limited to institutions in Ohio but in a new governance structure was established that allowed institutions from other states to join In the governance structure was again modified to accommodate participation from outside the United States br As OCLC expanded services in the United States outside Ohio it relied on establishing strategic partnerships with networks organizations that provided training support and marketing services By there were independent United States regional service providers OCLC networks played a key role in OCLC governance with networks electing delegates to serve on the OCLC Members Council During OCLC commissioned two studies to look at distribution channels at the same time the council approved governance changes that had been recommended by the Board of Trustees severing the tie between the networks and governance In early OCLC negotiated new contracts with the former networks and opened a centralized support center br In July the company was sued by SkyRiver a rival startup in an antitrust suit Library automation company Innovative Interfaces joined SkyRiver in the suit The suit was dropped in March however following the acquisition of SkyRiver by Innovative Interfaces br Innovative Interfaces was bought by ExLibris in therefore passing OCLC as the dominant supplier of ILS services in the US over market share for academic libraries and over for public libraries for ExLibris versus OCLC s market share of both types of libraries in br In membership and governance expanded to include any institution with a subscription to one of many qualifying OCLC products previously institutions qualified for membership by contributing intellectual content or participating in global resource or reference sharing with the exception of for profit organizations that are part of OCLC s partner program This change reflected OCLC s expanding number of services due to its corporate acquisitions br br The following people

library and information research Such projects have included communities such as the Society of American Archivists the Open Archives Initiative the Institute for Museum and Library Services the International Organization for Standardization the National Information Standards Organization the World Wide Web Consortium the Internet Engineering Task Force and Internet One of the most successful contributions to this effort was the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative an open forum of libraries archives museums technology organizations and software companies who work together to develop interoperable online metadata standards that support a broad range of purposes and business models br OCLC has collaborated with the Wikimedia Foundation and the Wikimedia volunteer community through integrating library metadata with Wikimedia projects hosting a Wikipedian in residence and doing a national training program through WebJunction called Wikipedia Libraries Better Together br br OCLC s WorldCat database is used by the general public and by librarians for cataloging and research WorldCat is available to the public for searching via a subscription web based service called FirstSearch to which many libraries subscribe as well as through the publicly available WorldCat org br br OCLC assigns a unique control number referred to as an OCN for OCLC Control Number to each new bibliographic record in WorldCat Numbers are assigned serially and in mid over a billion OCNs had been created In September the OCLC declared these numbers to be in the public domain removing a perceived barrier to widespread use of OCNs outside OCLC itself The control numbers link WorldCat s records to local library system records by providing a common reference key for a record across libraries br OCNs are particularly useful as identifiers for books and other bibliographic materials that do not have ISBNs e g books published before OCNs are often used as identifiers for Wikipedia and Wikidata In October it was reported that out of instances of book infoboxes in Wikipedia there were ISBNs and OCNs and regarding Wikidata of around million Wikidata items were books Wikidata items have an ISBN associated with them and have OCNs br OCLC also runs the Virtual International Authority File VIAF an international name authority file with oversight from the VIAF Council composed of

br In January OCLC acquired Sustainable Collection Services SCS SCS offered consulting services based on analyzing library print collection data to help libraries manage and share materials In OCLC acquired Relais International a library interlibrary loan service provider based in Ottawa Canada br A more complete list of mergers and acquisitions is available on the OCLC website br br In May OCLC was criticized by Jeffrey Beall for monopolistic practices among other faults Library blogger Rick Mason responded that although he thought Beall had some valid criticisms of OCLC he demurred from some of Beall s statements and warned readers to beware the hyperbole and the personal nature of his criticism for they strongly overshadow that which is worth stating br In November the Board of Directors of OCLC unilaterally issued a new Policy for Use and Transfer of WorldCat Records that would have required member libraries to include an OCLC policy note on their bibliographic records the policy caused an uproar among librarian bloggers Among those who protested the policy was the non librarian activist Aaron Swartz who believed the policy would threaten projects such as the Open Library Zotero and Wikipedia and who started a petition to Stop the OCLC powergrab Swartz s petition garnered signatures but the details of his proposed actions went largely unheeded Within a few months the library community had forced OCLC to retract its policy and to create a Review Board to consult with member libraries more transparently In August OCLC recommended that member libraries adopt the Open Data Commons Attribution ODC BY license when sharing library catalog data although some member libraries have explicit agreements with OCLC that they can publish catalog data using the
