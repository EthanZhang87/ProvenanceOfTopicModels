The ArmaLite AR Explorer is a semi automatic firearm in Long Rifle caliber developed in from the AR that was adopted by the U S Air Force as a pilot and aircrew survival weapon The AR was adopted and modified by the Israeli Air Force as an aircrew survival weapon in the s br The AR was designed by American firearms designer Eugene Stoner who is most associated with the development of the ArmaLite AR rifle that was adopted by the US military as the M The civilian AR s intended markets today are backpackers and other recreational users as a takedown utility rifle The AR is intended for users of recreational vehicles automobile airplane or boat who might have need for a weapon for foraging or defense in a wilderness emergency br br br History and design br The prototype of what would become the AR was designed by Eugene Stoner at ArmaLite Inc a division of Fairchild Aircraft The rifle shares some of the features of the bolt action AR another takedown rifle designed by Stoner for ArmaLite and adopted by the United States Air Force in as the MA The MA was intended to replace the M Survival Rifle and the M Aircrew Survival Weapon which was a superposed over under twin barrel rifle shotgun chambered in Hornet and bore using a break open action The AR had the advantage of repeat fire over the then standard M using the same Hornet cartridge When the AR was adopted as the MA but was not placed in issue due to the numbers of usable M and M survival weapons in USAF inventory ArmaLite used the research and tooling for the AR in developing the AR for the civilian market br br The AR uses a blowback semi automatic action in Long Rifle but retains the AR MA feature of storing the disassembled parts within the hollow stock which is filled with plastic foam and capable of floating Like the bolt action AR the AR was designed as a survival rifle for foraging small game for food The AR is constructed primarily of aluminum with plastic for the stock buttcap and recoil spring guide The bolt is steel The original barrel was aluminum using a rifled steel liner barrels of some production models have used all steel barrels others have used barrels made of composite materials The AR measures inches cm overall when assembled It disassembles to four sections barrel action stock and magazine with three parts storing inside the plastic stock measuring inches cm long The rifle weighs pounds kg light enough for convenient backpacking The rear sight is a peep sight which comes on a flat metal blade with an aperture in later production two different size apertures available by removing and flipping the rear sight and is adjustable for elevation up down The front sight is adjustable for windage side to side Accuracy is sufficient for hunting small game at ranges to yards m br br br Performance br Reliability of the AR is highly dependent on the condition of the magazine and on the ammunition used perhaps more so than with other models of semi automatic caliber rifles The feed ramp is part of the magazine and subject to damage from mishandling Flat nosed bullets tend to jam on the edge of the chamber of the barrel The transition of cartridge from magazine to barrel can be smoothed by minor beveling of the chamber of the barrel by using round nosed as opposed to flat nosed bullets and by paying attention to condition of the feed lips and feed ramp of the magazine Later production magazines include an external wire spring to align the cartridge earlier magazines used two pinch marks at the top of the magazine body which in use could become sprung open or worn br All iterations of the AR from the ArmaLite to the Henry U S Survival rifle use a bolt and dual recoil springs that are heavy compared to most other semiautomatics The AR requires high velocity ammunition for reliable functioning The manufacturers recommend use of grain g round nose bullets in high velocity loadings It is possible to manually load a single round into the firing chamber allowing use of flat nosed bullets or low velocity or subsonic ammunition br The barrel takedown nut tends to loosen during firing and may need hand tightening to maintain both accuracy and reliability br ArmaLite sold the design to Charter Arms in According to some accounts posted by enthusiasts this is when quality began to deteriorate Barrels were said to have a tendency to warp Other sources state that the first production at Charter had problems which were corrected in later production runs br br br Production history br Summary of information available in The Blue Book of Gun

Repeating Arms Co Bayonne New Jersey br br br AR variants br br br ArmaLite AR Explorer br Original ArmaLite barrels had a steel liner in an aluminum shell The stock was a foam filled plastic shell with internal recesses for the receiver barrel and one magazine and did not accept the receiver with a magazine in place The original ArmaLite stock retained buoyancy longer than some later stocks by other makers The receiver did not provide for a scope mount The rear sight was a peep aperture adjustable for elevation The front sight was drift adjustable for windage br br br Argentine variant br The AR was also manufactured in Argentina as the Sistema de Armas LR Fire de Brenta It came with various barrel lengths shrouds and fixed rifle stocks as well as pistol grips with retractable stocks br br br Herter s Outdoor Supply br Herter s Hy Hunter and American International Distributors marketed replicas of the Broomhandle Mauser as Bolomauser Thompson submachine gun as T Civilian Defense Model and M Carbine made on AR receivers and barrels br br br Charter Arms AR Explorer br The Charter Arms AR Explorer rifle replicated the ArmaLite AR Explorer with variations in finish br br br Charter Arms Explorer II pistol br br Explorer II was a pistol version of the AR It resembled a Broomhandle Mauser The receiver had a built in pistol grip with no provision for the rifle stock the internal parts are interchangeable between rifle and pistol The rear sight of the pistol was an open notch adjustable for windage and elevation The Explorer II front sight was integral with the barrel shell and was not adjustable The magazine well in front of the trigger guard would accept any magazine designed for the rifle A spare round magazine could be carried inside the grip The most common barrel was six inches mm Optional barrel lengths included eight inches mm and ten inches mm br br br Legal note br br Because the U S NFA regulations set the minimum rifle barrel length at inches mm Charter Arms made the barrels of the Explorer I rifle and Explorer II pistol non interchangeable to prevent installing the pistol barrel on the rifle The AR barrel has an alignment lug that mates a notch in the receiver The rifle receiver notch and barrel lug are on top the pistol notch and lug are broader and on the bottom If a Charter Arms factory made pistol barrel were installed on a rifle the extractor on the bolt would be opposite the extractor slot in the barrel preventing the bolt from closing plus the front sight would be upside down Modifying the pistol barrel to fit the rifle or modifying the rifle receiver to accept the pistol barrel would be making a short barrel rifle legally requiring federal registration on an ATF Form with payment of a tax br Conversely after the Supreme Court ruling in United States v Thompson Center Arms Co modifying the pistol to accept the rifle barrel and or stock or modifying the rifle barrel or stock to fit the pistol is legal so long as you do not have the rifle stock attached at the same time as the pistol barrel It is legal as a pistol to have the rifle barrel attached with the pistol grip there is no federal maximum pistol barrel length br In the United Kingdom this rifle is a Section Firearm requiring a Firearms Certificate to buy or acquire br br br AR Industries br AR Industries made solid steel barrels much heavier than the AR barrels by ArmaLite Charter or Henry br br br Henry Survival Rifle br In the design and production rights passed on to Henry Repeating Arms and the compact rifle was slightly revised resulting in improved reliability and durability The AR is now known as the Henry U S Survival AR rifle An ABS material replaced the original stock plastic which was prone to cracking and failure The receiver recess in the Henry stock allows storage of receiver with a magazine in place and the rifle is normally sold with two magazines The latest versions of the Henry allow for storage of three magazines total with two in the stock recess and one in the receiver The modern Henry U S Survival Rifle floats on water for a while either assembled or stored although it is not entirely waterproof and will sink eventually The rifles now include a full Teflon coating on the outer surface Henry added a inch mm Dovetail rail aka Weaver Tip Off Mount rail on the top of the receiver for attaching a wide variety of optics Henry introduced a round magazine for jurisdictions that limit magazine capacity for hunting wild game br br br Israeli pilot s survival rifle br Another variant was made by ArmaLite and sold to the Israeli Military for use as pilot aircrew survival weapons replacing the mm Beretta shot handgun The Israelis further modified these rifles adding a telescoping stock a pistol grip from a FAL type rifle shortening the barrel to inches mm and adding a front sight based on the K k Mauser The shoulder stock held two magazines with a third magazine in the receiver plus forty rounds of ammunition stored inside the pistol grip After Israeli service some of these rifles were re imported into the U S by Bricklee Trading Company for sale on the civilian market The barrels are marked with the BTC identification as required by U S law on imported guns The Israeli version commands a premium among collectors In order to comply with U S Federal law on minimum rifle barrel length of a inch muzzle brake was permanently attached br br br Operation br The AR functions as a simple or plain blowback semi automatic The AR is a light firearm with heavy bolt and twin recoil springs br br br Aftermarket modifications br The fact that both the barrel and stock are detachable has led to a plethora of after market accessories similar to those available for the Ruger Barrels stocks and grips of varying finishes and utility can be added to the rifle These include collapsible stocks wire framed stocks pistol grips flash suppressors shrouded barrels high capacity magazines telescopic sights reflex red dot sights and other occasionally fanciful looking hardware some at a cost greater than the rifle itself Such accessories often make it impossible to use the original floating stock for storage of modified parts br The current Henry U S Survival AR has a scope sight rail integral with the receiver to accept standard Weaver style Tip Off rings For earlier makes B Square supplied the Charter Arms AR Explorer Scope Mount Base an accessory bracket with a rail The base attached by the receiver side plate screw the Charter Arms side plate screw is longer than that of the ArmaLite This base can be used on the ArmaLite and the Charter Arms Explorer rifles and the Charter Arms Explorer II pistol However with the base in place the rifle receiver will no longer fit the recess in the stock for storage The B Square Charter Arms AR base is not needed on the Henry version and will not fit the Henry receiver br Apart from the highly modified AR Israeli survival rifles most AR models lack provision for a carry sling AR owners have adapted slings designed for use on guns without modification such as universal shotgun slings designed to cup the shotgun buttstock at the rear and clamp to the barrel or magazine tube at the front Given the light weight of the AR pounds a proper length of parachute cord with a slip knot at either end can be used as a sling or lanyard br br br See also br List of ArmaLite rifles br Preetz Model br Marlin Model P br br br br br br External links br Henry Repeating Arms webpage for the AR U S Survival Rifle br Photos
