A berry is a small pulpy and often edible fruit Typically berries are juicy rounded brightly colored sweet sour or tart and do not have a stone or pit although many pips or seeds may be present Common examples of berries in the culinary sense are strawberries raspberries blueberries blackberries white currants blackcurrants and redcurrants In Britain soft fruit is a horticultural term for such fruits br The common usage of the term berry is different from the scientific or botanical definition of a berry which refers to a fruit produced from the ovary of a single flower where the outer layer of the ovary wall develops into an edible fleshy portion pericarp The botanical definition includes many fruits that are not commonly known or referred to as berries such as grapes tomatoes cucumbers eggplants bananas and chili peppers Fruits commonly considered berries but excluded by the botanical definition include strawberries raspberries and blackberries which are aggregate fruits and mulberries which are multiple fruits Watermelons and pumpkins are giant berries that fall into the category pepos A plant bearing berries is said to be bacciferous or baccate br Berries are eaten worldwide and often used in jams preserves cakes or pies Some berries are commercially important The berry industry varies from country to country as do types of berries cultivated or growing in the wild Some berries such as raspberries and strawberries have been bred for hundreds of years and are distinct from their wild counterparts while other berries such as lingonberries and cloudberries grow almost exclusively in the wild br While many berries are edible some are poisonous to humans such as deadly nightshade and pokeweed Others such as the white mulberry red mulberry and elderberry are poisonous when unripe but are edible when ripe br br br History br br Berries have been valuable as a food source for humans since before the start of agriculture and remain among the primary food sources of other primates They were a seasonal staple for early hunter gatherers for thousands of years and wild berry gathering remains a popular activity in Europe and North America today In time humans learned to store berries so that they could be used in the winter They may be made into fruit preserves and among Native Americans mixed with meat and fats as pemmican br Berries also began to be cultivated in Europe and other countries Some species of blackberries and raspberries of the genus Rubus have been cultivated since the th century while smooth skinned blueberries and cranberries of the genus Vaccinium have been cultivated in the United States for over a century In Japan between the th and th centuries the terms ichibigo and ichigo referred to many berry crops The most widely cultivated berry of modern times however is the strawberry which is produced globally at twice the amount of all other berry crops combined br The strawberry was mentioned by ancient Romans who thought it had medicinal properties but it was then not a staple of agriculture Woodland strawberries began to be grown in French gardens in the th century The musk strawberry F moschata also known as the hautbois strawberry began to be grown in European gardens in the late th century Later the Virginia strawberry was grown in Europe and the United States The most commonly consumed strawberry the garden strawberry F ananassa is an accidental hybrid of the Virginia strawberry and a Chilean variety Fragaria chiloensis It was first noted by a French gardener around the mid th century that when F moschata and F virginiana were planted in between rows of F chiloensis the Chilean strawberry would bear abundant and unusually large fruits Soon after Antoine Nicolas Duchesne began to study the breeding of strawberries and made several discoveries crucial to the science of plant breeding such as the sexual reproduction of strawberry Later in the early s English breeders of strawberry made varieties of F ananassa which were important in strawberry breeding in Europe and hundreds of cultivars have since been produced through the breeding of strawberries br br br Etymology br The Old English word berie berry grape comes from Proto Germanic basjom source also of Old Norse ber Middle Dutch bere German Beere berry Old Saxon winberi Gothic weinabasi grape which is of unknown origin This and apple are the only native fruit names br br br Botanical definition br br In botanical terminology a berry is a simple fruit with seeds and pulp produced from the ovary of a single flower It is fleshy throughout except for the seeds It does not have a special line of weakness along which it splits to release the seeds when ripe i e it is indehiscent A berry may develop from an ovary with one or more carpels the female reproductive structures of a flower The seeds are usually embedded in the fleshy interior of the ovary but there are some non fleshy examples such as peppers with air rather than pulp around their seeds The differences between the everyday and botanical uses of berry results in three categories those fruits that are berries under both definitions those fruits that are botanical berries but not commonly known as berries and those parts of plants commonly known as berries that are not botanical berries and may not even be fruits br Berries under both definitions include blueberries cranberries lingonberries and the fruits of many other members of the heather family as well as gooseberries goji berries and elderberries The fruits of some currants Ribes species such as blackcurrants red currants and white currants are botanical berries and are treated as horticultural berries or as soft fruit in the UK even though their most commonly used names do not include the word berry br Botanical berries not commonly known as berries include bananas tomatoes grapes eggplants aubergines persimmons watermelons and pumpkins br There are several different kinds of fruits which are commonly called berries but are not botanical berries Blackberries raspberries and strawberries are kinds of aggregate fruit they contain seeds from different ovaries of a single flower In aggregate fruits like blackberries the individual fruitlets making up the fruit can be clearly seen The fruits of blackthorn may be called sloe berries but botanically are small stone fruits or drupes like plums or apricots Junipers and yews are commonly said to have berries but these differ from botanical berries and are instead highly modified seed bearing cones In juniper berries used to flavour gin the cone scales which are hard and woody in most conifers are instead soft and fleshy when ripe The bright red berries of yews consist of a fleshy outgrowth aril almost enclosing the poisonous seed br br br Cultivation br br Strawberries have been grown in gardens in Europe since the th century Blueberries were domesticated starting in with the first commercial crop in Huckleberries of all varieties are not fully domesticated but domestication was attempted from to for the economically significant western huckleberry Many other varieties of Vaccinium are likewise not domesticated with some being of commercial importance br br br Agricultural methods br Like most other food crops berries are commercially grown with both conventional pest management and integrated pest management IPM practices Organically certified berries are becoming more widely available br Many soft fruit berries require a period of temperatures between and C and F for breaking dormancy In general strawberries require hours blueberries hours blackberries hours raspberries hours currants and gooseberries hours and cranberries hours However too low a temperature will kill the crops blueberries do not tolerate temperatures below C F raspberries depending on variety may tolerate as low as C F and blackberries are injured below C F Spring frosts are however much more damaging to berry crops than low winter temperatures Sites with moderate slopes facing north or east in the northern hemisphere near large bodies of water which regulate spring temperature are considered ideal in preventing spring frost injury to the new leaves and flowers All berry crops have shallow root systems Many land grant university extension offices suggest that strawberries should not be planted more than five years on the same site due to the danger of black root rot though many other illnesses go by the same name which in the past has been controlled in major commercial production by annual methyl bromide fumigation but is largely prohibited now Besides the number of years in production soil compaction the frequency of fumigation and herbicide usages increase the appearance of black root rot in strawberries Raspberries blackberries strawberries and many other berries are susceptible to verticillium wilt Blueberries and cranberries grow poorly if the clay or silt content of the soil is more than while most other berries tolerate a wide range of soil types For most berry crops the ideal soil is well drained sandy loam with a pH of and a moderate to high organic content however blueberries have an ideal pH of and can be grown on muck soils while blueberries and cranberries prefer poorer soils with lower cation exchange lower calcium and lower levels of phosphorus br Growing most berries organically requires the use of proper crop rotation the right mix of cover crops and the cultivation of the correct beneficial microorganisms in the soil As blueberries and cranberries thrive in soils that are not hospitable to most other plants and conventional fertilizers are toxic to them the primary concern when growing them organically is bird management br Postharvest small fruit berries are generally stored at relative humidity and C F Cranberries however are frost sensitive and should be stored at C F Blueberries are the only berries that respond to ethylene but flavor does not improve after harvest so they require the same treatment as other berries Removal of ethylene may reduce disease and spoilage in all berries Precooling within one to two hours post harvest to storage temperature generally C F via forced air cooling increases the storage life of berries by about a third Under optimum storage conditions raspberries and blackberries last for two to five days strawberries days blueberries two to four weeks and cranberries two to four months Berries can be shipped under high carbon dioxide or modified atmosphere of carbon dioxide for high carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide and oxygen for a modified atmosphere container to increase shelf life and prevent grey mold rot br br br Breeding br Several discoveries in the science of breeding berries were made in the th century by Antoine Nicolas Duchesne in his work on strawberries In the traditional technique of plant breeding berries with specific desirable characteristics were chosen and allowed to sexually reproduce with other berries and offspring with improved traits could then be selected and used for further crossing Plants may be hybridized with different species within the same genus hybridization between different genus may also be possible but more difficult Breeding may seek to increase the size and yield of the fruit improve the flavor and quality of its nutrient content such as antioxidants expand the harvest season and produce cultivars with resistance to diseases tolerance of hot or cold conditions and other desirable traits Advancements in molecular biology and genetic engineering allow for a more efficient and better targeted approach in the selection for a desirable genotype via marker assisted selection for example Genetic modification techniques can also be used for breeding berries br br br Horticultural soft fruit berries br Some fruit not commonly referred to as berries and not always botanically berries are included by land grant university extension offices in their guides for berry cultivation or in guides for identifying local wild edible and non edible berries Examples include beach plums American persimmons pawpaws Pacific crabapples and prickly pears br br br Commercial production br In the year there were million acres square kilometres of land worldwide cultivating berries with million short tons megatonnes produced br br br Economics br br In certain regions berrypicking can be a large part of the economy and it is becoming increasingly common for western European countries such as Sweden and Finland to import cheap labor from Thailand or Bulgaria to do the berry picking This practice has come under scrutiny in the past years because of the low wages and poor living standard for the berry pickers as well as the lack of worker safety br In the late s in the US reduced migration from Mexico and increased minimum wage standards have made finding stoop work labourers to pick the strawberry crop difficult and costly br br br Phytochemicals and color br Once ripened berries have a contrasting color to their background often of green leaves making them visible and attractive to frugivorous animals and birds This assists the wide dispersal of the plants seeds br Berry colors are due to natural phytochemicals including plant pigments such as anthocyanins together with other flavonoids localized mainly in berry skins seeds and leaves Although berry pigments have antioxidant properties in vitro there is no physiological evidence established to date that berry pigments have actual antioxidant or any other functions within the human body Consequently it is not permitted to claim that foods containing polyphenols have antioxidant health value on product labels in the United States or Europe br br br Culinary significance br br br Use in baked goods br br Berries are commonly used in pies or tarts such as blueberry pie blackberry pie and strawberry pie br Berries are often used in baking such as blueberry muffins blackberry muffins berry cobblers berry crisps berry cakes berry buckles berry crumb cakes berry tea cakes and berry cookies Berries are commonly incorporated whole into the batter for baking and care is often taken so as to not burst the berries Frozen or dried berries may be preferable for some baked berry products Fresh berries are also often incorporated into baked berry desserts sometimes with cream either as a filling to the dessert or as a topping br br br Beverages br Berries are often added to water and or juiced as in cranberry juice which accounts for of cranberry crop usage blueberry juice raspberry juice goji berry juice acai juice aronia berry juice and strawberry juice Wine is the principal fermented beverage made from berries grapes Fruit wines are commonly made out of other berries In most cases sugars must be added to the berry juices in the process of Chaptalization to increase the alcohol content of the wine Examples of fruit wines made from berries include elderberry wine strawberry wine blueberry wine blackberry wine redcurrant wine huckleberry wine goji wine and cranberry wine Berries are used in some styles of beer particularly framboise made with raspberry and other fruit lambics br br br Dried br br Currants raisins and sultanas are examples of dried grape berries and many other commercially important berries are available in dried form br br br Fruit preserves br br Berries are perishable fruits with a short shelf life and are often preserved by drying freezing pickling or making fruit preserves Berries such as blackberry blueberry boysenberry lingonberry loganberry raspberry and strawberry are often used in jams and jellies In the United States Native Americans were the first to make preserves from blueberries br br br Other usages br Chefs have created quick pickled soft fruit such as blackberries strawberries and blueberries Strawberries can be battered and quickly fried in a deep fryer Sauces made from berries such as cranberry sauce can be frozen until hard battered and deep fried Cranberry sauce is a traditional food item for Thanksgiving and similar sauces can be made from many other berries such as blueberries raspberries blackberries and huckleberries br br br In culture br br br Dye br Berries have been used in some cultures for dyeing Many berries contain juices that can easily stain affording use as a natural dye For example blackberries are useful for making dyes especially when ripe berries can easily release juice to produce a colorfast effect Rubus berries such as blackberry raspberry black raspberry dewberry loganberry and thimbleberry all produce dye colors These were once used by Native Americans In Hawaii the native raspberry called akala was used to dye tapa cloth with lavender and pink hues whereas berries from the dianella lily were used for blue coloration and berries from the black nightshade were used to produce green coloration br br br
