The American black bear Ursus americanus also known as the black bear is a species of medium sized bear endemic to North America It is the continent s smallest and most widely distributed bear species It is an omnivore with a diet varying greatly depending on season and location It typically lives in largely forested areas but will leave forests in search of food and is sometimes attracted to human communities due to the immediate availability of food br The International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN lists the American black bear as a least concern species because of its widespread distribution and a large population estimated to be twice that of all other bear species combined Along with the brown bear Ursus arctos it is one of only two modern bear species not considered by the IUCN to be globally threatened with extinction br br br Taxonomy and evolution br Despite living in North America American black bears are not closely related to brown bears or polar bears genetic studies reveal that they split from a common ancestor million years ago mya American and Asian black bears are considered sister taxa and are more closely related to each other than to the other modern species of bears According to recent studies the sun bear is also a relatively recent split from this lineage br A small primitive bear called Ursus abstrusus is the oldest known North American fossil member of the genus Ursus dated to mya This suggests that U abstrusus may be the direct ancestor of the American black bear which evolved in North America Although Wolverton and Lyman still consider U vitabilis an apparent precursor to modern black bears it has also been placed within U americanus br The ancestors of American black bears and Asian black bears diverged from sun bears mya The American black bear then split from the Asian black bear mya The earliest American black bear fossils which were located in Port Kennedy Pennsylvania greatly resemble the Asian species though later specimens grew to sizes comparable to grizzly bears From the Holocene to the present American black bears seem to have shrunk in size but this has been disputed because of problems with dating these fossil specimens br The American black bear lived during the same period as the giant and lesser short faced bears Arctodus simus and A pristinus respectively and the Florida spectacled bear Tremarctos floridanus These tremarctine bears evolved from bears that had emigrated from Asia to the Americas mya The giant and lesser short faced bears are thought to have been heavily carnivorous and the Florida spectacled bear more herbivorous while the American black bears remained arboreal omnivores like their Asian ancestors br The American black bear s generalist behavior allowed it to exploit a wider variety of foods and has been given as a reason why of these three genera it alone survived climate and vegetative changes through the last Ice Age while the other more specialized North American predators became extinct However both Arctodus and Tremarctos had survived several other previous ice ages After these prehistoric ursids became extinct during the last glacial period years ago American black bears were probably the only bear present in much of North America until the migration of brown bears to the rest of the continent br br br Hybrids br American black bears are reproductively compatible with several other bear species and occasionally produce hybrid offspring According to Jack Hanna s Monkeys on the Interstate a bear captured in Sanford Florida was thought to have been the offspring of an escaped female Asian black bear and a male American black bear In an American black bear and a Eurasian brown bear were bred together in the London Zoological Gardens but the three cubs that were born died before they reached maturity In The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication Charles Darwin noted br br In the nine year Report it is stated that the bears had been seen in the zoological gardens to couple freely but previously to most had rarely conceived In the reports published since this date three species have produced young hybrids in one case br A bear shot in autumn in Michigan was thought by some to be an American black bear grizzly bear hybrid because of its unusually large size and its proportionately larger brain case and skull DNA testing was unable to determine whether it was a large American black bear or a grizzly bear br br br Subspecies br Sixteen subspecies are traditionally recognized however a recent genetic study does not support designating some of these such as the Florida black bear as distinct subspecies Listed alphabetically according to subspecific name br br br Distribution and population br br Historically American black bears occupied the majority of North America s forested regions Today they are primarily limited to sparsely settled forested areas American black bears currently inhabit much of their original Canadian range though they seldom occur in the southern farmlands of Alberta Saskatchewan and Manitoba they have been extirpated on Prince Edward Island since Surveys taken in the mid s found the Canadian black bear population to be between and in seven provinces this estimate excludes populations in New Brunswick the Northwest Territories Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan All provinces indicated stable populations of American black bears over the last decade br The current range in the United States is constant throughout most of the Northeast and within the Appalachian Mountains almost continuously from Maine to northern Georgia the northern Midwest the Rocky Mountain region the West Coast and Alaska However it becomes increasingly fragmented or absent in other regions Despite this American black bears in those areas seem to have expanded their range in recent decades such as with recent sightings in Ohio Illinois southern Indiana and western Nebraska Sightings of itinerant black bears in the Driftless Area of southeastern Minnesota northeastern Iowa and southwestern Wisconsin are common In biologists with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources confirmed documentation of an American black bear living year round in woodlands near the town of Decorah in northeastern Iowa believed to be the first instance of a resident black bear in Iowa since the s br Surveys taken from states in the early s indicated that American black bear populations were either stable or increasing except in Idaho and New Mexico The population in the United States was estimated to range between and in though this excludes populations from Alaska Idaho South Dakota Texas and Wyoming whose populations were not recorded in the survey In California there were an estimated black bears in making it the largest population of the species in any of the contiguous United States In there were about bears in Great Smoky Mountains National Park where the population density is about two per square mile In western North Carolina the black bear population has dramatically increased in recent decades from about in the early s to over in the s br As of known black bear populations in Mexico existed in four areas though knowledge on the distribution of populations outside those areas has not been updated since Mexico is the only country where the species is classified as endangered br br br Habitat br Throughout their range habitats preferred by American black bears have a few shared characteristics They are often found in areas with relatively inaccessible terrain thick understory vegetation and large quantities of edible material especially masts The adaptation to woodlands and thick vegetation in this species may have originally been because the bear evolved alongside larger more aggressive bear species such as the extinct giant short faced bear and the grizzly bear that monopolized more open habitats and the historic presence of larger predators such as Smilodon and the American lion that could have preyed on black bears Although found in the largest numbers in wild undisturbed areas and rural regions American black bears can adapt to surviving in some numbers in peri urban regions as long as they contain easily accessible foods and some vegetative coverage br In most of the contiguous United States American black bears today are usually found in heavily vegetated mountainous areas from to m to ft in elevation For American black bears living in the American Southwest and Mexico habitat usually consists of stands of chaparral and pinyon juniper woods In this region bears occasionally move to more open areas to feed on prickly pear cactus At least two distinct prime habitat types are inhabited in the Southeastern United States American black bears in the southern Appalachian Mountains survive in predominantly oak hickory and mixed mesophytic forests In the coastal areas of the southeast such as Florida the Carolinas and Louisiana bears inhabit a mixture of flatwoods bays and swampy hardwood sites br In the northeastern part of the range the United States and Canada prime habitat consists of a forest canopy of hardwoods such as beech maple birch and coniferous species Corn crops and oak hickory mast are also common sources of food in some sections of the northeast small thick swampy areas provide excellent refuge cover largely in stands of white cedar Along the Pacific coast redwood Sitka spruce and hemlocks predominate as overstory cover Within these northern forest types are early successional areas important for American black bears such as fields of brush wet and dry meadows high tidelands riparian areas and a variety of mast producing hardwood species The spruce fir forest dominates much of the range of the American black bear in the Rockies Important non forested areas here are wet meadows riparian areas avalanche chutes roadsides burns sidehill parks and subalpine ridgetops br In areas where human development is relatively low such as stretches of Canada and Alaska American black bears tend to be found more regularly in lowland regions In parts of northeastern Canada especially Labrador American black bears have adapted exclusively to semi open areas that are more typical habitat in North America for brown bears likely due to the absence there of brown and polar bears as well as other large carnivore species br br br Description br br br Build br br The skulls of American black bears are broad with narrow muzzles and large jaw hinges In Virginia the length of adult bear skulls was found to average to mm to in Across its range the greatest skull length for the species has been reportedly measured from to cm to in Females tend to have slenderer and more pointed faces than males br Their claws are typically black or grayish brown The claws are short and rounded being thick at the base and tapering to a point Claws from both hind and front legs are almost identical in length though the foreclaws tend to be more sharply curved The paws of the species are relatively large with a rear foot length of to cm to in which is proportionately larger than other medium sized bear species but much smaller than the paws of large adult brown and especially polar bears The soles of the feet are black or brownish and are naked leathery and deeply wrinkled br The hind legs are relatively longer than those of Asian black bears The typically small tail is cm in long The ears are small and rounded and are set well back on the head br American black bears are highly dexterous being capable of opening screw top jars and manipulating door latches They also have great physical strength a bear weighing pounds kg was observed turning flat rocks weighing to pounds to kg by flipping them over with a single foreleg They move in a rhythmic sure footed way and can run at speeds of to miles per hour to km h American black bears have good eyesight and have been proven experimentally to be able to learn visual color discrimination tasks faster than chimpanzees and just as fast as domestic dogs They are also capable of rapidly learning to distinguish different shapes such as small triangles circles and squares br br br Size br br Adults typically range from to cm to in in head and body length and to cm to in in shoulder height Although they are the smallest bear species in North America large males exceed the size of other bear species except the brown bear and the polar bear br Weight tends to vary according to age sex health and season Seasonal variation in weight is very pronounced in autumn their pre den weight tends to be higher than in spring when black bears emerge from their dens Bears on the East Coast tend to be heavier on average than those on the West Coast although they typically follow Bergmann s rule and bears from the northwest are often slightly heavier than the bears from the southeast Adult males typically weigh between kg lb while females weigh less at kg lb br In California studies indicate that the average mass is kg lb in adult males and kg lb in adult females Adults in Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge in east central Alaska were found to average kg lb in males and kg lb in females whereas on Kuiu Island in southeastern Alaska where nutritious salmon are readily available adults averaged kg lb In Great Smoky Mountains National Park adult males averaged kg lb and adult females averaged kg lb per one study br In one of the largest studies on regional body mass bears in British Columbia averaged kg lb in females and kg lb in males In Yellowstone National Park a study found that adult males averaged kg lb and adult females averaged kg lb Black bears in north central Minnesota averaged kg lb in females and kg lb in males In New York the males average kg lb and females kg lb It was found in Nevada and the Lake Tahoe region that bears closer to urban regions were significantly heavier than their arid country dwelling counterparts with males near urban areas averaging kg lb against wild land males which averaged kg lb whereas peri urban females averaged kg lb against the average of kg lb in wild land ones In Waterton Lakes National Park Alberta adults averaged to kg to lb br The biggest wild American black bear ever recorded was a male from New Brunswick shot in November that weighed kg lb after it had been dressed meaning it weighed an estimated kg lb in life and measured m ft in long Another notably outsized wild American black bear weighing in at kg lb was the cattle killer shot in December on the Moqui Reservation in Arizona The record sized American black bear from New Jersey was shot in Morris County December and scaled kg lb The Pennsylvania state record weighed kg lb and was shot in November in Pike County The North American Bear Center located in Ely Minnesota is home to the world s largest captive male and female American black bears Ted the male weighed kg lb in the fall of Honey the female weighed kg lb in the fall of br br br Pelage br br The fur is soft with dense underfur and long coarse thick guard hairs The fur is not as shaggy or coarse as that of brown bears American black bear skins can be distinguished from those of Asian black bears by the lack of a white blaze on the chest and hairier footpads br Despite their name black bears show a great deal of color variation Individual coat colors can range from white blonde cinnamon light brown or dark chocolate brown to jet black with many intermediate variations existing Silvery gray American black bears with a blue luster this is found mostly on the flanks occur along a portion of coastal Alaska and British Columbia White to cream colored American black bears occur in the coastal islands and the adjacent mainland of southwestern British Columbia Albino individuals have also been recorded Black coats tend to predominate in humid areas such as Maine New England New York Tennessee Michigan and western Washington Approximately of all American black bears are black though only in the Rocky Mountains are black Many in northwestern North America are cinnamon blonde or light brown in color and thus may sometimes be mistaken for grizzly bears Grizzly and other types of brown bears can be distinguished by their shoulder hump larger size and broader more concave skull br In his book The Great Bear Almanac Gary Brown summarized the predominance of black or brown blonde specimens by location br br br Behavior and life history br br American black bears have eyesight and hearing comparable to that of humans Their keenest sense is smell which is about seven times more sensitive than a domestic dog s They are excellent and strong swimmers swimming for pleasure and to feed largely on fish They regularly climb trees to feed escape enemies and hibernate Four of the eight modern bear species are habitually arboreal the most arboreal species the American and Asian black bears and the sun bear being fairly closely related Their arboreal abilities tend to decline with age They may be active at any time of the day or night although they mainly forage by night Bears living near human habitations tend to be more extensively nocturnal while those living near brown bears tend to be more often diurnal br American black bears tend to be territorial and non gregarious in nature However at abundant food sources e g spawning salmon or garbage dumps they may congregate and dominance hierarchies form with the largest most powerful males dominating the most fruitful feeding spots They mark their territories by rubbing their bodies against trees and clawing at the bark Annual ranges held by mature male bears tend to be very large though there is some variation On Long Island off the coast of Washington ranges average sq mi km whereas on the Ungava Peninsula in Canada ranges can average up to sq mi km with some male bears traveling as far as sq mi km at times of food shortages br Bears may communicate with various vocal and non vocal sounds Tongue clicking and grunting are the most common sounds and are made in cordial situations to conspecifics offspring and occasionally humans When at ease they produce a loud rumbling hum During times of fear or nervousness bears may moan huff or blow air Warning sounds include jaw clicking and lip popping In aggressive interactions black bears produce guttural pulsing calls that may sound like growling Cubs squeal bawl or scream when anxious and make a motor like humming sound when comfortable or nursing American black bears often mark trees using their teeth and claws as a form of communication with other bears a behavior common to many species of bears br br br Reproduction and development br Sows usually produce their first litter at the age of to years with those living in more developed areas tending to get pregnant at younger ages The breeding period usually occurs in the June July period though it can extend to August in the species northern range The breeding period lasts for two to three months Both sexes are promiscuous Males try to mate with several females but large dominant ones may violently claim a female if another mature male comes near Copulation can last minutes Sows tend to be short tempered with their mates after copulating br The fertilized eggs undergo delayed development and do not implant in the female s womb until November The gestation period lasts days and litters are usually born in late January to early February Litter size is between one and six cubs typically two or three At birth cubs weigh g lb and measure cm in in length They are born with fine gray down like hair and their hind quarters are underdeveloped They typically open their eyes after days and begin walking after weeks Cubs are dependent on their mother s milk for weeks and will reach independence at months At weeks they attain g lb by weeks they reach kg lb and by months they weigh to kg to lb They reach sexual maturity at years and attain their full growth at years br br br Longevity and mortality br br The average lifespan in the wild is years though it is quite possible for wild individuals to survive for more than years The record age of a wild individual was years while that in captivity was years The average annual survival rate is variable ranging from in Florida to in Virginia and North Carolina In Minnesota of wintering adult bears were able to survive the hibernation cycle in one study Remarkably a study of American black bears in Nevada found that the amount of annual mortality of a population of bears in wilderness areas was whereas in developed areas in the state this figure rose to Survival in subadults is generally less assured In Alaska only of subadult males and of subadult females were found in a study to survive to adulthood Across the range the estimated number of cubs who survive past their first year is br With the exception of the rare confrontation with an adult brown bear or a gray wolf pack adult black bears are not usually subject to natural predation However as evidenced by scats with fur inside of them and the recently discovered carcass of an adult sow with puncture marks in the skull black bears may occasionally fall prey to jaguars in the southern parts of their range In such scenarios the big cat would have the advantage if it ambushed the bear killing it with a crushing bite to the back of the skull Cubs tend to be more vulnerable to predation than adults with known predators including bobcats coyotes cougars gray wolves brown bears and other bears of their own species Many of these will stealthily snatch small cubs right from under the sleeping mother There is record of a golden eagle snatching a yearling cub Once out of hibernation mother bears may be able to fight off most potential predators Even cougars will be displaced by an angry mother bear if they are discovered stalking the cubs Flooding of dens after birth may also occasionally kill newborn cubs However in current times bear fatalities are mainly attributable to human activities Seasonally thousands of black bears are hunted legally across North America to control their numbers while some are illegally poached or trapped unregulated Auto collisions also may claim many black bears annually br br br Hibernation br br American black bears were once not considered true or deep hibernators but because of discoveries about the metabolic changes that allow black bears to remain dormant for months without eating drinking urinating or defecating most biologists have redefined mammalian hibernation as specialized seasonal reduction in metabolism concurrent with scarce food and cold weather American black bears are now considered highly efficient hibernators The physiology of American black bears in the wild is closely related to that of bears in captivity Understanding the physiology of bears in the wild is vital to the bear s success in captivity br The bears enter their dens in October and November although in the southernmost areas of their range i e Florida Mexico the southeastern United States only pregnant females and mothers with yearling cubs will enter hibernation Prior to that time they can put on up to kg lb of body fat to get them through the several months during which they fast Hibernation typically lasts months depending on regional climate br Hibernating bears spend their time in hollowed out dens in tree cavities under logs or rocks in banks caves or culverts and in shallow depressions Although naturally made dens are occasionally used most dens are dug out by the bear During their time in hibernation an American black bear s heart rate drops from to beats per minute to beats per minute and the metabolic rate can drop to a quarter of the bear s nonhibernating basal metabolic rate These reductions in metabolic rate and heart rate do not appear to decrease the bear s ability to heal injuries during hibernation Their circadian rhythm stays intact during hibernation This allows the bear to sense the changes in the day based on the ambient temperature caused by the sun s position in the sky It has also been shown that ambient light exposure and low disturbance levels that is to say wild bears in ambient light conditions directly correlate with their activity levels The bear keeping track of the changing days allows it to awaken from hibernation at the appropriate time of year to conserve as much energy as possible br The hibernating bear does not display the same rate of muscle and bone atrophy relative to other nonhibernatory animals that are subject to long periods of inactivity due to ailment or old age A hibernating bear only loses approximately half the muscular strength compared to that of a well nourished inactive human The bear s bone mass does not change in geometry or mineral composition during hibernation which implies that the bear s conservation of bone mass during hibernation is caused by a biological mechanism During hibernation American black bears retain all excretory waste leading to the development of a hardened mass of fecal material in the colon known as a fecal plug Leptin is released into the bear s systems to suppress appetite The retention of waste during hibernation specifically in minerals such as calcium may play a role in the bear s resistance to atrophy br The body temperature does not drop significantly like other mammalian hibernators staying around C F and they remain somewhat alert and active If the winter is mild enough they may wake up and forage for food Females also give birth in February and nurture their cubs until the snow melts During winter American black bears consume of their body weight The footpads peel off while they sleep making room for new tissue br Many of the physiological changes an American black bear exhibits during hibernation are retained slightly post hibernation Upon exiting hibernation bears retain a reduced heart rate and basal metabolic rate The metabolic rate of a hibernating bear will remain at a reduced level for up to days after hibernation After emerging from their winter dens in spring they wander their home ranges for two weeks so that their metabolism accustoms itself to the activity In mountainous areas they seek southerly slopes at lower elevations for forage and move to northerly and easterly slopes at higher elevations as summer progresses br The time that American black bears emerge from hibernation varies Factors affecting this include temperature flooding and hunger In southern areas they may wake up in midwinter Further north they may not be seen until late March April or even early May Altitude also has an effect Bears at lower altitudes tend to emerge earlier Mature males tend to come out earliest followed by immature males and females and lastly mothers with cubs Mothers with yearling cubs are seen before those with newborns br br br Dietary habits br br Generally American black bears are largely crepuscular in foraging activity though they may actively feed at any time Up to of their diet consists of vegetation though they tend to dig less than brown bears eating far fewer roots bulbs corms and tubers than the latter species When initially emerging from hibernation they will seek to feed on carrion from winter killed animals and newborn ungulates As the spring temperature warms American black bears seek new shoots of many plant species especially new grasses wetland plants and forbs Young shoots and buds from trees and shrubs during the spring period are important to bears emerging from hibernation as they assist in rebuilding muscle and strengthening the skeleton and are often the only digestible foods available at that time During summer the diet largely comprises fruits especially berries and soft masts such as buds and drupes br During the autumn hyperphagia feeding becomes virtually the full time task Hard masts become the most important part of the diet in autumn and may even partially dictate the species distribution Favored masts such as hazelnuts oak acorns and whitebark pine nuts may be consumed by the hundreds each day by a single bear during the fall During the fall period bears may also habitually raid the nut caches of tree squirrels Also extremely important in fall are berries such as huckleberries and buffalo berries Bears living in areas near human settlements or around a considerable influx of recreational human activity often come to rely on foods inadvertently provided by humans especially during summertime These include refuse birdseed agricultural products and honey from apiaries br The majority of the diet consists of insects such as bees yellow jackets ants beetles and their larvae American black bears are also fond of honey and will gnaw through trees if hives are too deeply set into the trunks for them to reach it with their paws Once the hive is breached the bears will scrape the honeycombs together with their paws and eat them regardless of stings from the bees Bears that live in northern coastal regions especially the Pacific Coast will fish for salmon during the night as their black fur is easily spotted by salmon in the daytime Other bears such as the white furred Kermode bears of the islands of western Canada have a greater success rate in catching salmon than their black furred counterparts Other fish including suckers trout and catfish are readily caught whenever possible Although American black bears do not often engage in active predation of other large animals for much of the year the species will regularly prey on mule and white tailed deer fawns in spring given the opportunity Bears may catch the scent of hiding fawns when foraging for something else and then sniff them out and pounce on them As the fawns reach days of age they can outmaneuver the bears and their scent is soon ignored until the next year American black bears have also been recorded similarly preying on elk calves in Idaho and moose calves in Alaska br Predation on adult deer is rare but it has been recorded They may even hunt prey up to the size of adult female moose which are considerably larger than themselves by ambushing them There is at least one record of a male American black bear killing two bull elk over the course of six days by chasing them into deep snow banks which impeded their movements In Labrador American black bears are exceptionally carnivorous living largely off caribou usually young injured old sickly or dead specimens and rodents such as voles This is believed to be due to a paucity of edible plant life in this sub Arctic region and a local lack of competing large carnivores including other bear species Like brown bears American black bears try to use surprise to ambush their prey and target the weak injured sickly or dying animals in the herds Once a deer fawn is captured it is frequently torn apart alive while feeding If it is able to capture a mother deer in spring the bear frequently begins feeding on the udder of lactating females but generally prefers meat from the viscera Bears often drag their prey to cover preferring to feed in seclusion The skin of large prey is stripped back and turned inside out with the skeleton usually left largely intact Unlike gray wolves and coyotes Bears rarely scatter the remains of their kills Vegetation around the carcass is usually matted down and their droppings are frequently found nearby Bears may attempt to cover remains of larger carcasses though they do not do so with the same frequency as cougars and grizzly bears They will readily consume eggs and nestlings of various birds and can easily access many tree nests even the huge nests of bald eagles Bears have been reported stealing deer and other game from human hunters br br br Interspecific predatory relationships br Over much of their range American black bears are assured scavengers that can intimidate using their large size and considerable strength and if necessary dominate other predators in confrontations over carcasses However on occasions where they encounter Kodiak or grizzly bears the larger two brown subspecies dominate them American black bears tend to escape competition from brown bears by being more active in the daytime and living in more densely forested areas Violent interactions resulting in the deaths of American black bears have been recorded in Yellowstone National Park br American black bears do occasionally compete with cougars over carcasses Like brown bears they will sometimes steal kills from cougars One study found that both bear species visited of cougar kills in Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks usurping of the carcasses Another study found that American black bears visited of cougar kills in summer in Colorado and of kills in California As a result the cats spend more time killing and less time feeding on each kill br American black bear interactions with gray wolves are much rarer than with brown bears due to differences in habitat preferences The majority of American black bear encounters with wolves occur in the species northern range with no interactions being recorded in Mexico Despite the American black bear being more powerful on a one to one basis packs of wolves have been recorded to kill black bears on numerous occasions without eating them Unlike brown bears American black bears frequently lose against wolves in disputes over kills Wolf packs typically kill American black bears when the larger animals are in their hibernation cycle br There is at least one record of an American black bear killing a wolverine Gulo gulo in a dispute over food in Yellowstone National Park Anecdotal cases of alligator predation on American black bears have been reported though such cases may involve assaults on cubs At least one jaguar Panthera onca has been recorded to have attacked and eaten a black bear El Jefe the jaguar famous for being the first jaguar seen in the United States in over a century br br br Relationships with humans br br br In folklore mythology and culture br br br Indigenous br Black bears feature prominently in the stories of some of North America s indigenous peoples One tale tells of how the black bear was a creation of the Great Spirit while the grizzly bear was created by the Evil Spirit In the mythology of the Haida Tlingit and Tsimshian people of the northwest coast mankind first learned to respect bears when a girl married the son of a black bear chieftain In Kwakwa ka wakw mythology black and brown bears became enemies when Grizzly Bear Woman killed Black Bear Woman for being lazy Black Bear Woman s children in turn killed Grizzly Bear Woman s children The Navajo believed that the Big Black Bear was chief among the bears of the four directions surrounding Sun s house and would pray to it in order to be granted its protection during raids br Sleeping Bear Dunes in Michigan is named after a Native American legend where a female bear and her two cubs swam across Lake Michigan to escape a fire on the Wisconsin shore The mother bear reached the shore and waited for her cubs but they did not make it across Two islands mark where the cubs drowned while the dune marks the spot where the mother bear waited br br br Anglo American br Morris Michtom the creator of the teddy bear was inspired to make the toy when he came across a cartoon of Theodore Roosevelt refusing to shoot a black bear cub tied to a tree The fictional character Winnie the Pooh was named after Winnipeg a female cub that lived at the London Zoo from until her death in A cub who in the spring of was caught in the Capitan Gap Fire was made into the living representative of Smokey Bear the mascot of the United States Forest Service br Terrible Ted was a de toothed and de clawed bear who was forced to perform as a pro wrestler and whose career lasted from the s to the s The American black bear is the mascot of the University of Maine and Baylor University where the university houses two live bears on campus br br br Attacks on humans br br Although an adult bear is quite capable of killing a human American black bears typically avoid confronting humans Unlike grizzly bears which became a subject of fearsome legend among the European settlers of North America black bears were rarely considered overly dangerous even though they lived in areas where the pioneers had settled br American black bears rarely attack when confronted by humans and usually only make mock charges emit blowing noises and swat the ground with their forepaws The number of attacks on humans is higher than those by brown bears in North America but this is largely because black bears considerably outnumber brown bears Compared to brown bear attacks aggressive encounters with black bears rarely lead to serious injury Most attacks tend to be motivated by hunger rather than territoriality and thus victims have a higher probability of surviving by fighting back rather than submitting Unlike female brown bears female American black bears are not as protective of their cubs and rarely attack humans in the vicinity of the cubs However occasionally such attacks do occur The worst recorded attack occurred in May in which a bear killed three teenagers fishing in Algonquin Park in Ontario Another exceptional attack occurred in August in Liard River Hot Springs Provincial Park in British Columbia when an emaciated bear attacked a mother and child killing the mother and a man who intervened The bear was shot while mauling a fourth victim br The majority of attacks happened in national parks usually near campgrounds where the bears had habituated to close human proximity and food Of incidents of aggressive acts toward humans recorded from to in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park resulted in injury and occurred mainly in tourist hot spots where people regularly fed the bears handouts In almost every case where open garbage dumps that attracted bears were closed and handouts ceased the number of aggressive encounters dropped However in the Liard River Hot Springs case the bear was apparently dependent on a local garbage dump that had closed and so was starving to death Attempts to relocate bears are typically unsuccessful as the bears seem able to return to their home range even without familiar landscape cues br br br Livestock and crop predation br A limitation of food sources in early spring and wild berry and nut crop failures in summer may contribute to bears regularly feeding from human based food sources These bears often eat crops especially during autumn hyperphagia when natural foods are scarce Favored crops include apples oats and corn American black bears can do extensive damage in areas of the northwestern United States by stripping the bark from trees and feeding on the cambium Livestock depredations occur mostly in spring br Although they occasionally hunt adult cattle and horses they seem to prefer smaller prey such as sheep goats pigs and young calves They usually kill by biting the neck and shoulders though they may break the neck or back of the prey with blows with the paws Evidence of a bear attack includes claw marks and is often found on the neck back and shoulders of larger animals Surplus killing of sheep and goats is common American black bears have been known to frighten livestock herds over cliffs causing injuries and death to many animals whether this is intentional is not known Occasionally bears kill pets especially domestic dogs which are most prone to harass a bear It is not recommended to use unleashed dogs to deter bear attacks Although large aggressive dogs can sometimes cause a bear to run if pressed angry bears often turn the tables and end up chasing the dogs in return A bear in pursuit of a pet dog can threaten both canid and human lives br br br Hunting br br The hunting of American black bears has taken place since the initial settlement of the Americas The first piece of evidence dates to a Clovis site at Lehner Ranch Arizona Partially calcined teeth of a month old black bear cub came from a roasting pit suggesting the bear cub was eaten The surrounding charcoal was dated to the Early Holocene BP Black bear remains also appear to be associated with early peoples in Tlapacoya Mexico Native Americans increasingly utilized black bears during the Holocene particularly in the late Holocene upper Midwest e g Hopewell and Mississippian cultures br Some Native American tribes in admiration for the American black bear s intelligence would decorate the heads of bears they killed with trinkets and place them on blankets Tobacco smoke would be wafted into the disembodied head s nostrils by the hunter that dealt the killing blow who would compliment the animal for its courage The Kutchin typically hunted American black bears during their hibernation cycle Unlike the hunting of hibernating grizzly bears which was fraught with danger hibernating American black bears took longer to awaken and hunting them was thus safer and easier During the European colonisation of eastern North America thousands of bears were hunted for their meat fat and fur Theodore Roosevelt wrote extensively on black bear hunting in his Hunting the Grisly and other sketches in which he stated br br in a black bear chase there is much excitement and occasionally a slight spice of danger just enough to render it attractive so it has always been eagerly followed br He wrote that black bears were difficult to hunt by stalking due to their habitat preferences though they were easy to trap Roosevelt described how in the southern states planters regularly hunted bears on horseback with hounds General Wade Hampton was known to have been present at successful bear hunts two thirds of which he killed personally He killed or bears with only a knife which he would use to stab the bears between the shoulder blades while they were distracted by his hounds Unless well trained horses were often useless in bear hunts as they often bolted when the bears stood their ground In American black bear skins were exported from Quebec In skins were exported from the Hudson s Bay Company In untanned fleshed and salted hides were sold for an average of br In Canada black bears are considered as both a big game and furbearer species in all provinces save for New Brunswick and the Northwest Territories where they are only classed as a big game species There are around licensed bear hunters in Canada Canadian black bear hunts take place in the fall and spring and both male and female bears can be legally taken though some provinces prohibit the hunting of females with cubs or yearlings br Currently of the U S states have American black bear hunting seasons Nineteen states require a bear hunting license with some also requiring a big game license In eight states only a big game license is required Overall over American black bear hunting licenses are sold per year The hunting methods and seasons vary greatly according to state with some bear hunting seasons including fall only spring and fall or year round New Jersey in November approved a six day bear hunting season in early December to slow the growth of the population Bear hunting had been banned in New Jersey for five years before that time A Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind poll found that of New Jersey voters approved of the new season if scientists concluded that bears were leaving their usual habitats and destroying private property Men
