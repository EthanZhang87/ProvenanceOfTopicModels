The ruffed grouse Bonasa umbellus is a medium sized grouse occurring in forests from the Appalachian Mountains across Canada to Alaska It is the most widely distributed game bird in North America It is non migratory It is the only species in the genus Bonasa br The ruffed grouse is sometimes incorrectly referred to as a partridge an unrelated phasianid and occasionally confused with the grey partridge a bird of open areas rather than woodlands br The ruffed grouse is the state game bird of Pennsylvania United States br br br Taxonomy br br Bonasa umbellus was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his th edition of Systema Naturae He classified it as Tetrao umbellus placing it in a subfamily with Eurasian grouse The genus Bonasa was applied by British naturalist John Francis Stephens in Ruffed grouse is the preferred common name because it applies only to this species Misleading vernacular names abound however and it is often called partridge sometimes rendered pa tridge or shortened to pat pheasant or prairie chicken all of which are properly applied to other birds Other nicknames for ruffed grouse include drummer or thunder chicken br The ruffed grouse has

and span cm in across their short strong wings They have two distinct morphs grey and brown In the grey morph the head neck and back are grey brown the breast is light with barring There is much white on the underside and flanks Overall the birds have a variegated appearance the throat is often distinctly lighter The tail is essentially the same brownish grey with regular barring and a broad black band near the end subterminal Brown morph birds have tails of the same color and pattern However the rest of the plumage is much more brown giving the appearance of a more uniform bird with less light plumage below and a conspicuously grey tail There are all sorts of intergrades between the most typical morphs warmer and more humid conditions favor browner birds in general br br The ruffs are on the sides of the neck in both sexes They also have a crest on top of their head which sometimes lies flat Both sexes are similarly marked and sized making them difficult to tell apart even in hand The female often has a broken subterminal tail band At the same time males tend to have unbroken tail bands though the opposite of either can occur Females may also do a display similar to the male Another fairly accurate sign is that rump feathers with a single white dot indicate a female rump feathers with more than one white dot indicate a male br The average life span of a ruffed grouse is one year although some birds are thought to live for as long as eleven years Ruffed grouse are polygynous and males may mate with several females during the breeding season br br br Ecology br br Like most grouse they spend most of their time on the ground mixed woodland rich in aspen seems to be particularly well liked These birds forage on the ground or in trees They are omnivores eating buds leaves berries seeds and insects According to nature writer Don L Johnson br br More than any other characteristic it is the ruffed grouse s ability to thrive on a wide range of foods that has allowed it to adapt to such a wide and varied range of habitat on this continent A complete menu of grouse fare might itself fill a book One grouse crop yielded a live salamander in a salad of watercress Another contained a small snake br br br Hunting br br Hunting of the ruffed grouse is common in the northern and far western United States as well as Canada often with shotguns Dogs may also be used Hunting of the ruffed grouse can be challenging This is because the grouse spends most of its time in thick brush aspen stands and second growth pines It is also very hard to detect a foraging grouse bobbing about in the thicket due to their camouflage With adequate snow cover they will burrow under the snow The ruffed grouse will maintain trails through the underbrush and pines like other forest creatures These can often be found by looking for the bird s feathers on the ground and twigs at the edges of its trail Hunting of the ruffed grouse requires a good ear and lots of stamina as one will be constantly walking and listening for them in the leaves br Ruffed grouse frequently seek gravel and clover along road beds during early morning and late afternoon These are good areas to walk during this time to flush birds Also grouse use sandy roadbeds to dust their feathers to rid themselves of skin pests Dusting sites are visible as areas of disturbed soils with some signs of feathers Birds will return to these spots during the late afternoon to bathe in dust and socialize and mate br br br Behavior br br The ruffed grouse differs from other grouse species in its courtship display The ruffed grouse relies entirely on a non vocal acoustic display known as drumming unlike other grouse species The drumming itself is a rapid wing beating display that creates a low frequency sound starting slow and speeding up thump thump thump thump thump thump thump Even in thick woods this can be heard for miles km or more br The ruffed grouse spends most of its time quietly on the ground and when surprised may explode into flight beating its wings very loudly They will burrow into the snow for warmth in the winter and may suddenly burst out of the snow when approached too closely br The male grouse proclaims his property by engaging in a drumming display This sound is made by beating his wings against the air to create a vacuum It usually stands on a log stone or mound of dirt when drumming It does not strike the log to make the noise it only uses the drumming log as a sort of stage br The ruffed grouse population has a cycle and follows the cycle no matter how much or how little hunting there is The cycle has puzzled scientists for years and is simply referred to as the grouse cycle In spite of this historical cycle populations have been declining in Pennsylvania and management plans adopted Habitat loss has been a concern for the species but the introduction of the West Nile virus has been seen to be further increasing mortality br br br See also br State birds
