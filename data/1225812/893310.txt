originally developed by librarians to help teenagers make the transition between children s literature and adult literature following the recognition around World War II of teenagers as a distinct group of young people While the genre is targeted at adolescents a study found that of young adult literature purchases were made by adults br br br Definitions br Author and academic Michael Cart states that the term young adult literature first found common usage in the late s in reference to realistic fiction that was set in the real as opposed to imagined contemporary world and addressed problems issues and life circumstances of interest to young readers aged approximately However The term young adult literature is inherently amorphous for its constituent terms young adult and literature are dynamic changing as culture and society which provide their context change and even those who study and teach it have not reached a consensus on a definition br Victor Malo Juvera Crag

aged to chose independently br Literature written for young people aged to and books marked as young adult by a publisher br Literature including a teenager who is the main character and as the center of the plot engages in problems related to and relatable to the lives of teenagers br Novels told by a teen protagonist speaking from an adolescent point of view with all the limitations of understanding that implies br br br History br Librarians first defined this new category of fiction in particular librarians from the New York Public Library The NYPL s first annual Books for Young People list was sent in to schools and libraries across the country Then In NYPL librarian Margaret Scoggin changed the name of her library journal column from Books for Older Boys and Girls to Books for Young Adults and the genre was christened with a name that has lasted to this day Initially the YA genre tended to feature the same boy and girl love story But in the s the novels developed to more fully examining the lives of adolescents Particularly noteworthy was S E Hinton s The Outsiders br br br Pre th century br br French historian Philippe Ari s argues in his book Centuries of Childhood that the modern concept of childhood only emerged in recent times He explains that children were in the past not considered as greatly different from adults and were not given significantly different treatment Furthermore Teenagers weren t a designated demographic in most respects until around World War II due in part to advances in psychology and sociological changes like the abolishment of child labor With this development came the marketing of clothes music films radio programs and the novel for young adults br All the same Sarah Trimmer in recognized young adults as a distinct age group describing young adulthood as lasting from ages to In her children s literature periodical The Guardian of Education Trimmer introduced the terms Books for Children for those under fourteen and Books for Young Persons for those between fourteen and twenty one establishing terms of reference for young adult literature that still remain in use br At the beginning of the eighteenth century according to M O Grenby br br very few enjoyable books for children existed Children read certainly but the books that they probably enjoyed reading or hearing most were not designed especially for them Fables were available and fairy stories lengthy chivalric romances and short affordable pamphlet tales and ballads called chapbooks but these were published for children and adults alike Take Nathaniel Crouch s Winter Evenings Entertainments It contains riddles pictures and pleasant and delightful relations of many rare and notable accidents and occurrences which has suggested to some that it should be thought of as an early children s book However its title page insists that it is excellently accommodated to the fancies of old or young br A number of works by eighteenth and nineteenth century authors though not written specifically for young readers have appealed to them Novels by Daniel Defoe Jonathan Swift Jane Austen Walter Scott Charles Dickens Lewis Carroll Robert Louis Stevenson Mark Twain Francis Hodgson Burnett and Edith Nesbit br Alice s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll published in and one of the best known works of Victorian literature has had widespread influence on popular culture and literature especially in the fantasy genre It is credited as helping end an era of didacticism in children s literature inaugurating an era in which writing for children aimed to delight or entertain The tale has had a lasting popularity with adults as well as with children A shortened version for young children The Nursery Alice was published in It was inspired when on July Lewis Carroll and Reverend Robinson Duckworth rowed in a boat with the three young daughters of scholar Henry Liddell Lorina aged Alice aged and Edith Mary aged During the trip Carroll told the girls a story that he described in his diary as Alice s Adventures Under Ground and which his journal says he undertook to write out for Alice She finally got the manuscript more than two years later br A number of novels by Robert Louis Stevenson were first published in serial form in a weekly children s literary magazine Young Folks including Treasure Island Kidnapped and The Black Arrow This magazine was for boys and girls of an older age than many of its contemporaries br Mark Twain s Tom Sawyer is described by publisher Simon Schuster as The classic tale of a young boy s adventures on the Mississippi in the nineteenth century The same description can be applied to its sequel Huckleberry Finn Huck is or br br br th century br According to journalist Erin Blakemore Though young adult literature had existed since at least Laura Ingalls Wilder s Little House series which was published in the s teachers and librarians were slow to accept books for adolescents as a genre br In Seventeenth Summer called by some the first young adult novel by years old Maureen Daly was published Its themes were especially relevant to teenagers underaged drinking driving dating and angst br Another early example is the Heinlein juveniles which were science fiction novels written by Robert A Heinlein for Scribner s young adult line beginning with Rocket Ship Galileo in Scribner s published eleven more between and but the thirteenth Starship Troopers was instead published by Putnam The intended market was teenaged boys A fourteenth novel Podkayne of Mars featured a teenaged girl as the protagonist br In the s The Catcher in the Rye attracted the attention of the adolescent readers although it was written for adults The themes of adolescent angst and alienation in the novel have become synonymous with young adult literature br The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings by J R R Tolkien are highly successful fantasy novels which are read to young children and read by both children and adults They are found in the teen or young adult section of American public and school libraries However Lord of the Rings is generally not on the curriculum of high schools This is because the paperback version can run to almost pages and the vocabulary is difficult br A Wrinkle in Time written by Madeleine L Engle in received over twenty six rejections before publication in because it was in L Engle s words too different and because it deals overtly with the problem of evil and it was really difficult for children and was it a children s or an adults book anyhow br In the Young Adult Library Services Association initially called the Young Adult Services Division following a reorganization of the American Library Association had been created YALSA evaluates and selects materials for young adults with the most active YASLA committee being the book selection committee br Michael Cart argues that the s was the decade when literature for adolescents could be said to have come into its own A significant early example of young adult fiction was S E Hinton s The Outsiders The novel features a truer darker side of adolescent life that was not often represented in works of fiction of the time Written during high school and written when Hinton was only The Outsiders also lacked the nostalgic tone common in books about adolescents written by adults The Outsiders remains one of the best selling young adult novels of all time In the late s and early s five other very popular books were published I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings an autobiography of the early years of American poet Maya Angelou The Friends by Rosa Guy the semi autobiographical The Bell Jar US under a pseudonym UK by poet Sylvia Plath Bless the Beasts and Children by Glendon Swarthout and Deathwatch by Robb White which was awarded Edgar Award for Best Juvenile Mystery by the Mystery Writers of America The works of Angelou and Plath were published as adult works but The Bell Jar deals with a nineteen year old s teenage angst and Angelou s autobiography is one of the ten books most frequently banned from high school and junior high school libraries and classrooms br Authors Philip Pullman and Neil Gaiman have both argued for the importance of British fantasy writer Alan Garner According to Pullman Garner is indisputably the great originator the most important British writer of fantasy since Tolkien and in many respects better than Tolkien Similarly Ursula le Guin in a review praising Garner s novel Red Shift argues that Some of the most interesting English novels of recent years have been published as children s books Although Garner s early work is often labelled children s literature Garner himself rejects such a description Critic Neil Philip commenting on Garner s early novels notes that It may be that Garner s is a case where the division between children s and adults literature is meaningless br Judy Blume author of Are You There God It s Me Margaret has significantly contributed to children s and young adult literature She was one of the first young adult authors to write novels focused on such controversial topics as masturbation menstruation teen sex birth control and death br Ursula le Guin s A Wizard of Earthsea published in had a significant influence on YA fantasy fiction It won or contributed to several notable awards for le Guin including the Boston Globe Horn Book Award in and was one of the last winners of the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award With regard to the Earthsea series Barbara Bucknal stated that Le Guin was not writing for young children when she wrote these fantasies nor yet for adults She was writing for older kids But in fact she can be read like Tolkien by ten year olds and by adults Margaret Atwood said that A Wizard of Earthsea since it dealt with themes such as life and mortality and who are we as human beings it could be read and enjoyed by anybody older than twelve Reviewers have commented that the basic premise of A Wizard of Earthsea that of a talented boy going to a wizard s school and making an enemy with whom he has a close connection is also the premise of Harry Potter br As publishers began to focus on the emerging adolescent market more booksellers and libraries began creating young adult sections distinct from children s literature and novels written for adults The s to the mid s have been described as the golden age of young adult fiction when challenging novels began speaking directly to the interests of the identified adolescent market br In the s young adult literature began pushing the envelope in terms of the subject matter that was considered appropriate for their audience Books dealing with topics such as rape suicide parental death and murder which had previously been deemed taboo saw significant critical and commercial success A flip side of this trend was a strong revived interest in the romance novel including young adult romance With an increase in number of adolescents the genre matured blossomed and came into its own with the better written more serious and more varied young adult books than those published during the last two decades br The first novel in J K Rowling s seven book Harry Potter series Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone was published in Originally marketed in the UK under the broad category of children s literature the books received attention and praise for their increasingly mature and sophisticated nature eventually garnering a significant audience of adult readers This phenomenon led many to see Harry Potter and J K Rowling as responsible for a resurgence of young adult literature It also established a pre eminent role for speculative fiction in the field a trend further solidified by The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins The end of the decade saw a number of awards appear such as the Michael L Printz Award and Alex Awards designed to recognize excellence in writing for young adult audiences br Philip Pullman s fantasy trilogy His Dark Materials published between and added another controversial topic to the field by attacking established religion especially Roman Catholicism Northern Lights the first volume in the trilogy won the Carnegie Medal as the year s outstanding English language children s book Pullman has written other YA fiction including the Sally Lockhart series as well as books for younger children br br br st century br The category of young adult fiction continues to expand into other media and genres graphic novels

Outsiders is a well known example of the YA problem novel Following its publication problem novels became popular during the s br Librarian Sheila Egoff described three reasons why problem novels resonate with adolescents br br They depict real situations that the readers are experiencing so they have therapeutic value br They are interesting new and foreign to those not experiencing these issues br They feature mature story lines which appeal to a child s desire to grow up br A classic example of a problem novel and one that defined the sub genre is Go Ask Alice anonymously published by Beatrice Sparks in Go Ask Alice is written as the diary of a young girl who to cope with her many problems experiments with drugs More recent examples include Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson Crank by Ellen Hopkins and The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky br br br Boundaries between children s young adult and adult fiction br The boundary between books for children and adult literature is flexible and loosely defined and in particular the young have always been efficient plunderers of stories from all sources and have carried off such literary booty as pleased them This boundary has been policed by adults and has alternated between the rigid and the permeable depending on the political and cultural climate br At the lower end of the age spectrum fiction targeted to readers aged is referred to as middle grade fiction Some novels originally marketed to adults are of interest and value to adolescents and vice versa as in the case of books such as the Harry Potter

classrooms is linked to br br higher levels of engagement and motivation among students br increased levels of self confidence personal development and self identification br increased desire to read similar books br Students who read YA are more likely to appreciate literature and have stronger reading skills than others YA also allows teachers to talk about taboo or difficult topics with their students For example a study shows that using Laurie Halse Anderson s novel Speak aided in discussions on consent and complicity Those who read about tough situations like date rape are more emotionally prepared to handle the situation if it arises It is important to use diverse literature in the classroom especially in discussing taboo topics to avoid excluding minority students br Literature written for young adults can also be used as a stepping stone to canonical works that are traditionally read in classrooms and required by many school curriculums In Building a Culture of Readers YA Literature and the Canon by Kara Lycke Lycke suggests pairing young adult literature and canon works to prepare young adults to understand the classic literature they will encounter YA can provide familiar and less alienating examples of similar concepts than those in classic literature Suggested pairings include Rick Riordan s Percy Jackson series with the Iliad or the Odyssey or Stephenie Meyer s Twilight with Wuthering Heights When discussing identity Lycke suggests pairing Hawthorne s The Scarlet Letter with Sherman Alexie s The Absolutely True Diary of a Part Time Indian

br Some consider diversity beneficial since it encourages children of diverse backgrounds to read and it teaches children of all backgrounds an accurate view of the world around them In the mid s more attention was drawn to diversity from various quarters In the several years following diversity numbers seem to have increased One survey showed that in a quarter of children s books were about minority protagonists almost a increase from br br br Literary merit br Jack Zipes a professor of German and literature has criticized the standardized nature of young adult fiction in Western society He writes that to become a phenomenon a work has to conform to the standards set by the mass media and promoted by the culture industry in general Zipes complains of similarities between Harry Potter and other well known heroes br Professor Chris Crowe argues that criticism of young adult fiction arises from the fear that the genre will replace classic works He also suggests that because there is much poorly written young adult fiction and the genre s recent development it has difficulty in establishing its value in relation to the classics of literature br br br Awards br br br See also br br
