title: Spearfishing
id: 306254
Spearfishing is fishing using handheld elongated sharp pointed tools such as a spear gig or harpoon to impale the fish in the body It was one of the earliest fishing techniques used by mankind and has been deployed in artisanal fishing throughout the world for millennia Early civilizations were familiar with the custom of spearing fish from rivers and streams using sharpened sticks br Modern spearfishing usually involves the use of underwater swimming gear and slingshot like elastic spearguns or compressed gas powered pneumatic spearguns which launch a tethered dart like projectile to strike the target fish Specialised techniques and equipment have been developed for various types of aquatic environments and target fish Spearfishing uses no bait and is highly selective with no by catch but inflicts lethal injury to the fish and thus precludes catch and release br Spearfishing may be done using free diving snorkelling or scuba diving techniques but spearfishing while using scuba equipment is illegal in some countries The use of mechanically powered spearguns is also outlawed in some countries and jurisdictions such as New Zealand br br br History br br Spearfishing with barbed poles harpoons was widespread in palaeolithic times Cosquer Cave in Southern France contains cave art over years old including drawings of seals which appear to have been harpooned br There are references to fishing with spears in ancient literature though in most cases the descriptions do not go into detail An early example from the Bible is in Job Canst thou fill his Leviathan skin with barbed irons or his head with fish spears br The Greek historian Polybius ca BC BC in his Histories describes hunting for swordfish by using a harpoon with a barbed and detachable head br Greek author Oppian of Corycus wrote a major treatise on sea fishing the Halieulica or Halieutika composed between and This is the earliest such work to have survived intact Oppian describes various means of fishing including the use of spears and tridents br In a parody of fishing a type of gladiator called retiarius carried a trident and a casting net He fought the murmillo who carried a short sword and a helmet with the image of a fish on the front br Copper harpoons were known to the seafaring Harappans well into antiquity Early hunters in India include the Mincopie people aboriginal inhabitants of India s Andaman and Nicobar islands who have used harpoons with long cords for fishing since early times br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Traditional br br Spear fishing is an ancient method of fishing and may be conducted with an ordinary spear or a specialised variant such as an eel spear or the trident A small trident type spear with a long handle is used in the American South and Midwest for gigging bullfrogs with a bright light at night or for gigging carp and other fish in the shallows br br br Modern br Traditional spear fishing is restricted to shallow waters but the development of the speargun diving mask and swimfins allows fishing in deeper waters Some freedivers are able to hold their breath for more than five minutes a diver with underwater breathing equipment can dive for much longer periods br In the s sport spearfishing using only watertight swimming goggles became popular on the Mediterranean coast of France and Italy This led to development of the modern diving mask fins and snorkel Modern scuba diving had its genesis in the systematic use of rebreathers by Italian sport spearfishers during the s This practice came to the attention of the Italian Navy which developed its frogman unit which affected World War II br By small groups of people in California USA had been spearfishing for less than years Most used imported gear from Europe while innovators Charlie Sturgill Jack Prodanovich and Wally Potts invented and built innovative equipment for California s divers br During the s attempts to have spearfishing recognised as an Olympic sport were unsuccessful Instead two organisations the International Underwater Spearfishing Association IUSA and the International Bluewater Spearfishing Records Committee IBSRC list world record catches by species according to rules to ensure fair competition Spearfishing is illegal in many bodies of water and some locations only allow spearfishing during certain seasons br br br Conservation br Spearfishing has been implicated in local disappearances of some species including the Atlantic goliath grouper on the Caribbean island of Bonaire the Nassau grouper in the barrier reef off the coast of Belize and the giant black sea bass in California which have all been listed as endangered br Modern spearfishing has shifted focus onto catching only what one needs and targeting sustainable fisheries As gear evolved in the s and s spearfishers typically viewed the ocean as an unlimited resource and often sold their catch This practice is now heavily frowned upon in prominent spearfishing nations for promoting unsustainable methods and encouraging taking more fish than is needed In countries such as Australia and South Africa where the activity is regulated by state fisheries spearfishing has been found to be the most environmentally friendly form of fishing due to being highly selective having no by catch causing no habitat damage nor creating pollution or harm to protected endangered species In the Australian Bluewater Freediving Classic became the first spearfishing tournament to be accredited and was awarded out of stars based on environmental social safety and economic indicators br br br Shore diving br br Shore diving is perhaps the most common form of spearfishing and simply involves entering and exiting the sea from beaches or headlands and hunting around ocean structures usually reef but also rocks kelp or sand Usually shore divers hunt at depths of metres ft depending on location In some locations divers can experience drop offs from to metres to ft close to the shore line Sharks and reef fish can be abundant in these locations In subtropical areas sharks may be less common but other challenges face the shore diver such as managing entry and exit in the presence of big waves Headlands are favoured for entry because of their proximity to deeper water but timing is important so the diver does not get pushed onto rocks by waves Beach entry can be safer but more difficult due to the need to repeatedly dive through the waves until the surf line is crossed Divers may enter from a relatively exposed headland for convenience then swim to a more protected part of the shore for their exit from the water br Shore dives produce mainly reef fish but oceangoing pelagic fish are also caught from shore dives in some places and can be specifically targeted br Shore diving can be done with trigger less spears such as pole spears or Hawaiian slings but more commonly triggered devices such as spearguns Speargun setups to catch and store fish include speed rigs and fish stringers br br br Boat diving br Boats ships kayaks or even jetski can be used to access offshore reefs or ocean structure Man made structures such as oil rigs and Fish Aggregating Devices FADs are also fished Sometimes a boat is necessary to access a location that is close to shore but inaccessible by land br Methods and gear used for boat diving are similar to shore diving or blue water hunting depending on the target prey br Boat diving is practiced worldwide Hot spots include Mozambique the Three Kings islands of New Zealand yellowtail Gulf of Mexico oil rigs cobia grouper and the Great Barrier Reef wahoo dogtooth tuna The deepwater fishing grounds off Cape Point Cape Town South Africa have become popular with trophy hunting freediving spearfishers in search of Yellowfin Tuna br br br Blue water hunting br Blue water hunting involves diving in open ocean waters for pelagic species It involves accessing usually very deep and clear water and chumming for large pelagic fish species such as marlin tuna wahoo or giant trevally Blue water hunting is often conducted in drifts the boat driver drops divers and allow them to drift in the current for up to several kilometres before collecting them Blue water hunters can go for hours without seeing any fish and without any ocean structure or a visible bottom the divers can experience sensory deprivation and have difficulty determining the size of a solitary fish One technique to overcome this is to note the size of the fish s eye in relation to its body Large specimens have a proportionally smaller eye br The creation of the Australian Bluewater Freediving Classic in in northern New South Wales was a way of creating interest and promotion of this format of underwater hunting and contributed to the formation of the International Bluewater Spearfishing Records Committee The IBSRC formed in was the first dedicated organization worldwide created by recognized world leaders in blue water hunting to record the capture of pelagic species by blue water hunters br The Blue Water World Cup in La Ventana BCS Mexico has also brought a large amount of notoriety to the sport Started in by Dennis Haussler Elite spearfishers from all over the world compete in a day format that involves very selective spearing of pelagic species with Wahoo AmberJack Dorado Roosterfish Marlin and Tuna being the target species The diving is dynamic and challenging with depths that vary from ft to over ft br Notably some blue water hunters use large multi band wooden guns and make use of breakaway rigs to catch and subdue their prey If the prey is large and still has fight left after being subdued a second gun can provide a kill shot at a safe distance This is acceptable to IBSRC and IUSA regulations as long as the spearo loads it himself in the water br Blue water hunting is conducted worldwide but notable hot spots include Baja Mexico yellowfin tuna wahoo Southern California bluefin tuna Tanzania dogtooth tuna wahoo and yellowfin tuna Mozambique dogtooth tuna wahoo and giant turrum South Africa Yellowfin tuna Spanish Mackerel wahoo marlin and giant turrum Australia dogtooth tuna wahoo and Spanish Mackerel and the South Pacific dogtooth tuna br br br Freshwater hunting br br Many US states allow spearfishing in lakes and rivers but most of them restrict divers to shooting only rough fish such as carp gar bullheads suckers etc Some US states do allow the taking of certain gamefish such as sunfish crappies striped bass catfish and walleyes Freshwater hunters typically have to deal with widely varying seasonal changes in water clarity due to flooding algae blooms and lake turnover Some especially hardy midwestern and north central scuba divers go spearfishing under the ice in the winter when water clarity is at its best br In the summer the majority of freshwater spearfishers use snorkelling gear rather than scuba since many of the fish they pursue are in relatively shallow water Carp shot by freshwater spearfishers typically end up being used as fertilizer bait for trappers or are occasionally donated to zoos br br br Without diving br br Spearfishing with a hand held spear from land shallow water or boat has been practised for thousands of years The fisher must account for optical refraction at the water s surface which makes fish appear higher in their line of sight than they are By experience the fisher learns to aim lower Calm and shallow waters are favored for spearing fish from above the surface as water clarity is of utmost importance Many people who grew up on farms in the midwest U S in the s s recall going spearing for carp with pitchforks when their fields flooded in the spring Spearfishing in this manner has some similarities to bowfishing br br br Equipment br This is a list of equipment commonly used in spearfishing Not all of it is necessary and spearfishing is often practised with minimal gear br br br Speargun br A speargun is an underwater fishing tool designed to launch a tethered short spear at a fish or other marine animal e g a lobster The most popular spearguns are elastically powered by natural latex rubber bands like a slingshot while pneumatic powered spearguns are also used but are less powerful br br br Polespear br Polespears or hand spears consist of a long shaft with point at one end and an elastic loop at the other for propulsion They also come in a wide variety from aluminum or titanium metal to fiberglass or carbon fiber Often they are screwed together from smaller pieces or able to be folded down for ease of transport In Charlie Sturgill beat the competition who were all using spearguns with his own pole spear design br br br Hawaiian slings br Hawaiian slings consist of an elastic band attached to a tube through which a spear is launched br br br Wetsuit br Wetsuits designed specifically for spearfishing are often two piece jacket and high waisted pants or long john style pants with shoulder straps and are black or are fully or partially camouflage br br br Weight belt or vest br Weight belt and vest are used to compensate for wetsuit buoyancy and help the diver descend to depth Rubber belts which can be quickly released in an emergency have proven to be particularly popular for spearfishing worldwide This is because the rubber stretches when fitted and retracts as the body and wetsuit compress underwater keeping them in place more effectively than non stretch webbing belts which tend to slide around more underwater as they loosen with depth Most spearfishing equipment manufacturers now offer rubber weight belts br br br Swimfins br Swimfins for freedive spearfishing are much longer than those used in scuba to aid in fast ascent Typically a closed foot design is used by freediving snorkelling spearos usually worn with neoprene socks while open foot designs which allow diving boots to be worn are more popular with scuba divers br br br Diving knife or cutters br A utility knife or side cutter typically made of saltwater corrosion resistant material such as stainless steel or titanium alloy is carried as a safety precaution in case the diver becomes tangled in a spearline or floatline It can also be used to deliver a coup de gr ce and kill the fish quickly br br br Kill spike br In lieu of a knife a sharpened metal spike can be used to kill the fish quickly and humanely upon capture Ikejime is a Japanese term for kill spiking a fish a method traditionally used by Japanese fishermen Killing the fish quickly is believed to improve the flavor of the flesh by limiting the buildup of lactic acid in the fish s muscles It also reduces chance of attracting opportunistic sharks by stopping the fish thrashing br br br Buoy and floatline br A buoy is usually tethered to the spearfisher s speargun or directly to the spear A buoy helps to subdue large fish It can also assist in storing fish But is more importantly used as a safety device to warn boat drivers there is diver in the area usually by being large brightly colored and flying a dive flag the red flag with white diagonal stripe in the USA or the blue white alpha flag elsewhere in the world A typical spearo dive float will be torpedo shaped orange or red in colour with a volume of between and litres and display a dive flag on a short mast However other designs such as inflatable mini dinghy planche box Tommy Botha big game and body boards are also used br A floatline connects the buoy to the speargun or to the weight belt Often made from braided polyester they are also frequently made from mono filament encased in an airtight plastic tube or made from stretchable bungee cord br br br Gloves br Cut resistant gloves protect the hands when retrieving fish from coral or rock crevices when loading the bands on rubber powered spearguns and from the teeth and spines of struggling fish They are also used for thermal protection in colder water br br br Stringer br Fish stringers are used to store speared fish while diving Usually a length of cable cord string or monofilament terminated by a loop and sometimes a swivel at one end and a large stainless steel pin spike at the other The pin is typically cm long mm diameter with a sharp point at one end and with the cable threaded through a hole usually in the middle so the spike functions as a toggle once threaded The pin can optionally be used as an iki jime spike to dispatch speared fish It can alternatively be a large shaped loop of stainless steel The stringer may be attached to the dive float especially in areas of high shark activity although some divers will use a clip to attach their stringer to their weight belt or the base of their speargun br br br Snorkel and diving mask br Spearfishing snorkels and diving masks are similar to those used for scuba diving although spearfishing masks usually have two eye lenses and a lower internal volume br br br Diver down flag br The Diver Down flag also called a dive flag is a warning flag floating on the water to indicate to other boats personal watercrafts and aircraft that there is a diver below When in use it signals to other boats to keep clear watch for divers in the water and approach at a slow speed br br br Management br br Spearfishing is intensively managed throughout the world br Australia allows only recreational spearfishing and generally only breath hold free diving State territory governments impose numerous restrictions demarcating Marine Protected Areas Closed Areas Protected Species size bag limits and equipment Most of the authorities have different set of rules recommendations and regulations to be followed when it comes to spearfishing for example Dive Newcastle recommends spearfishing being accompanied by a friend The body principally concerned with spearfishing is the Australian Underwater Federation Australia s peak recreational diving body The AUF s vision for spearfishing is Safe Sustainable Selective Spearfishing The AUF provides membership advocacy and organises competitions br Regulations governing spearfishing in Tanzania have been the subject of controversy Commercial spearfishing is illegal while spearfishing for sport is legal but requires that Tanzanian citizens hold a specific sport spearfishing license Foreigners may spearfish for sport only if they are accompanied by a registered and authorized sport spearfishing charter operator br Norway has a relatively large ratio of coastline to population and has one of the most liberal spearfishing rules in the northern hemisphere Spearfishing with scuba gear is widespread among recreational divers Restrictions in Norway are limited to anadrome species like Atlantic salmon sea trout and lobster br In Mexico a regular fishing permit allows spearfishing but not electro mechanical spearguns Spearfishing with scuba gear is illegal and the use of power heads as well Penalties are severe and include fines confiscation of gear and even imprisonment br United States has different spearfishing regulations for each state In Florida spearfishing is restricted to several hundred yards offshore in many areas and the usage of a powerhead is prohibited within state waters Many types of fish are currently under heavy bag restrictions In California only recreational spearfishing is allowed California also imposes numerous restrictions demarcating Marine protected areas closed areas protected species size bag limits and equipment br Spearfishing in Puerto Rico has its own set of rules Here you are allowed to freedive with a speargun in marine waters Spearfishing with scuba gear or in freshwater is not allowed br In the UK while spearfishing is not explicitly regulated it is instead subject to both local typically bye laws and national level legislation relating to permitted fish species and minimum size limits For example it is not permitted to spearfish in freshwater and the non tidal reaches of rivers br Under recent EU guidelines recreational spearfishing is now explicitly permitted in the EU s Atlantic waters br br br Competitive spearfishing br br Competitive spearfishing is defined by the world governing body CMAS as the hunting and capture of fish underwater without the aid of artificial breathing devices using gear that depends entirely on the physical strength of the competitor They publish a set of competition rules that are used by affiliated organisations br br br Notable spearfishers br This is an
