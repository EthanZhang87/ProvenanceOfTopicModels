The Dewey Decimal Classification DDC colloquially known as the Dewey Decimal System is a proprietary library classification system which allows new books to be added to a library in their appropriate location based on subject br It was first published in the United States by Melvil Dewey in Originally described in a page pamphlet it has been expanded to multiple volumes and revised through major editions the latest printed in It is also available in an abridged version suitable for smaller libraries OCLC a non profit cooperative that serves libraries currently maintains the system and licenses online access to WebDewey a continuously updated version for catalogers br The decimal number classification introduced the concepts of relative location and relative index Libraries previously had given books permanent shelf locations that were related to the order of acquisition rather than topic The classification s notation makes use of three digit numbers for main classes with fractional decimals allowing expansion for further detail Numbers are flexible to the degree that they can be expanded in linear fashion to cover special aspects of general subjects A library assigns a classification number that unambiguously locates a particular volume in a position relative to other books in the library on the basis of its subject The number makes it possible to find any book and to return it to its proper place on the library shelves The classification system is used in libraries in at least countries br br br History br br br early development br Melvil Dewey was an American librarian and self declared reformer He was a founding member of the American Library Association and can be credited with the promotion of card systems in libraries and business He developed the ideas for his library classification system in while working at the Amherst College library He applied the classification to the books in that library until in he had a first version of the classification In he published the classification in pamphlet form with the title A Classification and Subject Index for Cataloguing and Arranging the Books and Pamphlets of a Library br He used the pamphlet published in more than one version during the year to solicit comments from other librarians It is not known who received copies or how many commented as only one copy with comments has survived that of Ernest Cushing Richardson His classification system was mentioned in an article in the first issue of the Library Journal and in an article by Dewey in the Department of Education publication Public Libraries in America in In March he applied for and received copyright on the first edition of the index The edition was pages in length with index entries and was printed in copies br br br period of adoption br br The second edition of the Dewey Decimal system published in with the title Decimal Classification and Relativ Index for arranging cataloging and indexing public and private libraries and for pamflets clippings notes scrap books index rerums etc comprised pages with index entries Five hundred copies were produced Editions published between and used a variant of this same title Dewey modified and expanded his system considerably for the second edition In an introduction to that edition Dewey states that nearly persons hav spelling of have per English language spelling reform which Dewey championed contributed criticisms and suggestions br One of the innovations of the Dewey Decimal system was that of positioning books on the shelves in relation to other books on similar topics When the system was first introduced most libraries in the US used fixed positioning each book was assigned a permanent shelf position based on the book s height and date of acquisition Library stacks were generally closed to all but the most privileged patrons so shelf browsing was not considered of importance The use of the Dewey Decimal system increased during the early th century as librarians were convinced of the advantages of relative positioning and of open shelf access for patrons br New editions were readied as supplies of previously published editions were exhausted even though some editions provided little change from the previous as they were primarily needed to fulfill demand In the next decade three editions followed closely on the rd th and th Editions through were published from to The th edition was published in a record copies although subsequent editions were much lower During this time the size of the volume grew and edition swelled to pages an increase of over the previous edition br In response to the needs of smaller libraries which were finding the expanded classification schedules difficult to use in the first abridged edition of the Dewey Decimal system was produced The abridged edition generally parallels the full edition and has been developed for most full editions since that date By popular request in the Library of Congress began to print Dewey Classification numbers on nearly all of its cards thus making the system immediately available to all libraries making use of the Library of Congress card sets br Dewey s was not the only library classification available although it was the most complete Charles Ammi Cutter published the Expansive Classification in with initial encouragement from Melvil Dewey Cutter s system was not adopted by many libraries with one major exception it was used as the basis for the Library of Congress Classification system br In the International Institute of Bibliography located in Belgium and led by Paul Otlet contacted Dewey about the possibility of translating the classification into French and using the classification system for bibliographies as opposed to its use for books in libraries This would have required some changes to the classification which was under copyright Dewey gave permission for the creation of a version intended for bibliographies and also for its translation into French Dewey did not agree however to allow the International Institute of Bibliography to later create an English version of the resulting classification considering that a violation of their agreement as well as a violation of Dewey s copyright Shortly after Dewey s death in however an agreement was reached between the committee overseeing the development of the Decimal Classification and the developers of the French Classification Decimal The English version was published as the Universal Decimal Classification and is still in use today br According to a study done in the Dewey system was used in the US in approximately of responding public libraries and of the college libraries After the death of Melvil Dewey in administration of the classification was under the Decimal Classification Committee of the Lake Placid Club Education Foundation and the editorial body was the Decimal Classification Editorial Policy Committee with participation of the American Library Association ALA Library of Congress and Forest Press By the th edition in the Dewey Decimal Classification index was over pages in length and was published in two volumes br br br present forging an identity br br The growth of the classification to date had led to significant criticism from medium and large libraries which were too large to use the abridged edition but found the full classification overwhelming Dewey had intended issuing the classification in three editions the library edition which would be the fullest edition the bibliographic edition in English and French which was to be used for the organization of bibliographies rather than of books on the shelf and the abridged edition In the bibliographic edition became the Universal Decimal Classification which left the library and abridged versions as the formal Dewey Decimal Classification editions The th edition edited by Milton Ferguson implemented the growing concept of the standard edition designed for the majority of general libraries but not attempting to satisfy the needs of the very largest or of special libraries It also reduced the size of the Dewey system by over half from to pages This revision was so radical that an advisory committee was formed right away for the th and th editions The th and th editions under the editorship of the Library of Congress grew again to two volumes However by then the Dewey Decimal system had established itself as a classification for general libraries with the Library of Congress Classification having gained acceptance for large research libraries br The first electronic version of Dewey was created in Hard copy editions continue to be issued at intervals the online WebDewey and Abridged WebDewey are updated quarterly br br br Administration and publication br Dewey and a small editorial staff managed the administration of the very early editions Beginning in the Lake Placid Club Educational Foundation a not for profit organization founded by Melvil Dewey managed administrative affairs The ALA set up a Special Advisory Committee on the Decimal Classification as part of the Cataloging and Classification division of ALA in The previous Decimal Classification Committee was changed to the Decimal Classification Editorial Policy Committee with participation of the ALA Division of Cataloging and Classification and of the Library of Congress br Melvil Dewey edited the first three editions of the classification system and oversaw the revisions of all editions until his death in May Seymour became editor in and served until her death in She was followed by Dorcas Fellows who was editor until her death in Constantin J Mazney edited the th edition Milton Ferguson functioned as editor from to The th edition in was edited under an agreement between the Library of Congress and Forest Press with David Haykin as director Editions were edited by Benjamin A Custer and the editor of edition was John P Comaromi Joan Mitchell was editor until covering editions to In Michael Panzer of OCLC became Editor in Chief The Dewey Editorial Program Manager since has been Rebecca Green br Dewey himself held copyright in editions to Copyright in editions was held by the publisher The Library Bureau On the death of May Seymour Dewey conveyed the copyrights and control of all editions to the Lake Placid Club Educational Foundation a non profit chartered in The Online Computer Library Center of Dublin Ohio US acquired the trademark and copyrights associated with the Dewey Decimal Classification system when it bought Forest Press in In the Dewey Decimal Classification came to the attention of the U S press when OCLC sued the Library Hotel for trademark infringement for using the classification system as the hotel theme The case was settled shortly thereafter br The OCLC has maintained the classification since and also publishes new editions of the system The editorial staff responsible for updates is based partly at the Library of Congress and partly at OCLC Their work is reviewed by the Decimal Classification Editorial Policy Committee a ten member international board which meets twice each year The four volume unabridged edition was published approximately every six years with the last edition DDC published in mid In the editorial staff announced that the English edition of DDC will no longer be printed in favor of using the frequently updated WebDewey An experimental version of Dewey in RDF was previously available at dewey info beginning in but has not been available since br In addition to the full version a single volume abridged edition designed for libraries with titles or fewer has been made available since The last printed English abridged edition Abridged Edition was published in early br br br Design br The Dewey Decimal Classification organizes library materials by discipline or field of study The scheme comprises ten classes each divided into ten divisions each having ten sections The system s notation uses Indo Arabic numbers with three whole numbers making up the main classes and sub classes and decimals designating further divisions The classification structure is hierarchical and the notation follows the same hierarchy Libraries not needing the full level of detail of the classification can trim right most decimal digits from the class number to obtain more general classifications For example br br Natural sciences and mathematics br Mathematics br Geometry br Analytic geometries br Metric differential geometries br Finsler geometry br The classification was originally enumerative meaning that it listed all of the classes explicitly in the schedules Over time it added some aspects of a faceted classification scheme allowing classifiers to construct a number by combining a class number for a topic with an entry from a separate table Tables cover commonly used elements such as geographical and temporal aspects language and bibliographic forms For example a class number could be constructed using for economics for geographic treatment for Europe to create the class European economy Or one could combine the class for the United States for periodical publications on the topic to arrive at the number for periodicals concerning the United States generally The classification also makes use of mnemonics in some areas such that the number represents the country Italy in classification numbers like history of Italy Italian language and Italian philosophy The combination of faceting and mnemonics makes the classification synthetic in nature with meaning built into parts of the classification number br The Dewey Decimal Classification has a number for all subjects including fiction although many libraries maintain a separate fiction section shelved by alphabetical order of the author s surname Each assigned number consists of two parts a class number from the Dewey system and a book number which prevents confusion of different books on the same subject A common form of the book number is called a Cutter number which represents the author and distinguishes the book from other books on the same topic br br br

it Relativ Index is an alphabetical index to the classification for use both by classifiers and by library users when seeking books by topic The index was relative because the index entries pointed to the class numbers not to the page numbers of the printed classification schedule In this way the Dewey Decimal Classification itself had the same relative positioning as the library shelf and could be used either as an entry point to the classification by catalogers or as an index to a Dewey classed library itself br br br Influence and criticism br Dewey Decimal Classification numbers formed the basis of the Universal Decimal Classification UDC which combines the basic Dewey numbers with selected punctuation marks comma colon parentheses etc Adaptations of the system for specific regions outside the English speaking world include the Korean Decimal Classification the New Classification Scheme for Chinese Libraries and the Nippon Decimal Classification in Japan br Despite its widespread use the classification has been criticized for its complexity and its limited capability for amendment In particular the arrangement of subheadings has been described as archaic and biased towards an Anglo American world view This is particularly clear in the s section in which most literature particularly from outside the United States or Europe is relegated to the s particularly when contrasted with the s history In the Maricopa County Library District in Arizona abandoned the DDC in favor of the Book Industry Standards and Communications BISAC system commonly used by commercial bookstores in an effort to make its libraries more accessible for their users Several other libraries across the United States and other countries including Canada and the Netherlands followed suit br br br Treatment of homosexuality br In topics relating to homosexuality were first added to the system under mental derangements and abnormal psychology In homosexuality was also included under the study of sexes in society In it was added to social problems a classification that continues in the current edition br In homosexuality was added to sexual relations this remains the preferred location in the current edition Although books can also be found under sexual practices viewed as medical disorders the official direction states br br Use for homosexuality only when the work treats homosexuality as a medical disorder or focuses on arguing against the views of those who consider homosexuality to be a medical disorder br br br Treatment of religion br The top level class for religion heavily favors Christianity dedicating nearly all of the division to it the world s thousands of other religions were listed under the s For example Islam is under just DDC despite being almost as large as Christianity by population The entire section has remained largely unchanged since DDC since restructuring would pose a significant amount of work for existing libraries The motivation for this change is ideological rather than technical as appending significant figures can add space as needed br br br Treatment of women br It has also been argued by Hope A Olson that the placement of topics related to women shows implicit bias but this has been simpler to address than the religion schema Some changes made so far have been in numerical proximity altering the placement of topics relative to each other For example in older versions of the DDC some categories regarding women were adjacent to categories on etiquette the placement of these categories next to each other imposed an association of etiquette with women rather than treating it as gender neutral This was changed in DDC version in br br br See also br Comparison of Dewey and Library of Congress subject
