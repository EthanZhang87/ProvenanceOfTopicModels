title: Lake
id: 18842431
A lake is an often naturally occurring relatively large and fixed body of water on the Earth s surface It is localized in a basin or interconnected basins surrounded by dry land Lakes lie completely on land and are separate from the ocean although they may be connected with the ocean by rivers such as Lake Ontario Most lakes are freshwater and account for almost all the world s surface freshwater but some are salt lakes with salinities even higher than that of seawater Lakes vary significantly in surface area and volume of water br Lakes are typically larger and deeper than ponds which are also water filled basins on land although there are no official definitions or scientific criteria distinguishing the two Lakes are also distinct from lagoons which are shallow tidal pools dammed by sandbars at coastal regions of oceans or large lakes Most lakes are fed by springs and both fed and drained by creeks and rivers but some lakes are endorheic without any outflow while volcanic lakes are filled directly by precipitation runoffs and do not have any inflow streams br Natural lakes are generally found in mountainous areas i e alpine lakes dormant volcanic craters rift zones and areas with ongoing glaciation Other lakes are found in depressed landforms or along the courses of mature rivers where a river channel has widened over a basin formed by eroded floodplains and wetlands Some parts of the world have many lakes formed by the chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last ice age All lakes are temporary over long periods of time as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them br Artificially controlled lakes are known as reservoirs and are usually constructed for industrial or agricultural use for hydroelectric power generation for supplying domestic drinking water for ecological or recreational purposes or for other human activities br br br Etymology meaning and usage of lake br The word lake comes from Middle English lake lake pond waterway from Old English lacu pond pool stream from Proto Germanic lak pond ditch slow moving stream from the Proto Indo European root le to leak drain Cognates include Dutch laak lake pond ditch Middle Low German l ke water pooled in a riverbed puddle as in de Wolfslake de Butterlake German Lache pool puddle and Icelandic l kur slow flowing stream Also related are the English words leak and leach br There is considerable uncertainty about defining the difference between lakes and ponds and neither term has an internationally accepted definition across scientific disciplines or political boundaries For example limnologists have defined lakes as water bodies that are simply a larger version of a pond which can have wave action on the shoreline or where wind induced turbulence plays a major role in mixing the water column None of these definitions completely excludes ponds and all are difficult to measure For this reason simple size based definitions are increasingly used to separate ponds and lakes Definitions for lake range in minimum sizes for a body of water from hectares acres to hectares acres Pioneering animal ecologist Charles Elton regarded lakes as waterbodies of hectares acres or more The term lake is also used to describe a feature such as Lake Eyre which is a dry basin most of the time but may become filled under seasonal conditions of heavy rainfall In common usage many lakes bear names ending with the word pond and a lesser number of names ending with lake are in quasi technical fact ponds One textbook illustrates this point with the following In Newfoundland for example almost every lake is called a pond whereas in Wisconsin almost every pond is called a lake br One hydrology book proposes to define the term lake as a body of water with the following five characteristics br br It partially or totally fills one or several basins connected by straits br It has essentially the same water level in all parts except for relatively short lived variations caused by wind varying ice cover large inflows etc br It does not have regular intrusion of seawater br A considerable portion of the sediment suspended in the water is captured by the basins for this to happen they need to have a sufficiently small inflow to volume ratio br The area measured at the mean water level exceeds an arbitrarily chosen threshold for instance one hectare br With the exception of criterion the others have been accepted or elaborated upon by other hydrology publications br br br Distribution br br The majority of lakes on Earth are freshwater and most lie in the Northern Hemisphere at higher latitudes Canada with a deranged drainage system has an estimated lakes larger than square kilometres sq mi in surface area The total number of lakes in Canada is unknown but is estimated to be at least million Finland has lakes of square metres sq ft in area or larger of which are large square metres sq ft or larger br Most lakes have at least one natural outflow in the form of a river or stream which maintain a lake s average level by allowing the drainage of excess water Some lakes do not have a natural outflow and lose water solely by evaporation or underground seepage or both These are termed endorheic lakes br Many lakes are artificial and are constructed for hydroelectric power generation aesthetic purposes recreational purposes industrial use agricultural use or domestic water supply br The number of lakes on Earth is undetermined because most lakes and ponds are very small and do not appear on maps or satellite imagery Despite this uncertainty a large number of studies agree that small ponds are much more abundant than large lakes For example one widely cited study estimated that Earth has million lakes and ponds and that of these are hectare acres or less in area Despite the overwhelming abundance of ponds almost all of Earth s lake water is found in fewer than large lakes this is because lake volume scales superlinearly with lake area br Extraterrestrial lakes exist on the moon Titan which orbits the planet Saturn The shape of lakes on Titan is very similar to those on Earth Lakes were formerly present on the surface of Mars but are now dry lake beds br br br Types br In G Evelyn Hutchinson published a monograph titled A Treatise on Limnology which is regarded as a landmark discussion and classification of all major lake types their origin morphometric characteristics and distribution Hutchinson presented in his publication a comprehensive analysis of the origin of lakes and proposed what is a widely accepted classification of lakes according to their origin This classification recognizes major lake types that are divided into subtypes The major lake types are br br br Tectonic lakes br Tectonic lakes are lakes formed by the deformation and resulting lateral and vertical movements of the Earth s crust These movements include faulting tilting folding and warping Some of the largest lakes on Earth are rift lakes occupying rift valleys e g Central African Rift lakes and Lake Baikal Other well known tectonic lakes Caspian Sea the Sea of Aral and other lakes from the Pontocaspian occupy basins that have been separated from the sea by the tectonic uplift of the sea floor above the ocean level br Often the tectonic action of crustal extension has created an alternating series of parallel grabens and horsts that form elongate basins alternating with mountain ranges Not only does this promote the creation of lakes by the disruption of preexisting drainage networks it also creates within arid regions endorheic basins that contain salt lakes also called saline lakes They form where there is no natural outlet a high evaporation rate and the drainage surface of the water table has a higher than normal salt content Examples of these salt lakes include Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea Another type of tectonic lake caused by faulting is sag ponds br br br Volcanic lakes br br Volcanic lakes are lakes that occupy either local depressions e g craters and maars or larger basins e g calderas created by volcanism Crater lakes are formed in volcanic craters and calderas which fill up with precipitation more rapidly than they empty via either evaporation groundwater discharge or a combination of both Sometimes the latter are called caldera lakes although often no distinction is made An example is Crater Lake in Oregon in the caldera of Mount Mazama The caldera was created in a massive volcanic eruption that led to the subsidence of Mount Mazama around BCE Other volcanic lakes are created when either rivers or streams are dammed by lava flows or volcanic lahars The basin which is now Malheur Lake Oregon was created when a lava flow dammed the Malheur River Among all lake types volcanic crater lakes most closely approximate a circular shape br br br Glacial lakes br br Glacial lakes are lakes created by the direct action of glaciers and continental ice sheets A wide variety of glacial processes create enclosed basins As a result there are a wide variety of different types of glacial lakes and it is often difficult to define clear cut distinctions between different types of glacial lakes and lakes influenced by other activities The general types of glacial lakes that have been recognized are lakes in direct contact with ice glacially carved rock basins and depressions morainic and outwash lakes and glacial drift basins Glacial lakes are the most numerous lakes in the world Most lakes in northern Europe and North America have been either influenced or created by the latest but not last glaciation to have covered the region Glacial lakes include proglacial lakes subglacial lakes finger lakes and epishelf lakes Epishelf lakes are highly stratified lakes in which a layer of freshwater derived from ice and snow melt is dammed behind an ice shelf that is attached to the coastline They are mostly found in Antarctica br br br Fluvial lakes br Fluvial or riverine lakes are lakes produced by running water These lakes include plunge pool lakes fluviatile dams and meander lakes br br br Oxbow lakes br br The most common type of fluvial lake is a crescent shaped lake called an oxbow lake due to the distinctive curved shape They can form in river valleys as a result of meandering The slow moving river forms a sinuous shape as the outer side of bends are eroded away more rapidly than the inner side Eventually a horseshoe bend is formed and the river cuts through the narrow neck This new passage then forms the main passage for the river and the ends of the bend become silted up thus forming a bow shaped lake Their crescent shape gives oxbow lakes a higher perimeter to area ratio than other lake types br br br Fluviatile dams br These form where sediment from a tributary blocks the main river br br br Lateral lakes br These form where sediment from the main river blocks a tributary usually in the form of a levee br br br Floodplain lakes br Lakes formed by other processes responsible for floodplain basin creation During high floods they are flushed with river water There are four types Confluent floodplain lake Contrafluent confluent floodplain lake Contrafluent floodplain lake Profundal floodplain lake br br br Solution lakes br A solution lake is a lake occupying a basin formed by surface dissolution of bedrock In areas underlain by soluble bedrock its solution by precipitation and percolating water commonly produce cavities These cavities frequently collapse to form sinkholes that form part of the local karst topography Where groundwater lies near the grounds surface a sinkhole will be filled water as a solution lake If such a lake consists of a large area of standing water that occupies an extensive closed depression in limestone it is also called a karst lake Smaller solution lakes that consist of a body of standing water in a closed depression within a karst region are known as karst ponds Limestone caves often contain pools of standing water which are known as underground lakes Classic examples of solution lakes are abundant in the karst regions at the Dalmatian coast of Croatia and within large parts of Florida br br br Landslide lakes br A landslide lake is created by the blockage of a river valley by either mudflows rockslides or screes Such lakes are most common in mountainous regions Although landslide lakes may be large and quite deep they are typically short lived An example of a landslide lake is Quake Lake which formed as a result of the Hebgen Lake earthquake br Most landslide lakes disappear in the first few months after formation but a landslide dam can burst suddenly at a later stage and threaten the population downstream when the lake water drains out In an earthquake triggered a landslide that blocked a deep valley in the Pamir Mountains region of Tajikistan forming the Sarez Lake The Usoi Dam at the base of the valley has remained in place for more than years but the terrain below the lake is in danger of a catastrophic flood if the dam were to fail during a future earthquake br Tal y llyn Lake in north Wales is a landslide lake dating back to the last glaciation in Wales some years ago br br br Aeolian lakes br Aeolian lakes are produced by wind action These lakes are found mainly in arid environments although some aeolian lakes are relict landforms indicative of arid paleoclimates Aeolian lakes consist of lake basins dammed by wind blown sand interdunal lakes that lie between well oriented sand dunes and deflation basins formed by wind action under previously arid paleoenvironments Moses Lake in Washington United States was originally a shallow natural lake and an example of a lake basin dammed by wind blown sand br China s Badain Jaran Desert is a unique landscape of megadunes and elongated interdunal aeolian lakes particularly concentrated in the southeastern margin of the desert br br br Shoreline lakes br Shoreline lakes are generally lakes created by blockage of estuaries or by the uneven accretion of beach ridges by longshore and other currents They include maritime coastal lakes ordinarily in drowned estuaries lakes enclosed by two tombolos or spits connecting an island to the mainland lakes cut off from larger lakes by a bar or lakes divided by the meeting of two spits br br br Organic lakes br Organic lakes are lakes created by the actions of plants and animals On the whole they are relatively rare in occurrence and quite small in size In addition they typically have ephemeral features relative to the other types of lakes The basins in which organic lakes occur are associated with beaver dams coral lakes or dams formed by vegetation br br br Peat lakes br Peat lakes are a form of organic lake They form where a buildup of partly decomposed plant material in a wet environment leaves the vegetated surface below the water table for a sustained period of time They are often low in nutrients and mildly acidic with bottom waters low in dissolved oxygen br br br Artificial lakes br br Artificial lakes or anthropogenic lakes are large waterbodies created by human activity They can be formed by the intentional damming of rivers and streams rerouting of water to inundate a previously dry basin or the deliberate filling of abandoned excavation pits by either precipitation runoff ground water or a combination of both Artificial lakes may be used as storage reservoirs that provide drinking water for nearby settlements to generate hydroelectricity for flood management for supplying agriculture or aquaculture or to provide an aquatic sanctuary for parks and nature reserves br The Upper Silesian region of southern Poland contains an anthropogenic lake district consisting of more than water bodies created by human activity The diverse origins of these lakes include reservoirs retained by dams flooded mines water bodies formed in subsidence basins and hollows levee ponds and residual water bodies following river regulation Same for the Lusatian Lake District Germany br See List of notable artificial lakes in the United States br br br Meteorite extraterrestrial impact lakes br br Meteorite lakes also known as crater lakes not to be confused with volcanic crater lakes are created by catastrophic impacts with the Earth by extraterrestrial objects either meteorites or asteroids Examples of meteorite lakes are Lonar Lake in India Lake El gygytgyn in northeast Siberia and the Pingualuit crater lake in Quebec Canada As in the cases of El gygytgyn and Pingualuit meteorite lakes can contain unique and scientifically valuable sedimentary deposits associated with long records of paleoclimatic changes br br br Other classification methods br br In addition to the mode of origin lakes have been named and classified according to various other important factors such as thermal stratification oxygen saturation seasonal variations in lake volume and water level salinity of the water mass relative seasonal permanence degree of outflow and so on The names used by the lay public and in the scientific community for different types of lakes are often informally derived from the morphology of the lakes physical characteristics or other factors Also different cultures and regions of the world have their own popular nomenclature br br br By thermal stratification br One important method of lake classification is on the basis of thermal stratification which has a major influence on the animal and plant life inhabiting a lake and the fate and distribution of dissolved and suspended material in the lake For example the thermal stratification as well as the degree and frequency of mixing has a strong control over the distribution of oxygen within the lake br Professor F A Forel also referred to as the Father of limnology was the first scientist to classify lakes according to their thermal stratification His system of classification was later modified and improved upon by Hutchinson and L ffler As the density of water varies with temperature with a maximum at degrees Celsius thermal stratification is an important physical characteristic of a lake that controls the fauna and flora sedimentation chemistry and other aspects of individual lakes First the colder denser water typically forms a layer near the bottom which is called the hypolimnion Second normally overlying the hypolimnion is a transition zone known as the metalimnion Finally overlying the metalimnion is a surface layer of warmer water with a lower density called the epilimnion This typical stratification sequence can vary widely depending on the specific lake or the time of year or a combination of both The classification of lakes by thermal stratification presupposes lakes with sufficient depth to form a hypolimnion accordingly very shallow lakes are excluded from this classification system br Based upon their thermal stratification lakes are classified as either holomictic with a uniform temperature and density from top to bottom at a given time of year or meromictic with layers of water of different temperature and density that do not intermix The deepest layer of water in a meromictic lake does not contain any dissolved oxygen so there are no living aerobic organisms Consequently the layers of sediment at the bottom of a meromictic lake remain relatively undisturbed which allows for the development of lacustrine deposits In a holomictic lake the uniformity of temperature and density allows the lake waters to completely mix Based upon thermal stratification and frequency of turnover holomictic lakes are divided into amictic lakes cold monomictic lakes dimictic lakes warm monomictic lakes polymictic lakes and oligomictic lakes br Lake stratification does not always result from a variation in density because of thermal gradients Stratification can also result from a density variation caused by gradients in salinity In this case the hypolimnion and epilimnion are separated not by a thermocline but by a halocline which is sometimes referred to as a chemocline br br br By seasonal variations in water level and volume br Lakes are informally classified and named according to the seasonal variation in their lake level and volume Some of the names include br br Ephemeral lake is a short lived lake or pond If it fills with water and dries up disappears seasonally it is known as an intermittent lake They often fill poljes br Dry lake is a popular name for an ephemeral lake that contains water only intermediately at irregular and infrequent intervals br Perennial lake is a lake that has water in its basin throughout the year and is not subject to extreme fluctuations in level br Playa lake is a typically shallow intermittent lake that covers or occupies a playa either in wet seasons or in especially wet years but subsequently drying up in an arid or semiarid region br Vlei is a name used in South Africa for a shallow lake which varies considerably in level with the seasons br br br By water chemistry br Lakes may be informally classified and named according to the general chemistry of their water mass Using this classification method the lake types include br br An acid lake contains water with a below neutral pH of less than A lake is considered to be highly acidic if its pH drops below leading to biological consequences Such lakes include acidic pit lakes occupying abandoned mines and excavations naturally acidic lakes of igneous and metamorphic landscapes peat bogs in northern regions crater lakes of active and dormant volcanoes and lakes acidified by acid rain br A salt lake also known as a saline lake or brine lake is an inland body of water situated in an arid or semiarid region with no outlet to the sea containing a high concentration of dissolved neutral salts principally sodium chloride Examples include the Great Salt Lake in Utah and the Dead Sea in southwestern Asia br An alkali sink also known as an alkali flat or salt flat is a shallow saline feature that can be found in low lying areas of arid regions and in groundwater discharge zones These features are typically classified as dry lakes or playas because they are periodically flooded by rain or flood events and then dry up during drier intervals leaving accumulations of brines and evaporitic minerals br A salt pan is a small shallow natural depression in which water accumulates and evaporates leaving a salt deposit or the shallow lake of brackish water that occupies a salt pan The term salt pan comes from open pan salt making a method of extracting salt from brine using large open pans br A saline pan is another name for an ephemeral acid saline lake which precipitates a bottom crust that is subsequently modified during subaerial exposure br br br Composed of other liquids br Lava lake is a large volume of molten lava usually basaltic contained in a volcanic vent crater or broad depression br Hydrocarbon lakes are bodies of liquid ethane and methane that occupy depressions on the surface of Titan They were detected by the Cassini Huygens space probe br br br Paleolakes br A paleolake also palaeolake is a lake that existed in the past when hydrological conditions were different Quaternary paleolakes can often be identified on the basis of relict lacustrine landforms such as relict lake plains and coastal landforms that form recognizable relict shorelines called paleoshorelines Paleolakes can also be recognized by characteristic sedimentary deposits that accumulated in them and any fossils that might be contained in these sediments The paleoshorelines and sedimentary deposits of paleolakes provide evidence for prehistoric hydrological changes during the times that they existed br There are two types of paleolake br br A former lake is a paleolake that no longer exists Such lakes include prehistoric lakes and those that have permanently dried up often as the result of either evaporation or human intervention An example of a former lake is Owens Lake in California United States Former lakes are a common feature of the Basin and Range area of southwestern North America br A shrunken lake is a paleolake that still exists but has considerably decreased in size over geological time An example of a shrunken lake is Lake Agassiz which once covered much of central North America Two notable remnants of Lake Agassiz are Lake Winnipeg and Lake Winnipegosis br Paleolakes are of scientific and economic importance For example Quaternary paleolakes in semidesert basins are important for two reasons they played an extremely significant if transient role in shaping the floors and piedmonts of many basins and their sediments contain enormous quantities of geologic and paleontologic information concerning past environments In addition the organic rich deposits of pre Quaternary paleolakes are important either for the thick deposits of oil shale and shale gas contained in them or as source rocks of petroleum and natural gas Although of significantly less economic importance strata deposited along the shore of paleolakes sometimes contain coal seams br br br Characteristics br br Lakes have numerous features in addition to lake type such as drainage basin also known as catchment area inflow and outflow nutrient content dissolved oxygen pollutants pH and sedimentation br Changes in the level of a lake are controlled by the difference between the input and output compared to the total volume of the lake Significant input sources are precipitation onto the lake runoff carried by streams and channels from the lake s catchment area groundwater channels and aquifers and artificial sources from outside the catchment area Output sources are evaporation from the lake surface and groundwater flows and any extraction of lake water by humans As climate conditions and human water requirements vary these will create fluctuations in the lake level br Lakes can be also categorized on the basis of their richness in nutrients which typically affect plant growth Nutrient poor lakes are said to be oligotrophic and are generally clear having a low concentration of plant life Mesotrophic lakes have good clarity and an average level of nutrients Eutrophic lakes are enriched with nutrients resulting in good plant growth and possible algal blooms Hypertrophic lakes are bodies of water that have been excessively enriched with nutrients These lakes typically have poor clarity and are subject to devastating algal blooms Lakes typically reach this condition due to human activities such as heavy use of fertilizers in the lake catchment area Such lakes are of little use to humans and have a poor ecosystem due to decreased dissolved oxygen br Due to the unusual relationship between water s temperature and its density lakes form layers called thermoclines layers of drastically varying temperature relative to depth Fresh water is most dense at about degrees Celsius F at sea level When the temperature of the water at the surface of a lake reaches the same temperature as deeper water as it does during the cooler months in temperate climates the water in the lake can mix bringing oxygen starved water up from the depths and bringing oxygen down to decomposing sediments Deep temperate lakes can maintain a reservoir of cold water year round which allows some cities to tap that reservoir for deep lake water cooling br br Since the surface water of deep tropical lakes never reaches the temperature of maximum density there is no process that makes the water mix The deeper layer becomes oxygen starved and can become saturated with carbon dioxide or other gases such as sulfur dioxide if there is even a trace of volcanic activity Exceptional events such as earthquakes or landslides can cause mixing which rapidly brings the deep layers up to the surface and release a vast cloud of gas which lay trapped in solution in the colder water at the bottom of the lake This is called a limnic eruption An example is the disaster at Lake Nyos in Cameroon The amount of gas that can be dissolved in water is directly related to pressure As deep water surfaces the pressure drops and a vast amount of gas comes out of solution Under these circumstances carbon dioxide is hazardous because it is heavier than air and displaces it so it may flow down a river valley to human settlements and cause mass asphyxiation br The material at the bottom of a lake or lake bed may be composed of a wide variety of inorganics such as silt or sand and organic material such as decaying plant or animal matter The composition of the lake bed has a significant impact on the flora and fauna found within the lake s environs by contributing to the amounts and the types of nutrients available br A paired black and white layer of the varved lake sediments correspond to a year During winter when organisms die carbon is deposited down resulting to a black layer At the same year during summer only few organic materials are deposited resulting to a white layer at the lake bed These are commonly used to track past paleontological events br Natural lakes provide a microcosm of living and nonliving elements that are relatively independent of their surrounding environments Therefore lake organisms can often be studied in isolation from the lake s surroundings br br br Limnology br br Limnology is the study of inland bodies of water and related ecosystems Limnology divides lakes into three zones the littoral zone a sloped area close to land the photic or open water zone where sunlight is abundant and the deep water profundal or benthic zone where little sunlight can reach The depth to which light can penetrate depends on the turbidity of the water which is determined by the density and size of suspended particles A particle will be in suspension if its weight is less than the random turbidity forces acting upon it These particles can be sedimentary or biological in origin including algae and detritus and are responsible for the color of the water Decaying plant matter for instance may account for a yellow or brown color while algae may cause a greenish coloration In very shallow water bodies iron oxides make the water reddish brown Bottom dwelling detritivorous fish stir the mud in search of food and can be the cause of turbid waters Piscivorous fish contribute to turbidity by eating plant eating planktonivorous fish thus increasing the amount of algae see aquatic trophic cascade br The light depth or transparency is measured using a Secchi disk a cm in disk with alternating white and black quadrants The depth at which the disk is no longer visible is the Secchi depth a measure of transparency The Secchi disk is commonly used to test for eutrophication For a detailed look at these processes see lentic ecosystems br A lake moderates the surrounding region s temperature and climate because water has a very high specific heat capacity J kg K In the daytime a lake can cool the land beside it with local winds resulting in a sea breeze in the night it can warm it with a land breeze br br br Biological properties br br Lake zones br br Epilittoral The zone that is entirely above the lake s normal water level and never submerged by lake water br Littoral The zone that encompasses the small area above the normal water level which is sometimes submerged when the lake s water level increases reaching to the deepest part of the lake that still allows for submerged macrophytic growth br Littoriprofundal Transition zone commonly aligned with stratified lakes metalimnions too deep for macrophytes but includes photosynthetic algae and bacteria br Profundal Sedimentary zone containing no vegetation br Algal community types br br Epipelic Algae that grow on sediments br Epilithic Algae that grow on rocks br Epipsammic Algae that grow on or within sand br Epiphytic Algae that grow on macrophytes br Epizooic Algae that grow on living animals br Metaphyton Algae present in the littoral zone not in a state of suspension nor attached to a substratum such as a macrophyte br br br Circulation br br br Flora and fauna br br br Disappearance br br The lake may be infilled with deposited sediment and gradually become a wetland such as a swamp or marsh Large water plants typically reeds accelerate this closing process significantly because they partially decompose to form peat soils that fill the shallows Conversely peat soils in a marsh can naturally burn and reverse this process to recreate a shallow lake resulting in a dynamic equilibrium between marsh and lake This is significant since wildfire has been largely suppressed in the developed world over the past century This has artificially converted many shallow lakes into emergent marshes Turbid lakes and lakes with many plant eating fish tend to disappear more slowly A disappearing lake barely noticeable on a human timescale typically has extensive plant mats at the water s edge These become a new habitat for other plants like peat moss when conditions are right and animals many of which are very rare Gradually the lake closes and young peat may form forming a fen In lowland river valleys where a river can meander the presence of peat is explained by the infilling of historical oxbow lakes In the final stages of succession trees can grow in eventually turning the wetland into a forest br br Some lakes can disappear seasonally These are called intermittent lakes ephemeral lakes or seasonal lakes and can be found in karstic terrain A prime example of an intermittent lake is Lake Cerknica in Slovenia or Lag Prau Pulte in Graub nden Other intermittent lakes are only the result of above average precipitation in a closed or endorheic basin usually filling dry lake beds This can occur in some of the driest places on earth like Death Valley This occurred in the spring of after unusually heavy rains The lake did not last into the summer and was quickly evaporated see photos to right A more commonly filled lake of this type is Sevier Lake of west central Utah br Sometimes a lake will disappear quickly On June in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast Russia a lake called Lake Beloye vanished in a matter of minutes News sources reported that government officials theorized that this strange phenomenon may have been caused by a shift in the soil underneath the lake that allowed its water to drain through channels leading to the Oka River br The presence of ground permafrost is important to the persistence of some lakes Thawing permafrost may explain the shrinking or disappearance of hundreds of large Arctic lakes across western Siberia The idea here is that rising air and soil temperatures thaw permafrost allowing the lakes to drain away into the ground br Some lakes disappear because of human development factors The shrinking Aral Sea is described as being murdered by the diversion for irrigation of the rivers feeding it Between and more than half of the world s large lakes decreased in size in part due to climate change br br br Extraterrestrial lakes br br Only one astronomical body other than Earth is known to harbor large lakes Saturn s largest moon Titan Photographs and spectroscopic analysis by the Cassini Huygens spacecraft show liquid ethane on the surface which is thought to be mixed with liquid methane The largest lake on Titan is Kraken Mare which at an estimated km is roughly five times the size of Lake Superior km and nearly the size of all five Great Lakes of North America combined The second largest Titanean lake Ligeia Mare is almost twice the size of Lake Superior at an estimated km br Jupiter s large moon Io is volcanically active leading to the accumulation of sulfur deposits on the surface Some photographs taken during the Galileo mission appear to show lakes of liquid sulfur in volcanic caldera though these are more analogous to lakes of lava than of water on Earth br The planet Mars has only one confirmed lake which is underground and near the south pole Although the surface of Mars is too cold and has too little atmospheric pressure to permit permanent surface water geologic evidence appears to confirm that ancient lakes once formed on the surface br There are dark basaltic plains on the Moon similar to lunar maria but smaller which are called lacus singular lacus Latin for lake because they were thought by early astronomers to be lakes of water br br br Notable lakes on Earth br br The largest lake by surface area is Caspian Sea which is despite its name considered as a lake from the point of view of geography Its surface area is sq mi km br The second largest lake by surface area and the largest freshwater lake by surface area is Lake Michigan Huron which is hydrologically a single lake Its surface area is sq mi km For those who consider Lake Michigan Huron to be separate lakes and Caspian Sea to be a sea Lake Superior would be the largest lake at km square miles br Lake Baikal is the deepest lake in the world located in Siberia with a bottom at metres ft Its mean depth is also the greatest in the world metres ft It is also the world s largest freshwater lake by volume cubic

that it has turned into a small bay br The longest lake is Lake Tanganyika with a length of about kilometres mi measured along the lake s center line It is also the third largest by volume the second oldest and the second deepest metres ft in the world after Lake Baikal br The world s highest lake if size is not a criterion may be the crater lake of Ojos del Salado at metres ft br The highest

the east and Israel and Palestine to the west at metres ft below sea level It is also one of the lakes with highest salt concentration br Lake Michigan Huron has the longest lake coastline in the world about kilometres mi excluding the coastline of its many inner islands Even if it is considered two lakes Lake Huron alone would still have the longest coastline in the world at kilometres mi br
