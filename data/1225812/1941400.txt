hooks sewing kit and a flashlight br Civilians such as forestry workers surveyors or bush pilots who work in remote locations or in regions with extreme climate conditions may also be equipped with survival kits Disaster supplies are also kept on hand by those who live in areas prone to earthquakes or other natural disasters For the average citizen to practice disaster preparedness some towns will have survival stores to keep survival supplies in stock br The American Red Cross recommends an emergency preparedness kit that is easy to carry and use in the event of an emergency or disaster br br Mini survival kits or Altoids tin survival kits are small kits that contain a few basic survival tools These kits often include a small compass waterproof matches minimum fishing tackle large plastic bag small candle jigsaw blade craft knife or scalpel blade and or a safety pin s Pre packaged survival kits may also include instructions in survival techniques such as fire starting or first aid methods In addition paracord can be wrapped around the tin The paracord can be used for setting up an emergency shelter or snaring small animals They are designed to fit within a container roughly the size of a mint tin br br Other small kits are wearable and built into everyday carry survival bracelets or belts Most often these are paracord bracelets with tools woven inside Several tools such

bag BOB also known as a hour kit GOOD bag get out of Dodge personal emergency relocation kit PERK go bag survival backpack or quick run bag QRB is a portable kit containing items that would help a person to survive for hours during an escape or evacuation from an emergency event or disaster such as a hurricane earthquake or flood br The focus is on evacuation rather than long term survival The kits are also popular in the survivalism subculture br br The term bug out bag is related to and possibly derived from the bail out bag emergency kit many military aviators carry In the United States the term refers to the Korean War practice of the U S Army designating alternative defensive positions in the event that the units had to retreat They were directed to bug out when being overrun was imminent The term has since been adopted by military training institutions around the world with standard operating procedures involving a bug out location a method of withdrawal and the bare supplies needed to withdraw quickly but still survive in the field The concept passed into wide usage among other military and law enforcement personnel though the bail out bag is as likely to include emergency gear for going into an emergency situation as for escaping an emergency br The primary purpose of a bug out bag is to allow one to evacuate quickly if a disaster should strike It is therefore prudent to gather into a single place all of the materials and supplies that might be required to do this such as a bag or a few storage containers The recommendation that a bug out bag contain enough supplies for hours arises from advice from organizations responsible for disaster relief and management that it may take them up to hours to reach people affected by a disaster and offer help The bag s contents may vary according to the region of the user as someone evacuating from the path of a hurricane may have different supplies from someone who lives in an area prone to blizzards earthquakes or wildfires br In addition to allowing one to survive a disaster evacuation a bug out bag may also be used when sheltering in place bugging in as a response to emergencies such as blackouts house fires tornadoes and other severe natural disasters br br The Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA the United States s agency responsible for disaster planning and emergency
