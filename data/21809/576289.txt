from the players Livingstone would sue for the team s revenues in George Kennedy owner of the Canadiens would later say br br The Toronto players belong as a body to the National Hockey League for

was sidelined and Odie got an exemption from the army on the condition he not play hockey this season As a result of losing the Cleghorns owner Sam Lichtenhein threatened to fold the Wanderers unless he got all of Quebec s players The other owners had little sympathy and George Kennedy of the Canadiens pointed out that Lichtenhein could have chosen Malone in the draft After this exchange of words Lichtenhein and manager Art Ross decided to keep quiet for the time being br br br Rule changes br On January the league decided to allow goaltenders to drop to the ice surface in order to make saves

Frank Calder As far as I am concerned they can stand on their head s br br br Teams br br br Regular season br The new league faced stiff competition for players from the rival Pacific Coast Hockey Association PCHA Also filling rosters was a challenge because many players were fighting in World War I br The Wanderers were in trouble from the start of the season They won their home opener but drew only fans The Wanderers then lost the next three games and owner Lichtenhein threatened to withdraw from the league unless he could get some players Although they could have acquired Joe Malone in the draft they turned to the PCHA and in exchange for waiving their claim on Gordon Roberts signed goaltender Hap Holmes They immediately offered him to Toronto for Reg Noble Toronto turned down the deal but kept the door open for obtaining Holmes The Wanderers also obtained permission to sign such players as Frank Foyston Jack Walker and others if they could do so The Wanderers loaned Holmes to the Seattle Metropolitans of the PCHA but he eventually found his way back to the NHL when Seattle loaned him to Toronto today known as Toronto Arenas br br A league meeting was planned to deal with the situation but on January the matter was resolved when the Westmount Arena burned down leaving the Canadiens and Wanderers homeless The Canadiens moved into the seat Jubilee Rink The Hamilton
