Toronto Blueshirts owner Eddie Livingstone The remaining clubs then met in November to form the NHL using the same constitution and playing rules of the NHA The NHL took the NHA s place in competing for the Cup in a playoff series with the Pacific Coast Hockey Association br The Toronto NHL players were assigned from the Toronto NHA franchise and played for a temporary Toronto NHL franchise operated by the Toronto Arena owners This is why it is often called the Arenas although no hockey club with the official name Arenas existed until after the season The team at the time used no nickname it was often referred to at the time as the Blueshirts the nickname of the NHA franchise as it was announced by the NHA that the franchise had been sold although Eddie Livingstone had not
