An electronic visual display is a display device that can display images video or text that is transmitted electronically Electronic visual displays include television sets computer monitors and digital signage They are ubiquitous in mobile computing applications like tablet computers smartphones and information appliances Many electronic visual displays are informally referred to as screens br Starting in the early s flat panel displays began to dominate the industry as cathode ray tubes CRT were phased out especially for computer applications Starting in the mid s curved display panels began to be used in televisions computer monitors and smartphones br br br Types br There are various technologies used for electronic visual displays br br Electroluminescent EL display br Liquid crystal display LCD with Light emitting diode LED backlit Liquid crystal display LCD br Light emitting diode LED display br OLED display br AMOLED display br Plasma P display br Quantum dot QD display br An overhead projector can be considered a type of electronic visual display br Additionally CRTs were widely used in the past and microLED displays are under development br br br Classification br Electronic visual displays present visual information according to the electrical input signal analog or digital either by emitting light then they are called active displays or alternatively by modulating available light during the process of reflection or transmission light modulators are called passive displays br br br Display mode of observation br Electronic visual displays can be observed directly direct view display or the displayed information can be projected to a screen transmissive or reflective screen This usually happens with smaller displays at a certain magnification br br A different kind of projection display is the class of laser projection displays where the image is built up sequentially either via line by line scanning or by writing one complete column at a time For that purpose one beam is formed from three lasers operating at the primary colors and this beam is scanned electro mechanically galvanometer scanner micro mirror array or electro acousto optically br br br Layout of picture elements br Depending on the shape and on the arrangement of the picture elements of a display either fixed information can be displayed symbols signs simple numerals segment layout or arbitrary shapes can be formed dot matrix displays br br br Emission and control of colors br Colors can be generated by selective emission by selective absorption transmission or by selective reflection br br br Addressing modes br Each sub pixel of a display device must be selected addressed in order to be energized in a controlled way br br br Display driving modes br br br See also br Display device br ISO br br br br br SID Society for Information Display International Conference Proceedings br Journal of the Society for Information Display JSID br Display Reparatur in German br Passive Displays br Choosing an IT device br br br Further reading br Pochi Yeh Claire Gu Optics of Liquid Crystal Displays John Wiley Sons Conoscopy pp
