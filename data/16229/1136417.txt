A computer case also known as a computer chassis is the enclosure that contains most of the hardware of a personal computer The components housed inside the case such as the CPU motherboard memory mass storage devices power supply unit and various expansion cards are referred as the internal hardware while hardware outside the case typically cable linked or plug and play devices such as the display speakers keyboard mouse and USB flash drives are known as peripherals br Conventional computer cases are fully enclosed with small holes mostly in the back panel that allow ventilation and cutout openings that provide access to plugs sockets back and removable media drive bays front The structural frame chassis of a case is usually constructed from rigid metals such as steel often SECC steel electrogalvanized cold rolled coil and aluminium alloy with hardpoints and through holes for mounting internal hardware case fans coolers and for organizing cable management The external case panels at least one of which are removable cover the chassis from the front sides and top to shield the internal components from physical intrusion and dust collection and are typically made from painted metallic and or plastic material while other materials such as mesh tempered glass acrylic wood and even Lego bricks have appeared in many modern commercial or home built cases In recent years open frame or open air cases that are only partly enclosed with freer ventilation and thus theoretically better cooling have become available in the premium gaming PC market br br br Sizes and terminology br br Cases can come in many different sizes and shapes which are usually determined by the form factor of the motherboard since it is physically the largest hardware component in most computers Consequently personal computer form factors typically specify only the internal dimensions and layout of the case Form factors for rack mounted and blade servers may include precise external dimensions as well since these cases must themselves fit in specific enclosures br For example a case designed for an ATX motherboard and power supply unit PSU may take on several external forms such as a vertical tower designed to sit on the floor height width a flat desktop height width or pizza box height cm or in designed to sit on the desk under the computer s monitor Full size tower cases are typically larger in volume than desktop cases with more room for drive bays expansion slots and custom or all in one AIO water cooling solutions Desktop cases and mini tower cases under about cm in high are popular in business environments where space is at a premium br br Currently the most popular form factor for desktop computers is ATX although microATX and small form factors have also become very popular for a variety of uses In the high end segment the unofficial and loosely defined XL ATX specification appeared around It extends the length of the mainboard to accommodate four graphics cards with dual slot coolers Some XL ATX mainboards increase the mainboard s width as well to allow more space for the CPU Memory PWM and in some cases a second CPU socket While the market share of these exotic high end mainboards is very low almost all high end cases and many mainstream cases support XL ATX expansion slots As of no major motherboard manufacturer has made an XL ATX board for several years E ATX is similar to XL ATX in that it is larger than ATX and is also loosely defined Unlike XL ATX E ATX motherboards and cases are still in production as of and support quad channel memory across slots of ram up to PCI e expansion slots for up to double slot graphics cards and a single CPU such as the AMD Ryzen Threadripper X Companies like In Win Development Shuttle Inc and AOpen originally popularized small cases for which FlexATX was the most common motherboard size As of Mini ITX has widely replaced FlexATX as the most common small form factor mainboard standard The latest mini ITX mainboards from Asus Gigabyte MSI ASRock Zotac and Foxconn offer the same feature set as full size mainboards High end mini ITX mainboards support standard desktop CPUs use standard memory DIMM sockets and mostly feature a full size PCI E slot with support for the fastest graphics cards although some instead use a PCI or PCIe slot of fewer than lanes This allows customers to build a fully fledged high end computer in a significantly smaller case Apple Inc has also produced the Mac Mini computer which is similar in size to a standard CD ROM drive and many manufacturers offer mini ITX cases of similar size for low wattage CPUs with integrated graphics br br Tower cases are often categorized as mini tower midi tower mid tower or full tower The terms are subjective and inconsistently defined by different manufacturers br Full tower cases are typically cm in or more in height and intended to stand on the floor They can have anywhere from six to ten externally accessible drive bays These cases were originally developed to house file servers which would typically be tasked with serving data from expensive CD ROM databases that held more data than the hard drives commonly available at the time Hence many full tower cases include locking doors and other physical security features to prevent theft of the discs However as computing technology moves from floppy disks and CD ROMs to large capacity hard drives USB flash drives and network based solutions more recent full tower cases typically only have none one or two external bays for CD drives with the internal bays moved elsewhere in the case to improve airflow Today full tower cases are commonly used by enthusiasts as showpiece display cases with custom water cooling lighting and tempered glass replacing acrylic They may also hold two computers as is the case with the Corsair D and dual power supplies Corsair D br Mid tower cases are smaller about cm in high with two to four external bays They may also hold two computers br A mini tower case will typically have only one or two external bays br The marketing term midi tower sometimes refers to cases smaller than mid tower but larger than mini tower typically with two to three external bays Other times the term may be synonymous with mid tower br br br Layout br Computer cases usually include sheet metal enclosures for a power supply unit and drive bays as well as a rear panel that can accommodate peripheral connectors protruding from the motherboard and expansion slots Most cases also have a power button or switch a reset button and LEDs to indicate power hard drive activity and network activity in some models Some cases include built in I O ports such as USB and headphone ports on the front of the case Such a case will also normally include the wires needed to connect these ports switches and indicators to the motherboard br br br Major component locations br The motherboard is usually screwed to the case along its largest face which could be the bottom or the side of the case depending on its form factor and orientation br Form factors such as ATX provide a back panel with cut out holes to expose I O ports provided by integrated peripherals as well as expansion slots which may optionally expose additional ports provided by expansion cards Many larger ATX cases can also be used with motherboards of other form factors br The power supply unit mounting point differs from case to case but the most commonly used locations both at the rear of the case and their advantages disadvantages are br The top of the case usually allowing the PSU s built in fan to act as an auxiliary exhaust fan but causes the PSU to be fed air heated by the internal components of the case thus causing PSU efficiency and lifespan degradation br The bottom of the case with an often filtered vent in the bottom of the case allowing the PSU to draw cool air from the outside br Regardless of the mounting position the PSU will usually be attached to the case with four screws to support its weight br Most cases include drive bays on the front of the case a typical ATX case includes and bays In modern computers the bays are used for optical drives the bays are used for hard drives and card readers and the bays are used for solid state drives br Buttons and LEDs are typically located on the front of the case some cases include additional I O ports temperature and processor speed monitors in the same area br Vents are often found on the front back top left side panel and sometimes on the right side panel of the case Regardless of their placement their purpose is either to let cool air into the case or to let hot air out Larger vents usually allow cooling fans to be mounted via surrounding threaded screw holes Newer cases include mountings for larger mm or mm cooling fans for quieter operation than the mm fans formerly common br An I O template or I O plate fits around the motherboard s back panel of external ports Sometimes provided by the case manufacturer it is often replaced by the one that comes with the motherboard br br br Internal access br Accessing the interior components of a modern ATX tower case is done by removing the side panels Looking front to back accessing the motherboard PSU drive bays and most case fan installation points are done by removing the left side panel br Removing the right side panel is done less often to access the space behind the motherboard mounting plate This space is devoted to cable management as cables routed in front of the motherboard may disrupt the flow of air within the case causing increased temperatures BTX an uncontemporary standard has the main side panel on the right side as opposed to the left Some upside down designed ATX cases are also accessed by removing the right side panel door br Alternatively the case may have a single large U shaped cover that saddles the chassis This was ubiquitous in AT tower cases br To prevent the buildup of performance degrading dust within the case many models feature dust filters in front of the air intake fans While the exact method of accessing the front filters depends on the case model it usually requires the removal of the entire front panel Removal of the front panel itself may or may not require the removal of one or both of the side panels If there is any doubt consult the user s manual if possible br Traditionally most computer cases required computer case screws to hold components and panels in place i e motherboard PSU drives and expansion cards From the early s onwards there is a trend towards tool less cases in which components are held together with snap in plastic rails thumbscrews and other methods that do not require tools this facilitates quick assembly and modification of computer hardware and is also cheaper to manufacture br br br Appearance br br Throughout the s most computer cases had simple rectangular shapes and were often painted beige or white with little attention given to the visual design Beige box designs are still found on a large number of budget computers assembled from generic components These class of machines are now known as white box computers even though the cases for these types of machines are now generally colored black or silver instead of beige More modern computer cases include a much wider range of variation in shape color form factor and materials such as brushed aluminium and or tempered glass which are offered with more expensive cases br Case modding is the artistic styling of computer cases often to draw attention to the use of advanced or unusual components Since the early s some cases have included clear side panels or acrylic windows so that users can look inside while it is operating Modded cases may also include colored internal lighting custom paint or liquid cooling systems Some hobbyists build custom cases from raw materials like aluminum steel styrofoam acrylic or wood br Historically cases used CCFL lighting and eventually single color LEDs as strips or in fans to illuminate their interior modern cases use RGB LED lighting instead often incorporated into case fans To improve airflow while allowing RGB fans to be visible many cases as of use metal meshes without any external bays Many include a PSU shroud and vertical gpu mounts Some used to include holes to support external water cooling radiators Cases with side windows may have side fans on the window as well although it is uncommon for cases with glass windows to have side fans br br br Case manufacturers br br Prominent after market case manufacturers include Antec BitFenix Cooler Master Corsair Fractal Design In Win Development Lian Li NZXT Corp Phanteks Rosewill and Thermaltake DIY PC br br br Intrusion detection br Some computer cases include a biased switch push button which connects to the motherboard When the case is opened the switch position changes and the system records this change The system s firmware or BIOS may be configured to report this event the next time it is powered on This physical intrusion detection system may help computer owners detect tampering with their computers However most such systems are quite simple in construction a knowledgeable intruder can open the case or modify its contents without triggering the switch br In the past many tower cases including full tower cases intended to house file servers featured a locking door covering the external drive bays This was a security feature intended to prevent the theft of the CD ROM discs the drives would be holding At the time CD ROM capacity was larger than the hard disks available and many business critical databases were distributed on this media These databases were often very expensive or held proprietary data and hence would be likely targets for casual theft br br br Gallery br br Computer cases br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br
