The Sukhoi Su Russian NATO reporting name Felon is a twin engine stealth multirole fighter aircraft developed by Sukhoi It is the product of the PAK FA Russian prospective aeronautical complex of front line aviation programme which was initiated in as a more modern and affordable alternative to the MFI Mikoyan Project Sukhoi s internal designation for the aircraft is T The Su is the first aircraft in Russian military service designed with stealth technology and is intended to be the basis for a family of stealth combat aircraft br A multirole fighter capable of aerial combat as well as ground and maritime strike the Su incorporates stealth supermaneuverability supercruise integrated avionics and large payload capacity The aircraft is expected to succeed the MiG and Su in the Russian military service and has also been marketed for export The first prototype aircraft flew in but the program experienced a protracted development due to various structural and technical issues that emerged during trials including the destruction of the first production aircraft in a crash before its delivery br After repeated delays the first Su entered service with the Russian Aerospace Forces VKS in December br br br Development br br br Origins br br In the Soviet Union outlined a need for next generation fighter aircraft intended to enter service in the s The programme became the I Russian short for lit Fighter of the s and required the fighter to be multifunctional i e multirole by having substantial ground attack capabilities and would eventually replace the MiG and Su in frontline tactical aviation service Two subsequent projects were designed to meet these requirements the MFI Russian short for lit Multifunctional Frontline Fighter and smaller LFI Russian short for lit Light with conceptual work beginning in Mikoyan was selected for the MFI and began developing its MiG Though not a participant in the MFI Sukhoi started its own programme in to develop technologies for a next generation fighter eventually resulting in the forward swept wing S experimental aircraft later redesignated S and then Su br Due to a lack of funds after the dissolution of the Soviet Union the MFI was repeatedly delayed and the first flight of the MiG prototype did not occur until nine years behind schedule Owing to the high costs the MFI and LFI were eventually cancelled while the Russian Ministry of Defence began work on a new next generation fighter programme in the ministry initiated the PAK FA or I programme with the competition announced in April Because of Russia s financial difficulties the programme aimed to rein in costs by producing a single multirole fifth generation fighter that would replace both the Su and the MiG Further cost saving measures include an intended size in between that of the Su and the MiG and normal takeoff weight considerably smaller than the MiG MFI s tonnes lb and the Su s tonnes lb br Sukhoi s approach to the PAK FA competition differed fundamentally from Mikoyan s whereas Mikoyan proposed for the three design bureaus Mikoyan Sukhoi and Yakovlev to cooperate as a consortium with the winning team leading the design effort Sukhoi s proposal had itself as the lead designer from the beginning and included a joint work agreement that covered the entire development and production cycle from propulsion and avionics suppliers to research facilities Additionally the two companies had differing design philosophies for the aircraft Mikoyan s E was smaller and more affordable with normal takeoff weight of tonnes lb and powered by a pair of Klimov VK M engines with tonnes kN lbf of thrust each In contrast Sukhoi s T would be comparatively larger and more capable with normal takeoff weight goal of tonnes lb and powered by a pair of Lyulka Saturn AL F engines each with maximum thrust in the tonne kN lbf class br In April the Ministry of Defence selected Sukhoi over Mikoyan as the winner of the PAK FA competition and the lead design bureau of the new aircraft In addition to the merits of the proposal Sukhoi s experience in the s was taken into account with the successful development of various Su derivatives and numerous exports ensuring its financial stability According to the Russian Air Force Commander in Chief Vladimir Mikhaylov flight tests were projected to begin in Mikoyan continued to develop its E as the LMFS Russian short for lit Light Multifunctional Frontline Aircraft at its own expense br br br Research and development br The research and development programme of the PAK FA was called Stolitsa Russian lit Capital city In Alexander Davidenko selected as the T s chief designer at Sukhoi The Novosibirsk Aircraft Production Association NAPO and Komsomolsk on Amur Aircraft Production Association KnAAZ would manufacture the new multi role fighter with KnAAZ performing final assembly at Komsomol sk on Amur Following a competition held in the Tekhnokompleks Scientific and Production Center Ramenskoye Instrument Building Design Bureau the Tikhomirov Scientific Research Institute of Instrument Design NIIP the Ural Optical and Mechanical Plant UOMZ in Yekaterinburg the Polet firm in Nizhny Novgorod and the Central Scientific Research Radio Engineering Institute in Moscow were selected for the development of the PAK FA s avionics suite In April NPO Lyulka Saturn now NPO Saturn was signed as the contractor for the AL F engines with the development designation izdeliye br Sukhoi used existing airframes as testbeds for various subsystems and concepts the Su tested internal weapon bays and Su M prototypes served as testbeds for the flight control system and engines To reduce developmental risk and spread out associated costs as well as to bridge the gap with extant fourth generation fighters Sukhoi implemented some of the T s technology and features such as propulsion and certain avionics in an advanced derivative of the Su called the T BM Russian short for lit Major Modernization which was eventually procured by the Russian Ministry of Defence in and entered service as the Su S in br In December the T s conceptual design and shape was complete and approved by the Ministry of Defence government funding of the programme began in and drastically increased in when detailed design was underway On August Russian Air Force Commander in Chief Alexander Zelin was quoted by Russian news agencies that the programme s development stage was complete and construction of the first aircraft for flight testing would begin with three flyable T prototypes planned to be built by In the aircraft s design was officially approved The T was named Su in July br Since the early stages of the PAK FA programme Russia sought after foreign partnerships on the project to increase funding for its development and also secure large export orders On October Russia and India signed a contract for Sukhoi and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited HAL to jointly develop a derivative of the PAK FA called the Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft FGFA In September India and Russia agreed on a preliminary design contract where each country was to invest billion a memorandum of understanding for the preliminary design was signed in December and the development of the FGFA was expected to take years By however the Indian Air Force began voicing concerns over performance cost and workshare India found that the aircraft does not meet its requirements and eventually left the partnership in br br br Prototyping br br The T s maiden flight was repeatedly postponed from early after encountering unspecified technical problems In August Alexander Zelin acknowledged that problems with the engine and in technical research remained unsolved On February Sukhoi general director Mikhail Pogosyan announced that the airframe was almost finished and that the first prototype should be ready by August On August Pogosyan said that the first flight would be by year s end Konstantin Makiyenko deputy head of the Moscow based Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies said that even with delays the aircraft would likely make its first flight by January or February adding that it would take five to ten years for commercial production br Flight testing was further delayed when Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov announced in December that the first trials would begin in The first taxi test was successfully completed on December and the maiden flight of the first prototype aircraft T occurred on January Piloted by Sukhoi test pilot Sergey Bogdan the aircraft s minute maiden flight took place at KnAAPO s Dzemgi Airport in the Russian Far East Construction of the prototypes would progress slower than initially planned by the end of October the test programme had amassed more than flights across five aircraft br br A total of ten flying and three non flying T prototypes would be built for preliminary flight tests and state trials Initially the program was planned to have up to six prototypes before the start of serial production however testing would reveal that the initial prototypes did not have adequate fatigue life with early structural cracks forming in the airframe br The aircraft subsequently underwent a structural redesign with changes including increased composite material usage reinforced airframe to meet full life cycle requirements elongated tail sting and slightly greater wingspan the sixth flyable prototype was the first of the redesigned second stage aircraft with the five initial prototypes consequently considered first stage vehicles and requiring additional structural reinforcements in order to continue flight tests The last two flying prototypes were test articles of production Su aircraft with full mission systems on board While the second stage structural redesign reduced the weight growth from the required strengthening of the first stage design the normal takeoff weight still increased to approximately tonnes lb Issues and accidents during the testing resulted in repeated delays to the programme with the delivery of the first production aircraft pushed back from to br br br Procurement br br The procurement plans for the PAK FA have been considerably scaled back and delayed from original plans In the Ministry of Defence had planned on buying the first aircraft for evaluation after and production standard aircraft after These plans were refined under the State Armament Programme from to GPV with serial production hoped to begin in the Ministry of Defence was planning to acquire aircraft by and another by Additionally export orders for FGFA were expected to begin in br Plans were greatly cut down in as a result of technical obstacles encountered during testing India s unclear commitment to the partnership and Russia s economic downturn due to international sanctions after its annexation of Crimea and the drop in oil prices Russian Deputy Minister of Defence Yury Borisov stated in that the Russian Air Force would slow production reduce its initial order to fighters and operate large fleets of upgraded fourth generation fighters such as the Su S and the Su SM In Borisov stated that the PAK FA would most likely enter service in and be part of the new State Armament Programme from to GPV On June an order for aircraft was agreed while deliveries to the Russian Armed Forces was pushed back again to with the first aircraft planned to join fighter regiments at the Lipetsk Air Center At the same time Borisov praised the Su S stating that it was comparable to the Su except for the stealth features while being more affordable br Due to the substantially higher cost of the Su compared to the Su S and Su SM the design was placed on hold for mass production until the need arises On August during the International Military Technical Forum ARMY the Defence Ministry and Sukhoi signed the first contract for delivery of two serial Su fighters scheduled for and respectively In January the Ministry of Defence announced they hoped to conclude a second contract for more aircraft in br However on May the acquisition plan drastically changed when Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that aircraft would be purchased and delivered to the Aerospace Forces by This came after the negotiations were able to lower the price of the Su and equipment by The contract for the aircraft was formally signed on June at the International Military Technical Forum ARMY The same month General Director of Tactical Missiles Corporation KRTV Boris Obnosov reported a contract for serial production of ammunition for Su fighters was signed and is being inducted br Serial production of the aircraft began in July with the first production aircraft scheduled to be delivered by the end of the year following the crash of the first production aircraft the Russian Aerospace Forces took delivery of the second Su as its first aircraft in December By May four more aircraft were delivered and production has progressed slower than planned with total of six aircraft delivered by end of the year However with the opening of new production line in production of Su increased and in total new aircraft were delivered to Russian Air Force by end of According to Yuri Slyusar another aircraft are expected to be built in what would make the Su the most produced jet fighter in Russia br br br Further developments br In Sukhoi anticipated that the Su could become the basis for a family of combat aircraft for the Russian Aerospace Forces similar to the Su family Under the program name Megapolis Russian lit Megapolis the company is developing a new variant designated Su M that augments the base Su design with improved mission systems reliability and maintenance enhancements incorporation of electromechanical drives and the new NPO Saturn izdeliye or AL F engines br The formal contract was signed in although preliminary work had begun earlier In flight test of the improved variant was planned to begin in with serial production in the mid s The second flying T prototype was used to test the new izdeliye engine starting in the third prototype was configured for teaming tests with the Okhotnik UCAV in Additionally work is underway to make a variant of the aircraft that can operate on aircraft carriers br Sukhoi has also used technology from the Su to produce a mockup of a more affordable lightweight single engine aircraft designated as the LTS Russian short for lit Light Tactical Aircraft At the Moscow Air Show MAKS Sukhoi revealed its LTS mockup named Checkmate which shares many systems with the Su including radar main weapons bay vertical stabilizers and wings br As of international sanctions on Russia s defence industries has made it far more difficult for Russia to source the Western avionics and micro electronics that have been essential components of its advanced fighter and attack aircraft cockpits br The United Aircraft Corporation UAC reported that an upgraded Su aircraft made its first flight on October It is yet unclear whether this airframe represents a Su M as the second stage engine alluding to the Izdeliye was reportedly not mounted The flight was carried out by Russian test pilot Sergey Bogdan br br br Design br br The Su is a fifth generation multirole fighter aircraft and the first operational stealth aircraft for the Russian armed forces In addition to stealth the fighter emphasizes supermaneuverability in all aircraft axes capacious internal payload bays for multirole versatility and advanced sensor systems such as active phased array radar as well as the integration of these systems to achieve high levels of automation br In the Su s design Sukhoi cited the Lockheed Martin F as the baseline for a supermaneuverable stealth fighter but addressed what the bureau considered to be the limitations such as the inability to use thrust vectoring to induce roll and yaw moments a lack of space for weapons bays between the engines resulting in insufficient payload and complications for post stall recovery if thrust vectoring fails In particular Sukhoi considered the F design unsuitable as a multirole fighter required for PAK FA due to the limited payload that was too focused on air to air missiles br The aircraft has a wide blended wing body fuselage with two widely spaced engines and has all moving horizontal and vertical stabilisers with the vertical stabilisers canted for stealth the trapezoid wings have leading edge flaps ailerons and flaperons The aircraft incorporates thrust vectoring and large leading edge root extensions that shift the aerodynamic center forward increasing static instability and maneuverability These extensions have adjustable leading edge vortex controllers LEVCONs designed to control the generated vortices and can provide trim and improve high angle of attack behaviour including a quick stall recovery if the thrust vectoring system fails To air brake the ailerons deflect up while the flaperons deflect down and the vertical stabilisers toe inward to increase drag Although the majority of the structural materials are alloys with aluminum alloys and titanium alloys the aircraft makes extensive use of composites with the material comprising of the structural weight and approximately of the outer surface br Designed from the outset as a multirole aircraft the Su has substantial internal payload capacity that allows the carriage of multiple large air to surface ordnance Weapons are housed in two tandem main weapons bays in the large ventral volume between the widely spaced engine nacelles and smaller side bays with bulged triangular section fairings near the wing root Internal weapons carriage eliminates drag from external stores and enables higher performance compared to external carriage as well as preserving the stealth shaping br The high degree of static instability or relaxed stability in both pitch and yaw advanced KSU flight control system and canted thrust vectoring nozzles make the Su departure resistant and highly maneuverable in all axes and enables the aircraft to perform very high angles of attack maneuvers such as the Pugachev s Cobra and the bell maneuver along with doing flat rotations with little altitude loss The aerodynamics and engines enable it to achieve speeds of Mach and fly supersonic without afterburners or supercruise at Mach giving a significant kinematic advantage and extends the effective range of missiles and bombs over previous generations of aircraft Combined with a high fuel load the fighter has a supersonic range of over km mi more than twice that of the Su An extendable refueling probe is available to further increase its range br br br Stealth br The first aircraft in Russian military service to emphasize stealth the Su employs a variety of methods to reduce its radar signature Similar to other stealth fighters such as the F the aircraft aligns the planform edges to reduce its radar cross section RCS the leading and trailing edges of the wings and control surfaces and the serrated edges of skin panels are carefully angled to reduce the number of directions the radar waves can be reflected Weapons are carried internally in weapons bays within the airframe and antennas are recessed from the surface of the skin to preserve the aircraft s stealthy shape while radar absorbent material RAM coatings absorb radar emissions and reduce the reflection back to the source br The infrared search and track sensor housing is turned backwards when not in use and its rear is also treated with RAM To mask the significant RCS contribution of the engine face the walls of the inlet ducts are coated with RAM and the partial serpentine ducts obscure most of the engines compressor face and inlet guide vanes IGV the remaining exposed engine face is masked by a slanted blocker grid placed in front of the IGV at a distance of times the diameter of the duct similar in principle to the method on the Boeing F A E F br The aircraft canopy is coated with nm thick metal oxide layers with enhanced radar wave absorbing to reduce the radar return of the cockpit by and protect the pilot from the impact of ultraviolet and thermal radiation The production tolerances are significantly tighter than previous Russian fighters in order to improve stealth characteristics br The combined effect of airframe shape and RAM of the production aircraft is estimated to have reduced the aircraft s RCS to a value thirty times smaller than that of the Su Sukhoi s patent for the T stealth features cites an intention to reduce average RCS to approximately to m compared to the Su s RCS of approximately to m The Su s design emphasizes frontal stealth with RCS reducing features most apparent in the forward hemisphere the shaping of the aft fuselage is less optimized for radar stealth compared to American stealth designs such as the F and F likely as a result of cost reduction as well as the Russian doctrine of operating the aircraft within the umbrella of friendly integrated air defense systems br As with other stealth fighters the Su s low observability measures are chiefly effective against super high frequency between and GHz radars usually found on other aircraft The effects of Rayleigh scattering and resonance mean that low frequency radars employed by weather radars and early warning radars are more likely to detect the Su due to its size Such radars are also large susceptible to clutter and are less precise br br br Engines br br The Su is powered by a pair of NPO Lyulka Saturn izdeliye or AL F augmented turbofans The engine is a highly improved and uprated variant of the AL and produces tonnes kN lbf of dry thrust tonnes kN lbf of thrust in afterburner and tonnes kN lbf of thrust in special emergency power The engines have full authority digital engine control FADEC and are integrated into the flight control system to facilitate maneuverability and handling The AL F is closely related to the Lyulka Saturn izdeliye S engine or AL F S used by the Su S with the latter s separate engine control system being the key difference br The aircraft employs thrust vector control TVC where the vectoring nozzles rotational axes are each canted at an angle similar to the nozzle arrangement first employed on the Su MKI and also used on Su S The nozzles themselves vector in only one plane the canting allows roll and yaw moments by vectoring each nozzle differentially thus enabling the aircraft to produce thrust vectoring moments about all three aircraft axes pitch yaw and roll The engine inlet incorporates variable intake ramps for supersonic efficiency and retractable mesh screens to prevent engine damage from foreign object debris ingestion especially when operating in short austere runways In the Indian Air Force openly expressed concerns over the reliability and performance of the AL F during the Moscow Air Show MAKS a Su suffered a compressor stall that forced the aircraft to abort takeoff br The planned Su M will be equipped with a new engine from NPO Saturn in the mid s under the development designation izdeliye and eventually designated AL F The powerplant is designed with an estimated thrust of tonnes kN lbf dry and tonnes kN lbf in afterburner In addition to improved performance reliability and costs compared to the AL F the AL F will also reduce the aircraft s radar and infrared signature with glass fibre plastic IGVs and a new nozzle with serrated flaps br In it was reported that UEC Saturn is planning a sixth generation engine design for the Su As of December all future Su fighters delivered to the Russian Air Force by the United Aircraft Corporation UAC will be powered by the advanced and more powerful Stage engine also called Izdeliye br br br Armament br The Su has two tandem main internal weapon bays each approximately m ft long and m ft wide and two side weapon bays with triangular section fairings under the fuselage near the wing root The main bays have two types of ejection launchers made by Vympel the UVKU L for missiles weighing up to kg lb and the UVKU U for ordnance weighing up to kg lb the side bays use the VPU launch rails br For air to air combat the Su carries four beyond visual range missiles in its two main weapons bays and two short range missiles in the side bays The primary medium range missile is the active radar homing R M izdeliye an upgraded R variant with AESA seeker dual pulse motor and conventional rear fins The short range missile is the infrared homing heat seeking R M izdeliye an upgraded R variant with reduced cross section for internal carriage A clean sheet design short range missile designated K MD izdeliye is being developed to eventually replace the R M For longer ranged applications the Su can carry the izdeliye missile a further development of the R M with shorter control surfaces and updated motor and seeker with two in each main weapons bay the R M could be carried externally br For striking surface targets the aircraft can carry the kg lb KAB or kg lb KAB precision guided bombs in its main bays Internal weapons also include the Kh M air to ground missile Kh U AS Kayak anti ship missile Kh UShK AS Kilter anti radiation missile and Kh originally designated Kh MK cruise missile For missions that do not require stealth the Su can carry stores on its six external hardpoints which can use most Russian tactical fighter weapons New hypersonic missile with characteristics similar to the Kh M Kinzhal ALBM is also being developed for the Su The missile is to have intra body accommodation and smaller dimensions to allow it to be carried inside the Su s main bays br The aircraft has a A K GSh mm autocannon with cartridges mounted internally near the right LEVCON root The weapon has an effective range of m yd against aerial targets and m yd against surface targets br br br Cockpit br The Su has a glass cockpit with no analogue gauges information is displayed on two cm in main multi functional LCD displays similar to the arrangement of the Su S Supplementing the primary display is a smaller multi functional display and digital control panel The cockpit has a wide angle by head up display HUD Primary controls are the joystick and a pair of throttles with all major functions controlled with hands on throttle and stick HOTAS The aircraft uses a two piece canopy with the aft section sliding forward and locking into place The canopy is treated with metallized coatings to reduce the aircraft s radar signature The Su integrated computer system at Chip VM Ya FGU FSC NIISI in Russian br The aircraft uses the NPP Zvezda K D ejection seat and the SOZhE life support system which comprises the anti g and oxygen generating system The pilot is equipped with a ZSh B helmet which mounts the NSTsI digital display system which enhances pilot situational awareness through pupil tracking and allows engagement of targets at high angles off boresight The kg lb oxygen generating system provides the pilot with unlimited oxygen supply The life support system enables pilots to perform g maneuvers for up to seconds at a time while the ejection seat and the new PPK flight suit allows safe ejection at altitudes from to m ft and instrument airspeeds from to km h mph the system also includes a survival kit to assist the pilot after ejection br br br Avionics br br One of the main technical goals of the PAK FA programme is to achieve total integration of avionics systems or sensor fusion increase the pilot s situational awareness and reduce workload Integration of the Su s onboard systems is controlled by an IUS Russian short for lit Information Management System with its computer system developed by GRPZ from Ryazan The main avionics systems are the Sh Russian multifunctional integrated radio electronic system MIRES and the KS Atoll Russian electro optical system In a departure from prior Sukhoi aircraft the IUS systems integration was performed by Sukhoi itself rather than RPKB of Ramenskoye The integrated avionics suite called IMA BK Russian short for lit Integrated Modular Avionics Combat Systems uses fibre optic channels and runs on over million lines of code br br The Sh consists of the N Byelka radar system and L Himalayas electronic countermeasures ECM system Developed by Tikhomirov NIIP Institute the N consists of the main nose mounted N X band active electronically scanned array AESA radar or in Russian nomenclature active phased array radar Russian romanized AFAR short for with T R modules and two side looking N B X band AESA radars with T R modules embedded in the cheeks of the forward fuselage for increased angular coverage The nose antenna is tilted backwards for stealth Moreover the side looking radar could enable the Su to employ beaming tactics while still able to guide its own missile The suite also has two N L L band transceivers on the wing s leading edge flaps that are not only used to handle the N Sh Pokosnik Reaper friend or foe identification system but also for electronic warfare purposes Processing of the X and L band signals by the N YeVS and GRPZ Solo computers enable the system s information to be significantly enhanced The L Himalayas ECM suite made by the Kaluga Research Radio Engineering Institute uses both its own arrays and the N radar system with one of its arrays mounted in the dorsal sting between the two engines Redundant radio telephone communication and encrypted data exchange among various aircraft and also command centers ground and sea based and airborne are provided by the S system developed by Polyot br br The UOMZ KS Atoll electro optical system consisted of the KS V infrared search and track IRST KS O directional infrared counter measures DIRCM KS U ultraviolet missile approach warning sensors MAWS KS P thermal imager for low altitude flight and landing and KS N navigation and targeting pod The IRST turret is mounted on the starboard side in front of the cockpit and can track multiple targets simultaneously When not in use the receiver is turned backwards and its rear is treated with RAM to preserve stealth Additionally the Su is the first fighter to mount a DIRCM system with one turret mounted behind the canopy and another mounted under the cockpit The aircraft is capable of deploying countermeasures such as flares and radar decoys as well as single use programmable ECM transmitters The dispensers for these countermeasures are mounted in the tail boom between the engines br For in flight navigation the Su uses the BINS SP M inertial navigation system developed by Concern Radio Electronic Technologies KRET The system can also integrate with GLONASS and is controlled by the IVS computing system In KRET announced it is developing a multifunctional video processing system called Okhotnik Hunter to increase the Su s target detection range as well as to improve automatic detection and tracking of targets A monitoring system allows real time assessment of the aircraft s condition and predict the remaining life of the composite parts of the aircraft by transmitting information through optical fibers with sensitivity to mechanical influences woven into the structure This allows a more efficient maintenance and repair process The Su could also serve as a testbed for advanced AI and man unmanned teaming technologies intended for use in a future sixth generation fighter program The aircraft has also tested autonomous flight without pilot input br br br Operational history br br br Testing and trials br br Even before the first flight of the T prototype several subsystems were tested on other aircraft for validation and risk reduction an Su M was used to test the AL F engine on January while another tested the KSU flight control system The T prototype conducted its first high speed taxi run on January and had its maiden flight several days later on January First supersonic flight occurred on March at a test range near Komsomolsk on Amur br The Su tests consisted of preliminary trials PI Russian short for conducted by Sukhoi at the Gromov Flight Research Institute LII Russian at Zhukovsky as well as two stages of joint state trials GSI Russian short for conducted by the Ministry of Defence at the th State Flight Test Centre GLITs Russian at Akhtubinsk The completion of GSI resulted in the acceptance of the aircraft s airworthiness and the completion of GSI which tests the mission systems and armaments clears the Su for operational service The preliminary trials and state trials occurred with some overlap with each other br Early flight tests revealed that the initial T design had problems with structural strength and fatigue when the first two prototypes were showcased publicly in MAKS the airframes cracked despite flying with a restrictive g limit which necessitated grounding and structural reinforcing for over a year as well as a second stage structural redesign Of the ten flying and three non flying T prototypes the three non flying prototypes tested static flight loads one each for first stage and second stage structures and avionics integration The first two flying prototypes tested flight characteristics and basic mechanical systems and thus had no mission systems Testing of mission systems such as the radar and electronic warfare suite began from the third prototype onwards with each subsequent aircraft having slight variations in the arrangement of avionics and sensor systems The final pre production aircraft were equipped with full mission systems and tested the overall integrated avionics br By February the first phase of preliminary trials PI had concluded in the same month the th GLITs received its first T at Akhtubinsk for further testing and GSI state trials However severe issues were discovered during PI in addition to the structural issues the aircraft suffered from engine problems including the AL F compressor stall during the MAKS airshow In June the fifth prototype was severely damaged by an in flight fire and written off and an incomplete first stage airframe was finished using parts salvaged from the fifth prototype Both preliminary and state trials were delayed by the fire and the structural redesign the second phase of preliminary trials PI ran from to and mainly used structurally reinforced first stage aircraft while GSI was halted until in order to wait for the updated second stage airframes Armament trials were also delayed with external weapon trials starting in May and internal trials starting in March GSI was finished on February with formal signing in May After more than flights GSI was planned to be completed by but this was pushed to partly because of the crash of the first production aircraft in December br br As the Su is gradually being inducted into Russian military service Sukhoi is testing upgrades for the improved Su M variant First flight of the izdeliye engine occurred on December with the second prototype T bort no Prototypes were also used for unmanned aerial vehicle UAV teaming tests with the Okhotnik UCAV with a video of flight tests released by the Ministry of Defence on September On June TASS with reference to anonymous sources within the military industrial complex reported that a swarm teaming experiment had been conducted with a group of Su s and an Su acting as a command and control aircraft The networked information exchange significantly increases the efficiency of combat missions Reportedly the experiment was conducted in real combat conditions br br br Syrian combat evaluation br On February two Su s performed their first international flight as they were spotted landing at the Russian Khmeimim air base in Syria The aircraft were deployed along with four Sukhoi Su fighters four Sukhoi Su s and one Beriev A AEW C aircraft Three days later two more Su s were reported to have arrived in Syria The deployment was criticised by some experts as overly risky especially after reports of drone attacks at Khmeimim air base as well as having limited value due to the short duration of only several days As the deployment overlapped with Russia s Defender of the Fatherland Day the purpose may have been to support the president s state of the nation speech Additionally deployment of the aircraft in a combat theatre may serve to enhance the aircraft s marketing On March the Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu stated that the two Su s had spent two days in Syria and successfully completed a trials program including combat trials during which parameters of weapons work were monitored On May the Defence Ministry disclosed that during the February deployment to Syria a Su fired a cruise missile in combat likely a Kh MK On November the Defence Ministry posted an extended video of the fighters flights and announced that Su performed flights during its deployment to Syria However the video did not specify when the test flights took place br In December the Chief of the Russian General Staff Valery Gerasimov announced that Russian Defence Ministry had once again tested the Su in Syria and all tasks had been successfully fulfilled br br br Entry into service br On December the Russian Defence Ministry announced that the Su had entered service upon the delivery of the first production aircraft to one of the aviation regiments of the Southern Military District at Lipetsk This initial production batch would be used for military evaluation tactics development and crew conversion training The first operational unit to be equipped with the Su is the rd Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment based in Dzyomgi in the Eastern Military District with deliveries to begin in the colocation of the unit with the KnAAZ aircraft manufacturing plant enables easier support for newly introduced aircraft The first fully operational Su regiment of aircraft is expected to be equipped by br br br Russian invasion of Ukraine br br In May Russian sources claimed that Su fighters were used two or three weeks after the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine striking targets with missiles outside of the zone of activity of Ukrainian air defenses just like other Russian aircraft that are also restricted mainly to Russian airspace br In June RIA Novosti reported four Su s working in a network were used in SEAD role over Ukraine to identify and destroy Ukrainian air defense systems The source also noted that its low radar visibility was demonstrated in combat br On October Russian army general Sergey Surovikin then commander of all Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine claimed that the Su has been used both in air to air and air to ground role during the war in Ukraine and that it has scored kills in both roles Subsequently some Russian sources claimed the Su shot down a Ukrainian Su with a long range R missile However while some Su s are based in Lipetsk and Akhtubinsk air bases for development and trials no hard evidence for claims of combat has surfaced Commercial satellite imagery from late December shows five Su s deployed at Akhtubinsk air base some km from Ukraine br On February a Su escorted by a pair of Su fighters launched a missile strike against Ukrainian targets using a stealthy Kh cruise missile The aircraft operated above the Luhansk Oblast br In May Ukrainian sources reported that Russia intensified the use of Su fighters to strike targets in Ukraine Air strikes were reportedly carried out from the airspace of Kursk Bryansk and occupied Luhansk oblasts utilizing the latest Kh cruise missiles br On June the Ukrainian Main Directorate of Intelligence claimed to have damaged or destroyed two Russian Su fighter jets using drones during a strike on the Akhtubinsk air base in Astrakhan Oblast Several Telegram channels affiliated with the Russian military confirmed the attack and that at least one Su was damaged by shrapnel while also criticizing the lack of protective hangars for the aircraft Further information about the strike was added by the Russian Telegram channel Fighterbomber added that the state of the aircraft is currently being examined which would determine whether or not it can be repaired Maxar Technologies satellite imagery showed a crater next to an Su at Akhtubinsk br br br Potential operators br In the early stages of the PAK FA programme India had planned to be one of the largest foreign customers by procuring the FGFA derivative It originally planned on buying single seat and two seat fighters but later changed it to single seat fighters and later reduced its purchase to fighters by In April India pulled out of the FGFA project which it believed did not meet its requirements for stealth combat avionics radars and sensors by that time Indian Air Force Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa during an interview with Russian Ministry of Defence s official newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda Red Star stated that the Su is currently not being considered for the service but the aircraft can be evaluated once it enters service with the Russian Aerospace Forces The General Director of the United Aircraft Corporation Yuri Slyusar however denied the previous reports saying the topic is not closed and that Russia and India are still discussing the creation of the fifth generation fighter However in October the Indian Air Force Chief of Air Staff RKS Bhadauria stated that the country will not be importing stealth fighters like the Su and will instead focus on indigenous efforts such as the HAL AMCA br Sukhoi states that the main export advantage of the PAK FA is its lower cost than current US fifth generation jet fighters Russia was reported to be offering the PAK FA for South Korea s next generation jet fighter South Korea s Defense Acquisition Program Administration DAPA stated that the Sukhoi PAK FA was a candidate for the Republic of Korea Air Force s next generation fighter F X Phase aircraft however Sukhoi did not submit a bid by the January deadline In Russia offered Brazil participation and joint production in a next generation fighter based on the Su Instead of Russian Su and French Rafale Brazil signed an agreement with the Swedish Saab Group to locally produce Gripen E fighters for the Brazilian Air Force br In May as Turkish participation in the F program was in doubt due to Turkey s procurement of the S missile system CEO of Rostec Sergey Chemezov said that Russia was ready to cooperate with Turkey on the export and local production of the Su On September an Su took part in the Technofest festival held in Istanbul However on February President Erdogan announced that the replacement of the F will not be Russian Su but instead will be the Turkish domestic fifth generation aircraft TF X fighter br On December Algeria signed a contract for aircraft as part of large military deal that also includes the purchase of Su and Su fighters This decision was reportedly taken in summer when Algerian delegation personally inspected the Su at the

acquire the fighters to replace its aging fleet of Su s On July Vietnam announced its intention to buy Su aircraft but it is critical of the aircraft s workmanship br Russia has offered Su E fighters to the United Arab Emirates during IDEX During the Dubai Air Show Chemezov talked about the possibility of localization of portions of the Su supply chain within other countries that decide to buy those jets including United Arab Emirates India or Turkey depends on the capabilities of the defense industrial base of the customer in question However the UAE has refrained from signing a contract with Russia to avoid CAATSA sanctions from the United States br In Iraqi military leadership including its inspector for the Iraqi Ministry of Defence Imad Al Zuhairin stated the country s interest in the Su br As of no Su fighters have been exported Furthermore it has been reported that the export models of the fighter are unlikely to be available until the end of the decade despite production allegedly slated to be increased in The war in Ukraine and the imposed sanctions have also further reduced Russia s ability to continue the development of its advanced fighter jets like the Su and the

of Su for Indian Air Force but India withdrew from the FGFA programme in before any prototype was built The FGFA was intended to be the primary export version of the PAK FA and was to differ in ways with improvements to stealth supercruise sensors networking and combat avionics There were conflicting reports on the FGFA with India detailing numerous improvements over the baseline PAK FA while Mikhail Pogosyan the head of United Aircraft Corporation said in that the PAK FA and the FGFA will use identical onboard systems and avionics India has refrained from signing a deal with Russia citing concerns over shared manufacturing technology and maintenance According to the same source India also had questions about development of the aircraft s stealth radar and supercruise capability at the time and ultimately withdrew from the programme in br br br Other versions br In UAC president Alexei Fedorov has said that any decision on applying fifth generation technologies to produce a smaller fighter comparable to the F must wait until after the development of the PAK FA is completed br A naval version of the Su was proposed for the Project E or Storm supercarrier Models of the aircraft carrier project are showing Su on board with folding wings and stabilators The Su should be able to use the takeoff ramp as well as the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System The draft of the future state armament program GVP for includes the development of a new carrier based fighter based on the Su albeit with deep modifications br The aircraft is used as a testbed for integration with UAVs as well as various subsystems including weapon control and navigation systems being developed for Russia s future sixth generation combat system both in manned and unmanned version In January it was reported the third flyable Su prototype bort no is being used for interaction with the Sukhoi S Okhotnik UCAV and testing of its avionics systems br In July it was officially announced that a two seater variant of the Su was under development to be used for training pilots and for ensuring the control of the Sukhoi S Okhotnik UCAV This variant was also mentioned at the Army forum in August br br br Operators br Russia br Russian Aerospace Forces in service as of December one damaged in June out of a total order of airframes br br br Accidents br On June the fifth flying prototype aircraft T was severely damaged by an engine fire after landing The pilot managed to escape unharmed The aircraft was subsequently written off and its salvageable parts were cannibalized to finish the sixth first stage prototype which was then given the fifth prototype s bort number and its designation changed from T to T R However official accounting still considers the two aircraft to be the same one br On December the first serial Su bort number blue crashed km away from the Dzyomgi Airport Khabarovsk Krai during the final stage of its factory trials due to a control system malfunction The pilot ejected and was recovered by helicopter According to TASS the test flight took place at an altitude of meters when the malfunction occurred causing the airplane to enter a rapid spiral descent When all attempts to stabilize the airplane into a horizontal flight using the manual flight control system failed the pilot ejected at an altitude of meters br br br Specifications Su br br Data from
