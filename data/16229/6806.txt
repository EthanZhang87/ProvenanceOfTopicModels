Computer memory stores information such as data and programs for immediate use in the computer The term memory is often synonymous with the terms RAM main memory or primary storage Archaic synonyms for main memory include core for magnetic core memory and store br Main memory operates at a high speed compared to mass storage which is slower but less expensive per bit and higher in capacity Besides storing opened programs and data being actively processed computer memory serves as a mass storage cache and write buffer to improve both reading and writing performance Operating systems borrow RAM capacity for caching so long as not needed by running software If needed contents of the computer memory can be transferred to storage a common way of doing this is through a memory management technique called virtual memory br Modern computer memory is implemented as semiconductor memory where data is stored within memory cells built from MOS transistors and other components on an integrated circuit There are two main kinds of semiconductor memory volatile and non volatile Examples of non volatile memory are flash memory and ROM PROM EPROM and EEPROM memory Examples of volatile memory are dynamic random access memory DRAM used for primary storage and static random access memory SRAM used mainly for CPU cache br Most semiconductor memory is organized into memory cells each storing one bit or Flash memory organization includes both one bit per memory cell and a multi level cell capable of storing multiple bits per cell The memory cells are grouped into words of fixed word length for example or bits Each word can be accessed by a binary address of N bits making it possible to store N words in the memory br br br History br br In the early s memory technology often permitted a capacity of a few bytes The first electronic programmable digital computer the ENIAC using thousands of vacuum tubes could perform simple calculations involving numbers of ten decimal digits stored in the vacuum tubes br The next significant advance in computer memory came with acoustic delay line memory developed by J Presper Eckert in the early s Through the construction of a glass tube filled with mercury and plugged at each end with a quartz crystal delay lines could store bits of information in the form of sound waves propagating through the mercury with the quartz crystals acting as transducers to read and write bits Delay line memory was limited to a capacity of up to a few thousand bits br Two alternatives to the delay line the Williams tube and Selectron tube originated in both using electron beams in glass tubes as means of storage Using cathode ray tubes Fred Williams invented the Williams tube which was the first random access computer memory The Williams tube was able to store more information than the Selectron tube the Selectron was limited to bits while the Williams tube could store thousands and was less expensive The Williams tube was nevertheless frustratingly sensitive to environmental disturbances br Efforts began in the late s to find non volatile memory Magnetic core memory allowed for recall of memory after power loss It was developed by Frederick W Viehe and An Wang in the late s and improved by Jay Forrester and Jan A Rajchman in the early s before being commercialized with the Whirlwind I computer in Magnetic core memory was the dominant form of memory until the development of MOS semiconductor memory in the s br The first semiconductor memory was implemented as a flip flop circuit in the early s using bipolar transistors Semiconductor memory made from discrete devices was first shipped by Texas Instruments to the United States Air Force in The same year the concept of solid state memory on an integrated circuit IC chip was proposed by applications engineer Bob Norman at Fairchild Semiconductor The first bipolar semiconductor memory IC chip was the SP introduced by IBM in While semiconductor memory offered improved performance over magnetic core memory it remain larger and more expensive and did not displace magnetic core memory until the late s br br br MOS memory br br The invention of the metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor MOSFET enabled the practical use of metal oxide semiconductor MOS transistors as memory cell storage elements MOS memory was developed by John Schmidt at Fairchild Semiconductor in In addition to higher performance MOS semiconductor memory was cheaper and consumed less power than magnetic core memory In J Wood and R Ball of the Royal Radar Establishment proposed digital storage systems that use CMOS complementary MOS memory cells in addition to MOSFET power devices for the power supply switched cross coupling switches and delay line storage The development of silicon gate MOS integrated circuit MOS IC technology by Federico Faggin at Fairchild in enabled the production of MOS memory chips NMOS memory was commercialized by IBM in the early s MOS memory overtook magnetic core memory as the dominant memory technology in the early s br The two main types of volatile random access memory RAM are static random access memory SRAM and dynamic random access memory DRAM Bipolar SRAM was invented by Robert Norman at Fairchild Semiconductor in followed by the development of MOS SRAM by John Schmidt at Fairchild in SRAM became an alternative to magnetic core memory but requires six transistors for each bit of data Commercial use of SRAM began in when IBM introduced their SP SRAM chip for the System Model br Toshiba introduced bipolar DRAM memory cells for its Toscal BC electronic calculator in While it offered improved performance bipolar DRAM could not compete with the lower price of the then dominant magnetic core memory MOS technology is the basis for modern DRAM In Robert H Dennard at the IBM Thomas J Watson Research Center was working on MOS memory While examining the characteristics of MOS technology he found it was possible to build capacitors and that storing a charge or no charge on the MOS capacitor could represent the and of a bit while the MOS transistor could control writing the charge to the capacitor This led to his development of a single transistor DRAM memory cell In Dennard filed a patent for a single transistor DRAM memory cell based on MOS technology This led to the first commercial DRAM IC chip the Intel in October Synchronous dynamic random access memory SDRAM later debuted with the Samsung KM SL chip in br The term memory is also often used to refer to non volatile memory including read only memory ROM through modern flash memory Programmable read only memory PROM was invented by Wen Tsing Chow in while working for the Arma Division of the American Bosch Arma Corporation In Dawon Kahng and Simon Sze of Bell Labs proposed that the floating gate of a MOS semiconductor device could be used for the cell of a reprogrammable ROM which led to Dov Frohman of Intel inventing EPROM erasable PROM in EEPROM electrically erasable PROM was developed by Yasuo Tarui Yutaka Hayashi and Kiyoko Naga at the Electrotechnical Laboratory in Flash memory was invented by Fujio Masuoka at Toshiba in the early s Masuoka and colleagues presented the invention of NOR flash in and then NAND flash in Toshiba commercialized NAND flash memory in br Developments in technology and economies of scale have made possible so called very large memory VLM computers br br br Volatile memory br br Volatile memory is computer memory that requires power to maintain the stored information Most modern semiconductor volatile memory is either static RAM SRAM or dynamic RAM DRAM DRAM dominates for desktop system memory SRAM is used for CPU cache SRAM is also found in small embedded systems requiring little memory br SRAM retains its contents as long as the power is connected and may use a simpler interface but commonly uses six transistors per bit Dynamic RAM is more complicated for interfacing and control needing regular refresh cycles to prevent losing its contents but uses only one transistor and one capacitor per bit allowing it to reach much higher densities and much cheaper per bit costs br br br Non volatile memory br br Non volatile memory can retain the stored information even when not powered Examples of non volatile memory include read only memory flash memory most types of magnetic computer storage devices e g hard disk drives floppy disks and magnetic tape optical discs and early computer storage methods such as magnetic drum paper tape and punched cards br Non volatile memory technologies under development include ferroelectric RAM programmable metallization cell Spin transfer torque magnetic RAM SONOS resistive random access memory racetrack memory Nano RAM D XPoint and millipede memory br br br Semi volatile memory br A third category of memory is semi volatile The term is used to describe a memory that has some limited non volatile duration after power is removed but then data is ultimately lost A typical goal when using a semi volatile memory is to provide the high performance and durability associated with volatile memories while providing some benefits of non volatile memory br For example some non volatile memory types experience wear when written A worn cell has increased volatility but otherwise continues to work Data locations which are written frequently can thus be directed to use worn circuits As long as the location is updated within some known retention time the data stays valid After a period of time without update the value is copied to a less worn circuit with longer retention Writing first to the worn area allows a high write rate while avoiding wear on the not worn circuits br As a second example an STT RAM can be made non volatile by building large cells but doing so raises the cost per bit and power requirements and reduces the write speed Using small cells improves cost power and speed but leads to semi volatile behavior In some applications the increased volatility can be managed to provide many benefits of a non volatile memory for example by removing power but forcing a wake up before data is lost or by caching read only data and discarding the cached data if the power off time exceeds the non volatile threshold br The term semi volatile is also used to describe semi volatile behavior constructed from other memory types such as nvSRAM which combines SRAM and a non volatile memory on the same chip where an external signal copies data from the volatile memory to the non volatile memory but if power is removed before the copy occurs the data is lost Another example is battery backed RAM which uses an external battery to power the memory device in case of external power loss If power is off for an extended period of time the battery may run out resulting in data loss br br br Management br br Proper management of memory is vital for a computer system to operate properly Modern operating systems have complex systems to properly manage memory Failure to do so can lead to bugs or slow performance br br br Bugs br Improper management of memory is a common cause of bugs and security vulnerabilities including the following types br br A memory leak occurs when a program requests memory from the operating system and never returns the memory when it is done with it A program with this bug will gradually require more and more memory until the program fails as the operating system runs out br A segmentation fault results when a program tries to access memory that it does not have permission to access Generally a program doing so will be terminated by the operating system br A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes data to the end of its allocated space and then continues to write data beyond this to memory that has been allocated for other purposes This may result in erratic program behavior including memory access errors incorrect results a crash or a breach of system security They are thus the basis of many software vulnerabilities and can be maliciously exploited br br br Virtual memory br br Virtual memory is a system where physical memory is managed by the operating system typically with assistance from a memory management unit which is part of many modern CPUs It allows multiple types of memory to be used For example some data can be stored in RAM while other data is stored on a hard drive e g in a swapfile functioning as an extension of the cache hierarchy This offers several advantages Computer programmers no longer need to worry about where their data is physically stored or whether the user s computer will have enough memory The operating system will place actively used data in RAM which is much faster than hard disks When the amount of RAM is not sufficient to run all the current programs it can result in a situation where the computer spends more time moving data from RAM to disk and back than it does accomplishing tasks this is known as thrashing br br br Protected memory br br Protected memory is a system where each program is given an area of memory to use and is prevented from going outside that range If the operating system detects that a program has tried to alter memory that does not belong to it the program is terminated or otherwise restricted or redirected This way only the offending program crashes and other programs are not affected by the misbehavior whether accidental or intentional Use of protected memory greatly enhances both the reliability and security of a computer system br Without protected memory it is possible that a bug in one program will alter the memory used by another program This will cause that other program to run off of corrupted memory with unpredictable results If the operating system s memory is corrupted the entire computer system may crash and need to be rebooted At times programs intentionally alter the memory used by other programs This is done by viruses and malware to take over computers It may also be used benignly by desirable programs which are intended to modify other programs debuggers for example to insert breakpoints or hooks br br br See also br br Memory geometry br Memory hierarchy br Memory organization br Processor registers store data but normally are not considered as memory since they
