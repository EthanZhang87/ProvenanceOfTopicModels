A gamepad is a type of video game controller held in two hands where the fingers especially thumbs are used to provide input They are typically the main input device for video game consoles br br br Features br br Some common additions to the standard pad include shoulder buttons also called bumpers and triggers placed along the edges of the pad shoulder buttons are usually digital i e merely on off while triggers are usually analog centrally placed start select and home buttons and an internal motor to provide force feedback Analog triggers like that of the GameCube controller are pressure sensitive and games can read in the amount of pressure applied to one to control the intensity of a certain action such as how forceful water is to be sprayed in Super Mario Sunshine br There are programmable joysticks that can emulate keyboard input Generally they have been made to circumvent the lack of joystick support in some computer games e g the Belkin Nostromo SpeedPad n There are several programs that emulate keyboard and mouse input with a gamepad such as the free and open source cross platform software antimicro Enjoy or proprietary commercial solutions such as JoyToKey Xpadder and Pinnacle Game Profiler br br br History br br br Analog joysticks br The video game Spacewar initially used toggle switches built into the computer readout display to control the game These switches were awkward and uncomfortable to use so Alan Kotok and Bob Saunders built and wired in a detached control device for the game This device has been called the earliest gamepad br br br Entry into the mass market br It would take many years for the gamepad to rise to prominence as during the s and the early s joysticks and paddles were the dominant video game controllers though several Atari joystick port compatible pushbutton controllers were also available The third generation of video games saw many major changes and the eminence of gamepads in the video game market br Nintendo developed a gamepad device for directional inputs a D pad with a cross design for their Donkey Kong handheld game This design would be incorporated into their Game Watch series and console controllers such as the standard NES controller Though developed because they were more compact than joysticks and thus more appropriate for handheld games D pads were soon found by developers to be more comfortable to use than joysticks The D pad soon became a ubiquitous element on console gamepads though to avoid infringing on Nintendo s patent most controller manufacturers use a cross in a circle shape for the D pad instead of a simple cross br br br Continued refinements br The original Sega Genesis Mega Drive control pad has three face buttons but a six button pad was later released The SNES controller also featured six action buttons with four face buttons arranged in a diamond formation and two shoulder buttons positioned to be used with the index fingers a design which has been imitated by most controllers since The inclusion of six action buttons was influenced by the popularity of the Street Fighter arcade series which utilized six buttons For most of the s and early s analog joysticks were the predominant form of gaming controller for PCs while console gaming controllers were mostly digital This changed in when all three major consoles introduced an optional analog control The Sony Dual Analog Controller had twin convex analog thumbsticks the Sega Saturn D Control Pad had a single analog thumbstick and the Nintendo controller combined digital and analog controllers in a single body starting a trend to have both an analog stick and a d pad br Despite these changes gamepads essentially continued to follow the template set by the NES controller a horizontally oriented controller with two or more action buttons positioned for use with the right thumb and a directional pad positioned for use with the left thumb br br br Three dimensional control br Though three dimensional games rose to prominence in the mid s controllers continued to mostly operate on two dimensional principles in order to move with six degrees of freedom players would have to hold down a button to toggle the axis on which the directional pad operates rather than being able to control movement along all three axes at once One of the first gaming consoles the Fairchild Channel F did have a controller which allowed six degrees of freedom but the processing limitations of the console itself prevented there from being any software to take advantage of this ability In Logitech introduced the CyberMan the first practical six degrees of freedom controller due to its high price poor build quality and limited software support it sold poorly Industry insiders blame the CyberMan s high profile and costly failure for the gaming industry s lack of interest in developing D control over the next several years br br The Wii Remote is shaped like a television remote control and contains tilt sensors and three dimensional pointing which allows the system to understand all directions of movement and rotation back and forth around the pitch roll and yaw axes The controller is also multifunctional and includes an expansion bay which can be used with different types of peripherals An analog stick peripheral called Nunchuk also contains an accelerometer but unlike the Wii Remote it lacks any pointer functionality br br br Uses br Gamepads are also available for personal computers Examples of PC gamepads include the Asus Eee Stick the Gravis PC the Microsoft SideWinder and Saitek Cyborg range and the Steam Controller Third party USB adapters and software can be employed to utilize console gamepads on PCs the DualShock DualShock DualSense Wii Remote and Joy Con can be used with third party software on systems with Bluetooth functionality with USB additionally usable on DualShock DualShock and DualSense Xbox and Xbox One controllers are officially supported on Windows with Microsoft supplied drivers a dongle can be used to connect them wirelessly or the controller can be connected directly to the computer over USB wired versions of Xbox controllers were marketed by Microsoft as PC gamepads while the Xbox One controller can be connected to a PC via its Micro USB slot br br br Non gaming use br Gamepads or devices closely modelled on them are sometimes used for controlling real machinery and vehicles as they are familiar to users and in the case of actual gamepads provide an off the shelf solution The US Army and US Navy use Xbox controllers br for operating devices and the British Army uses a device modelled on gamepads to operate systems on the Challenger main battle tank br The ill fated Titan submersible used a gamepad for control br br br See also br Computer keyboard br Computer mouse br Game port br Racing wheel br br br
