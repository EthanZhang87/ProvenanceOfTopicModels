Project Gemini IPA was the second United States human spaceflight program to fly Conducted after the first American crewed space program Project Mercury while the Apollo program was still in early development Gemini was conceived in and concluded in The Gemini spacecraft carried a two astronaut crew Ten Gemini crews and individual astronauts flew low Earth orbit LEO missions during and br Gemini s objective was the development of space travel techniques to support the Apollo mission to land astronauts on the Moon In doing so it allowed the United States to catch up and overcome the lead in human spaceflight capability the Soviet Union had obtained in the early years of the Space Race by demonstrating mission endurance up to just under days longer than the eight days required for a round trip to the Moon methods of performing extravehicular activity EVA without tiring and the orbital maneuvers necessary to achieve rendezvous and docking with another spacecraft This left Apollo free to pursue its prime mission without spending time developing these techniques br All Gemini flights were launched from Launch Complex LC at Cape Kennedy Air Force Station in Florida Their launch vehicle was the Titan II GLV a modified intercontinental ballistic missile Gemini was the first program to use the newly built Mission Control Center at the Houston Manned Spacecraft Center for flight control The project also used the Agena target vehicle a modified Atlas Agena upper stage used to develop and practice orbital rendezvous and docking techniques br The astronaut corps that supported Project Gemini included the Mercury Seven The New Nine and The Fourteen During the program three astronauts died in air crashes during training including both members of the prime crew for Gemini The backup crew flew this mission br Gemini was robust enough that the United States Air Force planned to use it for the Manned Orbital Laboratory MOL program which was later canceled Gemini s chief designer Jim Chamberlin also made detailed plans for cislunar and lunar landing missions in late He believed Gemini spacecraft could fly in lunar operations before Project Apollo and cost less NASA s administration did not approve those plans In Lukas Bingham proposed a Big Gemini that could have been used to shuttle up to astronauts to the planned space stations in the Apollo Applications Project AAP The only AAP project funded was Skylab The first American space station which used existing spacecraft and hardware thereby eliminating the need for Big Gemini br br br Pronunciation br The constellation for which the project was named is commonly pronounced the last syllable rhyming with eye However staff of the Manned Spacecraft Center including the astronauts tended to pronounce the name rhyming with knee NASA s public affairs office then issued a statement in declaring Jeh mih nee the official pronunciation Gus Grissom acting as Houston capsule communicator when Ed White performed his spacewalk on Gemini is heard on flight recordings pronouncing the spacecraft s call sign Jeh mih nee and the NASA pronunciation is used in the film First Man br br br Program origins and objectives br The Apollo program was conceived in early as a three man spacecraft to follow Project Mercury Jim Chamberlin the head of engineering at the Space Task Group STG was assigned in February to start working on a bridge program between Mercury and Apollo He presented two initial versions of a two man spacecraft then designated Mercury Mark II at a NASA retreat at Wallops Island in March Scale models were shown in July at the McDonnell Aircraft Corporation s offices in St Louis br After Apollo was chartered to land men on the Moon by President John F Kennedy on May it became evident to NASA officials that a follow on to the Mercury program was required to develop certain spaceflight capabilities in support of Apollo NASA approved the two man two vehicle program rechristened Project Gemini Latin for twins in reference to the third constellation of the Zodiac with its twin stars Castor and Pollux on December McDonnell Aircraft was contracted to build it on December The program was publicly announced on January with these major objectives br br To demonstrate endurance of humans and equipment in spaceflight for extended periods at least eight days required for a Moon landing to a maximum of two weeks br To effect rendezvous and docking with another vehicle and to maneuver the combined spacecraft using the propulsion system of the target vehicle br To demonstrate Extra Vehicular Activity EVA or space walks outside the protection of the spacecraft and to evaluate the astronauts ability to perform tasks there br To perfect techniques of atmospheric reentry and touchdown at a pre selected location on land br br br Team br Chamberlin designed the Gemini capsule which carried a crew of two He was previously the chief aerodynamicist on Avro Canada s CF Arrow fighter interceptor program Chamberlin joined NASA along with senior Avro engineers after cancellation of the Canadian Arrow program and became head of the U S Space Task Group s engineering division in charge of Gemini The prime contractor was McDonnell Aircraft Corporation which was also the prime contractor for the Project Mercury capsule br Astronaut Gus Grissom was heavily involved in the development and design of the Gemini spacecraft What other Mercury astronauts dubbed Gusmobile was so designed around Grissom s body that when NASA discovered in that of astronauts would not fit in the spacecraft the interior had to be redesigned Grissom wrote in his posthumous book Gemini that the realization of Project Mercury s end and the unlikelihood of his having another flight in that program prompted him to focus all his efforts on the upcoming Gemini program br The Gemini program was managed by the Manned Spacecraft Center located in Houston Texas under direction of the Office of Manned Space Flight NASA Headquarters Washington D C Dr George E Mueller Associate Administrator of NASA for Manned Space Flight served as acting director of the Gemini program William C Schneider Deputy Director of Manned Space Flight for Mission Operations served as mission director on all Gemini flights beginning with Gemini A br Guenter Wendt was a McDonnell engineer who supervised launch preparations for both the Mercury and Gemini programs and would go on to do the same when the Apollo program launched crews His team was responsible for completion of the complex pad close out procedures just prior to spacecraft launch and he was the last person the astronauts would see prior to closing the hatch The astronauts appreciated his taking absolute authority over and responsibility for the condition of the spacecraft and developed a good humored rapport with him br br br Spacecraft br br NASA selected McDonnell Aircraft which had been the prime contractor for the Project Mercury capsule in to build the Gemini capsule the first of which was delivered in The spacecraft was feet inches m long and feet m wide with a launch weight varying from to pounds to kg br The Gemini crew capsule referred to as the Reentry Module was essentially an enlarged version of the Mercury capsule Unlike Mercury the retrorockets electrical power propulsion systems oxygen and water were located in a detachable Adapter Module behind the Reentry Module which would burn up on reentry A major design improvement in Gemini was to locate all internal spacecraft systems in modular components which could be independently tested and replaced when necessary without removing or disturbing other already tested components br br br Reentry module br Many components in the capsule itself were reachable through their own small access doors Unlike Mercury Gemini used completely solid state electronics and its modular design made it easy to repair br Gemini s emergency launch escape system did not use an escape tower powered by a solid fuel rocket but instead used aircraft style ejection seats The tower was heavy and complicated and NASA engineers reasoned that they could do away with it as the Titan II s hypergolic propellants would burn immediately on contact A Titan II booster explosion had a smaller blast effect and flame than on the cryogenically fueled Atlas and Saturn Ejection seats were sufficient to separate the astronauts from a malfunctioning launch vehicle At higher altitudes where the ejection seats could not be used the astronauts would return to Earth inside the spacecraft which would separate from the launch vehicle br The main proponent of using ejection seats was Chamberlin who had never liked the Mercury escape tower and wished to use a simpler alternative that would also reduce weight He reviewed several films of Atlas and Titan II ICBM failures which he used to estimate the approximate size of a fireball produced by an exploding launch vehicle and from this he gauged that the Titan II would produce a much smaller explosion thus the spacecraft could get away with ejection seats br br Maxime Faget the designer of the Mercury LES was on the other hand less than enthusiastic about this setup Aside from the possibility of the ejection seats seriously injuring the astronauts they would also only be usable for about seconds after liftoff by which point the booster would be attaining Mach speed and ejection would no longer be possible He was also concerned about the astronauts being launched through the Titan s exhaust plume if they ejected in flight and later added The best thing about Gemini was that they never had to make an escape br The Gemini ejection system was never tested with the Gemini cabin pressurized with pure oxygen as it was prior to launch In January the fatal Apollo fire demonstrated that pressurizing a spacecraft with pure oxygen created an extremely dangerous fire hazard In a oral history astronaut Thomas P Stafford commented on the Gemini launch abort in December when he and command pilot Wally Schirra nearly ejected from the spacecraft br br So it turns out what we would have seen had we had to do that would have been two Roman candles going out because we were or psi pure oxygen soaking in that for an hour and a half You remember the tragic fire we had at the Cape Jesus with that fire going off and that it would have burned the suits Everything was soaked in oxygen So thank God That was another thing NASA never tested it under the conditions that they would have had if they would have had to eject They did have some tests at China Lake where they had a simulated mock up of Gemini capsule but what they did is fill it full of nitrogen They didn t have it filled full of oxygen in the sled test they had br Gemini was the first astronaut carrying spacecraft to include an onboard computer the Gemini Guidance Computer to facilitate management and control of mission maneuvers This computer sometimes called the Gemini Spacecraft On Board Computer OBC was very similar to the Saturn Launch Vehicle Digital Computer The Gemini Guidance Computer weighed pounds kg Its core memory had addresses each containing a bit word composed of three bit syllables All numeric data was bit two s complement integers sometimes used as fixed point numbers either stored in the first two syllables of a word or in the accumulator Instructions always with a bit opcode and bits of operand could go in any syllable br Unlike Mercury Gemini used in flight radar and an artificial horizon similar to those used in the aviation industry Like Mercury Gemini used a joystick to give the astronauts manual control of yaw pitch and roll Gemini added control of the spacecraft s translation forward backward up down and sideways with a pair of T shaped handles one for each crew member Translation control enabled rendezvous and docking and crew control of the flight path The same controller types were also used in the Apollo spacecraft br br The original intention for Gemini was to land on solid ground instead of at sea using a Rogallo wing rather than a parachute with the crew seated upright controlling the forward motion of the craft To facilitate this the airfoil did not attach just to the nose of the craft but to an additional attachment point for balance near the heat shield This cord was covered by a strip of metal which ran between the twin hatches This design was ultimately dropped and parachutes were used to make a sea landing as in Mercury The capsule was suspended at an angle closer to horizontal so that a side of the heat shield contacted the water first This eliminated the need for the landing bag cushion used in the Mercury capsule br br br Adapter module br The adapter module in turn was separated into a Retro module and an Equipment module br br br Retro module br The Retro module contained four solid fuel TE M Star E retrorockets each spherical in shape except for its rocket nozzle which were structurally attached to two beams that reached across the diameter of the retro module crossing at right angles in the center Re entry began with the retrorockets firing one at a time Abort procedures at certain periods during lift off would cause them to fire at the same time thrusting the Descent module away from the Titan rocket br br br Equipment module br Gemini was equipped with an Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System OAMS containing sixteen thrusters for translation control in all three perpendicular axes forward backward left right up down in addition to attitude control pitch yaw and roll angle orientation as in Mercury Translation control allowed changing orbital inclination and altitude necessary to perform space rendezvous with other craft and docking with the Agena Target Vehicle ATV with its own rocket engine which could be used to perform greater orbit changes br Early short duration missions had their electrical power supplied by batteries later endurance missions used the first fuel cells in crewed spacecraft br Gemini was in some regards more advanced than Apollo because the latter program began almost a year earlier It became known as a pilot s spacecraft due to its assortment of jet fighter like features in no small part due to Gus Grissom s influence over the design and it was at this point where the US crewed space program clearly began showing its superiority over that of the Soviet Union with long duration flight rendezvous and extravehicular capability The Soviet Union during this period was developing the Soyuz spacecraft intended to take cosmonauts to the Moon but political and technical problems began to get in the way leading to the ultimate end of their crewed lunar program br br br Launch vehicle br br The Titan II debuted in as the Air Force s second generation ICBM to replace the Atlas By using hypergolic fuels it could be stored longer and be easily readied for launch in addition to being a simpler design with fewer components The only caveat was the propellant mix nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine were extremely toxic compared to the Atlas liquid oxygen RP However the Titan had considerable difficulty being man rated due to early problems with pogo oscillation The launch vehicle used a radio guidance system that was unique to launches from Cape Kennedy br br br Astronauts br br Deke Slayton as director of flight crew operations had primary responsibility for assigning crews for the Gemini program Each flight had a primary crew and backup crew and the backup crew would rotate to primary crew status three flights later Slayton intended for first choice of mission commands to be given to the four remaining active astronauts of the Mercury Seven Alan Shepard Grissom Cooper and Schirra John Glenn had retired from NASA in January and Scott Carpenter who was blamed by some in NASA management for the problematic reentry of Aurora was on leave to participate in the Navy s SEALAB project and was grounded from flight in July due to an arm injury sustained in a motorbike accident Slayton himself continued to be grounded due to a heart problem As for Shepard during training on the Gemini Project his inner ear deficiency due to Meni re s Disease would effectively ground him as well and keep him removed from the flight roster until he underwent corrective surgery and would not fly on Gemini at all but return to flight with Apollo as Commander br Titles used for the left hand command and right hand pilot seat crew positions were taken from the U S Air Force pilot ratings Command Pilot and Pilot Sixteen astronauts flew on crewed Gemini missions br br br Crew selection br In late Slayton selected Shepard and Stafford for Gemini McDivitt and White for Gemini and Schirra and Young for Gemini which was to be the first Agena rendezvous mission The backup crew for Gemini was Grissom and Borman who were also slated for Gemini to be the first long duration mission Finally Conrad and Lovell were assigned as the backup crew for Gemini br Delays in the production of the Agena Target Vehicle caused the first rearrangement of the crew rotation The Schirra and Young mission was bumped to Gemini and they became the backup crew for Shepard and Stafford Grissom and Borman then had their long duration mission assigned to Gemini br The second rearrangement occurred when Shepard developed M ni re s disease an inner ear problem Grissom was then moved to command Gemini Slayton felt that Young was a better personality match with Grissom and switched Stafford and Young Finally Slayton tapped Cooper to command the long duration Gemini Again for reasons of compatibility he moved Conrad from backup commander of Gemini to pilot of Gemini and Borman to backup command of Gemini Finally he assigned Armstrong and Elliot See to be the backup crew for Gemini br The third rearrangement of crew assignment occurred when Slayton felt that See wasn t up to the physical demands of EVA on Gemini He reassigned See to be the prime commander of Gemini and put Scott as pilot of Gemini and Charles Bassett as the pilot of Gemini br The fourth and final rearrangement of the Gemini crew assignment occurred after the deaths of See and Bassett when their trainer jet crashed coincidentally into a McDonnell building which held their Gemini capsule in St Louis The backup crew of Stafford and Cernan was then moved up to the new prime crew of Gemini A Lovell and Aldrin were moved from being the backup crew of Gemini to be the backup crew of Gemini This cleared the way through the crew rotation for Lovell and Aldrin to become the prime crew of Gemini br Along with the deaths of Grissom White and Roger Chaffee in the fire of Apollo this final arrangement helped determine the makeup of the first seven Apollo crews and who would be in position for a chance to be the first to walk on the Moon br br br Missions br br In April and January two Gemini missions were flown without crews to test systems and the heat shield These were followed by flights with crews in and All were launched by Titan II launch vehicles Some highlights from the Gemini program br br Gemini Grissom and Young was the first crewed Gemini mission first multi crewed US mission and the first crewed spacecraft to use thrusters to change its orbit br On Gemini Ed White became the first American to make an extravehicular activity EVA or spacewalk on June br Gemini August demonstrated the day endurance necessary for an Apollo lunar mission with the first use of fuel cells to generate its electrical power br Gemini A accomplished the first space rendezvous with its sister craft Gemini in December with Gemini setting a day endurance record for its flight br Gemini achieved the first space docking with an uncrewed Agena target vehicle br Gemini established that radiation at high altitude was not a problem further demonstrated the ability to rendezvous with a passive object and was the first Gemini mission to fire the Agena s own rocket Michael Collins would be the first person to meet another spacecraft in orbit during his second successful EVA br Gemini first direct ascent first orbit rendezvous with an Agena Target Vehicle docking with it hour minutes after launch Set a crewed Earth orbital altitude record of nautical miles km in September using the Agena target vehicle s propulsion system This record still stands as of br On Gemini Edwin Buzz Aldrin became the first space traveler to prove that useful work EVA could be done outside a spacecraft without life threatening exhaustion due to newly implemented footholds handholds and scheduled rest periods br Rendezvous in orbit is not a straightforward maneuver Should a spacecraft increase its speed to catch up with another the result is that it goes into a higher and slower orbit and the distance thereby increases The right procedure is to go to a lower orbit first and which increases relative speed and then approach the target spacecraft from below and decrease orbital speed to meet it To practice these maneuvers special rendezvous and docking simulators were built for the astronauts br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Gemini Titan launches and serial numbers br br The Gemini Titan II launch vehicle was adapted by NASA from the U S Air Force Titan II ICBM Similarly the Mercury Atlas launch vehicle had been adapted from the USAF Atlas missile The Gemini Titan II rockets were assigned Air Force serial numbers which were painted in four places on each Titan II on opposite sides on each of the first and second stages USAF crews maintained Launch Complex and prepared and launched all of the Gemini Titan II launch vehicles Data and experience operating the Titans was of value to both the U S Air Force and NASA br The USAF serial numbers assigned to the Gemini Titan launch vehicles are given in the tables above Fifteen Titan IIs were ordered in so the serial is XXX but only XXX is painted on the Titan II The order for the last three of the launch vehicles was canceled on July and they were never built Serial numbers were however assigned to them prospectively GLV GLV and GLV br br br Program cost br From to Gemini cost billion in dollars billion in In January a NASA report to the US Congress estimating the costs for Mercury Gemini and Apollo through the first crewed Moon landing included billion for Gemini million for spacecraft million for launch vehicles and million for

applications br br br Advanced Gemini br br McDonnell Aircraft the main contractor for Mercury and Gemini was also one of the original bidders on the prime contract for Apollo but lost out to North American Aviation McDonnell later sought to extend the Gemini program by proposing a derivative which could be used to fly a cislunar mission and even achieve a crewed lunar landing earlier and at less cost than Apollo but these proposals were rejected by NASA br A range of applications were considered for Advanced Gemini missions including military flights space station crew and logistics delivery and lunar flights The Lunar proposals ranged from reusing the docking systems developed for the Agena Target Vehicle on more powerful upper stages such as the Centaur which could propel the spacecraft to the Moon to complete modifications of the Gemini to enable it to land on the lunar surface Its applications would have ranged from crewed lunar flybys before Apollo was ready to providing emergency shelters or rescue for stranded Apollo crews or even replacing the Apollo program br Some of the Advanced Gemini proposals used off the shelf Gemini spacecraft unmodified from the original program while others featured modifications to allow the spacecraft to carry more crew dock with space stations visit the Moon and perform other mission objectives Other modifications considered included the addition of wings or a parasail to the spacecraft in order to enable it to make a horizontal landing br br br Big Gemini br br Big Gemini or Big G was another proposal by McDonnell Douglas made in August It was intended to provide large capacity all purpose access to space including missions that ultimately used Apollo or the Space Shuttle br The study was performed to generate a preliminary definition of a logistic spacecraft derived from Gemini that would be used to resupply an orbiting space station Land landing at a preselected site and refurbishment and reuse were design requirements Two baseline spacecraft were defined a nine man minimum modification version of the Gemini B called Min Mod Big G and a man advanced concept having the same exterior geometry but with new state of the art subsystems called Advanced Big G Three launch vehicles Saturn IB Titan IIIM and Saturn INT S IC S IVB were investigated for use with the spacecraft br br br Military applications br The Air Force had an interest in the Gemini system and decided to use its own modification of the spacecraft as the crew vehicle for the Manned Orbital Laboratory To this end the Gemini spacecraft was refurbished and flown again atop a mockup of the MOL sent into space by a Titan IIIC This was the first time a spacecraft went into space twice br The USAF also thought of adapting the Gemini spacecraft for military applications such as crude observation of the ground no specialized reconnaissance camera could be carried and practicing making rendezvous with suspicious satellites This project was called Blue Gemini The USAF did not like the fact that Gemini would have to be recovered by the US Navy so they intended for Blue Gemini eventually to use the airfoil and land on three skids carried over from the original design of Gemini br At first some within NASA welcomed sharing of the cost with the USAF but it was later agreed that NASA was better off operating Gemini by itself Blue Gemini was canceled in by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara who decided the NASA Gemini flights could conduct necessary military experiments MOL was canceled by Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird in when it was determined that uncrewed spy satellites could perform the same functions much more cost effectively br br br In media br Two Gemini capsules codenamed Jupiter instead of Gemini are featured in the plot of the James Bond film You Only Live Twice br A modified one person Gemini capsule is used to send an astronaut played by James Caan to the Moon in the film Countdown br Gemini missions and feature in the first episode of the HBO series From the Earth to the Moon br Like other US space programs Gemini was covered in the PBS series Spaceflight br Some aspects of the Gemini program relating to astronaut Neil Armstrong were touched upon in the film First Man br Many episodes of the television show I Dream of Jeannie featured launch pad and launch
