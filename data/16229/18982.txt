Muscular dystrophies MD are a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of rare neuromuscular diseases that cause progressive weakness and breakdown of skeletal muscles over time The disorders differ as to which muscles are primarily affected the degree of weakness how fast they worsen and when symptoms begin Some types are also associated with problems in other organs br Over different disorders are classified as muscular dystrophies Of those Duchenne muscular dystrophy DMD accounts for approximately of cases and affects males beginning around the age of four Other relatively common muscular dystrophies include Becker muscular dystrophy facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy whereas limb girdle muscular dystrophy and congenital muscular dystrophy are themselves groups of several usually extremely rare genetic disorders br Muscular dystrophies are caused by mutations in genes usually those involved in making muscle proteins The muscle protein dystrophin is in most muscle cells and works to strengthen the muscle fibers and protect them from injury as muscles contract and relax It links the muscle membrane to the thin muscular filaments within the cell Dystrophin is an integral part of the muscular structure An absence of dystrophin can cause impairments healthy muscle tissue can be replaced by fibrous tissue and fat causing an inability to generate force Respiratory and cardiac complications can occur as well These mutations are either inherited from parents or may occur spontaneously during early development Muscular dystrophies may be X linked recessive autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant Diagnosis often involves blood tests and genetic testing br There is no cure for any disorder from the muscular dystrophy group Several drugs designed to address the root cause are currently available including gene therapy Elevidys and antisense drugs Ataluren Eteplirsen etc Other medications used include glucocorticoids Deflazacort Vamorolone calcium channel blockers Diltiazem to slow skeletal and cardiac muscle degeneration anticonvulsants to control seizures and some muscle activity and Histone deacetylase inhibitors Givinostat to delay damage to dying muscle cells Physical therapy braces and corrective surgery may help with some symptoms while assisted ventilation may be required in those with weakness of breathing muscles br Outcomes depend on the specific type of disorder Many affected people will eventually become unable to walk and Duchenne muscular dystrophy in particular is associated with shortened life expectancy br Muscular dystrophy was first described in the s by Charles Bell The word dystrophy comes from the Greek dys meaning no un and troph meaning nourish br br br Signs and symptoms br br The signs and symptoms consistent with muscular dystrophy are br br br Causes br The majority of muscular dystrophies are inherited the different muscular dystrophies follow various inheritance patterns X linked autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant In a small percentage of patients the disorder may have been caused by a de novo spontaneous mutation br br br Diagnosis br The diagnosis of muscular dystrophy is based on the results of muscle biopsy increased creatine phosphokinase CpK electromyography and genetic testing A physical examination and the patient s medical history will help the doctor determine the type of muscular dystrophy Specific muscle groups are affected by different types of muscular dystrophy br An MRI can be used to assess the white matter of the nervous system and measure the merosin levels in young boys An absence of merosin in young boys will result with neurological deficits and changes in the white matter br br br Classification br br br Management br br Currently there is no cure for muscular dystrophy In terms of management physical therapy occupational therapy orthotic intervention e g ankle foot orthosis speech therapy and respiratory therapy may be helpful Low intensity corticosteroids such as prednisone and deflazacort may help to maintain muscle tone Orthoses orthopedic appliances used for support and corrective orthopedic surgery may be needed to improve the quality of life in some cases The cardiac problems that occur with Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy EDMD and myotonic muscular dystrophy may require a pacemaker The myotonia delayed relaxation of a muscle after a strong contraction occurring in myotonic muscular dystrophy may be treated with medications such as quinine br Low intensity assisted exercises dynamic exercise training or assisted bicycle training of the arms and legs during a week trial significantly delayed the functional loss of muscular dystrophy It can be done in a safe and feasible manner even with boys late in their ambulation stage However eccentric exercises or intense exercises causing soreness should not be used as they can cause further damage br Occupational therapy assists the individual with MD to engage in activities of daily living such as self feeding and self care activities and leisure activities at the most independent level possible This may be achieved with use of adaptive equipment or the use of energy conservation techniques Occupational therapy may implement changes to a person s environment both at home or work to increase the individual s function and accessibility furthermore it addresses psychosocial changes and cognitive decline which may accompany MD and provides support and education about the disease to the family and individual br br br Prognosis br Prognosis depends on the individual form of muscular dystrophy Some dystrophies cause progressive weakness and loss of muscle function which may result in severe physical disability and a life threatening deterioration of respiratory muscles or heart Other dystrophies do not affect life expectancy and only cause relatively mild impairment br br br History br In the s descriptions of boys who grew progressively weaker lost the ability to walk and died at an early age became more prominent in medical journals In the following decade French neurologist Guillaume Duchenne gave a comprehensive account of the most common and severe form of the disease which now carries his name Duchenne MD br br br Society and culture br In in the US and Canada Jerry Lewis and the Muscular Dystrophy Association MDA began the annual Labor Day telecast The Jerry Lewis Telethon significant in raising awareness of muscular dystrophy in North America Disability rights advocates however have criticized the telethon for portraying those living with the disease as deserving pity rather than respect br On December the MD CARE Act was signed into law in the US it amends the Public Health Service Act to provide research for the various muscular dystrophies This law also established the Muscular Dystrophy Coordinating Committee to help focus research efforts through a coherent research strategy br br br See also br br br br br br Further reading br De Los Angeles Beyt a Maria Vry Julia Kirschner Janbernd Drug treatment of Duchenne
