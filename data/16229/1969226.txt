Robert Albert Charles Esnault Pelterie November December was a French aircraft designer and spaceflight theorist He is referred to as being one of the founders of modern rocketry and astronautics along with the Russian Konstantin Tsiolkovsky the Germans Hermann Oberth Wernher Von Braun and the American Robert H Goddard br br br Biography br He was born on November in Paris to a textile industrialist He was educated at the Facult des Sciences studying engineering at the Sorbonne br He served in World War I and was made an Officier de la L gion d Honneur br In November on board the Ile de France while sailing to New York City he was married to Carmen Bernaldo de Quir s the daughter of Don Antonio and Yvonne Cabarrus and granddaughter of General Marquis of Santiago Grandee of Spain Head of the Military Household of Queen Isabella II br He died on December in Nice France br br br REP br Esnault Pelterie developed and manufactured aeroplanes and aero engines under the name REP br br br Aeroplanes br His first experiments in aviation were based on the Wright brothers glider His first glider design was tested on a beach near Calais but was not successful His glider was based upon an incomplete understanding of the Wright glider and although using a version of the wing warping which the Wright brothers had used to control their aircraft this did not work properly and was abandoned since he considered it dangerous After condemning the Wright brothers approach he developed the concept of the aileron fitting a pair of mid gap control surfaces in front of the wings This potentially initial example of the use of ailerons of any sort is believed to pre date all others after their patent description in by British inventor M P W Boulton was approved in that year br br In he began his first experiments in towed flight On September he flew m ft He made his first powered flight on October a distance of m ft with the REP This was driven by a seven cylinder hp air cooled engine of his own design br br Trials of the monoplane REP began on June This aircraft set a record with a m ft flight reaching an altitude of m ft After a modified version of this plane was flown for the last time in at Rheims Pelterie stopped flying and instead focused on the development and manufacture of aircraft br The Vickers R E P Type Monoplane was based upon his designs and marked the beginning of aircraft production at the later Vickers Limited In he introduced the REP Type N and in the REP Parasol monoplane br br His family had invested heavily to fund his aircraft designs and this had left them nearly financially ruined However he was the inventor of the joystick flight control and owned a patent on the design This would end up being integrated during into fellow French aviator Louis Bl riot s eighth design setting the pattern for future user interfaces in aircraft flight control system design Following the war Esnault Pelterie was involved in litigation over his joystick patent Many aircraft built during the war had used this design and the aircraft companies owed him royalties The damages he won and subsequent royalties made him a wealthy man This also allowed him to repay his father s significant investment br br br Aero engines br Esnault Pelterie designed and built his own aero engines He also sold them under the name R E P They were all of an unusual multiple banked fan or half radial type The first design featured seven cylinders double banked with four in one bank and three in the other and was rated at horsepower kW A later model doubled them up to create a cylinder quadruple banked engine giving horsepower kW br br br Rocketry br He became interested in space travel and not knowing of Tsiolkovsky s work in produced a paper that presented the rocket equation and calculated the energies required to reach the Moon and nearby planets In this talk he proposed the use of atomic energy using kg of radium to power an interplanetary vehicle His culminating work was L Astronautique published in A later version published in included details on interplanetary travel and applications of nuclear power br On June Esnault Pelterie gave a symposium for the Soci t astronomique de France French Astronomical Society titled L exploration par fus es de la tr s haute atmosph re et la possibilit des voyages interplan taires concerning the exploration of outer space using rocket propulsion Jean Jacques Barr attended this lecture and developed a correspondence with Esnault Pelterie on the topic of rockets br In Esnault Pelterie proposed the idea of the ballistic missile for military bombardment By Esnault Pelterie and Barr had persuaded the French War Department to fund a study of the concept In the two began experimenting with various types of rocket propulsion systems including liquid propellants The same year he ran a demonstration of a rocket engine powered with gasoline and liquid oxygen During an experiment with a rocket design using tetra nitromethane he lost four fingers from his right hand during an explosion Ultimately their work failed to create an interest in rocketry within France br br br Prix REP Hirsch br The Prix REP Hirsch was an international award of the Soci t astronomique de France given in recognition of the study of interplanetary travel and astronautics Established by Esnault Pelterie and Andr Louis Hirsch a Parisian banker and science enthusiast it was the first prize for astronautics in the world The award was given to recognize the best original scientific work theoretical or experimental that is able to advance one of the questions related to the realisation of space travel or to increase human understanding of one of the branches related to the science of astronautics The idea for establishing the prize originated during a dinner Hirsch and Esnault Pelterie organised in Paris on December The guests discussed the emerging science of space travel which they called astronautics at the suggestion of science fiction writer J H Rosny the elder Hirsch and Esnault Pelterie provided funds francs annually for and to the Soci t astronomique de France for an annual award in astronautics in their names A Comit d Astronautique was established to manage the prize In addition to Esnault Pelterie Hirsch and Rosny the elder it included General Gustave Auguste Ferri President Jean Perrin and Eug ne Fichot Vice Presidents and other expert members The prize was awarded for years In the name of the award changed from the Prix REP Hirsch to the Prix International d Astronautique International Astronautics Prize br The laureates were br br Hermann Oberth for his overall contributions to the field br Pierre Montagne for his theoretical work on the equilibrium of gas temperatures inside combustion chambers br Pierre Montagne for his work on chemical equilibria in chemical reactions and their application to rockets and Ary Sternfeld Prix d Encouragement for his book Initiation la Cosmonautique br Louis Damblanc for his innovations in solid propellants for rockets br American Rocket Society and Alfred Africano br Giovanni Serragli for his publication Recherches sur les poudres lentes et leur usage pour l exploration de la haute atmosph re br Frank J Malina M daille de vermeil and Nathan Carver M daille d argent br Though the award was short lived it helped stimulate interest in the new science of astronautics and encouraged early pioneers in the field br br Jacques Blamont br br br Legacy br br Among his interests were horseback riding playing golf camping and driving cars During his lifetime he filed about patents in a variety of fields ranging from metallurgy to automobile suspension He was the inventor of the center stick aircraft control and of a new type of fuel pump He also developed the idea of rocket maneuver by means of vectored thrust br br br Honors br In he received the Prix Jules Janssen the highest award of the Soci t astronomique de France the French astronomical society br Member of the French Academy br The crater Esnault Pelterie on the Moon is named after him br An avenue in Paris rue Robert Esnault Pelterie in the th arr is named after him br Inducted as a member of the inaugural class to the International Space Hall of Fame br br br Works by Esnault Pelterie br L
