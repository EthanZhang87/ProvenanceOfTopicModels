The DVD common abbreviation for digital video disc or digital versatile disc is a digital optical disc data storage format It was invented and developed in and first released on November in Japan The medium can store any kind of digital data and has been widely used to store video programs watched using DVD players software and other computer files DVDs offer significantly higher storage capacity than compact discs CD while having the same dimensions A standard single layer DVD can store up to GB of data a dual layer DVD up to GB Variants can store up to a maximum of GB br Prerecorded DVDs are mass produced using molding machines that physically stamp data onto the DVD Such discs are a form of DVD ROM because data can only be read and not written or erased Blank recordable DVD discs DVD R and DVD R can be recorded once using a DVD recorder and then function as a DVD ROM Rewritable DVDs DVD RW DVD RW and DVD RAM can be recorded and erased many times br DVDs are used in DVD Video consumer digital video format and less commonly in DVD Audio consumer digital audio format as well as for authoring DVD discs written in a special AVCHD format to hold high definition material often in conjunction with AVCHD format camcorders DVDs containing other types of information may be referred to as DVD data discs br br br Etymology br The Oxford English Dictionary comments that In rival manufacturers of the product initially named digital video disc agreed that in order to emphasize the flexibility of the format for multimedia applications the preferred abbreviation DVD would be understood to denote digital versatile disc The OED also states that in The companies said the official name of the format will simply be DVD Toshiba had been using the name digital video disc but that was switched to digital versatile disc after computer companies complained that it left out their applications br Digital versatile disc is the explanation provided in a DVD Forum Primer from and in the DVD Forum s mission statement which the purpose is to promote broad acceptance of DVD products on technology across entertainment and other industries br Because DVDs became highly popular for the distribution of movies in the s the term DVD became popularly used in English as a noun to describe specifically a full length movie released on the format for example the sentence to watch a DVD describes watching a movie on DVD br br br History br br br Development and launch br br Released in CD Video used analog video encoding on optical discs matching the established standard mm in size of audio CDs Video CD VCD became one of the first formats for distributing digitally encoded films in this format in In the same year two new optical disc storage formats were being developed One was the Multimedia Compact Disc MMCD backed by Philips and Sony developers of the CD and CD i and the other was the Super Density SD disc supported by Toshiba Time Warner Matsushita Electric Hitachi Mitsubishi Electric Pioneer Thomson and JVC By the time of the press launches for both formats in January the MMCD nomenclature had been dropped and Philips and Sony were referring to their format as Digital Video Disc DVD br On May an ad hoc industry technical group formed from five computer companies IBM Apple Compaq Hewlett Packard and Microsoft issued a press release stating that they would only accept a single format The group voted to boycott both formats unless the two camps agreed on a single converged standard They recruited Lou Gerstner president of IBM to pressure the executives of the warring factions In one significant compromise the MMCD and SD groups agreed to adopt proposal SD which specified that both layers of the dual layered disc be read from the same side instead of proposal SD which would have created a two sided disc that users would have to turn over Philips Sony strongly insisted on the source code EFMPlus that Kees Schouhamer Immink had designed for the MMCD because it makes it possible to apply the existing CD servo technology Its drawback was a loss from to Gbyte of capacity Philips and Sony decided that it was in their best interests to end the format war and on September agreed to unify with companies backing the Super Density Disc to release a single format with technologies from both br As a result the DVD specification provided a storage capacity of GB GiB for a single layered single sided disc and GB GiB for a dual layered single sided disc The DVD specification ended up similar to Toshiba and Matsushita s Super Density Disc except for the dual layer option MMCD was single sided and optionally dual layer whereas SD was two half thickness single layer discs which were pressed separately and then glued together to form a double sided disc br Philips and Sony decided that it was in their best interests to end the format war and on September agreed to unify with companies backing the Super Density Disc to release a single format with technologies from both After other compromises between MMCD and SD the group of computer companies won the day and a single format was agreed upon The computer companies also collaborated with the Optical Storage Technology Association OSTA on the use of their implementation of the ISO file system known as Universal Disk Format for use on the new DVDs The format s details were finalized on December br In November Samsung announced it would start mass producing DVDs by September The format launched on November in Japan mostly with music video releases The first major releases from Warner Home Video arrived on December with four titles being available The format s release in the U S was delayed multiple times from August to October November before finally settling on early Players began to be produced domestically that winter with March as the U S launch date of the format proper in seven test markets br Approximately titles were available on launch day mainly from the Warner Bros MGM and New Line libraries with the notable inclusion of the film Twister However the launch was planned for the following day March leading to a distribution change with retailers and studios to prevent similar violations of breaking the street date The nationwide rollout for the format happened on August br DTS announced in late that they would be coming onto the format The sound system company revealed details in a November online interview and clarified it would release discs in early However this date would be pushed back several times before finally releasing their first titles at the Consumer Electronics Show br In blank DVD recordable discs cost the equivalent of US dollars in br br br Adoption br br Movie and home entertainment distributors adopted the DVD format to replace the ubiquitous VHS tape as the primary consumer video distribution format br Immediately following the formal adoption of a unified standard for DVD two of the four leading video game console companies Sega and The DO Company said they already had plans to design a gaming console with DVDs as the source medium Sony stated at the time that they had no plans to use DVD in their gaming systems despite being one of the developers of the DVD format and eventually the first company to actually release a DVD based console Game consoles such as the PlayStation Xbox and Xbox use DVDs as their source medium for games and other software Contemporary games for Windows were also distributed on DVD Early DVDs were mastered using DLT tape but using DVD R DL or R DL eventually became common TV DVD combos combining a standard definition CRT TV or an HD flat panel TV with a DVD mechanism under the CRT or on the back of the flat panel and VCR DVD combos were also available for purchase br For consumers DVD soon replaced VHS as the favored choice for home movie releases br In DVD players outsold VCRs for the first time in the United States At this time in American households owned a DVD player By about of Americans owned a DVD player a figure that had surpassed VCRs and was also higher than personal computers or cable television br br br Specifications br The DVD specifications created and updated by the DVD Forum are published as so called DVD Books e g DVD ROM Book DVD Audio Book DVD Video Book DVD R Book DVD RW Book DVD RAM Book DVD AR Audio Recording Book DVD VR Video Recording Book etc DVD discs are made up of two discs normally one is blank and the other contains data Each disc is mm thick and are glued together to form a DVD disc The gluing process must be done carefully to make the disc as flat as possible to avoid both birefringence and disc tilt which is when the disc is not perfectly flat preventing it from being read br Some specifications for mechanical physical and optical characteristics of DVD optical discs can be downloaded as freely available standards from the ISO website There are also equivalent European Computer Manufacturers Association Ecma standards for some of these specifications such as Ecma for DVD ROMs Also the DVD RW Alliance publishes competing recordable DVD specifications such as DVD R DVD R DL DVD RW or DVD RW DL These DVD formats are also ISO standards br Some DVD specifications e g for DVD Video are not publicly available and can be obtained only from the DVD Format Logo Licensing Corporation DVD FLLC for a fee of US Every subscriber must sign a non disclosure agreement as certain information on the DVD Books is proprietary and confidential br br br Double sided discs br br Borrowing from the LaserDisc format the DVD standard includes DVD discs Type B in ISO with two recorded data layers such that only one layer is accessible from either side of the disc This doubles the total nominal capacity of a DVD disc to GB GiB but each side is locked to GB Like DVD discs DVD discs are defined as single layer SL discs br br br Dual layer discs br DVD hardware accesses the additional layer layer by refocusing the laser through an otherwise normally placed semitransparent first layer layer This laser refocus and the subsequent time needed to reacquire laser tracking can cause a noticeable pause in A V playback on earlier DVD players the length of which varies between hardware A printed message explaining that the layer transition pause was not a malfunction became standard on DVD keep cases During mastering a studio could make the transition less obvious by timing it to occur just before a camera angle change or other abrupt shift an early example being the DVD release of Toy Story Later in the format s life larger data buffers and faster optical pickups in DVD players made layer transitions effectively invisible regardless of mastering br Dual layer DVDs are recorded using Opposite Track Path OTP br br br Combinations of the above br The DVD Book also permits an additional disc type called DVD a hybrid double sided disc with one dual layer side one single layer side and a total nominal capacity of GB DVD has no counterpart in ISO br Both of these additional disc types are extremely rare due to their complicated and expensive manufacturing For this reason some DVDs that were initially issued as double sided discs were later pressed as two disc sets br Note The above sections regarding disc types pertain to cm discs The same disc types exist for cm discs ISO standards still regard these discs as Types A D while the DVD Book assigns them distinct disc types DVD has no analogous cm type The comparative data for cm discs is provided further down br br br DVD recordable and rewritable br br HP initially developed recordable DVD media from the need to store data for backup and transport DVD recordables are now also used for consumer audio and video recording Three formats were developed DVD R RW DVD R RW plus and DVD RAM DVD R is available in two formats General nm and Authoring nm where Authoring discs may be recorded with CSS encrypted video content but General discs may not br br br Dual layer recording br Dual layer recording occasionally called double layer recording allows DVD R and DVD R discs to store nearly double the data of a single layer disc and gigabyte capacities respectively The additional capacity comes at a cost DVD DLs have slower write speeds as compared to DVD R DVD R DL was developed for the DVD Forum by Pioneer Corporation DVD R DL was developed for the DVD RW Alliance by Mitsubishi Kagaku Media MKM and Philips br Recordable DVD discs supporting dual layer technology are backward compatible with some hardware developed before the recordable medium br br br Capacity br br br DVD drives and players br br DVD drives are devices that can read DVD discs on a computer DVD players are a particular type of devices that do not require a computer to work and can read DVD Video and DVD Audio discs br br br Transfer rates br br Read and write speeds for the first DVD drives and players were kB s KiB s this speed is usually called More recent models at or have or times that speed For CD drives means kB s KiB s about one ninth as swift br br DVDs can spin at much higher speeds than CDs DVDs can spin at up to RPM vs for CDs br DVD recordable and rewritable discs can be read and written using either constant angular velocity CAV constant linear velocity CLV Partial constant angular velocity P CAV or Zoned Constant Linear Velocity Z CLV or ZCLV br Due to the slightly lower data density of dual layer DVDs GB instead of GB per layer the required rotation speed is around faster for the same data rate which means that the same angular speed rating equals a higher physical angular rotation speed For that reason the increase of reading speeds of dual layer media has stagnated at constant angular velocity for half height optical drives released since around and slim type optical drives are only able to record dual layer media at constant angular velocity while reading speeds of are still supported by such br br br Disc quality measurements br br The quality and data integrity of optical media is measureable which means that future data losses caused by deteriorating media can be predicted well in advance by measuring the rate of correctable data errors br Support of measuring the disc quality varies among optical drive vendors and models br br br DVD Video br br DVD Video is a standard for distributing video audio content on DVD media The format went on sale in Japan on November in the United States on March to line up with the th Academy Awards that day in Canada Central America and Indonesia later in and in Europe Australia and Africa in DVD Video became the dominant form of home video distribution in Japan when it first went on sale on November but it shared the market for home video distribution in the United States for several years it was June when weekly DVD Video in the United States rentals began outnumbering weekly VHS cassette rentals br DVD Video is still the dominant form of home video distribution worldwide except for in Japan where it was surpassed by Blu ray Disc when Blu ray first went on sale in Japan on March br br br Security br br The purpose of CSS is twofold br br CSS prevents byte for byte copies of an MPEG digital video stream from being playable since such copies do not include the keys that are hidden on the lead in area of the restricted DVD br CSS provides a reason for manufacturers to make their devices compliant with an industry controlled standard since CSS scrambled discs cannot in principle be played on noncompliant devices anyone wishing to build compliant devices must obtain a license which contains the requirement that the rest of the DRM system region codes Macrovision and user operation prohibition be implemented br br br Successors and decline br In two new formats called HD DVD and Blu ray Disc were released as the successor to DVD HD DVD competed unsuccessfully with Blu ray Disc in the format war of A dual layer HD DVD can store up to GB and a dual layer Blu ray disc can hold up to GB br However unlike previous format changes e g vinyl to Compact Disc or VHS videotape to DVD initially there was no immediate indication that production of the standard DVD will gradually wind down as at the beginning of the s they still dominated with around of video sales and approximately one billion DVD player sales worldwide as of April In fact experts claimed that the DVD will remain the dominant medium for at least another five years as Blu ray technology was still in its introductory phase write and read speeds being poor and necessary hardware being expensive and not readily available br Consumers initially were also slow to adopt Blu ray due to the cost By of stores were selling Blu ray Discs A high definition television and appropriate connection cables are also required to take advantage of Blu ray disc Some analysts suggested that the biggest obstacle to replacing DVD was due to its installed base a large majority of consumers were satisfied with DVDs br br DVDs started to face competition from video on demand services around With increasing numbers of homes having high speed Internet connections many people had the option to either rent or buy video from an online service and view it by streaming it directly from that service s servers meaning they no longer need any form of permanent storage media for video at all By digital streaming services had overtaken the sales of DVDs and Blu rays for the first time br Until the end of the s manufacturers continued to release standard DVD titles as of and the format remained the preferred one for the release of older television programs and films Shows that were shot and edited entirely on film such as Star Trek The Original Series could not be released in high definition without being re scanned from the original film recordings Shows that were made between the early s and the early s were generally shot on film then transferred to video tape and then edited natively in either NTSC or PAL making high definition transfers impossible as these SD standards were baked into the final cuts of the episodes Star Trek The Next Generation was the only such show that had a Blu ray release as prints were re scanned and edited from the ground up br By the beginning of the s sales of DVD had dropped with respect to the peak of DVD sales around while on demand sales and overall subscription streaming of TV shows and movies grew by over At its peak DVD sales represented almost two thirds of video market in the US but only years later around they fell to only of the market br By there was an increased demand of high definition media where Ultra HD Blu ray and regular Blu ray formats made up for almost half of the US market while sales of physical media continued to shrink in favor of streaming services br br br Longevity br Longevity of a storage medium is measured by how long the data remains readable assuming compatible devices exist that can read it that is how long the disc can be stored until data is lost Numerous factors affect longevity composition and quality of the media recording and substrate layers humidity and light storage conditions the quality of the initial recording which is sometimes a matter of mutual compatibility of media and recorder etc According to NIST a temperature of F C and RH Relative Humidity would be considered suitable for long term storage A lower temperature and RH is recommended for extended term storage br As with CDs the information and data storage will begin to degrade over time with most standard DVDs lasting up to years depending on the type of environment they are stored and whether they are full with data br According to the Optical Storage Technology Association OSTA Manufacturers claim lifespans ranging from to years for DVD DVD R and DVD R discs and up to years for DVD RW DVD RW and DVD RAM br According to a NIST LoC research project conducted in using accelerated life testing There were fifteen DVD products tested including five DVD R five DVD R two DVD RW and three DVD RW types There were ninety samples tested for each product Overall seven of the products tested had estimated life expectancies in ambient conditions of more than years Four products had estimated life expectancies of years in ambient storage conditions Two products had an estimated life expectancy of years and two products had estimated life expectancies of less than years when stored in ambient conditions The life expectancies for survival estimated in this project by type of product are tabulated below br br br See also br br br Notes br br br br br br Further reading br br br
