A power supply unit PSU converts mains AC to low voltage regulated DC power for the internal components of a desktop computer Modern personal computers universally use switched mode power supplies Some power supplies have a manual switch for selecting input voltage while others automatically adapt to the main voltage br Most modern desktop personal computer power supplies conform to the ATX specification which includes form factor and voltage tolerances While an ATX power supply is connected to the mains supply it always provides a volt standby VSB power so that the standby functions on the computer and certain peripherals are powered ATX power supplies are turned on and off by a signal from the motherboard They also provide a signal to the motherboard to indicate when the DC voltages are in spec so that the computer is able to safely power up and boot The most recent ATX PSU standard is version as of mid br br br Functions br br The desktop computer power supply converts the alternating current AC from a wall socket of mains electricity to a low voltage direct current DC to operate the motherboard processor and peripheral devices Several direct current voltages are required and they must be regulated with some accuracy to provide stable operation of the computer A power supply rail or voltage rail refers to a single voltage provided by a PSU br Some PSUs can also supply a standby voltage so that most of the computer system can be powered off after preparing for hibernation or shutdown and powered back on by an event Standby power allows a computer to be started remotely via wake on LAN and Wake on ring or locally via Keyboard Power ON KBPO if the motherboard supports it This standby voltage may be generated by a small linear power supply inside the unit or a switching power supply sharing some components with the main unit to save cost and energy br br br History br First generation microcomputer and home computer power supply units used a heavy step down transformer and a linear power supply as used in for example the Commodore PET introduced in The Apple II also introduced in was noted for its switched mode power supply which was lighter and smaller than an equivalent linear power supply would have been and which had no cooling fan The switched mode supply uses a ferrite cored high frequency transformer and power transistors that switch thousands of times per second By adjusting the switching time of the transistor the output voltage can be closely controlled without dissipating energy as heat in a linear regulator The development of high power and high voltage transistors at economical prices made it practical to introduce switch mode supplies that had been used in aerospace mainframes minicomputers and color television into desktop personal computers The Apple II design by Atari engineer Rod Holt was awarded a patent and was in the vanguard of modern computer power supply design Now all modern computers use switched mode power supplies which are lighter less costly and more efficient than equivalent linear power supplies br Computer power supplies may have short circuit protection overpower overload protection over voltage protection under voltage protection over current protection and over temperature protection br br br Input voltage switch br Power supplies designed for worldwide use were once equipped with an input voltage selector switch that allowed the user to configure the unit for use on local power grid In the lower voltage range around V this switch is turned on changing the power grid voltage rectifier into a voltage doubler in Delon circuit design As a result the large primary filter capacitor behind that rectifier was split up into two capacitors wired in series balanced with bleeder resistors and varistors that were necessary in the upper input voltage range around V Connecting the unit configured for the lower range to a higher voltage grid usually resulted in an immediate permanent damage When the power factor correction PFC was required those filter capacitors were replaced with higher capacity ones together with a coil installed in series to delay the inrush current This is the simple design of a passive PFC br Active PFC is more complex and can achieve higher PF up to The first active PFC circuits just delayed the inrush Newer ones are working as an input and output condition controlled step up converter supplying a single V filter capacitor from a wide range input source usually between and V Newer PFC circuits also replace the NTC based inrush current limiter which is an expensive part previously located next to the fuse br br br Development br br br Original IBM PC XT and AT standard br The first IBM PC power supply unit PSU supplied two main voltages V and V It supplied two other voltages V and V but with limited amounts of power Most microchips of the time operated on V power Of the W these PSUs could deliver most of it was on this V rail br The V supply was used primarily to operate motors such as in disk drives and cooling fans As more peripherals were added more power was delivered on the V rail However since most of the power is consumed by chips the V rail still delivered most of the power The V rail was used primarily to provide the negative supply voltage to the RS serial ports A V rail was provided for peripherals on the ISA bus such as soundcards but was not used by any motherboard other than the original IBM PC motherboard br An additional wire referred to as Power Good is used to prevent digital circuitry operation during the initial milliseconds of power supply turn on where output voltages and currents are rising but not yet sufficient or stable for proper device operation Once the output power is ready to use the Power Good signal tells the digital circuitry that it can begin to operate br Original IBM power supplies for the PC model XT and AT included a line voltage power switch that extended through the side of the computer case In a common variant found in tower cases the line voltage switch was connected to the power supply with a short cable allowing it to be mounted apart from the power supply br An early microcomputer power supply was either fully on or off controlled by the mechanical line voltage switch and energy saving low power idle modes were not a design consideration of early computer power supplies These power supplies were generally not capable of power saving modes such as standby or soft off or scheduled turn on power controls br Due to the always on design in the event of a short circuit either a fuse would blow or a switched mode supply would repeatedly cut the power wait a brief period of time and attempt to restart For some power supplies the repeated restarting is audible as a quiet rapid chirping or ticking emitted from the device br br br ATX standard br br When Intel developed the ATX standard power supply connector published in microchips operating on V were becoming more popular beginning with the Intel DX microprocessor in and the ATX standard supplies three positive rails V V and V Earlier computers requiring V typically derived that from a simple but inefficient linear regulator connected to the V rail br The ATX connector provides multiple wires and power connections for the V supply because it is most sensitive to voltage drop in the supply connections Another ATX addition was the V SB standby rail for providing a small amount of standby power even when the computer was nominally off br When a computer is in ACPI S sleep mode only V SB rail is used br There are two basic differences between AT and ATX power supplies the connectors that provide power to the motherboard and the soft switch In ATX style systems the front panel power switch provides only a control signal to the power supply and does not switch the mains AC voltage This low voltage control allows other computer hardware or software to turn the system on and off br Since ATX power supplies share both the same width and height mm in and the same mounting layout four screws arranged on the back side of the unit with the preceding format there s no major physical difference preventing an AT case to accept an ATX PSU or vice versa if the case can host the power switch needed by an AT PSU provided that the specific PSU is not too long for the specific case br br br ATX V standard br As transistors become smaller on chips it becomes preferable to operate them on lower supply voltages and the lowest supply voltage is often desired by the densest chip the central processing unit In order to supply large amounts of low voltage power to the Pentium and subsequent microprocessors a special power supply the voltage regulator module began to be included on motherboards Newer processors require up to A at V or less which is impractical to deliver from off board power supplies br Initially this was supplied by the main V supply but as power demands increased the high currents required to supply sufficient power became problematic To reduce the power losses in the V supply with the introduction of the Pentium microprocessor Intel changed the processor power supply to operate on V and added the separate four pin P connector to the new ATX V standard to supply that power br Modern high powered graphics processing units do the same thing resulting in most of the power requirement of a modern personal computer being on the V rail When high powered GPUs were first introduced typical ATX power supplies were V heavy and could only supply of their output in the form of V power Thus GPU manufacturers to ensure W of V power peak load CPU GPU recommended power supplies of W or higher More modern ATX power supplies can deliver almost all typically of their total rated capacity in the form of V power br Because of this change it is important to consider the V supply capacity rather than the overall power capacity when using an older ATX power supply with a more recent computer br Low quality power supply manufacturers sometimes take advantage of this overspecification by assigning unrealistically high power supply ratings knowing that very few customers fully understand power supply ratings br br br V and V rails br V and V rail voltage supplies are rarely a limiting factor generally any supply with a sufficient V rating will have adequate capacity at lower voltages However most hard drives or PCI cards will create a greater load on the V rail br Older CPUs and logic devices on the motherboard were designed for V operating voltage Power supplies for those computers regulate the V output precisely and supply the V rail in a specified voltage window depending on the load ratio of both rails The V supply was used for computer fan motors disk drive motors and serial interfaces which also used the V supply A further use of the V came with the sound cards using linear chip audio power amplifiers sometimes filtered by a V linear regulator on the card to cut the noise of the motors br Since certain i variants CPUs use lower operating voltages such as or V Motherboards had linear voltage regulators supplied by the V rail Jumpers or dip switches set the output voltages to the installed CPU s specification When newer CPUs required higher currents switching mode voltage regulators like buck converters replaced linear regulators for efficiency br Since the first revision of the ATX standard PSUs were required to have a V output voltage rail Rarely a linear regulator generated these V supplied from the V and converting the product of voltage drop and current to heat In the most common design this voltage is generated by shifting and transforming the pulses of the V rail on an additional choke causing the voltage to rise delayed and rectified separately into a dedicated V rail and getting the rising idle voltage cut by a device type TL which behaves similar to a Zener diode Later regulators managed all the and V rails Cutting the pulse by the voltage regulator the ratio of the and V is controlled Some of these PSUs use two different chokes feeding to the V rail from the transformer to manage changing loads by pulse with ratio between the and the V outputs In designs using identical chokes the pulse width manages the ratio br With the Pentium and newer computer generations the voltage for the CPU cores went below V Voltage drop on connectors forced the designers to place such buck converters next to the device Higher maximum power consumption required the buck converters no longer fed from the V and changed to a V input to decrease the current required from the power supply br In drives a small linear voltage regulator is installed to keep the V stable by feeding it from the V rail br br br Entry Level Power Supply Specification br Entry Level Power Supply Specification EPS is a power supply unit meant for high power consumption computers and entry level servers Developed by the Server System Infrastructure SSI forum a group of companies including Intel Dell Hewlett Packard and others that works on server standards the EPS form factor is a derivative of the ATX form factor The latest specification is v br The EPS standard provides a more powerful and stable environment for critical server based systems and applications EPS power supplies have a pin motherboard power connector and an eight pin V connector The standard also specifies two additional four pin V connectors for more power hungry boards one required on W PSUs both required on W PSUs EPS power supplies are in principle compatible with standard ATX or ATX V motherboards found in homes and offices but there may be mechanical issues where the V connector and in the case of older boards connector overhang the sockets Many PSU vendors use connectors where the extra sections can be unclipped to avoid this issue As with later versions of the ATX PSU standard there is also no V rail br br br Single vs multiple V rail br As power supply capacity increased the ATX power supply standard was amended beginning with version to include br br Power Limit Hazardous Energy Levels br Under normal or overload conditions no output shall continuously provide more than VA under any conditions of load including output short circuit per the requirement of UL CSA EN IEC br The requirement was later deleted from version March of the ATX V power supply specifications but led to a distinction in modern ATX power supplies between single and multiple rails br The rule was intended to set a safe limit on the current able to pass through any single output wire A sufficiently large current can cause serious damage in the event of a short circuit or can melt the wire or its insulation in the case of a fault or potentially start a fire or damage other components The rule limits each output to below amps with typical supplies guaranteeing A availability Power supplies capable of delivering more than A at V would provide their output in groups of cables called rails Each rail delivers up to a limited amount of current through one or more cables and each rail is independently controlled by its own current sensor which shuts down the supply upon excess current Unlike a fuse or circuit breaker these limits reset as soon as the overload is removed Typically a power supply will guarantee at least A at V by having a current limit of A Thus it is guaranteed to supply at least A and guaranteed to cut off before A The current limits for each group of cables is then documented so the user can avoid placing too many high current loads in the same group br Originally at the time of ATX a power supply featuring multiple V rails implied one able to deliver more than A of V power and was seen as a good thing However people found the need to balance loads across many V rails inconvenient especially as higher end PSUs began to deliver far greater currents up to around W or more than A at V compared to the or W of earlier times When the assignment of connectors to rails is done at manufacturing time it is not always possible to move a given load to a different rail or manage the allocation of current across devices br Rather than add more current limit circuits many manufacturers chose to ignore the requirement and increase the current limits above A per rail or provided single rail power supplies that omit the current limit circuitry In some cases in violation of their own advertising claims to include it Because of the above standards almost all high power supplies claimed to implement separate rails however this claim was often false many omitted the necessary current limit circuitry both for cost reasons and because it is an irritation to customers The lack was and is sometimes advertised as a feature under names like rail fusion or current sharing br The requirement was withdrawn as a result however the issue left its mark on PSU designs which can be categorized into single rail and multiple rail designs Both may and often do contain current limiting controllers As of ATX a single rail design s output current can be drawn through any combination of output cables and the management and safe allocation of that load is left for the user A multiple rail design does the same but limits the current supplied to each individual connector or group of connectors and the limits it imposes are the manufacturer s choice rather than set by the ATX standard br br br V only supplies br br Since Fujitsu and other tier manufacturers have been manufacturing systems containing motherboard variants that require only a V supply from a custom made PSU which is typically rated at W DC to DC conversion providing V and V is done on the motherboard the proposal is that V and V supply for other devices such as HDDs will be picked up at the motherboard rather than from the PSU itself although this does not appear to be fully implemented as of January br The reasons given for this approach to power supply are that it eliminates cross load problems simplifies and reduces internal wiring that can affect airflow and cooling reduces costs increases power supply efficiency and reduces noise by bringing the power supply fan speed under the control of the motherboard br At least two of Dell s business PCs introduced in the OptiPlex and Precision T ship with V only power supplies and implement V and V conversion exclusively on the motherboard Afterwards Lenovo ThinkCentre M P adopts V only PSU and performs V and V conversion exclusively on the IS XM motherboard br In Intel released a new standard based on an all V design ATX VO The power supply only provides V voltage output V V powers as needed by USB hard disk drive and other devices are transformed on the motherboard and the ATX motherboard connector is reduced from pin to pin Called ATX VO it is not expected to replace current standards but to exist alongside it At CES FSP Group showed the first prototype based on the new ATX VO standard br According to the Single Rail Power Supply ATX VO design guide officially published by Intel in May the guide listed the details of V only design and the major benefit which included higher efficiency and lower electrical interruption br br br Power rating br The overall power draw on a PSU is limited by the fact that all of the supply rails come through one transformer and any of its primary side circuitry like switching components Total power requirements for a personal computer may range from W to more than W for a high performance computer with multiple graphics cards Personal computers without especially high performing CPUs or graphics cards usually require to W br Power supplies are designed around greater than the calculated system power consumption This protects against system performance degradation and against power supply overloading Power supplies label their total power output and label how this is determined by the electric current limits for each of the voltages supplied Some power supplies have no overload protection br The system power consumption is a sum of the power ratings for all of the components of the computer system that draw on the power supply Some graphics cards especially multiple cards and large groups of hard drives can place very heavy demands on the V lines of the PSU and for these loads the PSU s V rating is crucial The total V rating on the power supply must be higher than the current required by such devices so that the PSU can fully serve the system when its other V system components are taken into account The manufacturers of these computer system components especially graphics cards tend to over rate their power requirements to minimize support issues due to too low of a power supply br br br Efficiency br br Various initiatives exist to improve the efficiency of computer power supplies Climate Savers Computing Initiative promotes energy saving and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by encouraging development and use of more efficient power supplies Plus certifies a variety of efficiency levels for power supplies and encourages their use via financial incentives Efficient power supplies also save money by wasting less power as a result they use less electricity to power the same computer and they emit less waste heat which results significant energy savings on central air conditioning in the summer The gains of using an efficient power supply are more substantial in computers that use a lot of power br Although a power supply with a larger than needed power rating will have an extra margin of safety against overloading such a unit is often less efficient and wastes more electricity at lower loads than a more appropriately sized unit For example a watt power supply with the Plus Silver efficiency rating which means that such a power supply is designed to be at least efficient for loads above W may only be efficient when the load is lower than W which is a typical idle power for a desktop computer Thus for a W load losses for this supply would be W if the same power supply was put under a W load for which the supply s efficiency peaks at the loss would be only W despite supplying times the useful power For a comparison a watt power supply carrying the Plus Bronze efficiency rating which means that such a power supply is designed to be at least efficient for loads above W may provide an efficiency for a W load wasting only W Other ratings such as plus gold plus platinum and plus titanium also provide the same ratings respectively plus gold providing an efficiency under load plus platinum providing a efficiency and plus titanium providing the best efficiency at br A power supply that is self certified by its manufacturer may claim output ratings double or more than what is actually provided To further complicate this possibility when there are two rails that share power through down regulating it also happens that either the V rail or the V rail overloads at well below the total rating of the power supply Many power supplies create their V output by down regulating their V rail or create V output by down regulating their V rails The two rails involved are labeled on the power supply with a combined current limit For example the V and V rails are rated with a combined total current limit For a description of the potential problem a V rail may have a A rating by itself W and the V rail may have a A rating W by itself but the two together may only be able to output W In this case loading the V rail to maximum W would leave the V rail only able to output W br A test in revealed computer power supplies are generally about efficient For a efficient power supply to produce W of DC output it would require W of AC input and dissipate the remaining W in heat Higher quality power supplies can be over efficient as a result energy efficient PSUs waste less energy in heat and require less airflow to cool resulting in quieter operation br As of some high end consumer PSUs can exceed efficiency at optimal load levels though will fall to efficiency during heavy or light loads Google s server power supplies are more than efficient HP s server power supplies have reached efficiency Standard PSUs sold for server workstations have around efficiency as of br The energy efficiency of a power supply drops significantly at low loads Therefore it is important to match the capacity of a power supply to the power needs of the computer Efficiency generally peaks at about load The curve varies from model to model examples of how this curve looks can be seen on test reports of energy efficient models found on the Plus website Archived at the Wayback Machine br br br Appearance br br Most desktop personal computer power supplies are a square metal box and have a large bundle of wires emerging from one end Opposite the wire bundle is the back face of the power supply with an air vent and an IEC C connector to supply AC power There may be a power switch and or a voltage selector switch Historically they were mounted on the upper part of the computer case and had two fans one inside the case pulling air towards the power supply and another extracting air from the power supply to the outside Many power supplies have a single large fan inside the case and are mounted on the bottom part of the case The fan may be always on or turn on and vary its speed depending on the load Some have no fans hence are cooled passively br A label on one side of the box lists technical information about the power supply including safety certifications and maximum output power Common certification marks for safety are the UL mark GS mark T V NEMKO SEMKO DEMKO FIMKO CCC CSA VDE GOST R mark and BSMI Common certificate marks for EMI RFI are the CE mark FCC and C tick The CE mark is required for power supplies sold in Europe and India A RoHS or Plus can also sometimes be seen br Dimensions of an ATX power supply are mm width mm height and typically mm depth although the depth can vary from brand to brand br Some power supplies come with sleeved cables which besides being more aesthetically pleasing also make wiring easier and have a less detrimental effect on airflow br br br Connectors br Typically power supplies have the following connectors all are Molex USA Inc Mini Fit Jr unless otherwise indicated br br ATX motherboard power connector usually called P This is the connector that goes to the motherboard to provide it with power The connector has or pins One of the pins belongs to the PS ON wire it is usually green This connector is the largest of all the connectors In older AT power supplies this connector was split in two P and P A power supply with a pin connector can be used on a motherboard with a pin connector In cases where the motherboard has a pin connector some power supplies come with two connectors one with pin and other with pin i e pin form which can be used together to form the pin connector br V only power connector labelled P though it is not compatible with the ATX or pin connector This is a or pin Molex connector supplying the motherboard with three or six V lines with common returns a supply OK signal a PSU ON signal and a or V auxiliary supply One pin is left unused br V only System monitoring P This is a AMP or equivalent connector carrying a supply to the PSU fan and sense returns br ATX V pin power connector also called the P power connector A second connector that goes to the motherboard in addition to the pin ATX motherboard connector to supply dedicated power for the processor br pin For the purpose of backwards compatibility some connectors designed for high end motherboards and processors more power is required therefore EPS V has an pin connector br pin Peripheral power connectors These are the other smaller connectors that go to the various disk drives of the computer Most of them have four wires two black one red and one yellow Unlike the US standard mains electrical wire color coding each black wire is a ground the red wire is V and the yellow wire is V In some cases these are also used to provide additional power to PCI cards such as FireWire cards br pin Molex Japan Ltd power connectors usually called Mini connector mini Molex or Berg connector This is one of the smallest connectors that supplies a inch floppy drive with power In some cases it can be used as an auxiliary connector for Accelerated Graphics Port AGP video cards Its cable configuration is similar to the Peripheral connector br Auxiliary power connectors There are several types of auxiliary connectors usually in pin form designed to provide additional power if it is needed br Serial ATA power connectors a pin connector for components that use SATA power plugs This connector supplies power at three different voltages and V in three pins per wire one designed to precharge capacitive loads on for hot plugging designed backplanes br pin Most modern computer power supplies include six pin connectors that are generally used for PCI Express graphics cards but a newly introduced eight pin connector should be seen on the latest model power supplies Each PCI Express pin connector can output a maximum of W br pin For the purpose of backwards compatibility some connectors designed for use with high end PCI Express graphics cards feature this kind of pin configuration It allows either a six pin card or an eight pin card to be connected by using two separate connection modules wired into the same sheath one with six pins and another with two pins Each PCI Express pin connector can output a maximum of W br pin for PCI Express graphics cards each PCI Express pin connector can output a maximum of W V A W pin can be combined via an adapter cable to form one W pin br pin VHPWR connector for PCI Express graphics cards each PCI Express pin connector can output a maximum of W V A power pins contact pins Introduced on ATX br An IEC C connector with an appropriate C cord is used to attach the power supply to the local power grid br br br Modular power supplies br br A modular power supply provides a detachable cable system offering the ability to remove unused connections at the expense of a small amount of extra electrical resistance introduced by the additional connector This reduces clutter removes the risk of dangling cables interfering with other components and can improve case airflow Many semi modular supplies have some permanent multi wire cables with connectors at the ends such as ATX motherboard and pin EPS though newer supplies marketed as fully modular allow even these to be disconnected The pin assignment of the detachable cables is only standardized on the output end and not on the end that is to be connected to the power supply Thus the cables of a modular power supply must only be used with this particular modular power supply model Usage with another modular power supply even if the cable prima facie appear compatible might result in a wrong pin assignment and thus can lead to damage of connected components by supplying V to a V or V pin br br br Other form factors br The Small Form Factor with a V connector SFX V configuration has been optimized for small form factor SFF system layouts such as microATX The low profile of the power supply fits easily into these systems br The Thin Form Factor with a V connector TFX V configuration has been optimized for small and low profile Mini ITX and Mini DTX system layouts The long narrow profile of the power supply fits easily into low profile systems The cooling fan placement can be used to efficiently exhaust air from the processor and core area of the motherboard making possible smaller more efficient systems using common industry components br Most portable computers have power supplies that provide to W In portable computers such as laptops there is usually an external power supply sometimes referred to as a power brick due to its similarity in size shape and weight to a real brick which converts AC power to one DC voltage most commonly V and further DC DC conversion occurs within the laptop to supply the various DC voltages required by the other components of the portable computer br External power supply could send data about itself power current and voltage ratings to the computer For example genuine Dell power source uses Wire protocol to send data by third wire to the laptop The laptop then refuses a non matching adapter br Some computers use a single voltage V power supply All other voltages are generated by voltage regulator modules on the motherboard

longer device life and better reliability Using higher quality electrical components at less than their maximum ratings or providing better cooling can contribute to a higher MTBF rating because lower stress and lower operating temperatures decrease component failure rates br An estimated MTBF value of hours roughly months at C and under full load is fairly common Such a rating expects that under the described conditions of the PSUs will be operating failure free over three years months equivalently of the units are expected to fail within three years of operation For the same example only of the units fewer than a half are expected to last hours without failing The formula for calculating predicted reliability R t is br br br br br R br br t br br br br e br br br br br t br br t br br M

running through a system monitor software like lm sensors on Linux envstat on NetBSD sysctl hw sensors on OpenBSD and DragonFly BSD or SpeedFan on Windows br Most of power supply fans are not connected to the speed sensor on the motherboard and so cannot be monitored but some high end PSU can provide digital control and monitoring and this requires connection to the fan speed sensor or USB
