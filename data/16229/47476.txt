An altimeter or an altitude meter is an instrument used to measure the altitude of an object above a fixed level The measurement of altitude is called altimetry which is related to the term bathymetry the measurement of depth under water br br br Types br br br Pressure altimeter br br br Sonic altimeter br In the US Army Air Corps and General Electric tested a sonic altimeter for aircraft which was considered more reliable and accurate than one that relied on air pressure when heavy fog or rain was present The new altimeter used a series of high pitched sounds like those made by a bat to measure the distance from the aircraft to the surface which on return to the aircraft was converted to feet shown on a gauge inside the aircraft cockpit br br br Radar altimeter br br A radar altimeter measures altitude more directly using the time taken for a radio signal to reflect from the surface back to the aircraft Alternatively Frequency Modulated Continuous wave radar can be used The greater the frequency shift the further the distance travelled This method can achieve much better accuracy than the pulsed radar for the same outlay and radar altimeters that use frequency modulation are industry standard The radar altimeter is used to measure height above ground level during landing in commercial and military aircraft Radar altimeters are also a component of terrain avoidance warning systems warning the pilot if the aircraft is flying too low or if there is rising terrain ahead Radar altimeter technology is also used in terrain following radar allowing combat aircraft to fly at very low height above the terrain br After extensive research and experimentation it has been shown that phase radio altimeters are most suitable for ground effect vehicles as compared to laser isotropic or ultrasonic altimeters br br br Laser altimeter br Lidar technology is used to help navigate the helicopter Ingenuity on its record setting flights over the terrain of Mars by means of a downward facing Lidar altimeter br br br Global Positioning System br Global Positioning System GPS receivers can also determine altitude by trilateration with four or more satellites In aircraft altitude determined using autonomous GPS is not reliable enough to supersede the pressure altimeter without using some method of augmentation In hiking and climbing it is common to find that the altitude measured by GPS is off by as much as feet metres depending on satellite orientation br br br See also br br br br br br External links
