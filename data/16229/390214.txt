id: 390214
A graphics processing unit GPU is a specialized electronic circuit initially designed to accelerate computer graphics and image processing either on a video card or embedded on motherboards mobile phones personal computers workstations and game consoles After their initial design GPUs were found to be useful for non graphic calculations involving embarrassingly parallel problems due to their parallel structure Other non graphical uses include the training of neural networks and cryptocurrency mining br br br History br br br s br Arcade system boards have used specialized graphics circuits since the s In early video game hardware RAM for frame buffers was expensive so video chips composited data together as the display was being scanned out on the monitor br A specialized barrel shifter circuit helped the CPU animate the framebuffer graphics for various s arcade video games from Midway and Taito such as Gun Fight Sea Wolf and Space Invaders The Namco Galaxian arcade system in used specialized graphics hardware that supported RGB color multi colored sprites and tilemap backgrounds The Galaxian hardware was widely used during the golden age of arcade video games by game companies such as Namco Centuri Gremlin Irem Konami Midway Nichibutsu Sega and Taito br br The Atari in used a video shifter called the Television Interface Adaptor Atari bit computers had ANTIC a video processor which interpreted instructions describing a display list the way the scan lines map to specific bitmapped or character modes and where the memory is stored so there did not need to be a contiguous frame buffer machine code subroutines could be triggered on scan lines by setting a bit on a display list instruction ANTIC also supported smooth vertical and horizontal scrolling independent of the CPU br br br s br br The NEC PD was the first implementation of a personal computer graphics display processor as a single large scale integration LSI integrated circuit chip This enabled the design of low cost high performance video graphics cards such as those from Number Nine Visual Technology It became the best known GPU until the mid s It was the first fully integrated VLSI very large scale integration metal oxide semiconductor NMOS graphics display processor for PCs supported up to resolution and laid the foundations for the emerging PC graphics market It was used in a number of graphics cards and was licensed for clones such as the Intel the first of Intel s graphics processing units The Williams Electronics arcade games Robotron Joust Sinistar and Bubbles all released in contain custom blitter chips for operating on color bitmaps br In Hitachi released ARTC HD the first major CMOS graphics processor for personal computers The ARTC could display up to K resolution when in monochrome mode It was used in a number of graphics cards and terminals during the late s In the Amiga was released with a custom graphics chip including a blitter for bitmap manipulation line drawing and area fill It also included a coprocessor with its own simple instruction set that was capable of manipulating graphics hardware registers in sync with the video beam e g for per scanline palette switches sprite multiplexing and hardware windowing or driving the blitter In Texas Instruments released the TMS the first fully programmable graphics processor It could run general purpose code but it had a graphics oriented instruction set During this chip became the basis of the Texas Instruments Graphics Architecture TIGA Windows accelerator cards br br In the IBM graphics system was released It was one of the first video cards for IBM PC compatibles to implement fixed function D primitives in electronic hardware Sharp s X released in used a custom graphics chipset with a color palette and hardware support for sprites scrolling and multiple playfields It served as a development machine for Capcom s CP System arcade board Fujitsu s FM Towns computer released in had support for a color palette In the first dedicated polygonal D graphics boards were introduced in arcades with the Namco System and Taito Air System br br IBM introduced its proprietary Video Graphics Array VGA display standard in with a maximum resolution of pixels In November NEC Home Electronics announced its creation of the Video Electronics Standards Association VESA to develop and promote a Super VGA SVGA computer display standard as a successor to VGA Super VGA enabled graphics display resolutions up to pixels a increase br br br s br br In S Graphics introduced the S C which its designers named after the Porsche as an indication of the performance increase it promised The C spawned a variety of imitators by all major PC graphics chip makers had added D acceleration support to their chips Fixed function Windows accelerators surpassed expensive general purpose graphics coprocessors in Windows performance and such coprocessors faded from the PC market br Throughout the s D GUI acceleration evolved As manufacturing capabilities improved so did the level of integration of graphics chips Additional application programming interfaces APIs arrived for a variety of tasks such as Microsoft s WinG graphics library for Windows x and their later DirectDraw interface for hardware acceleration of D games in Windows and later br In the early and mid s real time D graphics became increasingly common in arcade computer and console games which led to increasing public demand for hardware accelerated D graphics Early examples of mass market D graphics hardware can be found in arcade system boards such as the Sega Model Namco System and Sega Model and the fifth generation video game consoles such as the Saturn PlayStation and Nintendo Arcade systems such as the Sega Model and SGI Onyx based Namco Magic Edge Hornet Simulator in were capable of hardware T L transform clipping and lighting years before appearing in consumer graphics cards Another early example is the Super FX chip a RISC based on cartridge graphics chip used in some SNES games notably Doom and Star Fox Some systems used DSPs to accelerate transformations Fujitsu which worked on the Sega Model arcade system began working on integrating T L into a single LSI solution for use in home computers in the Fujitsu Pinolite the first D geometry processor for personal computers released in The first hardware T L GPU on home video game consoles was the Nintendo s Reality Coprocessor released in In Mitsubishi released the Dpro MP a GPU capable of transformation and lighting for workstations and Windows NT desktops ATi used it for its FireGL graphics card released in br The term GPU was coined by Sony in reference to the bit Sony GPU designed by Toshiba in the PlayStation video game console released in br In the PC world notable failed attempts for low cost D graphics chips included the S ViRGE ATI Rage and Matrox Mystique These chips were essentially previous generation D accelerators with D features bolted on Many were pin compatible with the earlier generation chips for ease of implementation and minimal cost Initially D graphics were possible only with discrete boards dedicated to accelerating D functions and lacking D graphical user interface GUI acceleration entirely such as the PowerVR and the dfx Voodoo However as manufacturing technology continued to progress video D GUI acceleration and D functionality were all integrated into one chip Rendition s Verite chipsets were among the first to do this well In Rendition collaborated with Hercules and Fujitsu on a Thriller Conspiracy project which combined a Fujitsu FXG Pinolite geometry processor with a V rit V core to create a graphics card with a full T L engine years before Nvidia s GeForce This card designed to reduce the load placed upon the system s CPU never made it to market NVIDIA RIVA was one of the first consumer facing GPU integrated D processing unit and D processing unit on a chip br OpenGL was introduced in the early s by SGI as a professional graphics API with proprietary hardware support for D rasterization In Microsoft acquired Softimage the dominant CGI movie production tool used for early CGI movie hits like Jurassic Park Terminator and Titanic With that deal came a strategic relationship with SGI and a commercial license of SGI s OpenGL libraries enabling Microsoft to port the API to the Windows NT OS but not to the upcoming release of Windows Although it was little known at the time SGI had contracted with Microsoft to transition from Unix to the forthcoming Windows NT OS the deal which was signed in was not announced publicly until In the intervening period Microsoft worked closely with SGI to port OpenGL to Windows NT In that era OpenGL had no standard driver model for competing hardware accelerators to compete on the basis of support for higher level D texturing and lighting functionality In Microsoft announced DirectX and support for gaming in the forthcoming Windows consumer OS in Microsoft announced the acquisition of UK based Rendermorphics Ltd and the Direct D driver model for the acceleration of consumer D graphics The Direct D driver model shipped with DirectX in It included standards and specifications for D chip makers to compete to support D texture lighting and Z buffering ATI which was later to be acquired by AMD began development on the first Direct D GPU s Nvidia quickly pivoted from a failed deal with Sega in to aggressively embracing support for Direct D In this era Microsoft merged their internal Direct D and OpenGL teams and worked closely with SGI to unify driver standards for both industrial and consumer D graphics hardware accelerators Microsoft ran annual events for D chip makers called Meltdowns to test their D hardware and drivers to work both with Direct D and OpenGL It was during this period of strong Microsoft influence over D standards that D accelerator cards moved beyond being simple rasterizers to become more powerful general purpose processors as support for hardware accelerated texture mapping lighting Z buffering and compute created the modern GPU During this period the same Microsoft team responsible for Direct D and OpenGL driver standardization introduced their own Microsoft D chip design called Talisman Details of this era are documented extensively in the books Game of X v and v by Russel Demaria Renegades of the Empire by Mike Drummond Opening the Xbox by Dean Takahashi and Masters of Doom by David Kushner The Nvidia GeForce also known as NV was the first consumer level card with hardware accelerated T L While the OpenGL API provided software support for texture mapping and lighting the first D hardware acceleration for these features arrived with the first Direct D accelerated consumer GPU s br br br s br Nvidia was first to produce a chip capable of programmable shading the GeForce Each pixel could now be processed by a short program that could include additional image textures as inputs and each geometric vertex could likewise be processed by a short program before it was projected onto the screen Used in the Xbox console this chip competed with the one in the PlayStation which used a custom vector unit for hardware accelerated vertex processing commonly referred to as VU VU The earliest incarnations of shader execution engines used in Xbox were not general purpose and could not execute arbitrary pixel code Vertices and pixels were processed by different units which had their own resources with pixel shaders having tighter constraints because they execute at higher frequencies than vertices Pixel shading engines were actually more akin to a highly customizable function block and did not really run a program Many of these disparities between vertex and pixel shading were not addressed until the Unified Shader Model br In October with the introduction of the ATI Radeon also known as R the world s first Direct D accelerator pixel and vertex shaders could implement looping and lengthy floating point math and were quickly becoming as flexible as CPUs yet orders of magnitude faster for image array operations Pixel shading is often used for bump mapping which adds texture to make an object look shiny dull rough or even round or extruded br With the introduction of the Nvidia GeForce series and new generic stream processing units GPUs became more generalized computing devices Parallel GPUs are making computational inroads against the CPU and a subfield of research dubbed GPU computing or GPGPU for general purpose computing on GPU has found applications in fields as diverse as machine learning oil exploration scientific image processing linear algebra statistics D reconstruction and stock options pricing GPGPU was the precursor to what is now called a compute shader e g CUDA OpenCL DirectCompute and actually abused the hardware to a degree by treating the data passed to algorithms as texture maps and executing algorithms by drawing a triangle or quad with an appropriate pixel shader This entails some overheads since units like the scan converter are involved where they are not needed nor are triangle manipulations even a concern except to invoke the pixel shader br Nvidia s CUDA platform first introduced in was the earliest widely adopted programming model for GPU computing OpenCL is an open standard defined by the Khronos Group that allows for the development of code for both GPUs and CPUs with an emphasis on portability OpenCL solutions are supported by Intel AMD Nvidia and ARM and according to a report in by Evans Data OpenCL had become the second most popular HPC tool br br br s br In Nvidia partnered with Audi to power their cars dashboards using the Tegra GPU to provide increased functionality to cars navigation and entertainment systems Advances in GPU technology in cars helped advance self driving technology AMD s Radeon HD series cards were released in and in AMD released its M Series discrete GPUs for mobile devices The Kepler line of graphics cards by Nvidia were released in and were used in the Nvidia s and series cards A feature in this GPU microarchitecture included GPU boost a technology that adjusts the clock speed of a video card to increase or decrease it according to its power draw The Kepler microarchitecture was manufactured on the nm process br The PS and Xbox One were released in they both use GPUs based on AMD s Radeon HD and Nvidia s Kepler line of GPUs was followed by the Maxwell line manufactured on the same process Nvidia s nm chips were manufactured by TSMC in Taiwan using the nm process Compared to the nm technology from the past this manufacturing process allowed a percent boost in performance while drawing less power Virtual reality headsets have high system requirements manufacturers recommended the GTX and the R X or better at the time of their release Cards based on the Pascal microarchitecture were released in The GeForce series of cards are of this generation of graphics cards They are made using the nm manufacturing process which improves upon previous microarchitectures Nvidia released one non consumer card under the new Volta architecture the Titan V Changes from the Titan XP Pascal s high end card include an increase in the number of CUDA cores the addition of tensor cores and HBM Tensor cores are designed for deep learning while high bandwidth memory is on die stacked lower clocked memory that offers an extremely wide memory bus To emphasize that the Titan V is not a gaming card Nvidia removed the GeForce GTX suffix it adds to consumer gaming cards br In Nvidia launched the RTX series GPUs that added ray tracing cores to GPUs improving their performance on lighting effects Polaris and Polaris GPUs from AMD are fabricated by a nm process Their release resulted in a substantial increase in the performance per watt of AMD video cards AMD also released the Vega GPU series for the high end market as a competitor to Nvidia s high end Pascal cards also featuring HBM like the Titan V br In AMD released the successor to their Graphics Core Next GCN microarchitecture instruction set Dubbed RDNA the first product featuring it was the Radeon RX series of video cards br The company announced that the successor to the RDNA microarchitecture would be incremental aka a refresh AMD unveiled the Radeon RX series its RDNA graphics cards with support for hardware accelerated ray tracing The product series launched in late consisted of the RX RX XT and RX XT The RX XT which is based on Navi was launched in early br The PlayStation and Xbox Series X and Series S were released in they both use GPUs based on the RDNA microarchitecture with incremental improvements and different GPU configurations in each system s implementation br Intel first entered the GPU market in the late s but produced lackluster D accelerators compared to the competition at the time Rather than attempting to compete with the high end manufacturers Nvidia and ATI AMD they began integrating Intel Graphics Technology GPUs into motherboard chipsets beginning with the Intel for the Pentium III and later into CPUs They began with the Intel Atom Pineview laptop processor in continuing in with desktop processors in the first generation of the Intel Core line and with contemporary Pentiums and Celerons This resulted in a large nominal market share as the majority of computers with an Intel CPU also featured this embedded graphics processor These generally lagged behind discrete processors in performance Intel re entered the discrete GPU market in with its Arc series which competed with the then current GeForce series and Radeon series cards at competitive prices br br br s br br In the s GPUs have been increasingly used for calculations involving embarrassingly parallel problems such as training of neural networks on enormous datasets that are needed for large language models Specialized processing cores on some modern workstation s GPUs are dedicated for deep learning since they have significant FLOPS performance increases using matrix multiplication and division resulting in hardware performance up to TFLOPS in some applications These tensor cores are expected to appear in consumer cards as well br br br GPU companies br Many companies have produced GPUs under a number of brand names In Intel Nvidia and AMD ATI were the market share leaders with and market share respectively In addition Matrox produces GPUs Modern smartphones use mostly Adreno GPUs from Qualcomm PowerVR GPUs from Imagination Technologies and Mali GPUs from ARM br br br Computational functions br Modern GPUs have traditionally used most of their transistors to do calculations related to D computer graphics In addition to the D hardware today s GPUs include basic D acceleration and framebuffer capabilities usually with a VGA compatibility mode Newer cards such as AMD ATI HD HD lack dedicated D acceleration it is emulated by D hardware GPUs were initially used to accelerate the memory intensive work of texture mapping and rendering polygons Later units were added to accelerate geometric calculations such as the rotation and translation of vertices into different coordinate systems Recent developments in GPUs include support for programmable shaders which can manipulate vertices and textures with many of the same operations that are supported by CPUs oversampling and interpolation techniques to reduce aliasing and very high precision color spaces br Several factors of GPU construction affect the performance of the card for real time rendering such as the size of the connector pathways in the semiconductor device fabrication the clock signal frequency and the number and size of various on chip memory caches Performance is also affected by the number of streaming multiprocessors SM for NVidia GPUs or compute units CU for AMD GPUs or Xe cores for Intel discrete GPUs which describe the number of core on silicon processor units within the GPU chip that perform the core calculations typically working in parallel with other SM CUs on the GPU GPU performance is typically measured in floating point operations per second FLOPS GPUs in the s and s typically deliver performance measured in teraflops TFLOPS This is an estimated performance measure as other factors can affect the actual display rate br br br GPU accelerated video decoding and encoding br br Most GPUs made since support the YUV color space and hardware overlays important for digital video playback and many GPUs made since also support MPEG primitives such as motion compensation and iDCT This hardware accelerated video decoding in which portions of the video decoding process and video post processing are offloaded to the GPU hardware is commonly referred to as GPU accelerated video decoding GPU assisted video decoding GPU hardware accelerated video decoding or GPU hardware assisted video decoding br Recent graphics cards decode high definition video on the card offloading the central processing unit The most common APIs for GPU accelerated video decoding are DxVA for Microsoft Windows operating systems and VDPAU VAAPI XvMC and XvBA for Linux based and UNIX like operating systems All except XvMC are capable of decoding videos encoded with MPEG MPEG MPEG ASP MPEG Part MPEG AVC H DivX VC WMV WMV Xvid OpenDivX DivX and DivX codecs while XvMC is only capable of decoding MPEG and MPEG br There are several dedicated hardware video decoding and encoding solutions br br br Video decoding processes that can be accelerated br Video decoding processes that can be accelerated by modern GPU hardware are br br Motion compensation mocomp br Inverse discrete cosine transform iDCT br Inverse telecine and pull down correction br Inverse modified discrete cosine transform iMDCT br In loop deblocking filter br Intra frame prediction br Inverse quantization IQ br Variable length decoding VLD more commonly known as slice level acceleration br Spatial temporal deinterlacing and automatic interlace progressive source detection br Bitstream processing Context adaptive variable length coding Context adaptive binary arithmetic coding and perfect pixel positioning br These operations also have applications in video editing encoding and transcoding br br br D graphics APIs br An earlier GPU may support one or more D graphics API for D acceleration such as GDI and DirectDraw br br br D graphics APIs br A GPU can support one or more D graphics API such as DirectX Metal OpenGL OpenGL ES Vulkan br br br GPU forms br br br Terminology br In the s the term GPU originally stood for graphics processor unit and described a programmable processing unit working independently from the CPU that was responsible for graphics manipulation and output In Sony used the term now standing for graphics processing unit in reference to the PlayStation console s Toshiba designed Sony GPU The term was popularized by Nvidia in who marketed the GeForce as the world s first GPU It was presented as a single chip processor with integrated transform lighting triangle setup clipping and rendering engines Rival ATI Technologies coined the term visual processing unit or VPU with the release of the Radeon in The AMD Alveo MA D features dual VPU s each using the nm process in br In personal computers there are two main forms of GPUs Each has many synonyms br br Dedicated graphics also called discrete graphics br Integrated graphics also called shared graphics solutions

Automated Driverless car br Nvidia Drive PX br br br Dedicated graphics processing unit br br Dedicated graphics processing units uses RAM that is dedicated to the GPU rather than relying on the computer s main system memory This RAM is usually specially selected for the expected serial workload of the graphics card see GDDR Sometimes systems with dedicated discrete GPUs were called DIS systems as opposed to UMA systems see next section br Dedicated GPUs are not necessarily removable nor does it necessarily interface with the motherboard in a standard fashion The term dedicated refers to the fact that graphics cards have RAM that is dedicated to the card s use not to the fact that most dedicated GPUs are removable Dedicated GPUs for portable computers are most commonly interfaced through a non standard and often proprietary slot due to size and weight constraints Such ports may still be considered PCIe or AGP in terms of their logical host interface even if they are not physically interchangeable with their counterparts br Graphics cards with dedicated GPUs typically interface with the motherboard by means of an expansion slot such as PCI Express PCIe or Accelerated Graphics Port AGP They can usually be replaced or upgraded with relative ease assuming the motherboard is capable of supporting the upgrade A few graphics cards still use Peripheral Component Interconnect PCI slots but their bandwidth is so limited that they are generally used only when a PCIe or AGP slot is not available br Technologies such as Scan Line Interleave by dfx SLI and NVLink by Nvidia and CrossFire by AMD allow multiple GPUs to draw images simultaneously for a single screen increasing the processing power available for graphics These technologies however are increasingly uncommon most games do not fully use multiple GPUs as most users cannot afford them Multiple GPUs are still used on supercomputers like in Summit on workstations to accelerate video processing multiple videos at once and D rendering for VFX GPGPU workloads and for simulations and in AI to expedite training as is the case with Nvidia s lineup of DGX workstations and servers Tesla GPUs and Intel s Ponte Vecchio GPUs br br br Integrated graphics processing unit br br Integrated graphics processing units IGPU integrated graphics shared graphics solutions integrated graphics processors IGP or unified memory architectures UMA use a portion of a computer s system RAM rather than dedicated graphics memory IGPs can be integrated onto a motherboard as part of its northbridge chipset or on the same die integrated circuit with the CPU like AMD APU or Intel HD Graphics On certain motherboards AMD s IGPs can use dedicated sideport memory a separate fixed block of high performance memory that is dedicated for use by the GPU As of early computers with integrated graphics account for about of all PC shipments They are less costly to implement than dedicated graphics processing but tend to be less capable Historically integrated processing was considered unfit for D games or graphically intensive programs but could run less intensive programs such as Adobe Flash Examples of such IGPs would be offerings from SiS and VIA circa However modern integrated graphics processors such as AMD Accelerated Processing Unit and Intel Graphics Technology HD UHD Iris Iris Pro Iris Plus and Xe LP can handle D graphics or low stress D graphics br Since GPU computations are memory intensive integrated processing may compete with the CPU for relatively slow system RAM as it has minimal or no dedicated video memory IGPs use system memory with bandwidth up to a current maximum of GB s whereas a discrete graphics card may have a bandwidth of more than GB s between its VRAM and GPU core This memory bus bandwidth can limit the performance of the GPU though multi channel memory can mitigate this deficiency Older integrated graphics chipsets lacked hardware transform and lighting but newer ones include it br On systems with Unified Memory Architecture UMA including modern AMD processors with integrated graphics modern Intel processors with integrated graphics Apple processors the PS and Xbox Series among others the CPU cores and the GPU block share the same pool of RAM and memory address space This allows the system to dynamically allocate memory between the CPU cores and the GPU block based on memory needs without needing a large static split of the RAM and thanks to zero copy transfers removes the need for either copying data over a bus computing between physically separate RAM pools or copying between separate address spaces on a single physical pool of RAM allowing more efficient transfer of data br br br Hybrid graphics processing br Hybrid GPUs compete with integrated graphics in the low end desktop and notebook markets The most common implementations of this are ATI s HyperMemory and Nvidia s TurboCache br Hybrid graphics cards are somewhat more expensive than integrated graphics but much less expensive than dedicated graphics cards They share memory with the system and have a small dedicated memory cache to make up for the high latency of the system RAM Technologies within PCI Express make this possible While these solutions are sometimes advertised as having as much as MB of RAM this refers to how much can be shared with the system memory br br br Stream processing and general purpose GPUs GPGPU br br It is common to use a general purpose graphics processing unit GPGPU as a modified form of stream processor or a vector processor running compute kernels This turns the massive computational power of a modern graphics accelerator s shader pipeline into general purpose computing power In certain applications requiring massive vector operations this can yield several orders of magnitude higher performance than a conventional CPU The two largest discrete see Dedicated graphics processing unit above GPU designers AMD and Nvidia are pursuing this approach with an array of applications Both Nvidia and AMD teamed with Stanford University to create a GPU based client for the Folding home distributed computing project for protein folding calculations In certain circumstances the GPU calculates forty times faster than the CPUs traditionally used by such applications br GPGPUs can be used for many types of embarrassingly parallel tasks including ray tracing They are generally suited to high throughput computations that exhibit data parallelism to exploit the wide vector width SIMD architecture of the GPU br GPU based high performance computers play a significant role in large scale modelling Three of the ten most powerful supercomputers in the world take advantage of GPU acceleration br GPUs support API extensions to the C programming language such as OpenCL and OpenMP Furthermore each GPU vendor introduced its own API which only works with their cards AMD APP SDK from AMD and CUDA from Nvidia These allow functions called compute kernels to run on the GPU s stream processors This makes it possible for C programs to take advantage of a GPU s ability to operate on large buffers in parallel while still using the CPU when appropriate CUDA was the first API to allow CPU based applications to directly access the resources of a GPU for more general purpose computing without the limitations of using a graphics API br Since there has been interest in using the performance offered by GPUs for evolutionary computation in general and for accelerating the fitness evaluation in genetic programming in particular Most approaches compile linear or tree programs on the host PC and transfer the executable to the GPU to be run Typically a performance advantage is only obtained by running the single active program simultaneously on many example problems in parallel using the GPU s SIMD architecture However substantial acceleration can also be obtained by not compiling the programs and instead transferring them to the GPU to be interpreted there Acceleration can then be obtained by either interpreting multiple programs simultaneously simultaneously running multiple example problems or combinations of both A modern GPU can simultaneously interpret hundreds of thousands of very small programs br br br External GPU eGPU br An external GPU is a graphics processor located outside of the housing of the computer similar to a large external hard drive External graphics processors are sometimes used with laptop computers Laptops might have a substantial amount of RAM and a sufficiently powerful central processing unit CPU but often lack a powerful graphics processor and instead have a less powerful but more energy efficient on board graphics chip On board graphics chips are often not powerful enough for playing video games or for other graphically intensive tasks such as editing video or D animation rendering br Therefore it is desirable to attach a GPU to some external bus of a notebook PCI Express is the only bus used for this purpose The port may be for example an ExpressCard or mPCIe port PCIe up to or Gbit s respectively a Thunderbolt or port PCIe up to or Gbit s respectively or an OCuLink port Those ports are only available on certain notebook systems eGPU enclosures include their own power supply PSU because powerful GPUs can consume hundreds of watts br Official vendor support for external GPUs has gained traction A milestone was Apple s decision to support external GPUs with MacOS High Sierra Several major hardware vendors HP Razer released Thunderbolt eGPU enclosures This support fuels eGPU implementations by enthusiasts br br br Energy efficiency br br br Sales br In million GPUs were shipped globally and the forecast for was million
