title: Pointing stick
id: 238799
A pointing stick or trackpoint also referred to generically as a nub or nipple is a small analog stick used as a pointing device typically mounted centrally in a computer keyboard Like other pointing devices such as mice touchpads or trackballs operating system software translates manipulation of the device into movements of the pointer on the computer screen Unlike other pointing devices it reacts to sustained force or strain rather than to gross movement so it is called an isometric pointing device IBM introduced it commercially in on its laptops under the name TrackPoint and patented an improved version of it in but the patent expired in It has been used for business laptops such as Acer s TravelMate Dell s Latitude HP s EliteBook and Lenovo s ThinkPad br The pointing stick senses applied force by using two pairs of resistive strain gauges A pointing stick can be used by pushing with the fingers in the general direction the user wants the pointer to move The velocity of the pointer depends on the applied force so increasing pressure causes faster movement The relation between pressure and pointer speed can be adjusted just as mouse speed is adjusted br On a QWERTY keyboard the stick is typically embedded between the G H and B keys and the mouse buttons are placed just below the space bar The mouse buttons can be operated right handed or left handed due to their placement below the keyboard along the centerline This pointing device has also appeared next to screens on compact sized laptops such as the Toshiba Libretto and Sony VAIO UX br br br Variants br Pointing sticks typically have a replaceable rubber cap called a nub which can be a slightly rough eraser head material or another shape br The cap is red on ThinkPads but is also found in other colors on other machines It may be gray pink black or blue on some Dell models blue on some HP Compaq laptops and green or gray on most Toshiba laptops produced before the s br Button configurations vary depending on vendor and laptop model ThinkPads have a prominent middle mouse button but some models have no physical buttons Toshiba employs concentric arcs br In the early s Zenith Data Systems shipped a number of laptop computers equipped with a device called J Mouse which essentially used a special keyswitch under the J key to allow the J keycap to be used as a pointing stick br In addition to appearing between the G H and B keys on a QWERTY keyboard these devices or similar can also appear on gaming devices as an alternative to a D pad or analog stick On certain Toshiba Libretto mini laptops the pointing stick was located next to the display IBM sold a mouse with a pointing stick in the location where a scroll wheel is common now br br Optical pointing sticks are also used on some Ultrabook tablet hybrids such as the Sony Duo ThinkPad Tablet and Samsung Ativ Q br On the Gateway Liberty laptop the pointing stick is above the enter key on the right side of the keyboard br A pointing stick was featured in the New Nintendo DS as a secondary analog stick known as the C Stick br br br Design challenges br The IBM TrackPoint III and the TrackPoint IV have a feature called Negative Inertia that causes the pointer s velocity to overreact when it is accelerated or decelerated Negative Inertia is intended to avoid the feeling of inertia or sluggishness when starting or stopping movement Usability tests at IBM have shown that it is easier for users to position the pointer with Negative Inertia and performance is better br Another challenge with pointing stick design is identification of the zero position the position where no motion is desired Because the amount of motion is small the sensitivity of the sensors must be high and they are subject to noise interference br A typical solution which assumes that pointing sticks frequently go out of calibration is to interpret a variation below a certain threshold over a given interval perhaps one or several seconds as being a neutral stick However the recalibration can also allow brief periods of drifting movement of the pointer while the user is not moving the pointing stick br In practice if the re calibration interval is set too short and if the user applies moderately consistent pressure to the stick for such an interval this method results in an incorrect zero point Additional pressure again moves the pointer but the calibration may occur again requiring even more force If the user releases pressure at this point the change will be interpreted as an instruction to move the opposite direction In time the software will re calibrate and stop the motion br Additionally if press to select is enabled the software may generate unexpected click events by touching the pointing stick during typing br br br History br In Ted Selker a researcher at PARC worked on a pointing stick based on a study showing that it takes a typist seconds to shift from the keyboard to the mouse and comparable time to shift back Selker built a model of a device that would minimize this time It was only three years later working at IBM that Selker refined his design resulting in the TrackPoint product for which IBM received US patents in and br Pointing sticks were the dominant pointing device for laptops before the advent of the touchpad During later years they faced a decline in popularity as most laptop producing brands switched to touchpads although as of some manufacturers like Lenovo still produce laptops with pointing sticks br br br Problem scope br br br Space constraints br br The pointing stick can be used in ultra compact netbooks where there would be no place for a touchpad br br br Finger motion reduction br The pointing stick is positioned such that the hands do not need to be removed from the home row to manipulate the mouse pointer br br br Continuous motion br Some people find them more appealing for mobile gaming than a touchpad because the trackpoint allows infinite movement without repositioning This is because a user s finger may run off the edge of a touchpad while positioning the pointer requiring them to reposition their finger in order to continue br br br Ergonomics br Some users feel that pointing sticks cause less wrist strain because a user does not need to avoid resting wrists on a touchpad which are usually located just below the keyboard One criticism is that because the pointing stick depends on the user s applying pressure it can cause hand cramps although this can be partly solved by setting the sensitivity higher and lifting the finger when the pointer is not being moved br Another criticism is that it stresses the index finger and may lead to repetitive strain injury br A number of ergonomic studies to compare trackpoint and touchpad performance have been performed Most studies find that touchpad is slightly faster one study found that the touchpad was operated faster than the trackpoint Another study found that average object selection time was faster with a touchpad seconds compared to seconds with a trackpoint and object manipulation took seconds with a touchpad on average against seconds with trackpoint br br br Naming and brands br br br Informal names br Various informal names have been invented including nub clit mouse which is an intercommunity term usually seen on ThinkPad forums and nipple mouse br br br Other uses br While typically employed on a computer keyboard IBM included one on its Trackpoint Mouse product suggested uses included scrolling as with a scroll wheel or a
