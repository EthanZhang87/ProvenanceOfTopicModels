A dance pad also known as a dance mat or dance platform is a flat electronic game controller used for input in dance games Most dance pads are divided into a matrix of square panels for the player to stand on with some or all of the panels corresponding to directions or actions within the game Some dance pads also have extra buttons outside the main stepping area such as Start and Select Pairs of dance pads often are joined side by side for certain gameplay modes br Popular arcade games such as Dance Dance Revolution In the Groove Pump It Up and StepManiaX use large steel dance platforms connected to the arcade cabinet whereas versions for home consoles usually use smaller often flexible plastic pads These home pads are specifically made for systems such as the GameCube Wii Dreamcast Japan only PlayStation PlayStation and Xbox but can also be used in computer simulators such as StepMania through the use of special adapters br br br Types br br br Soft br br Soft pads are thin and made of plastic They generally cost USD They are good for beginners to dance games or casual use but they have a tendency to move around and wrinkle up during gameplay unless modded such as by gluing or taping them to the top of a piece of plywood or the bottom of a transparent office chair mat They are not usually durable and may wear out easily but for light use they are quite suitable Manufacturers of soft pads include Konami BNSUSA RedOctane Intec Mad Catz Beat Pad MyMyBox Naki International and Nintendo Action Pad OEM manufacturers include Topway manufacturer of RedOctane pads Futime and many others br Some soft pads contain stiff foam inserts of the dense or hard varieties to provide more stability and durability The inserts usually ship as three or six puzzle pieces to allow for a smaller box which fit together using a dovetail joint and slide into the dance pad which then zips closed around the foam Certain brands of foam pads put raised plastic sections under the directional buttons to allow them to be more easily felt by a player s feet so as to help keep them centered on the pad These pads generally cost between and br It is also possible to modify a pad by attaching it to a hard surface and optionally covering it with clear material this can increase pad life and keep it from slipping around br br br Hard br br Hard pads are usually constructed with metal and sometimes wood for durability and usually come with a raised bar behind the player Arcade machines use very durable metal pads that are designed for heavy use Other hard pads can be purchased for home use with a video game system the prices can be around US to for double pads to online Manufacturers of hard pads include DDRgame Cobalt Flux L TEK MyMyBox Brown Box RedOctane ceased production as of February due to company termination and Naki International br Hard pads are used in all arcade versions of music games that employ dance pads and often serve as the nec plus ultra for DIY Gamers that attempt to construct Homebrew pads Many Homebrew kits are ultimately instruction guides for converting soft pads into hard pads although Homebrew hard pads often feature additional functions such as additional inputs see below br br br Solid State br Solid State pads replace the usual mechanical switch and contact used in other hard pads A proximity sensor is used to detect a player s steps on the pad The advantages of a solid state design is that they do not require pressure to activate eliminating moving parts that might break down and keeping dirt from getting into the mechanism br br br Caveats br Problems are often encountered when attempting to use a PlayStation pad with a computer simulator Most PlayStation PC adapters will not register Up and Down or Left and Right simultaneously initially although they are common jumps in dance games This is because normal PlayStation games do not require such input and because D pads are not usually designed to physically permit such input StepMania s website has a section concerning adapter compatibility Although these devices may work on a PC to date the adapters will not work with consoles that have built in USB ports such as the PlayStation and the Xbox br Purchasers of home pads should be aware of the number and arrangement of active arrow panels that are required by the game s they want to play Although most commercial pads have four arrow panels DDR In The Groove some have five Pump It Up six Dance Dance Revolution Solo eight Dance UK MC Groovz Dance Craze or nine Technomotion br br br Homebrew pads br br Not satisfied with the cost and or reliability of factory assembled metal dance pads many players construct their own dance pad Using common materials such as plywood sheet metal and acrylic glass or polycarbonate found at local hardware stores do it yourselfers are able to construct a pad that is often much more durable and more authentic feeling than commercially built hard pads Some homebrew pads have extra features such as additional arrows for playing Pump It Up or DDR Solo menu switches and pushbuttons and bars Furthermore the homebrew pads are easier to repair because they use common parts and are usually designed for easy disassembly br While some homebrew pads use custom electronics built from scratch most homebrew pads make use a circuit board from a standard controller to simplify the process of interfacing the pad with a gaming system The controller used depends on the system that the pad is intended to be played with GameCube PlayStation Xbox or PC br Homebrew pads use a variety of technologies for designing the arrows that the player is supposed to step on The most common design uses metal contacts that sandwich together when the player steps on the pad or arcade button switches but some novel ideas have been proposed such as the use of optical pressure vibration or proximity sensors br Due to the amount of work needed to create a custom metal pad some players instead opt to modify their existing soft pads Most of the time players will sometimes take plywood sheets acrylic or office chair floor protectors and staple it to their soft pads This effectively cures wrinkling and makes the pad more durable to use while wearing shoes br br br Educational use br A dance pad has been also used in experimental systems for navigating
