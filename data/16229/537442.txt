High Definition Multimedia Interface HDMI is a proprietary audio video interface for transmitting uncompressed video data and compressed or uncompressed digital audio data from an HDMI compliant source device such as a display controller to a compatible computer monitor video projector digital television or digital audio device HDMI is a digital replacement for analog video standards br br HDMI implements the ANSI CTA standard which defines video formats and waveforms transport of compressed and uncompressed LPCM audio auxiliary data and implementations of the VESA EDID p III CEA signals carried by HDMI are electrically compatible with the CEA signals used by the Digital Visual Interface DVI No signal conversion is necessary nor is there a loss of video quality when a DVI to HDMI adapter is used C The Consumer Electronics Control CEC capability allows HDMI devices to control each other when necessary and allows the user to operate multiple devices with one handheld remote control device br Several versions of HDMI have been developed and deployed since the initial release of the technology occasionally introducing new connectors with smaller form factors but all versions still use the same basic pinout and are compatible with all connector types and cables Other than improved audio and video capacity performance resolution and color spaces newer versions have optional advanced features such as D Ethernet data connection and CEC extensions br Production of consumer HDMI products started in late In Europe either DVI HDCP or HDMI is included in the HD ready in store labeling specification for TV sets for HDTV formulated by EICTA with SES Astra in HDMI began to appear on consumer HDTVs in and camcorders and digital still cameras in As of January nearly billion HDMI devices have been sold br br br History br The HDMI founders were Hitachi Panasonic Philips Silicon Image Sony Thomson and Toshiba Digital Content Protection LLC provides HDCP which was developed by Intel for HDMI HDMI has the support of motion picture producers Fox Universal Warner Bros and Disney along with system operators DirecTV EchoStar Dish Network and CableLabs br The HDMI founders began development on HDMI on April with the goal of creating an AV connector that was backward compatible with DVI At the time DVI HDCP DVI with HDCP and DVI HDTV DVI HDCP using the CEA B video standard were being used on HDTVs HDMI was designed to improve on DVI HDTV by using a smaller connector and adding audio capability and enhanced Y CBCR capability and consumer electronics control functions br The first Authorized Testing Center ATC which tests HDMI products was opened by Silicon Image on June in California United States The first ATC in Japan was opened by Panasonic on May in Osaka The first ATC in Europe was opened by Philips on May in Caen France The first ATC in China was opened by Silicon Image on November in Shenzhen The first ATC in India was opened by Philips on June in Bangalore The HDMI website contains a list of all the ATCs br According to In Stat the number of HDMI devices sold was million in million in million in and million in HDMI has become the de facto standard for HDTVs and according to In Stat around of digital televisions in included HDMI In Stat has estimated that million HDMI devices were sold in On April there were over consumer electronics and PC companies that had adopted the HDMI specification HDMI adopters On January HDMI Licensing LLC announced that HDMI had reached an installed base of over million HDMI devices In Stat has estimated that million HDMI devices would sell in and that all digital televisions by the end of would have at least one HDMI input br On January In Stat reported that shipments of HDMI were expected to exceed those of DVI in driven primarily by the consumer electronics market br In PC Magazine awarded a Technical Excellence Award in the Home Theater category for an innovation that has changed the world to the CEC portion of the HDMI specification Ten companies were given a Technology and Engineering Emmy Award for their development of HDMI by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences on January br On October the HDMI Forum was established by the HDMI founders to create an open organization so that interested companies can participate in the development of the HDMI specification All members of the HDMI Forum have equal voting rights may participate in the Technical Working Group and if elected can be on the Board of Directors There is no limit to the number of companies allowed in the HDMI Forum though companies must pay an annual fee of US with an additional annual fee of for those companies that serve on the Board of Directors The Board of Directors is made up of companies who are elected every two years by a general vote of HDMI Forum members All future development of the HDMI specification take place in the HDMI Forum and are built upon the HDMI b specification Also on the same day HDMI Licensing LLC announced that there were over HDMI adopters and that over billion HDMI enabled products had shipped since the launch of the HDMI standard From October all development of the HDMI specification became the responsibility of the newly created HDMI Forum br On January HDMI Licensing LLC announced that there were over HDMI adopters and that over billion HDMI devices had shipped since the launch of the HDMI standard The day also marked the th anniversary of the release of the first HDMI specification br As of January nearly billion HDMI devices had been sold br br br Specifications br The HDMI specification defines the protocols signals electrical interfaces and mechanical requirements of the standard p V The maximum pixel clock rate for HDMI is MHz which is sufficient to allow p and WUXGA at Hz HDMI increases that to MHz which allows for higher resolution such as WQXGA across a single digital link An HDMI connection can either be single link type A C D or dual link type B and can have a video pixel rate of MHz to MHz for a single link connection or MHz to MHz for a dual link connection Video formats with pixel rates below MHz like i at MHz are transmitted over TMDS links using a pixel repetition scheme br br br Audio video br HDMI uses the Consumer Technology Association Electronic Industries Alliance standards HDMI to HDMI a uses the EIA CEA B video standard HDMI uses the CEA D video standard and HDMI uses the CEA E video standard p III The CEA E document defines video formats and waveforms colorimetry and quantization transport of compressed and uncompressed LPCM audio carriage of auxiliary data and implementations of the Video Electronics Standards Association VESA Enhanced Extended Display Identification Data Standard E EDID On July the CEA announced the publication of CEA F a standard that can be used by video interfaces such as DVI HDMI and LVDS CEA F adds the ability to transmit several Ultra HD video formats and additional color spaces br To ensure baseline compatibility between different HDMI sources and displays as well as backward compatibility with the electrically compatible DVI standard all HDMI devices must implement the sRGB color space at bits per component Ability to use the Y CBCR color space and higher color depths deep color is optional HDMI permits sRGB chroma subsampling bits per component xvYCC chroma subsampling bits per component Y CBCR chroma subsampling bits per component or Y CBCR chroma subsampling bits per component The color spaces that can be used by HDMI are ITU R BT ITU R BT and IEC br For digital audio if an HDMI device has audio it is required to implement the baseline format stereo uncompressed PCM Other formats are optional with HDMI allowing up to channels of uncompressed audio at sample sizes of bits bits or bits with sample rates of kHz kHz kHz kHz kHz kHz or kHz HDMI also carries any IEC compliant compressed audio stream such as Dolby Digital and DTS and up to channels of one bit DSD audio used on Super Audio CDs at rates up to four times that of Super Audio CD With version HDMI allows lossless compressed audio streams Dolby TrueHD and DTS HD Master Audio As with the Y CBCR video audio capability is optional Audio return channel ARC is a feature introduced in the HDMI standard Return refers to the case where the audio comes from the TV and can be sent upstream to the AV receiver using the HDMI cable connected to the AV receiver An example given on the HDMI website is that a TV that directly receives a terrestrial satellite broadcast or has a video source built in sends the audio upstream to the AV receiver br The HDMI standard was not designed to pass closed caption data for example subtitles to the television for decoding As such any closed caption stream must be decoded and included as an image in the video stream s prior to transmission over an HDMI cable to appear on the DTV This limits the caption style even for digital captions to only that decoded at the source prior to HDMI transmission This also prevents closed captions when transmission over HDMI is required for upconversion For example a DVD player that sends an upscaled p i format via HDMI to an HDTV has no way to pass Closed Captioning data so that the HDTV can decode it as there is no line VBI in that format br br br Communication channels br br HDMI has three physically separate communication channels which are the DDC TMDS and the optional CEC HDMI added ARC and HEC br br br Display Data Channel DDC br br The Display Data Channel DDC is a communication channel based on the I C bus specification HDMI specifically requires the device implement the Enhanced Display Data Channel E DDC which is used by the HDMI source device to read the E EDID data from the HDMI sink device to learn what audio video formats it can take CEC CEC HDMI requires that the E DDC implement I C standard mode speed kbit s and allows it to optionally implement fast mode speed kbit s br The DDC channel is actively used for High bandwidth Digital Content Protection HDCP br br br Transition minimized differential signaling TMDS br Transition minimized differential signaling TMDS on HDMI interleaves video audio and auxiliary data using three different packet types called the video data period the data island period and the control period During the video data period the pixels of an active video line are transmitted During the data island period which occurs during the horizontal and vertical blanking intervals audio and auxiliary data are transmitted within a series of packets The control period occurs between video and data island periods br Both HDMI and DVI use TMDS to send bit characters that are encoded using b b encoding that differs from the original IBM form for the video data period and b b encoding for the control period HDMI adds the ability to send audio and auxiliary data using b b encoding for the data island period Each data island period is pixels in size and contains a bit packet header which includes bits of BCH ECC parity data for error correction and describes the contents of the packet Each packet contains four subpackets and each subpacket is bits in size including bits of BCH ECC parity data allowing for each packet to carry up to bits of audio data Each data island period can contain up to packets Seven of the packet types described in the HDMI a specifications deal with audio data while the other types deal with auxiliary data Among these are the general control packet and the gamut metadata packet The general control packet carries information on AVMUTE which mutes the audio during changes that may cause audio noise and color depth which sends the bit depth of the current video stream and is required for deep color The gamut metadata packet carries information on the color space being used for the current video stream and is required for xvYCC br br br Consumer Electronics Control CEC br br Consumer Electronics Control CEC is an HDMI feature designed to allow the user to command and control up to CEC enabled devices that are connected through HDMI by using only one of their remote controls for example by controlling a television set set top box and DVD player using only the remote control of the TV CEC also allows for individual CEC enabled devices to command and control each other without user intervention CEC br It is a one wire bidirectional serial bus that is based on the CENELEC standard AV link protocol to perform remote control functions CEC wiring is mandatory although implementation of CEC in a product is optional It was defined in HDMI Specification and updated in HDMI HDMI a and HDMI a which added timer and audio commands to the bus CEC CEC CEC CEC USB to CEC adapters exist that allow a computer to control CEC enabled devices br br br HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel br Introduced in HDMI HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel HEAC adds a high speed bidirectional data communication link HEC and the ability to send audio data upstream to the source device ARC HEAC utilizes two lines from the connector the previously unused Reserved pin called HEAC and the Hot Plug Detect pin called HEAC HEAC If only ARC transmission is required a single mode signal using the HEAC line can be used otherwise HEC is transmitted as a differential signal over the pair of lines and ARC as a common mode component of the pair HEAC br br Audio Return Channel ARC br ARC is an audio link meant to replace other cables between the TV and the A V receiver or speaker system This direction is used when the TV is the one that generates or receives the video stream instead of the other equipment A typical case is the running of an app on a smart TV such as Netflix but reproduction of audio is handled by the other equipment Without ARC the audio output from the TV must be routed by another cable typically TOSLink or RCA into the speaker system br br HDMI Ethernet Channel HEC br HDMI Ethernet Channel technology consolidates video audio and data streams into a single HDMI cable and the HEC feature enables IP based applications over HDMI and provides a bidirectional Ethernet communication at Mbit s The physical layer of the Ethernet implementation uses a hybrid to simultaneously send and receive attenuated BASE TX type signals through a single twisted pair br br br Compatibility with DVI br br HDMI is backward compatible with single link Digital Visual Interface digital video DVI D or DVI I but not DVI A or dual link DVI No signal conversion is required when an adapter or asymmetric cable is used so there is no loss of video quality appx C br From a user s perspective an HDMI display can be driven by a single link DVI D source since HDMI and DVI D define an overlapping minimum set of allowed resolutions and frame buffer formats to ensure a basic level of interoperability In the reverse case a DVI D monitor has the same level of basic interoperability unless content protection with High bandwidth Digital Content Protection HDCP interferes or the HDMI color encoding is in component color space Y CBCR instead of RGB which is not possible in DVI An HDMI source such as a Blu ray player may require an HDCP compliant display and refuse to output HDCP protected content to a non compliant display A further complication is that there is a small amount of display equipment such as some high end home theater projectors designed with HDMI inputs but not HDCP compliant br Any DVI to HDMI adapter can function as an HDMI to DVI adapter and vice versa Typically the only limitation is the gender of the adapter s connectors and the gender of the cables and sockets it is used with br Features specific to HDMI such as remote control and audio transport are not available in devices that use legacy DVI D signalling However many devices output HDMI over a DVI connector e g ATI series and NVIDIA GTX series video cards appx C and some multimedia displays may accept HDMI including audio over a DVI input Exact capabilities beyond basic compatibility vary Adapters are generally bi directional br br br Content protection HDCP br br High bandwidth Digital Content Protection HDCP is a newer form of digital rights management DRM Intel created the original technology to make sure that digital content followed the guidelines set by the Digital Content Protection group br HDMI can use HDCP to encrypt the signal if required by the source device Content Scramble System CSS Content Protection for Recordable Media CPRM and Advanced Access Content System AACS require the use of HDCP on HDMI when playing back encrypted DVD Video DVD Audio HD DVD and Blu ray Disc The HDCP repeater bit controls the authentication and switching distribution of an HDMI signal According to HDCP Specification beginning with HDMI CTS a any system that implements HDCP must do so in a fully compliant manner HDCP testing that was previously only a requirement for optional tests such as the Simplay HD testing program is now part of the requirements for HDMI compliance HDCP accommodates up to connected devices with up to levels using a combination of sources sinks and repeaters A simple example of this is several HDMI devices connected to an HDMI AV receiver that is connected to an HDMI display br Devices called HDCP strippers can remove the HDCP information from the video signal so the video can play on non HDCP compliant displays though a fair use and non disclosure form must usually be signed with a registering agency before use br br br Connectors br br There are five HDMI connector types Type A B are defined in the HDMI specification type C is defined in the HDMI specification and type D E are defined in the HDMI specification br br Type A br The plug male connector outside dimensions are mm mm and the receptacle female connector inside dimensions are mm mm There are pins with bandwidth to carry all SDTV EDTV HDTV UHD and K modes It is electrically compatible with single link DVI D br br Type B br This connector is mm mm and has pins carrying six differential pairs instead of three for use with very high resolution displays such as WQUXGA It is electrically compatible with dual link DVI D but as of August has not yet been used in any products With the introduction of HDMI the maximum bandwidth of single link HDMI exceeded that of dual link DVI D As of HDMI the pixel clock rate crossover frequency from single to dual link has not been defined br br Type C br This Mini connector is smaller than the type A plug measuring mm mm but has the same pin configuration It is intended for portable devices The differences are that all positive signals of the differential pairs are swapped with their corresponding shield the DDC CEC Ground is assigned to pin instead of pin the CEC is assigned to pin instead of pin and the reserved pin is instead of pin The type C Mini connector can be connected to a type A connector using a type A to type C cable br br Type D br This Micro connector shrinks the connector size to something resembling a micro USB connector measuring only mm mm fig For comparison a micro USB connector is mm mm and a USB Type A connector is mm mm It keeps the standard pins of types A and C but the pin assignment is different from both br br Type E br The Automotive Connection System has a locking tab to keep the cable from vibrating loose and a shell to help prevent moisture and dirt from interfering with the signals br The HDMI alternate mode lets a user connect the reversible USB C connector with the HDMI source devices mobile tablet laptop This cable connects to video display sink devices using any of the native HDMI connectors This is an HDMI cable in this case a USB C to HDMI cable br br br Cables br br An HDMI cable is composed of four shielded twisted pairs with impedance of the order of plus seven separate conductors HDMI cables with Ethernet differ in that three of the separate conductors instead form an additional shielded twisted pair with the CEC DDC ground as a shield HEAC br Although no maximum length for an HDMI cable is specified signal attenuation dependent on the cable s construction quality and conducting materials limits usable lengths in practice and certification is difficult to achieve for lengths beyond m HDMI defines two cable categories Category certified cables which have been tested at MHz which would include resolutions such as p and i and Category certified cables which have been tested at MHz which would include resolutions such as p and K Category HDMI cables are marketed as Standard and Category HDMI cables as High Speed This labeling guideline for HDMI cables went into effect on October Category and cables can either meet the required parameter specifications for inter pair skew far end crosstalk attenuation and differential impedance or they can meet the required non equalized equalized eye diagram requirements A cable of about meters feet can be manufactured to Category specifications easily and inexpensively by using AWG mm conductors With better quality construction and materials including AWG mm conductors an HDMI cable can reach lengths of up to meters feet Many HDMI cables under meters of length that were made before the HDMI specification can work as Category cables but only Category tested cables are guaranteed to work for Category purposes br As of the HDMI specification the following cable types are defined for HDMI in general br br Standard HDMI Cable up to i and p br Standard HDMI Cable with Ethernet br Standard Automotive HDMI Cable br High Speed HDMI Cable p K Hz D and deep color br High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet br A new certification program was introduced in October to certify that cables work at the Gbit s maximum bandwidth of the HDMI specification In addition to expanding the set of cable testing requirements the certification program introduces an EMI test to ensure cables minimize interference with wireless signals These cables are marked with an anti counterfeiting authentication label and are defined as br br Premium High Speed HDMI Cable br Premium High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet br In conjunction with the HDMI specification a third category of cable was announced on January called G Also known as Category HDMI or Ultra High Speed HDMI the cable is designed to support the Gbit s bandwidth of HDMI supporting K K K and K at Hz The cable is backwards compatible with the earlier HDMI devices using existing HDMI type A C and D connectors and includes HDMI Ethernet br br Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable G Cable K K K and K at Hz br br br Extenders br An HDMI extender is a single device or pair of devices powered with an external power source or with the V DC from the HDMI source Long cables can cause instability of HDCP and blinking on the screen due to the weakened DDC signal that HDCP requires HDCP DDC signals must be multiplexed with TMDS video signals to comply with HDCP requirements for HDMI extenders based on a single Category Category cable Several companies offer amplifiers equalizers and repeaters that can string several standard HDMI cables together Active HDMI cables use electronics within the cable to boost the signal and allow for HDMI cables of up to meters feet those based on HDBaseT can extend to meters HDMI extenders that are based on dual Category Category cable can extend HDMI to meters feet while HDMI extenders based on optical fiber can extend HDMI to meters feet br br br Licensing br The HDMI specification is not an open standard manufacturers need to be licensed by HDMI LA in order to implement HDMI in any product or component Companies that are licensed by HDMI LA are known as HDMI Adopters br DVI is the only interface that does not require a license for interfacing HDMI br br br HDMI adopters br While earlier versions of HDMI specs are available to the public for download only adopters have access to the latest standards HDMI b Only adopters have access to the compliance test specification CTS that is used for compliance and certification Compliance testing is required before any HDMI product can be legally sold br br Adopters have IP rights under Adopter Agreement br Adopters receive the right to use HDMI logos and TMs on their products and marketing materials br Adopters are listed on the HDMI website br Products from adopters are listed and marketed in the official HDMI product finder database br Adopters receive more exposure through combined marketing such as the annual HDMI Developers Conference and technology seminars br br br HDMI fee structure br There are two annual fee structures associated with being an HDMI adopter br br High volume more than units HDMI Adopter Agreement US per year br Low volume units or fewer HDMI Adopter Agreement US plus a flat US per unit administration fee br The annual fee is due upon the execution of the Adopter Agreement and must be paid on the anniversary of this date each year thereafter br The royalty fee structure is the same for all volumes The following variable per unit royalty is device based and not dependent on number of ports chips or connectors br br US for each end user licensed product br US if the HDMI logo is used on the product and promotional material the per unit fee drops from US to US br US if HDCP is implemented and HDMI logo is used the per unit fee drops from US to US br Use of HDMI logo requires compliance testing Adopters need to license HDCP separately br The HDMI royalty is only payable on licensed products that will be sold on a stand alone basis i e that are not incorporated into another licensed product that is subject to an HDMI royalty For example if a cable or IC is sold to an adopter who then includes it in a television subject to a royalty then the cable or IC maker would not pay a royalty and the television manufacturer would pay the royalty on the final product If the cable is sold directly to consumers then the cable would be subject to a royalty br br br Versions br br HDMI devices and cables are designed based on the HDMI Specification a document published by HDMI Licensing through version b or the HDMI Forum from version onward The HDMI Specification defines the minimum baseline requirements that all HDMI devices must adhere to for interoperability as well as a large set of optional features that HDMI devices may support The specification is periodically updated to add clarifications or define new capabilities that HDMI devices may implement Each new version of the specification expands the list of possible features but does not mandate support for new features in all devices or establish any classes of HDMI products which must support certain capabilities Version numbers do not refer to classes or tiers of products with certain levels of feature support and as such HDMI specification version numbers are not a method of describing support for specific features or describing the capabilities of an HDMI device or cable br In HDMI Licensing banned the use of version numbers in labeling HDMI products Instead HDMI devices should explicitly declare which features and capabilities they support For HDMI cables a speed rating system was established since feature support is not dependent on the cable apart from inline ethernet and ARC the cable only affects the maximum possible speed of the connection HDMI cables should be labeled with the appropriate speed certification i e Standard Speed High Speed or Ultra High Speed not a version number br br br Version br HDMI was released on December and is a single cable digital audio video connector interface The link architecture is based on DVI using exactly the same video transmission format but sending audio and other auxiliary data during the blanking intervals of the video stream HDMI allows a maximum TMDS clock of MHz Gbit s bandwidth per link the same as DVI It defines two connectors called Type A and Type B with pinouts based on the Single Link DVI D and Dual Link DVI D connectors respectively though the Type B connector was never used in any commercial products HDMI uses TMDS encoding for video transmission giving it Gbit s of video bandwidth or at Hz and channel LPCM kHz bit audio HDMI requires support for RGB video with optional support for Y CBCR and mandatory if the device has support for Y CBCR on other interfaces Color depth of bpc bit px or bpc bit px is allowed when using subsampling but only bpc bit px color depth is permitted when using RGB or Y CBCR Only the Rec and Rec color spaces are supported HDMI allows only specific pre defined video formats including all the formats defined in EIA CEA B and some additional formats listed in the HDMI Specification itself All HDMI sources sinks must also be capable of sending receiving native Single Link DVI video and be fully compliant with the DVI Specification br br br Version br HDMI was released on May and added support for DVD Audio br br br Version br HDMI was released on August and added the option of One Bit Audio used on Super Audio CDs at up to channels To make HDMI more suitable for use on PC devices version also removed the requirement that only explicitly supported formats be used It added the ability for manufacturers to create vendor specific formats allowing any arbitrary resolution and refresh rate rather than being limited to a pre defined list of supported formats In addition it added explicit support for several new formats including p at and Hz and relaxed the pixel format support requirements so that sources with only native RGB output PC sources would not be required to support Y CBCR output br HDMI a was released on December and fully specifies Consumer Electronic Control CEC features command sets and CEC compliance tests br br br Version br HDMI was released on June and increased the maximum TMDS clock to MHz Gbit s Like previous versions it uses TMDS encoding giving it a maximum video bandwidth of Gbit s sufficient for at Hz or at Hz It added support for bpc bpc and bpc color depth and bit px called deep color It also added support for the xvYCC color space in addition to the ITU R BT and BT color spaces supported by previous versions and added the ability to carry metadata defining color gamut boundaries It also optionally allows output of Dolby TrueHD and DTS HD Master Audio streams for external decoding by AV receivers It incorporates automatic audio syncing audio video sync capability It defined cable Categories and with Category cable being tested up to MHz and Category being tested up to MHz It also added the new HDMI Type C Mini connector for portable devices br HDMI a was released on November and had cable and sink modifications for HDMI Type C source termination recommendations and removed undershoot and maximum rise fall time limits It also changed CEC capacitance limits and CEC commands for timer control were brought back in an altered form with audio control commands added It also added the optional ability to stream SACD in its bitstream DST format rather than uncompressed raw DSD HDMI a is available to download free of charge after registration br br br Version br br HDMI was released on June and first came to market after Q of Retaining the bandwidth of the previous version HDMI defined standardized timings to use for at Hz at and Hz and added explicit support for at Hz with CTA timings It also added an HDMI Ethernet Channel HEC that accommodates a Mbit s Ethernet connection between the two HDMI connected devices so they can share an Internet connection introduced an audio return channel ARC D Over HDMI a new Micro HDMI Connector an expanded set of color spaces with the addition of sYCC Adobe RGB and Adobe YCC and an Automotive Connection System HDMI defined several stereoscopic D formats including field alternative interlaced frame packing a full resolution top bottom format line alternative full side by side half side by side full D depth and D depth graphics graphics depth WOWvx HDMI requires that D displays implement the frame packing D format at either p and p or p and p High Speed HDMI cables as defined in HDMI work with all HDMI features except for the HDMI Ethernet Channel which requires the new High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet defined in HDMI br HDMI a was released on March and added two mandatory D formats for broadcast content which was deferred with HDMI pending the direction of the D broadcast market HDMI a has defined mandatory D formats for broadcast game and movie content HDMI a requires that D displays implement the frame packing D format at either p and p or p and p side by side horizontal at either i or i and top and bottom at either p and p or p and p br HDMI b was released on October containing only minor clarifications to the a document HDMI b is the last version of the standard that HDMI LA is responsible for All later versions of the HDMI Specification are produced by the HDMI Forum created on October br br br Version br HDMI referred to by some manufacturers as HDMI UHD was released on September br HDMI increases the maximum bandwidth to Gbit s HDMI uses TMDS encoding for video transmission like previous versions giving it a maximum video bandwidth of Gbit s This enables HDMI to carry K video at Hz with bit px color depth Other features of HDMI include support for the Rec color space up to audio channels up to kHz audio sample frequency dual video streams to multiple users on the same screen up to four audio streams chroma subsampling fps D formats support for the aspect ratio dynamic synchronization of video and audio streams the HE AAC and DRA audio standards improved D capability and additional CEC functions br HDMI a was released on April and added support for High Dynamic Range HDR video with static metadata br HDMI b was released March HDMI b initially supported the same HDR standard as HDMI a as specified in the CTA specification In December additional support for HDR Video transport was added to HDMI b in the CTA G specification which extends the static metadata signaling to include hybrid log gamma HLG br br br Version br HDMI was officially announced by the HDMI Forum on January and was released on November It adds support for higher resolutions and higher refresh rates including K Hz and K Hz HDMI also introduces a new HDMI cable category called Ultra High Speed referred to as G during development which certifies cables at the new higher speeds that these formats require Ultra High Speed HDMI cables are backwards compatible with older HDMI devices and older cables are compatible with new HDMI devices though the full Gbit s bandwidth is only supported with the new cables br Some systems may not be able to use HDMI because the HDMI Forum is preventing its use in open source implementations such as Linux open source drivers Users of those systems may need to use DisplayPort instead to access high resolutions and speeds br The following features were added to the HDMI Specification br br Maximum supported format is K at Hz br Dynamic HDR for specifying HDR metadata on a scene by scene or even a frame by frame basis br Note While HDMI did standardize transport of dynamic HDR metadata over HDMI in actuality it only formalized dynamic metadata interfaces already utilized by Dolby Vision and HDR in HDMI which is why neither Dolby Vision nor HDR require HDMI to function properly br Display Stream Compression DSC is used for video formats higher than K with chroma subsampling br High Frame Rate HFR for K K and K which adds support for refresh rates up to Hz br Enhanced Audio Return Channel eARC for object based audio formats such as Dolby Atmos and DTS X br Enhanced refresh rate and latency reduction features br Variable Refresh Rate VRR reduces or eliminates lag stutter and frame tearing for more fluid motion in games br Quick Media Switching QMS for movies and video eliminates the delay that can result in blank screens before content begins to be displayed br Quick Frame Transport QFT reduces latency by bursting individual pictures across the HDMI link as fast as possible when the link s hardware supports more bandwidth than the minimum amount needed for the resolution and frame rate of the content With QFT individual pictures arrive earlier and some hardware blocks can be fully powered off for longer periods of time between pictures to reduce heat generation and extend battery life br Auto Low Latency Mode ALLM When a display device supports the option to either optimize its pixel processing for best latency or best pixel processing ALLM allows the current HDMI source device to automatically select based on its better understanding of the nature of its own content which mode the user would most likely prefer br Video formats that require more bandwidth than Gbit s K Hz bpc RGB such as K Hz bpc HDR K Hz and K Hz may require the new Ultra High Speed or Ultra High Speed with Ethernet cables HDMI s other new features are supported with existing HDMI cables br The increase in maximum bandwidth is achieved by increasing both the bitrate of the data channels and the number of channels Previous HDMI versions use three data channels each operating at up to Gbit s in HDMI or up to Gbit s in HDMI with an additional channel for the TMDS clock signal which runs at a fraction of the data channel speed one tenth the speed or up to MHz for signaling rates up to Gbit s one fortieth the speed or up to MHz for signaling rates between and Gbit s HDMI doubles the signaling rate of the data channels to Gbit s The structure of the data has been changed to use a new packet based format with an embedded clock signal which allows what was formerly the TMDS clock channel to be used as a fourth data channel instead increasing the signaling rate across that channel to Gbit s as well These changes increase the aggregate bandwidth from Gbit s Gbit s to Gbit s Gbit s a improvement in bandwidth In addition the data is transmitted more efficiently by using a b b encoding scheme which uses a larger percentage of the bandwidth for data rather than DC balancing compared to the TMDS scheme used by previous versions compared to This in combination with the bandwidth raises the maximum data rate of HDMI from Gbit s to Gbit s Subtracting overhead for FEC the usable data rate is approximately Gbit s around the data rate of HDMI br The Gbit s bandwidth provided by HDMI is enough for K resolution at approximately Hz with bpc RGB or Y CBCR color To achieve even higher formats HDMI can use Display Stream Compression DSC with a compression ratio of up to Using DSC formats up to K Hz or K Hz at bpc RGB are possible Using Y CBCR with or chroma subsampling in combination with DSC can allow for even higher formats br HDMI a was released on February and added support for Source Based Tone Mapping SBTM br HDMI b was released on August br br br Version comparison br br br Main specifications br br br Refresh frequency limits for common resolutions br The maximum limits for TMDS transmission are calculated using standard data rate calculations For FRL transmission the limits are calculated using the capacity computation algorithm provided by the HDMI Specification All calculations assume uncompressed RGB video with CVT RB v timing Maximum limits may differ if compression i e DSC or Y CBCR chroma subsampling are used br Display manufacturers may also use non standard blanking intervals a Vendor Specific Timing Format as defined in the HDMI Specification rather than CVT RB v to achieve even higher frequencies when bandwidth is a constraint The refresh frequencies in the below table do not represent the absolute maximum limit of each interface but rather an estimate based on a modern standardized timing formula The minimum blanking intervals and therefore the exact maximum frequency that can be achieved will depend on the display and how many secondary data packets it requires and therefore will differ from model to model br br br Refresh frequency limits for standard video br HDMI and are restricted to transmitting only certain video formats defined in EIA CEA B and in the HDMI Specification itself HDMI and all later versions allow any arbitrary resolution and frame rate within the bandwidth limit Formats that are not supported by the HDMI Specification i e no standardized timings defined may be implemented as a vendor specific format Successive versions of the HDMI Specification continue to add support for additional formats such as K resolutions but the added support is to establish standardized timings to ensure interoperability between products not to establish which formats are or are not permitted Video formats do not require explicit support from the HDMI Specification in order to be transmitted and displayed br Individual products may have heavier limitations than those listed below since HDMI devices are not required to support the maximum bandwidth of the HDMI version that they implement Therefore it is not guaranteed that a display will support the refresh rates listed in this table even if the display has the required HDMI version br Uncompressed bpc bit px color depth and RGB or Y CBCR color format are assumed on this table except where noted br br br Refresh frequency limits for HDR video br HDR requires bpc bit px color depth which uses more bandwidth than standard bpc video br Uncompressed bpc color depth and RGB or Y CBCR color format are assumed on this table except where noted br br br Feature support br The features defined in the HDMI Specification that an HDMI device may implement are listed below For historical interest the version of the HDMI Specification in which the feature was first added is also listed All features of the HDMI Specification are optional HDMI devices may implement any combination of these features br Although the HDMI version numbers are commonly misused as a way of indicating that a device supports certain features this notation has no official meaning and is considered improper by HDMI Licensing There is no officially defined correlation between features supported by a device and any claimed version numbers as version numbers refer to historical editions of the HDMI Specification

br br Display Stream Compression br Display Stream Compression DSC is a VESA developed video compression algorithm designed to enable increased display resolutions and frame rates over existing physical interfaces and make devices smaller and lighter with longer battery life br br br Applications br br br Blu ray Disc and HD DVD players br Blu ray Disc and HD DVD introduced in offer high fidelity audio features that require HDMI for best results HDMI can transport Dolby Digital Plus Dolby TrueHD and DTS HD Master Audio bitstreams in compressed form This capability allows for an AV receiver with the necessary decoder to decode the compressed audio stream The Blu ray specification does not include video encoded with either deep color or xvYCC thus HDMI can transfer Blu ray discs at full video quality br The HDMI specification released in added support for D video and is used by all Blu ray D compatible players br The Blu ray Disc Association BDA spokespersons have stated Sept at IFA show in Berlin Germany that the Blu ray Ultra HD players and K discs are expected to be available starting in the second half to It is anticipated that such Blu ray UHD players will be required to include a HDMI output that supports HDCP br Blu ray permits secondary audio decoding whereby the disc content can tell the player to mix multiple audio sources together before final output Some Blu ray and HD DVD players can decode all of the audio codecs internally and can output LPCM audio over HDMI Multichannel LPCM can be transported over an HDMI connection and as long as the AV receiver implements multichannel LPCM audio over HDMI and implements HDCP the audio reproduction is equal in resolution to HDMI bitstream output Some low cost AV receivers such as the Onkyo TX SR do not allow audio processing over HDMI and are labelled as HDMI pass through devices Virtually all modern AV Receivers now offer HDMI inputs and outputs with processing for all of the audio formats offered by Blu ray Discs and other HD video sources During several manufacturers introduced premium AV Receivers that include one or multiple HDMI inputs along with a HDMI output s However not until did most major manufacturers of AV receivers also support HDCP as needed to support certain high quality UHD video sources such as Blu ray UHD players br br br Digital cameras and camcorders br Most consumer camcorders as well as many digital cameras are equipped with a mini HDMI connector type C connector br Some cameras also have K capability br although cameras capable of HD video often include an HDMI interface for playback or even live preview the image processor and the video processor of cameras usable for uncompressed video must be able to deliver the full image resolution at the specified frame rate in real time without any missing frames causing jitter Therefore usable uncompressed video out of HDMI is often called clean HDMI br br br Personal computers br br Personal computer PCs with a DVI interface are capable of video output to an HDMI enabled monitor appx C Some PCs include an HDMI interface and may also be capable of HDMI audio output depending on specific hardware For example Intel s motherboard chipsets since the G and NVIDIA s GeForce motherboard chipsets are capable of channel LPCM output over HDMI Eight channel LPCM audio output over HDMI with a video card was first seen with the ATI Radeon HD which was released in June and is implemented by other video cards in the ATI Radeon HD series Linux can drive channel LPCM audio over HDMI if the video card has the necessary hardware and implements the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture ALSA The ATI Radeon HD series implements ALSA Cyberlink announced in June that they would update their PowerDVD playback software to allow kHz bit Blu ray Disc audio decoding in Q Q of Corel s WinDVD Plus currently has kHz bit Blu ray Disc audio decoding br Even with an HDMI output a computer may not be able to produce signals that implement HDCP Microsoft s Protected Video Path or Microsoft s Protected Audio Path Several early graphic cards were labelled as HDCP enabled but did not have the hardware needed for HDCP this included some graphic cards based on the ATI X chipset and certain models of the NVIDIA Geforce series The first computer monitors that could process HDCP were released in by February a dozen different models had been released The Protected Video Path was enabled in graphic cards that had HDCP capability since it was required for output of Blu ray Disc and HD DVD video In comparison the Protected Audio Path was required only if a lossless audio bitstream such as Dolby TrueHD or DTS HD MA was output Uncompressed LPCM audio however does not require a Protected Audio Path and software programs such as PowerDVD and WinDVD can decode Dolby TrueHD and DTS HD MA and output it as LPCM A limitation is that if the computer does not implement a Protected Audio Path the audio must be downsampled to bit kHz but can still output at up to channels No graphic cards were released in that implemented the Protected Audio Path br The Asus Xonar HDAV became the first HDMI sound card that implemented the Protected Audio Path and could both bitstream and decode lossless audio Dolby TrueHD and DTS HD MA although bitstreaming is only available if using the ArcSoft TotalMedia Theatre software It has an HDMI input output and Asus says that it can work with most video cards on the market br br In September AMD announced the ATI Radeon HD series video cards which have HDMI output deep color xvYCC wide gamut capability and high bit rate audio channel LPCM over HDMI and an integrated HD audio controller with a Protected Audio Path that allows bitstream output over HDMI for AAC Dolby AC Dolby TrueHD and DTS HD Master Audio formats The ATI Radeon HD released in September is the first video card that allows bitstream output over HDMI for Dolby TrueHD and DTS HD Master Audio The AMD Radeon HD series implements HDMI a The AMD Radeon HD series implements HDMI b br In December it was announced that several computer vendors and display makers including Intel AMD Dell Lenovo Samsung and LG would stop using LVDS actually FPD Link from and legacy DVI and VGA connectors from replacing them with DisplayPort and HDMI br On August Asus announced a new in cm monitor that produces its native resolution of via HDMI br On September Nvidia launched GeForce GTX and GTX with GM chip with HDMI support On January GeForce GTX with GM chip launched with HDMI support On March

PlayStation br br br Tablet computers br br Some tablet computers implement HDMI using Micro HDMI Type D port while others like the Eee Pad Transformer implement the standard using mini HDMI type C ports All iPad models have a special A V adapter that converts Apple s Lightning connector to a standard HDMI Type A port Samsung has a similar proprietary thirty pin port for their Galaxy Tab that could adapt to HDMI as well as USB drives The Dell Streak smartphone tablet hybrid is capable of outputting over HDMI While the Streak uses a PDMI port a separate cradle adds HDMI compatibility Some tablets running Android OS provide HDMI output using a mini HDMI type C port Most new laptops and desktops now have built in HDMI as well br br br Mobile phones br Many mobile phones can produce an output of HDMI video via a micro HDMI connector SlimPort MHL or other adapter br br br Legacy compatibility br HDMI can only be used with older analog only devices using connections such as SCART VGA RCA etc by means of a digital to analog converter or AV receiver as the interface does not carry any analog signals unlike DVI where devices with DVI I ports accept or provide either digital or analog signals Cables are available that contain the necessary electronics but it is important to distinguish these active converter cables from passive HDMI to VGA cables which are typically cheaper as they don t include any electronics The passive cables are only useful if a user has a device that is generating or expecting HDMI signals on a VGA connector or VGA signals on an HDMI connector this is a non standard feature not implemented by most devices br br br HDMI Alternate Mode for USB Type C br The HDMI Alternate Mode for USB C allows HDMI enabled sources with a USB C connector to directly connect to standard HDMI display devices without requiring an adapter The standard was released in September and supports all HDMI b features such as video resolutions up to Ultra HD Hz and CEC Previously the similar DisplayPort Alternate Mode could be used to connect to HDMI displays from USB Type C sources but where in that case active adapters were required to convert from DisplayPort to HDMI HDMI Alternate Mode connects to the display natively br The Alternate Mode reconfigures the four SuperSpeed differential pairs present in USB C to carry the three HDMI TMDS channels and the clock signal The two Sideband Use pins SBU and SBU are used to carry the HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel and the Hot Plug Detect functionality HEAC Utility pin and HEAC HPD pin As there are not enough reconfigurable pins remaining in USB C to accommodate the DDC clock SCL DDC data SDA and CEC these three signals are bridged between the HDMI source and sink via the USB Power Delivery USB PD protocol and are carried over the USB C Configuration Channel CC wire This is possible because the cable is electronically marked i e it contains a USB PD node that serves to tunnel the DDC and CEC from the source over the Configuration Channel to the node in the cable these USB PD messages are received and relayed to the HDMI sink as regenerated DDC SCL and SDA signals or CEC signals br As stated at CES in January HDMI Alternate Mode for USB Type C is no longer being updated as there are no known products using this protocol reducing its relevance in the current market This will reduce consumer confusion as DisplayPort Alternate Mode is the primary video protocol of choice over USB C br br br Relationship with DisplayPort br br The DisplayPort audio video interface was introduced in May Historically HDMI Licensing LLC was publicly dismissive of DisplayPort s position in the industry with its president stating in a interview that there are certainly some PCs that have br DisplayPort connectors on them but these are niche applications that have not taken hold in the market br In recent years DisplayPort connectors have become a common feature of premium products displays desktop computers and video cards most of the companies producing DisplayPort equipment are in the computer sector The DisplayPort website states that DisplayPort is expected to complement HDMI but as of of HD and UHD TVs had HDMI connectivity DisplayPort supported some advanced features which are useful for multimedia content creators and gamers e g K Adaptive Sync which was the reason most GPUs have DisplayPort These features were added to the official HDMI specification slightly later but with the introduction of HDMI these gaps are already leveled off e g VRR Variable Refresh Rate br DisplayPort uses a self clocking micro packet based protocol that allows for a variable number of differential pair lanes as well as flexible allocation of bandwidth between audio and video and allows encapsulating multi channel compressed audio formats in the audio stream DisplayPort supports multiple audio video streams variable refresh rate FreeSync and Dual mode transmitters compatible with HDMI or Revision increases overall transmission bandwidth to Gbit s with the new HBR mode featuring Gbit s per lane it requires Dual mode with mandatory HDMI compatibility and HDCP Revision added Display Stream Compression DSC support for the BT color space and HDR extensions from CTA including static and dynamic metadata Revision a was published in April updating DisplayPort s DSC implementation from to a Revision increased overall bandwidth from to Gbit s enabling increased resolutions and refresh rates increasing the resolutions and refresh rates with HDR support and other related improvements Revision was published in October incorporating the new DP and DP cable certifications which require proper operation at the UHBR Gbit s and UHBR Gbit s speeds introduced in version and a bandwidth management feature to enable DisplayPort tunnelling to coexist with other I O data traffic more efficiently over a USB USB Type C connection br The DisplayPort features an adapter detection mechanism enabling dual mode operation and the transmission of TMDS signals allowing the conversion to DVI and HDMI signals using a passive adapter The same external connector is used for both protocols when a DVI HDMI passive adapter is attached the transmitter circuit switches to TMDS mode DisplayPort Dual mode ports and cables adapters are typically marked with the DisplayPort logo Thunderbolt ports with mDP connector also supports Dual mode passive HDMI adapters cables Conversion to dual link DVI and component video VGA YPbPr requires active powered adapters br The USB Type C connector is increasingly the standard video connector replacing legacy video connectors such as mDP Thunderbolt HDMI and VGA in mobile devices USB C connectors can transmit DisplayPort video to docks and displays using standard USB Type C cables or Type C to DisplayPort cables and adapters USB C also supports HDMI adapters that actively convert from DisplayPort to HDMI or DisplayPort Alternate Mode for USB Type C specification was published in USB Type C chipsets are not required to include Dual mode so passive DP HDMI adapters do not work with Type C sources A specification for HDMI Alternate Mode for USB Type C was released in but was discontinued in with HDMI Licensing Administration stating they knew of no adapter having ever been produced br DisplayPort is royalty free though patent pool administrator Via LA attempts to collect a per device charge for a bulk license to patents it regards as essential to the DisplayPort specification while HDMI has an annual fee of US and a per unit royalty rate of between and br HDMI has had a few advantages over DisplayPort such as ability to carry Consumer Electronics Control CEC signals since its first generation DisplayPort introduced in is the earliest DisplayPort generation which can carry CEC signals br br br Relationship with MHL br br Mobile High Definition Link MHL is an adaptation of HDMI intended to connect mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets to high definition televisions HDTVs and displays Unlike DVI which is compatible with HDMI using only passive cables and adapters MHL requires that the HDMI socket be MHL enabled otherwise an active adapter or dongle is required to convert the signal to HDMI MHL is developed by a consortium of five consumer electronics manufacturers several of which are also behind HDMI br MHL pares down the three TMDS channels in a standard HDMI connection to a single one running over any connector that provides at least five pins This lets existing connectors in mobile devices such as micro USB be used avoiding the need for additional dedicated video output sockets The USB port switches to MHL mode when it detects a compatible device is connected br In addition to the features in common with HDMI such as HDCP encrypted uncompressed high definition video and eight channel surround sound MHL also adds the provision of power charging for the mobile device while in use and also enables the TV remote to control it Although support for these additional features requires connection to an MHL enabled HDMI port power charging can also be provided when using active MHL to HDMI adapters connected to standard HDMI ports provided there is a separate power connection to the adapter br Like HDMI MHL defines a USB C Alternate Mode to support the MHL standard over USB C connections br Version supported p i Hz RGB pixel encoding with a bandwidth of Gbit s Versions and added support for p Hz Y CBCR with a bandwidth of Gbit s in PackedPixel mode Version increased the bandwidth to Gbit s to support Ultra HD Hz video and also changed from being frame based like HDMI to packet based br The fourth version superMHL increased bandwidth by operating over multiple TMDS differential pairs up to a total of six allowing a maximum of Gbit s The six lanes are supported over a reversible pin superMHL connector while four lanes are supported over USB C Alternate Mode only a single lane is supported over micro USB HDMI Display Stream Compression DSC is used to allow up to K Ultra HD Hz HDR video and to support Ultra HD Hz video over a single lane br br br See also br List of display interfaces br DisplayPort br Thunderbolt interface br USB C br Wireless HDMI br br br Footnotes br br br br br br External links br br HDMI
