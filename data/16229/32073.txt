Universal Serial Bus USB is an industry standard that allows data exchange and delivery of power between many types of electronics It specifies its architecture in particular its physical interface and communication protocols for data transfer and power delivery to and from hosts such as personal computers to and from peripheral devices e g displays keyboards and mass storage devices and to and from intermediate hubs which multiply the number of a host s ports br USB was originally designed to standardize the connection of peripherals to computers replacing various interfaces such as serial ports parallel ports game ports and ADB ports Prior versions of USB became commonplace on a wide range of devices such as keyboards mice cameras printers scanners flash drives smartphones game consoles and power banks It has evolved into a standard to replace virtually all common ports on computers mobile devices peripherals power supplies and manifold other small electronics br In the current standard the USB C connector replaces the many various connectors for power up to W displays e g DisplayPort HDMI and many other uses as well as all previous USB connectors br As of USB consists of four generations of specifications USB x USB USB x and USB USB enhances the data transfer and power delivery functionality with br br a connection oriented tunneling architecture designed to combine multiple protocols onto a single physical interface so that the total speed and performance of the USB Fabric can be dynamically shared br USB particularly supports the tunneling of the Thunderbolt protocols namely PCI Express PCIe load store interface and DisplayPort display interface USB also adds host to host interfaces br Each specification sub version supports different signaling rates from and Mbit s total in USB to Gbit s in each direction in USB USB also provides power to peripheral devices the latest versions of the standard extend the power delivery limits for battery charging and devices requiring up to watts USB Power Delivery USB PD Over the years USB PD has been adopted as the standard power supply and charging format for many mobile devices such as mobile phones reducing the need for proprietary chargers br br br Overview br USB was designed to standardize the connection of peripherals to personal computers both to exchange data and to supply electric power It has largely replaced interfaces such as serial ports and parallel ports and has become commonplace on a wide range of devices Examples of peripherals that are connected via USB include computer keyboards and mice video cameras printers portable media players mobile portable digital telephones disk drives and network adapters br USB connectors have been increasingly replacing other types of charging cables for portable devices br USB connector interfaces are classified into three types the many various legacy Type A upstream and Type B downstream connectors found on hosts hubs and peripheral devices and the modern Type C USB C connector which as of starts to replace all of the many legacy connectors and is the only applicable connector for USB br The Type A and Type B connectors came in Standard Mini and Micro sizes The standard format was the largest and was mainly used for desktop and larger peripheral equipment The Mini USB connectors Mini A Mini B Mini AB were introduced for mobile devices but they were quickly replaced by the thinner Micro USB connectors Micro A Micro B Micro AB The Type C connector also known as USB C is not exclusive to USB is the only current standard for USB is required for USB and is required by other standards as well including modern DisplayPort and Thunderbolt It is reversible and can support various functionalities and protocols including USB some are mandatory many optional depending on the type of the hardware host peripheral device or hub br USB specifications provide backward compatibility but this usually results in a decrease in signalling rates maximal power offered and other provided capabilities The USB specification replaces USB The USB specification is backward compatible with USB The USB specification replaces USB and USB while also including the USB specification USB functionally replaces USB while retaining USB bus operating in parallel br The USB specification defined a new architecture and protocol named SuperSpeed aka SuperSpeed USB marketed as SS which included a new lane for a new signal coding scheme b b symbols Gbps also known as Gen providing full duplex data transfers that physically required five additional wires and pins while preserving the USB architecture and protocols and therefore keeping the original pins wires for the USB backward compatibility resulting in wires with or pins at connector interfaces ID pin is not wired in total br The USB specification introduced an Enhanced SuperSpeed System while preserving the SuperSpeed architecture and protocol SuperSpeed USB with an additional SuperSpeedPlus architecture and protocol aka SuperSpeedPlus USB adding a new coding schema b b symbols Gbps also known as Gen for some time period marketed as SuperSpeed SS br The USB specification added a second lane to the Enhanced SuperSpeed System besides other enhancements so that the SuperSpeedPlus USB system part implements the Gen x Gen x and Gen x operation modes The SuperSpeed USB part of the system however still implements the one lane Gen x operation mode Therefore two lane operations namely USB Gen x Gbit s and Gen x Gbit s are only possible with Full Featured USB C As of they are somewhat rarely implemented Intel however starts to include them in its th generation SoC processor models but Apple never provided them On the other hand USB Gen x Gbit s and Gen x Gbit s has been quite common for some years br br br Connector type quick reference br br Each USB connection is made using two connectors a receptacle and a plug Pictures show only receptacles br br br Objectives br The Universal Serial Bus was developed to simplify and improve the interface between personal computers and peripheral devices such as cell phones computer accessories and monitors when compared with previously existing standard or ad hoc proprietary interfaces br From the computer user s perspective the USB interface improves ease of use in several ways br br The USB interface is self configuring eliminating the need for the user to adjust the device s settings for speed or data format or configure interrupts input output addresses or direct memory access channels br USB connectors are standardized at the host so any peripheral can use most available receptacles br USB takes full advantage of the additional processing power that can be economically put into peripheral devices so that they can manage themselves As such USB devices often do not have user adjustable interface settings br The USB interface is hot swappable devices can be exchanged without shutting the host computer down br Small devices can be powered directly from the USB interface eliminating the need for additional power supply cables br Because use of the USB logo is only permitted after compliance testing the user can have confidence that a USB device will work as expected without extensive interaction with settings and configuration br The USB interface defines protocols for recovery from common errors improving reliability over previous interfaces br Installing a device that relies on the USB standard requires minimal operator action When a user plugs a device into a port on a running computer it either entirely automatically configures using existing device drivers or the system prompts the user to locate a driver which it then installs and configures automatically br The USB standard also provides multiple benefits for hardware manufacturers and software developers specifically in the relative ease of implementation br br The USB standard eliminates the requirement to develop proprietary interfaces to new peripherals br The wide range of transfer speeds available from a USB interface suits devices ranging from keyboards and mice up to streaming video interfaces br A USB interface can be designed to provide the best available latency for time critical functions or can be set up to do background transfers of bulk data with little impact on system resources br The USB interface is generalized with no signal lines dedicated to only one function of one device br br br Limitations br As with all standards USB possesses multiple limitations to its design br br USB cables are limited in length as the standard was intended for peripherals on the same table top not between rooms or buildings However a USB port can be connected to a gateway that accesses distant devices br USB data transfer rates are slower than those of other interconnects such as Gigabit Ethernet br USB has a strict tree network topology and master slave protocol for addressing peripheral devices those devices cannot interact with one another except via the host and two hosts cannot communicate over their USB ports directly Some extension to this limitation is possible through USB On The Go in Dual Role Devices and protocol bridge br A host cannot broadcast signals to all peripherals at once each must be addressed individually br While converters exist between certain legacy interfaces and USB they might not provide a full implementation of the legacy hardware For example a USB to parallel port converter might work well with a printer but not with a scanner that requires bidirectional use of the data pins br For a product developer using USB requires the implementation of a complex protocol and implies an intelligent controller in the peripheral device Developers of USB devices intended for public sale generally must obtain a USB ID which requires that they pay a fee to the USB Implementers Forum USB IF Developers of products that use the USB specification must sign an agreement with the USB IF Use of the USB logos on the product requires annual fees and membership in the organization br br br History br br A group of seven companies began the development of USB in Compaq DEC IBM Intel Microsoft NEC and Nortel The goal was to make it fundamentally easier to connect external devices to PCs by replacing the multitude of connectors at the back of PCs addressing the usability issues of existing interfaces and simplifying software configuration of all devices connected to USB as well as permitting greater data transfer rates for external devices and plug and play features Ajay Bhatt and his team worked on the standard at Intel the first integrated circuits supporting USB were produced by Intel in br br br USB x br br Released in January USB specified signaling rates of Mbit s Low Bandwidth or Low Speed and Mbit s Full Speed It did not allow for extension cables due to timing and power limitations Few USB devices made it to the market until USB was released in August USB was the earliest revision that was widely adopted and led to what Microsoft designated the Legacy free PC br Neither USB nor specified a design for any connector smaller than the standard type A or type B Though many designs for a miniaturized type B connector appeared on many peripherals conformity to the USB x standard was hampered by treating peripherals that had miniature connectors as though they had a tethered connection that is no plug or receptacle at the peripheral end There was no known miniature type A connector until USB revision introduced one br br br USB br br USB was released in April adding a higher maximum signaling rate of Mbit s maximum theoretical data throughput MByte s named High Speed or High Bandwidth in addition to the USB x Full Speed signaling rate of Mbit s maximum theoretical data throughput MByte s br Modifications to the USB specification have been made via engineering change notices ECNs The most important of these ECNs are included into the USB specification package available from USB org br br Mini A and Mini B Connector br Micro USB Cables and Connectors Specification br InterChip USB Supplement br On The Go Supplement USB On The Go makes it possible for two USB devices to communicate with each other without requiring a separate USB host br Battery Charging Specification Added support for dedicated chargers host chargers behavior for devices with dead batteries br Battery Charging Specification with increased current of A on charging ports for unconfigured devices allowing high speed communication while having a current up to A br Link Power Management Addendum ECN which adds a sleep power state br br br USB x br br The USB specification was released on November with its management transferring from USB Promoter Group to the USB Implementers Forum USB IF and announced on November at the SuperSpeed USB Developers Conference br USB adds a new architecture and protocol named SuperSpeed with associated backward compatible plugs receptacles and cables SuperSpeed plugs and receptacles are identified with a distinct logo and blue inserts in standard format receptacles br The SuperSpeed architecture provides for an operation mode at a rate of Gbit s in addition to the three existing operation modes Its efficiency is dependent on a number of factors including physical symbol encoding and link level overhead At a Gbit s signaling rate with b b encoding each byte needs bits to transmit so the raw throughput is MB s When flow control packet framing and protocol overhead are considered it is realistic for about two thirds of the raw throughput or MB s to transmit to an application SuperSpeed s architecture is full duplex all earlier implementations USB are all half duplex arbitrated by the host br Low power and high power devices remain operational with this standard but devices implementing SuperSpeed can provide increased current of between mA and mA by discrete steps of mA br USB also introduced the USB Attached SCSI protocol UASP which provides generally faster transfer speeds than the BOT Bulk Only Transfer protocol br USB released in July has two variants The first one preserves USB s SuperSpeed architecture and protocol and its operation mode is newly named USB Gen and the second version introduces a distinctively new SuperSpeedPlus architecture and protocol with a second operation mode named as USB Gen marketed as SuperSpeed USB SuperSpeed doubles the maximum signaling rate to Gbit s later marketed as SuperSpeed USB Gbps by the USB specification while reducing line encoding overhead to just by changing the encoding scheme to b b br USB released in September preserves existing USB SuperSpeed and SuperSpeedPlus architectures and protocols and their respective operation modes but introduces two additional SuperSpeedPlus operation modes USB Gen x and USB Gen x with the new USB C Fabric with signaling rates of and Gbit s nominal raw data rates of and MB s The increase in bandwidth is a result of two lane operation over existing wires that were originally intended for flip flop capabilities of the USB C connector br br br Naming scheme br Starting with the USB specification USB IF introduced a new naming scheme To help companies with branding of the different operation modes USB IF recommended branding the and Gbit s capabilities as SuperSpeed USB Gbps SuperSpeed USB Gbps and SuperSpeed USB Gbps respectively br In they were replaced again removing SuperSpeed with USB Gbps USB Gbps and USB Gbps With new Packaging and Port logos br br br USB br br The USB specification was released on August by the USB Implementers Forum br The USB specification was released on September by the USB Implementers Forum br USB is based on the Thunderbolt protocol It supports Gbit s throughput is compatible with Thunderbolt and backward compatible with USB and USB The architecture defines a method to share a single high speed link with multiple end device types dynamically that best serves the transfer of data by type and application br During CES USB IF and Intel stated their intention to allow USB products that support all the optional functionality as Thunderbolt products br The USB specification states that the following technologies shall be supported by USB br br br September naming scheme br br Because of the previous confusing naming schemes USB IF decided to change it once again As of September marketing names follow the syntax USB xGbps where x is the speed of transfer in Gb s Overview of the updated names and logos can be seen in the adjacent table br The operation modes USB Gen x and USB Gen x or USB Gen x and USB Gen x are not interchangeable or compatible all participating controllers must operate with the same mode br br br Version history br br br Release versions br br br Power related standards br br br System design br A USB system consists of a host with one or more downstream facing ports DFP and multiple peripherals forming a tiered star topology Additional USB hubs may be included allowing up to five tiers A USB host may have multiple controllers each with one or more ports Up to devices may be connected to a single host controller USB devices are linked in series through hubs The hub built into the host controller is called the root hub br A USB device may consist of several logical sub devices that are referred to as device functions A composite device may provide several functions for example a webcam video device function with a built in microphone audio device function An alternative to this is a compound device in which the host assigns each logical device a distinct address and all logical devices connect to a built in hub that connects to the physical USB cable br br USB device communication is based on pipes logical channels A pipe is a connection from the host controller to a logical entity within a device called an endpoint Because pipes correspond to endpoints the terms are sometimes used interchangeably Each USB device can have up to endpoints in and out though it is rare to have so many Endpoints are defined and numbered by the device during initialization the period after physical connection called enumeration and so are relatively permanent whereas pipes may be opened and closed br There are two types of pipe stream and message br br A message pipe is bi directional and is used for control transfers Message pipes are typically used for short simple commands to the device and for status responses from the device used for example by the bus control pipe number br A stream pipe is a uni directional pipe connected to a uni directional endpoint that transfers data using an isochronous interrupt or bulk transfer br Isochronous transfers br At some guaranteed data rate for fixed bandwidth streaming data but with possible data loss e g realtime audio or video br Interrupt transfers br Devices that need guaranteed quick responses bounded latency such as pointing devices mice and keyboards br Bulk transfers br Large sporadic transfers using all remaining available bandwidth but with no guarantees on bandwidth or latency e g file transfers br When a host starts a data transfer it sends a TOKEN packet containing an endpoint specified with a tuple of device address endpoint number If the transfer is from the host to the endpoint the host sends an OUT packet a specialization of a TOKEN packet with the desired device address and endpoint number If the data transfer is from the device to the host the host sends an IN packet instead If the destination endpoint is a uni directional endpoint whose manufacturer s designated direction does not match the TOKEN packet e g the manufacturer s designated direction is IN while the TOKEN packet is an OUT packet the TOKEN packet is ignored Otherwise it is accepted and the data transaction can start A bi directional endpoint on the other hand accepts both IN and OUT packets br br Endpoints are grouped into interfaces and each interface is associated with a single device function An exception to this is endpoint zero which is used for device configuration and is not associated with any interface A single device function composed of independently controlled interfaces is called a composite device A composite device only has a single device address because the host only assigns a device address to a function br When a USB device is first connected to a USB host the USB device enumeration process is started The enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to the USB device The signaling rate of the USB device is determined during the reset signaling After reset the USB device s information is read by the host and the device is assigned a unique bit address If the device is supported by the host the device drivers needed for communicating with the device are loaded and the device is set to a configured state If the USB host is restarted the enumeration process is repeated for all connected devices br The host controller directs traffic flow to devices so no USB device can transfer any data on the bus without an explicit request from the host controller In USB the host controller polls the bus for traffic usually in a round robin fashion The throughput of each USB port is determined by the slower speed of either the USB port or the USB device connected to the port br High speed USB hubs contain devices called transaction translators that convert between high speed USB buses and full and low speed buses There may be one translator per hub or per port br Because there are two separate controllers in each USB host USB devices transmit and receive at USB signaling rates regardless of USB or earlier devices connected to that host Operating signaling rates for earlier devices are set in the legacy manner br br br Device classes br The functionality of a USB device is defined by a class code sent to a USB host This allows the host to load software modules for the device and to support new devices from different manufacturers br Device classes include br br br USB mass storage USB drive br br The USB mass storage device class MSC or UMS standardizes connections to storage devices At first intended for magnetic and optical drives it has been extended to support flash drives and SD card readers The ability to boot a write locked SD card with a USB adapter is particularly advantageous for maintaining the integrity and non corruptible pristine state of the booting medium br Though most personal computers since early can boot from USB mass storage devices USB is not intended as a primary bus for a computer s internal storage However USB has the advantage of allowing hot swapping making it useful for mobile peripherals including drives of various kinds br Several manufacturers offer external portable USB hard disk drives or empty enclosures for disk drives These offer performance comparable to internal drives limited by the number and types of attached USB devices and by the upper limit of the USB interface Other competing standards for external drive connectivity include eSATA ExpressCard FireWire IEEE and most recently Thunderbolt br Another use for USB mass storage devices is the portable execution of software applications such as web browsers and VoIP clients with no need to install them on the host computer br br br Media Transfer Protocol br br Media Transfer Protocol MTP was designed by Microsoft to give higher level access to a device s filesystem than USB mass storage at the level of files rather than disk blocks It also has optional DRM features MTP was designed for use with portable media players but it has since been adopted as the primary storage access protocol of the Android operating system from the version Jelly Bean as well as Windows Phone Windows Phone devices had used the Zune protocol an evolution of MTP The primary reason for this is that MTP does not require exclusive access to the storage device the way UMS does alleviating potential problems should an Android program request the storage while it is attached to a computer The main drawback is that MTP is not as well supported outside of Windows operating systems br br br Human interface devices br br A USB mouse or keyboard can usually be used with older computers that have PS ports with the aid of a small USB to PS adapter For mice and keyboards with dual protocol support a passive adapter that contains no logic circuitry may be used the USB hardware in the keyboard or mouse is designed to detect whether it is connected to a USB or PS port and communicate using the appropriate protocol Active converters that connect USB keyboards and mice usually one of each to PS ports also exist br br br Device Firmware Upgrade mechanism br Device Firmware Upgrade DFU is a generic mechanism for upgrading the firmware of USB devices with improved versions provided by their manufacturers offering for example a way to deploy firmware bug fixes During the firmware upgrade operation USB devices change their operating mode effectively becoming a PROM programmer Any class of USB device can implement this capability by following the official DFU specifications Doing so allows use of DFU compatible host tools to update the device br DFU is sometimes used as a flash memory programming protocol in microcontrollers with built in USB bootloader functionality br br br Audio streaming br The USB Device Working Group has laid out specifications for audio streaming and specific standards have been developed and implemented for audio class uses such as microphones speakers headsets telephones musical instruments etc The working group has published three versions of audio device specifications USB Audio and referred to as UAC or ADC br UAC primarily introduces improvements for portable devices such as reduced power usage by bursting the data and staying in low power mode more often and power domains for different components of the device allowing them to be shut down when not in use br UAC introduced support for High Speed USB in addition to Full Speed allowing greater bandwidth for multi channel interfaces higher sample rates lower inherent latency and improvement in timing resolution in synchronous and adaptive modes UAC also introduced the concept of clock domains which provides information to the host about which input and output terminals derive their clocks from the same source as well as improved support for audio encodings like DSD audio effects channel clustering user controls and device descriptions br UAC devices are still common however due to their cross platform driverless compatibility and also partly due to Microsoft s failure to implement UAC for over a decade after its publication having finally added support to Windows through the Creators Update on March UAC is also supported by macOS iOS and Linux however Android only implements a subset of the UAC specification br USB provides three isochronous fixed bandwidth synchronization types all of which are used by audio devices br br Asynchronous The ADC or DAC are not synced to the host computer s clock at all operating off a free running clock local to the device br Synchronous The device s clock is synced to the USB start of frame SOF or Bus Interval signals For instance this can require syncing an MHz clock to a kHz SOF signal a large frequency multiplication br Adaptive The device s clock is synced to the amount of data sent per frame by the host br While the USB spec originally described asynchronous mode being used in low cost speakers and adaptive mode in high end digital speakers the opposite perception exists in the hi fi world where asynchronous mode is advertised as a feature and adaptive synchronous modes have a bad reputation In reality all types can be high quality or low quality depending on the quality of their engineering and the application Asynchronous has the benefit of being untied from the computer s clock but the disadvantage of requiring sample rate conversion when combining multiple sources br br br Connectors br br The connectors the USB committee specifies support a number of USB s underlying goals and reflect lessons learned from the many connectors the computer industry has used The female connector mounted on the host or device is called the receptacle and the male connector attached to the cable is called the plug The official USB specification documents also periodically define the term male to represent the plug and female to represent the receptacle br br The design is intended to make it difficult to insert a USB plug into its receptacle incorrectly The USB specification requires that the cable plug and receptacle be marked so the user can recognize the proper orientation The USB C plug however is reversible USB cables and small USB devices are held in place by the gripping force from the receptacle with no screws clips or thumb turns as some connectors use br The different A and B plugs prevent accidentally connecting two power sources However some of this directed topology is lost with the advent of multi purpose USB connections such as USB On The Go in smartphones and USB powered Wi Fi routers which require A to A B to B and sometimes Y splitter cables br USB connector types multiplied as the specification progressed The original USB specification detailed standard A and standard B plugs and receptacles The connectors were different so that users could not connect one computer receptacle to another The data pins in the standard plugs are recessed compared to the power pins so that the device can power up before establishing a data connection Some devices operate in different modes depending on whether the data connection is made Charging docks supply power and do not include a host device or data pins allowing any capable USB device to charge or operate from a standard USB cable Charging cables provide power connections but not data In a charge only cable the data wires are shorted at the device end otherwise the device may reject the charger as unsuitable br br br Cabling br br br The USB standard specifies that a standard cable can have a maximum length of meters ft in with devices operating at full speed Mbit s and a maximum length of meters ft in with devices operating at low speed Mbit s br USB provides for a maximum cable length of meters ft in for devices running at high speed Mbit s br The USB standard does not directly specify a maximum cable length requiring only that all cables meet an electrical specification for copper cabling with AWG wires the maximum practical length is meters ft in br br br USB bridge cables br USB bridge cables or data transfer cables can be found within the market offering direct PC to PC connections A bridge cable is a special cable with a chip and active electronics in the middle of the cable The chip in the middle of the cable acts as a peripheral to both computers and allows for peer to peer communication between the computers The USB bridge cables are used to transfer files between two computers via their USB ports br Popularized by Microsoft as Windows Easy Transfer the Microsoft utility used a special USB bridge cable to transfer personal files and settings from a computer running an earlier version of Windows to a computer running a newer version In the context of the use of Windows Easy Transfer software the bridge cable can sometimes be referenced as Easy Transfer cable br Many USB bridge data transfer cables are still USB but there are also a number of USB transfer cables Despite USB being times faster than USB USB transfer cables are only times faster given their design br The USB specification introduced an A to A cross over cable without power for connecting two PCs These are not meant for data transfer but are aimed at diagnostic uses br br br Dual role USB connections br USB bridge cables have become less important with USB dual role device capabilities introduced with the USB specification Under the most recent specifications USB supports most scenarios connecting systems directly with a Type C cable For the capability to work however connected systems must support role switching Dual role capabilities requires there be two controllers within the system as well as a role controller While this can be expected in a mobile platform such as a tablet or a phone desktop PCs and laptops often will not support dual roles br br br Power br br Upstream USB connectors supply power at a nominal V DC via the V BUS pin to downstream USB devices br br br Low power and high power devices br This section describes the power distribution model of USB that existed before Power Delivery USB PD On devices that do not use PD USB provides up to W through Type A and Type B connectors and up to W through USB C All pre PD USB power is provided at V br For a host providing power to devices USB has a concept of the unit load Any device may draw power of one unit and devices may request more power in these discrete steps It is not required that the host provide requested power and a device may not draw more power than negotiated br Devices that draw no more than one unit are said to be low power devices All devices must act as low power devices when starting out as unconfigured For USB devices up to USB a unit load is mA or mW while USB defines a unit load as mA mW Full featured USB C can support low power devices with a unit load of mA or mW br Devices that draw more than one unit are high power devices such as typical inch hard disk drives USB up to allows a host or hub to provide up to W to each device in five discrete steps of mA and SuperSpeed devices USB and up allows a host or a hub to provide up to W in six steps of mA USB C supports high power devices with up to W in six steps of mA Full featured USB C can support up to W br br To recognize Battery Charging mode a dedicated charging port places a resistance not exceeding across the D and D terminals Shorted or near shorted data lanes with less than of resistance across the D and D terminals signify a dedicated charging port DCP with indefinite charging rates br In addition to standard USB there is a proprietary high powered system known as PoweredUSB developed in the s and mainly used in point of sale terminals such as cash registers br br br Signaling br br USB signals are transmitted using differential signaling on twisted pair data wires with characteristic impedance USB and earlier specifications define a single pair in half duplex HDx USB and later specifications define one dedicated pair for USB compatibility and two or four pairs for data transfer two pairs in full duplex FDx for single lane variants require SuperSpeed connectors four pairs in full duplex for two lane x variants require USB C connectors USB Gen requires the use of all four pairs but allow for asymmetrical pairs configuration in this case one lane is used for the upstream data and the other three for the downstream data or vice versa USB Gen use pulse amplitude modulation on levels providing a trit of information every baud transmitted the transmission frequency of GHz translate to a transmission rate of GBd and the bit to trit translation provides a theoretical maximum transmission speed just over Gbit s br br Low speed LS and Full speed FS modes use a single data wire pair labeled D and D in half duplex Transmitted signal levels are V for logical low and V for logical high level The signal lines are not terminated br High speed HS uses the same wire pair but with different electrical conventions Lower signal voltages of to mV for low and to mV for logical high level and termination of to ground or differential to match the data cable impedance br SuperSpeed SS adds two additional pairs of shielded twisted data wires and new mostly compatible expanded connectors besides another grounding wire These are dedicated to full duplex SuperSpeed operation The SuperSpeed link operates independently from USB channel and takes a precedence on connection Link configuration is performed using LFPS Low Frequency Periodic Signaling approximately at MHz frequency and electrical features include voltage de emphasis at transmitter side and adaptive linear equalization on receiver side to combat electrical losses in transmission lines and thus the link introduces the concept of link training br SuperSpeed SS uses a new coding scheme with an increased signaling rate Gen x mode and or the additional lane of USB C Gen x and Gen x modes br A USB connection is always between an A end either a host or a downstream port of a hub and a B end either a peripheral device or the upstream port of a hub Historically this was made clear by the fact that hosts had only Type A ports and peripheral devices had only Type B and every valid cable had one Type A plug and one Type B plug USB C Type C is a single connector that replaces all Type A and Type B connectors legacy connectors so when both sides are modern equipment with USB C ports they negotiate which is the host A and which is the device B br br br Protocol layer br br During USB communication data is transmitted as packets Initially all packets are sent from the host via the root hub and possibly more hubs to devices Some of those packets direct a device to send some packets in reply br br br Transactions br br The basic transactions of USB are br br OUT transaction br IN transaction br SETUP transaction br Control transfer exchange br br br Related standards br br br Media Agnostic USB br The USB Implementers Forum introduced the Media Agnostic USB MA USB v wireless communication standard based on the USB protocol on July Wireless USB is a cable replacement technology and uses ultra wideband wireless technology for data rates of up to Mbit s br The USB IF used WiGig Serial Extension v specification as its initial foundation for the MA USB specification and is compliant with SuperSpeed USB and and Hi Speed USB USB Devices that use MA USB will be branded as Powered by MA USB provided the product qualifies its certification program br br br InterChip USB br br InterChip USB is a chip to chip variant that eliminates the conventional transceivers found in normal USB The HSIC physical layer uses about less power and less board area compared to USB It is an alternative standard to SPI and I C br br br USB C br br USB C officially USB Type C is a standard that defines a new connector and several new connection features Among them it supports Alternate Mode which allows transporting other protocols via the USB C connector and cable This is commonly used to support the DisplayPort or HDMI protocols which allows connecting a display such as a computer monitor or television set via USB C br All other connectors are not capable of two lane operations Gen x and Gen x in USB but can be used for one lane operations Gen x and Gen x br br br DisplayLink br br DisplayLink is a technology which allows multiple displays to be connected to a computer via USB It was introduced around and before the advent of Alternate Mode over USB C it was the only way to connect displays via USB It is a proprietary technology not standardized by the USB Implementers Forum and typically requires a separate device driver on the computer br br br Comparisons with other connection methods br br br FireWire IEEE br At first USB was considered a complement to FireWire IEEE technology which was designed as a high bandwidth serial bus that efficiently interconnects peripherals such as disk drives audio interfaces and video equipment In the initial design USB operated at a far lower data rate and used less sophisticated hardware It was suitable for small peripherals such as keyboards and pointing devices br The most significant technical differences between FireWire and USB include br br USB networks use a tiered star topology while IEEE networks use a tree topology br USB and use a speak when spoken to protocol meaning that each peripheral communicates with the host when the host specifically requests communication USB allows for device initiated communications towards the host A FireWire device can communicate with any other node at any time subject to network conditions br A USB network relies on a single host at the top of the tree to control the network All communications are between the host and one peripheral In a FireWire network any capable node can control the network br USB runs with a V power line while FireWire supplies V and theoretically can supply up to V br Standard USB hub ports can provide from the typical mA W of current only mA from non hub ports USB and USB On The Go supply A W for dedicated battery charging A W full bandwidth or mA W high bandwidth while FireWire can in theory supply up to watts of power although to watts is more typical br These and other differences reflect the differing design goals of the two buses USB was designed for simplicity and low cost while FireWire was designed for high performance particularly in time sensitive applications such as audio and video Although similar in theoretical maximum signaling rate FireWire is faster than USB high bandwidth in real use especially in high bandwidth use such as external hard drives The newer FireWire standard is twice as fast as FireWire and faster than USB high bandwidth both theoretically and practically However FireWire s speed advantages rely on low level techniques such as direct memory access DMA which in turn have created opportunities for security exploits such as the DMA attack br The chipset and drivers used to implement USB and FireWire have a crucial impact on how much of the bandwidth prescribed by the specification is achieved in the real world along with compatibility with peripherals br br br Ethernet br The IEEE af at and bt Power over Ethernet PoE standards specify more elaborate power negotiation schemes than powered USB They operate at V DC and can supply more power up to W for af W for at a k a PoE W for bt a k a PPoE over a cable up to meters compared to USB which provides W with a maximum cable length of meters This has made PoE popular for Voice over IP telephones Closed circuit television camerasecurity cameras wireless access points and other networked devices within buildings However USB is cheaper than PoE provided that the distance is short and power demand is low br Ethernet standards require electrical isolation between the networked device computer phone etc and the network cable up to V AC or V DC for seconds USB has no such requirement as it was designed for peripherals closely associated with a host computer and in fact it connects the peripheral and host grounds This gives Ethernet a significant safety advantage over USB with peripherals such as cable and DSL modems connected to external wiring that can assume hazardous voltages under certain fault conditions br br br MIDI br The USB Device Class Definition for MIDI Devices transmits Music Instrument Digital Interface MIDI music data over USB The MIDI capability is extended to allow up to sixteen simultaneous virtual MIDI cables each of which can carry the usual MIDI sixteen channels and clocks br USB is competitive for low cost and physically adjacent devices However Power over Ethernet and the MIDI plug standard have an advantage in high end devices that may have long cables USB can cause ground loop problems between equipment because it connects ground references on both transceivers By contrast the MIDI plug standard and Ethernet have built in isolation to V or more br br br eSATA eSATAp br The eSATA connector is a more robust SATA connector intended for connection to external hard drives and SSDs eSATA s transfer rate up to Gbit s is similar to that of USB up to Gbit s and USB up to Gbit s A device connected by eSATA appears as an ordinary SATA device giving both full performance and full compatibility associated with internal drives br eSATA does not supply power to external devices This is an increasing disadvantage compared to USB Even though USB s W is sometimes insufficient to power external hard drives technology is advancing and external drives gradually need less power diminishing the eSATA advantage eSATAp power over eSATA a k a ESATA USB is a connector introduced in that supplies power to attached devices using a new backward compatible connector On a notebook eSATAp usually supplies only V to power a inch HDD SSD on a desktop workstation it can additionally supply V to power larger devices including inch HDD SSD and inch optical drives br eSATAp support can be added to a desktop machine in the form of a bracket connecting the motherboard SATA power and USB resources br eSATA like USB supports hot plugging although this might be limited by OS drivers and device firmware br br br Thunderbolt br Thunderbolt combines PCI Express and Mini DisplayPort into a new serial data interface Original Thunderbolt implementations have two channels each with a transfer speed of Gbit s resulting in an aggregate unidirectional bandwidth of Gbit s br Thunderbolt uses link aggregation to combine the two Gbit s channels into one bidirectional Gbit s channel br Thunderbolt and Thunderbolt use USB C Thunderbolt has two physical Gbit s bi directional channels aggregated to appear as a single logical Gbit s bi directional channel Thunderbolt controllers can incorporate a USB Gen controller to provide compatibility with USB devices They are also capable of providing DisplayPort Alternate Mode as well as DisplayPort over USB Fabric making the function of a Thunderbolt port a superset of that of a USB Gen port br DisplayPort Alternate Mode USB requiring USB C requires that hubs support DisplayPort over a USB C Alternate Mode DisplayPort can support K resolution at Hz with HDR color DisplayPort can use up to Gbit s which is double the amount available to USB data because it sends all the data in one direction to the monitor and can thus use all eight data wires at once br After the specification was made royalty free and custodianship of the Thunderbolt protocol was transferred from Intel to the USB Implementers Forum Thunderbolt has been effectively implemented in the USB specification with compatibility with Thunderbolt optional but encouraged for USB products br br br Interoperability br br Various protocol converters are available that convert USB data signals to and from other communications standards br br br Security threats br Due to the prevalency of the USB standard there are many exploits using the USB standard One of the biggest instances of this today is known as the USB killer a device that damages USB devices by sending high voltage pulses across the data lines br In versions of Microsoft Windows before Windows XP Windows would automatically run a script if present on certain devices via AutoRun one of which are USB mass storage devices which may contain malicious software br br br See also br br br USB br br br Derived and related standards
