title: Farsightedness
id: 404646
Far sightedness also known as long sightedness hypermetropia and hyperopia is a condition of the eye where distant objects are seen clearly but near objects appear blurred This blur is due to incoming light being focused behind instead of on the retina due to insufficient accommodation by the lens Minor hypermetropia in young patients is usually corrected by their accommodation without any defects in vision But due to this accommodative effort for distant vision people may complain of eye strain during prolonged reading If the hypermetropia is high there will be defective vision for both distance and near People may also experience accommodative dysfunction binocular dysfunction amblyopia and strabismus Newborns are almost invariably hypermetropic but it gradually decreases as the newborn gets older br There are many causes for this condition It may occur when the axial length of eyeball is too short or if the lens or cornea is flatter than normal Changes in refractive index of lens alterations in position of the lens or absence of lens are the other main causes Risk factors include a family history of the condition diabetes certain medications and tumors around the eye It is a type of refractive error Diagnosis is based on an eye exam br Management can occur with eyeglasses contact lenses or refractive corneal surgeries Glasses are easiest while contact lenses can provide a wider field of vision Surgery works by changing the shape of the cornea Far sightedness primarily affects young children with rates of at years old and at years old It then becomes more common again after the age of known as presbyopia affecting about half of people The best treatment option to correct hypermetropia due to aphakia is IOL implantation br Other common types of refractive errors are near sightedness astigmatism and presbyopia br br br Signs and symptoms br In young patients mild hypermetropia may not produce any symptoms The signs and symptoms of far sightedness include blurry vision frontal or fronto temporal headaches eye strain tiredness of eyes etc The common symptom is eye strain Difficulty seeing with both eyes binocular vision may occur as well as difficulty with depth perception The asthenopic symptoms and near blur are usually seen after close work especially in the evening or night br br br Complications br Far sightedness can have rare complications such as strabismus and amblyopia At a young age severe far sightedness can cause the child to have double vision as a result of over focusing br Hypermetropic patients with short axial length are at higher risk of developing primary angle closure glaucoma so routine gonioscopy and glaucoma evaluation is recommended for all hypermetropic adults br br br Causes br Simple hypermetropia the most common form of hypermetropia is caused by normal biological variations in the development of eyeball Aetiologically causes of hypermetropia can be classified as br br Axial Axial hypermetropia occur when the axial length of eyeball is too short About mm decrease in axial length cause diopters of hypermetropia One condition that cause axial hypermetropia is nanophthalmos br Curvatural Curvatural hypermetropia occur when curvature of lens or cornea is flatter than normal About mm increase in radius of curvature results in diopters of hypermetropia Cornea is flatter in microcornea and cornea plana br Index Age related changes in refractive index cortical sclerosis can cause hypermetropia Another cause of index hypermetropia is diabetes Occasionally mild hypermetropic shift may be seen in association with cortical or subcapsular cataract also br Positional Positional hypermetropia occur due to posterior dislocation of Lens or IOL It may occur due to trauma br Consecutive Consecutive hypermetropia occur due to surgical over correction of myopia or surgical under correction in cataract surgery br Functional Functional hypermetropia results from paralysis of accommodation as seen in internal ophthalmoplegia CN III palsy etc br Absence of lens Congenital or acquired aphakia cause high degree hypermetropia br Far sightedness is often present from birth but children have a very flexible eye lens which helps to compensate In rare instances hyperopia can be due to diabetes and problems with the blood vessels in the retina br br br Diagnosis br br A diagnosis of far sightedness is made by utilizing either a retinoscope or an automated refractor objective refraction or trial lenses in a trial frame or a phoropter to obtain a subjective examination br Ancillary tests for abnormal structures and physiology can be made via a slit lamp test which examines the cornea conjunctiva anterior chamber and iris br In severe cases of hyperopia from birth the brain has difficulty in merging the images that each individual eye sees This is because the images the brain receives from each eye are always blurred A child with severe hyperopia can never see objects in detail If the brain never learns to see objects in detail then there is a high chance of one eye becoming dominant The result is that the brain will block the impulses of the non dominant eye In contrast the child with myopia can see objects close to the eye in detail and does learn at an early age to see objects in detail br br br Classification br br Hyperopia is typically classified according to clinical appearance its severity or how it relates to the eye s accommodative status br br br Clinical classification br There are three clinical categories of hyperopia br br Simple hyperopia Occurs naturally due to biological diversity br Pathological hyperopia Caused by disease trauma or abnormal development br Functional hyperopia Caused by paralysis that interferes eye s ability to accommodate br br br Classification according to severity br There are also three categories severity br br Low Refractive error less than or equal to diopters D br Moderate Refractive error greater than D up to D br High Refractive error greater than D br br br Components of hypermetropia br Accommodation has significant role in hyperopia Considering accommodative status hyperopia can be classified as br br Total hypermetropia It is the total amount of hyperopia which is obtained after complete relaxation of accommodation using cycloplegics like atropine br Latent hyperopia It is the amount of hyperopia normally corrected by ciliary tone approximately diopter br Manifest hyperopia It is the amount of hyperopia not corrected by ciliary tone Manifest hyperopia is further classified into two facultative and absolute br Facultative hyperopia It is the part of hyperopia corrected by patient s accommodation br Absolute hyperopia It is the residual part of hyperopia which causes blurring of vision for distance br So Total hyperopia latent hyperopia manifest hyperopia facultative absolute br br br Treatment br br br Corrective lenses br The simplest form of treatment for far sightedness is the use of corrective lenses i e eyeglasses or contact lenses Eyeglasses used to correct far sightedness have convex lenses br br br Surgery br There are also surgical treatments for far sightedness br Laser procedures br br Photorefractive keratectomy PRK This is a refractive technique that is done by removal of a minimal amount of the corneal surface Hyperopic PRK has many complications like regression effect astigmatism due to epithelial healing and corneal haze Post operative epithelial healing time is also more for PRK br Laser assisted in situ keratomileusis LASIK Laser eye surgery to reshape the cornea so that glasses or contact lenses are no longer needed Excimer laser LASIK can correct hypermetropia up to diopters LASIK is contraindicated in patients with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis br Laser epithelial keratomileusis LASEK Resembles PRK but uses alcohol to loosen the corneal surface br Epi LASIK Epi LASIK is also used to correct hyperopia In this procedure use of epikeratome eliminates the use of alcohol br Laser thermal keratoplasty LTK Laser thermal keratoplasty is a laser based non destructive refractive procedure used to correct hyperopia and presbyopia It uses Thallium Holmium Chromium THC YAG laser br IOL implantation br br Aphakia correction High degree hypermetropia due to absence of lens aphakia is best corrected using intraocular lens implantation br Refractive lens exchange RLE A variation of cataract surgery where the natural crystalline lens is replaced with an artificial intraocular lens the difference is the existence of abnormal ocular anatomy which causes a high refractive error br Phakic IOL Phakic intraocular lens are lenses that implanted inside eye without removing the normal crystalline lens Phakic IOLs can be used to correct hypermetropia up to diopters br Non laser procedures br br Conductive keratoplasty CK Conductive keratoplasty is a non laser refractive procedure used to correct presbyopia and low hypermetropia D to D with or without astigmatism up to D It uses radiofrequency energy to heat and shrink corneal collagen tissue CK is contraindicated in pregnant breastfeeding women central corneal dystrophies and scarring history of herpetic keratitis type diabetes etc br Automated lamellar keratoplasty ALK Hyperopic automated lamellar keratoplasty H ALK and Homoplastic ALK are ALK procedures that corrects low to moderate hyperopia Poor predictability and the risk of complications limits usefulness of these procedures br Keratophakia and epi keratophakia are another two non laser surgical procedures used to correct hypermetropia Keratophakia is a surgical technique developed by Barraquer for treating high hypermetropia and aphakia Poor predictability and induced irregular astigmatism are complications of these procedures br br br Etymology br The term hyperopia comes from Greek hyper over and ps sight GEN pos br br br br br br External links
