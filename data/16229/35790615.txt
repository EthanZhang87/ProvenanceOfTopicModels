id: 35790615
Rhythm game accessories are often required to play rhythm games available for various consoles such as the PlayStation PlayStation Wii and Xbox These include dance pads guitar controllers drum controllers microphones and turntable controllers With the exception of microphones these controllers can generally be used to control any game rhythm or otherwise but have limited inputs making them impractical for most games br Rhythm game controllers are generally cross compatible with other rhythm games For example the drum kit controller included with Guitar Hero World Tour functions properly when used in Rock Band games Some functionality may be diminished however For example Rock Band drum kits only feature drum pads as opposed to the featured on the Guitar Hero versions As a result the in game track must be changed to accommodate done automatically by the software br br br Guitar controllers br br Many officially licensed guitar controllers have been released mostly affiliated with either the Guitar Hero or Rock Band franchises These controllers are shaped to resemble guitars but are generally smaller than their real life counterparts br Common features among these controllers with the exception of Rock Band s pro guitar controllers are a set of five colored fret buttons on the neck green red yellow blue and orange a strum bar around where the pickups on an electric guitar would be and whammy bar corresponding to its real life position on the body Additionally the PlayStation and Xbox controllers also feature a d pad start and select back buttons and a Home Guide button For navigation within the system menus the strum bar acts as up and down on the d pad the dedicated d pad can also be used while the fret buttons correspond to and L on PlayStation or A B X Y and left bumper on Xbox br Guitar controllers for the PlayStation may connect either to the system s controller ports or via USB other than the original SG controllers most PS controllers are wireless via a transceiver dongle All those on the PlayStation connect to the system via USB most do so wirelessly via a USB transceiver dongle On the Xbox guitar controllers may be connected either by USB or wirelessly using the console s integrated GHz wireless technology dependent on the particular controller br br br PlayStation SG controllers br br The PlayStation SG controller is used for Guitar Hero Another was used for Guitar Hero II It is modeled after the Gibson SG guitar br br br X Plorer controller br br The Xbox version of Guitar Hero II came bundled with a newly designed controller known as the X Plorer controller and modeled after the Gibson Explorer guitar Like standard controllers the X Plorer features an expansion port which allows users to equip a wired headset for voice communication The controller connects to the system via a USB cable The controller was sold bundled with the Xbox version of Guitar Hero II some Xbox bundles of Guitar Hero III Legends of Rock or available separately It was also bundled with the Windows and Mac OS X releases of Guitar Hero III Legends of Rock br br br Guitar Hero III Kramer controller br The PlayStation version of Guitar Hero III featured a guitar controller based around the Kramer Striker guitar br br br Guitar Hero III Aerosmith Les Paul controller br br The PlayStation Wii and Xbox versions of Guitar Hero III Legends of Rock came with a newly designed wireless guitar controller which was designed to resemble a Gibson Les Paul br The PlayStation version of the controller connects wirelessly via a USB dongle The Xbox version of the controller utilizes the same GHz wireless technology as the official wireless controller and as such when used in conjunction with the Wireless Gaming Receiver for Microsoft Windows may be used with the PC version of Guitar Hero III Legends of Rock However it is not officially supported by Aspyr Media developer of the PC and Macintosh release and shows up in game using the same icon as the X Plorer The Wii version connects directly to the Wii Remote via its accessory connector while the Remote itself is held in a special cavity in the guitar controller br Both the PlayStation and Xbox versions feature a d pad and a Home Guide button The Wii version however utilises the Remote s Home button and replaces the d pad with an analog stick to facilitate use within the Wii s menus br br In addition to all the features of the earlier X Plorer Xbox and SG PS guitar controllers the Les Paul controller features a detachable neck for easier storage and replacement and customizable faceplates The PlayStation and Xbox versions come with a black faceplate as standard while the Wii version comes with a white one which also features a rectangular window for Wii Remote access The controller was also available separately and bundled with Guitar Hero Aerosmith The Guitar Hero Aerosmith version features a custom faceplate br br br Guitar Hero World Tour Metallica guitar controller br br Guitar Hero World Tour features another new controller known as the Genericaster Unlike previous guitar controllers this is not modeled after a real guitar design but resembles a Fender Stratocaster hence its name As well as a new shape it features a longer quieter strum bar longer whammy bar and repositioned start and select back buttons It also features a new touch sensitive solo section on the neck This is functionally similar to the solo section on Rock Band guitar controllers but is not compatible with Rock Band games br Like the Guitar Hero III Les Paul controller the PlayStation version of the Genericaster connects via a USB dongle which also acts as a two port USB hub while the Wii version connects to the Wii Remote accessory connector and the Xbox version connects via Microsoft s GHz wireless technology Also like the Les Paul it features a detachable neck and customizable faceplates This guitar was available separately bundled with a Guitar Hero World Tour guitar bundle or band bundle game guitar controller drum kit and microphone or bundled with Guitar Hero Metallica Like the Aerosmith Les Paul the Guitar Hero Metallica version features a custom Metallica themed faceplate br br br Guitar Hero guitar controller br The guitar controller for Guitar Hero retains the same basic design as the Guitar Hero World Tour Guitar Controller but with some minor alterations The strum bar is rubberized the nuts on the headstock are made from chrome rather than plastic and the solo section of the neck is molded differently and is now digital rather than analog br br br Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock guitar controller br The guitar controller released for Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock is like the World Tour and guitars not based on a real guitar design This controller differs from its predecessors however in that it drops the touch sensitive strip on the neck and allows for complete replacement customization of the body rather than just faceplates as on previous controllers br br br Guitar Hero Live guitar controller br Guitar Hero Live had a guitar controller with two rows of buttons each This renders the game incompatible with the older Guitar Hero controllers as well as making the Guitar Hero Live controller incompatible with older games br br br Rock Band guitar controller br br The guitar controller for Rock Band is based on the Fender Stratocaster It features two sets of fret buttons one for standard gameplay one for solo sections It also features an effects switch unique to the Rock Band series of games This controller

Day Rock Band br br br Rock Band Fender Precision bass guitar controller br Modeled after the Fender Precision Bass guitar this controller is designed specifically for use in the bass guitar tracks on Rock Band and other rhythm games It lacks the whammy bar found on standard guitar controllers and instead uses a knob A second knob is also present to switch between various effects within Rock Band games and a third knob acts as the start and select buttons by rotating it clockwise or counterclockwise respectively It also features a split strum bar allowing more accurate emulation of dual fingered up strumming used to play real bass guitars br br br The Beatles Rock Band guitar controllers br br Two new guitar controllers were released alongside The Beatles Rock Band modeled after John Lennon s Rickenbacker and George Harrison s Gretsch Duo Jet Functionally these controllers are equivalent to those released alongside Rock Band br br br The Beatles Rock Band bass guitar controller br br The bass guitar controller released alongside The Beatles Rock Band is modeled after the H fner violin bass guitar which was famously used by Sir Paul McCartney however it is configured for right handed use while McCartney s was left handed although one can use the Lefty Flip option to play left handed Unlike the bass guitar controller released alongside Rock Band this controller is functionally equivalent to standard guitar controllers br br br Compatibility br Although generally any guitar controller will work with a given rhythm game this is not the case universally The following table shows compatibility of various games with appropriate guitar controllers Rock Band Pro guitar controllers are only compatible with Rock Band and thus are not shown br br Sources disagree about whether USB based controllers are compatible with PopStar Guitar br br br Drum kits br br Various controllers based around drum kits have been produced for the PlayStation PlayStation Wii and Xbox The design of these varies depending on the game series a kit is designed for Rock Band and Power Gig kits feature four drum pads while Guitar Hero kits feature three drum pads and two cymbal pads The Rock Band kits may be used in Guitar Hero games and vice versa but due to the different number of pads the game experience may differ When Rock Band kits are used in Guitar Hero games the number of note tracks displayed on screen is reduced to four due to the reduced number of pads br br br Rock Band drum kit br br The drum kit controller designed for use with Rock Band features four drum pads and a kick pedal as well as a complement of standard buttons a br br br Rock Band drum kit br The drum kit controller designed for use with Rock Band follows the same basic design as

peripherals the kit was produced by RedOctane br br br Guitar Hero drum kit br The drum kit controller designed for Guitar Hero follows the same basic design as the Guitar Hero World Tour kit but with some modifications br br br ION Drum Rocker br br br Power Gig Rise of the SixString AirStrike drum kit br Unlike other drum controllers the Power Gig Rise of the SixString AirStrike drum kit does not feature discrete drum pads Instead it simulates drum hit via motion tracking of the drum sticks Like Rock Band kits the Power Gig Rise of the SixString AirStrike drum kit is set up for four drum pads br br br Rock Band Pro controllers br Rock Band saw the addition of a new Pro mode which more closely mimics playing real musical instruments As such new peripherals were produced available to allow players to access these modes br br br MIDI Pro adapter br br Designed by Harmonix and manufactured by Mad Catz the MIDI Pro Adapter allows users to connect most MIDI compatible drum kits and keyboards for use in Rock Band as well as some specialized guitars such as the official Rock Band Squier Stratocaster Pro controller and the You Rock MIDI guitar standard MIDI guitars are not compatible however The adapter features a small switch to change between drums keyboard and guitar modes a volume wheel and an overdrive button A standard complement of face buttons Start Select Back and Home Guide buttons and a d pad are also present for navigation The adapter connects to the console via a ft m USB cable and to the instrument via a standard MIDI connector pin DIN br br The MIDI Pro Adapter responds to specific MIDI note data so instruments that do not output these notes and cannot be re mapped are not compatible Requires firmware update on the You Rock guitar for compatibility br br br Wireless Pro keyboard br br In order to play the new keyboard based instrument parts keyboard piano organ etc in Rock Band Harmonix designed a keyboard controller which is produced by Mad Catz The controller has a handle or neck on one side and so resembles a keytar this allows it to be either worn over the shoulder using a strap like a keytar or placed on a horizontal surface like a traditional keyboard The keyboard features full sized velocity sensitive keys with an overdrive button and a touch sensitive strip on the neck It also features a standard set of buttons a in order to facilitate navigation within the game and on the console itself br For standard keyboard mode and when playing guitar bass parts five white keys from the middle C to G are marked with colored dots and are played similarly to the fret buttons found on guitar controllers For pro mode all the keys are used and the keyboard is split up into colored sections to aid the player red C E yellow F B blue C middle C E green F B and orange C The touchpad acts as a modulation control and in game play terms is functionally equivalent to the whammy bar on standard guitar controllers br The keyboard controller also has a mm TRS connector jack which can be used to attach either a stomp switch or an analog expression pedal br The controller connects to the console wirelessly via a USB dongle In order to facilitate syncing between the dongle and the controller each has a sync button The dongle also features a port USB hub allowing additional peripherals to be connected to the system Unlike guitar and drum controllers the Wii version does not connect via the Wii remote and instead connects via a USB dongle br br br Use as a MIDI controller br br The keyboard controller is also MIDI compatible via a standard MIDI port pin DIN connector on its side As such it can be connected to most synthesizers via a MIDI cable and computers via a MIDI to USB adapter allowing the controller to be used as a real musical instrument The controller transmits keyboard notes on MIDI channel br br When in MIDI mode the various non keyboard controls with the exception of the sync button are re mapped to MIDI commands The touch strip acts as a modulation wheel or when the overdrive button is held as a pitch wheel The X button decrements the octave i e shifts it down so for example the C key becomes C while the B button increments it shifts it up these can be used multiple times to get to various different octave settings from MIDI notes or C B to notes or C B This applies to the base octave red and yellow keys the other keys also shift in relation to this making the highest possible note C The Y and A buttons increment or decrement the program number respectively while the Start Home Guide and Select Back send real time system stop continue and start messages respectively Up on the d pad toggles the keyboard between standard and drum mapping mode which maps the lower octave red and yellow keys to MIDI drum notes transmitted on channel The remaining d pad buttons directions allow switching of analog pedal functions down sets it as a channel volume controller left as an expression pedal default and right sets it as a foot controller br br br Pro cymbals br In order to play the pro drum mode players require at least four drum pads and at least cymbal pad with up to three cymbals being compatible To allow this pro cymbals were released to complement existing Rock Band drum sets br br br Pro guitar controllers br For the pro guitar mode of Rock Band a pro guitar controller is required Unlike standard guitar controllers pro guitars allow input of any fret string combination allowing accurate simulation of a real guitar br br br Fender Mustang Pro Guitar controller br br The Fender Mustang Pro Guitar controller which is based on the Fender Mustang has buttons along its neck which simulate holding the guitar strings against the fretboard All six strings are represented along different frets In order to simulate picking strumming the Mustang pro controller features a string box located on the body of the controller around the position of the strum bar on standard guitar controllers or the cavity pickups on a real guitar It consists of six short stainless steel strings suspended between two sensors which detect the vibration of the stings when plucked or strummed In addition to pro mode use the Mustang can be used to play the game in basic mode It also functions as a full MIDI guitar with a MIDI output connector providing compatibility with MIDI software sequencers and hardware devices For use in gaming mode each Mustang controller can only be used with the game console it was designed for An unofficial workaround involves connecting it through a MIDI Pro Adapter although direction pad buttons overdrive detection and Basic button game play are unavailable since they do not function through the MIDI port The Mustang Pro Guitar is only a few inches smaller in length than an actual guitar but being made of plastic is much lighter than an actual guitar The neck is removable from the body for easier storage and transport br br br Fender Squier Stratocaster Pro Guitar br br The Fender Squier Stratocaster Pro Guitar is a specifically designed string Squier Stratocaster guitar which is compatible with Rock Band pro mode This is a true six string electric guitar with electronics built in to allow it to interface with the game to provide added features such as on screen fret sensing Additionally the Squier Stratocaster Pro Guitar has full MIDI output capabilities br Unlike the Mustang Pro controller the Squier is console neutral as it is connected to the console via the MadCatz MIDI Pro Adapter The Squier being a real guitar has no buttons for gameplay and therefore is not usable for basic game play mode only pro mode br br A demonstration of the Fender Squier Stratocaster Pro Guitar at its Electronic Entertainment Expo debut showed it being played directly through an electric amplifier alongside other players on the other controllers while playing the game br br br TurnTables br br br BeatMania
