id: 16182677
A side stick or sidestick controller is an aircraft control stick that is located on the side console of the pilot usually on the righthand side or outboard on a two seat flightdeck Typically this is found in aircraft that are equipped with fly by wire control systems br The throttle controls are typically located to the left of a single pilot or centrally on a two seat flightdeck Only one hand is required to operate them two handed operation is neither possible nor necessary br br br Prevalence br The side stick is used in many modern military fighter aircraft such as the F Fighting Falcon Mitsubishi F Dassault Rafale and F Raptor and also on civil aircraft such as the Sukhoi Superjet Airbus A and all subsequent Airbus aircraft including the largest passenger jet in service the Airbus A br It is also used in new helicopter models such as the Bell br br br Compared to centre sticks br A side stick arrangement contrasts with the more conventional design where the stick is located in the centre of the cockpit between the pilot s legs called a centre stick A side stick arrangement allows HOTAS and increases ejection seat safety for the pilot as there is less interference amongst flight controls br br br Comparison of passive and active side sticks br br br Passive side sticks br In the centre stick design like traditional airplane yokes both the pilot s and co pilot s controls are mechanically connected together so each pilot has a sense of the control inputs of the other In typical Airbus side stick implementations the sticks are independent the so called passive side stick The plane s computer either aggregates multiple inputs or a pilot can press a priority button to lock out inputs from the other side stick However if both side sticks are moved in different directions at the same time regardless of which pilot has priority then both inputs are cancelled out and an aural dual input warning sounds Examples of this occurring include the crash of Air France Flight an Airbus A flying from Rio de Janeiro to Paris the crash of Afriqiyah Airways Flight an Airbus A from flying Johannesburg to Tripoli and the crash of Indonesia AirAsia Flight an Airbus A flying from Surabaya to Singapore The dual input warning will not activate at very low levels if the EGPWS activates due to its lower priority compared to EGPWS br br br Active side sticks br However a later significant development is the active side stick which is in the new Gulfstream G G series business jet aircraft In this system movements in one side stick produce the same actions in the other side stick and therefore provides valuable feedback to the other pilot This addresses the earlier criticisms of the passive side stick The active side stick also provides tactile feedback to the pilot during manual flight In fact the three largest avionics manufacturers Honeywell Rockwell Collins and Thales believe it will become the standard for all new fly by wire aircraft In Ratier Figeac as a subsidiary of UTC Aerospace Systems and supplier of passive side sticks to Airbus since the s became the supplier of active side sticks for the Irkut MC This is the first airliner to use them br Such an active side stick can also be used to increase adherence to a safe flight envelope by applying a force feedback when the pilot makes a control input that would bring the aircraft closer to or beyond the borders of the safe flight envelope This reduces the risk of pilots entering dangerous states of flights outside the operational borders while maintaining the pilots final authority and increasing their situation awareness br br br See also br Centre stick br Yoke aeronautics br Fly by wire br Dual control aviation br Rudder pedals br br br Accidents br Air France Flight br Afriqiyah Airways Flight br Armavia Flight br Indonesia AirAsia Flight br br br br br br External links br Formation stick from Popular Science
