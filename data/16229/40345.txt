In electronics the metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor MOSFET MOS FET or MOS FET is a type of field effect transistor FET most commonly fabricated by the controlled oxidation of silicon It has an insulated gate the voltage of which determines the conductivity of the device This ability to change conductivity with the amount of applied voltage can be used for amplifying or switching electronic signals The term metal insulator semiconductor field effect transistor MISFET is almost synonymous with MOSFET Another near synonym is insulated gate field effect transistor IGFET br The basic principle of the field effect transistor was first patented by Julius Edgar Lilienfeld in Based on this research the first MOS transistor was successfully fabricated and demonstrated by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng in br The main advantage of a MOSFET is that it requires almost no input current to control the load current when compared to bipolar junction transistors BJTs In an enhancement mode MOSFET voltage applied to the gate terminal increases the conductivity of the device In depletion mode transistors voltage applied at the gate reduces the conductivity br The metal in the name MOSFET is sometimes a misnomer because the gate material can be a layer of polysilicon polycrystalline silicon Similarly oxide in the name can also be a misnomer as different dielectric materials are used with the aim of obtaining strong channels with smaller applied voltages br The MOSFET is by far the most common transistor in digital circuits as billions may be included in a memory chip or microprocessor Since MOSFETs can be made with either p type or n type semiconductors complementary pairs of MOS transistors can be used to make switching circuits with very low power consumption in the form of CMOS logic br br br History br The basic principle of this kind of transistor was first patented by Julius Edgar Lilienfeld in The structure resembling the MOS transistor was proposed by Bell scientists William Shockley John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain during their investigation that led to discovery of the transistor effect The structure failed to show the anticipated effects due to the problem of surface state traps on the semiconductor surface that hold electrons immobile In Carl Frosch and L Derick accidentally grew a layer of silicon dioxide over the silicon wafer Further research showed that silicon dioxide could prevent dopants from diffusing into the silicon wafer Building on this work Mohamed M Atalla showed that silicon dioxide is very effective in solving the problem of one important class of surface states br Following this research Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng successfully fabricated and demonstrated the first MOS transistor in The principles behind the device were based on earlier unsuccessful attempts by Bardeen Shockley and Brattain to build a surface field effect device br The device was about times slower than contemporary bipolar transistors and was initially seen as inferior Nevertheless Atalla and Kahng pointed out several advantages of the device notably ease of fabrication and its application in integrated circuits br br br Composition br br Usually the semiconductor of choice is silicon Some chip manufacturers most notably IBM and Intel use an alloy of silicon and germanium SiGe in MOSFET channels Many semiconductors with better electrical properties than silicon such as gallium arsenide do not form good semiconductor to insulator interfaces and thus are not suitable for MOSFETs Research continues on creating insulators with acceptable electrical characteristics on other semiconductor materials br To overcome the increase in power consumption due to gate current leakage a high dielectric is used instead of silicon dioxide for the gate insulator while polysilicon is replaced by metal gates e g Intel br The gate is separated from the channel by a thin insulating layer traditionally of silicon dioxide and later of silicon oxynitride Some companies use a high dielectric and metal gate combination in the nanometer node br When a voltage is applied between the gate and the source the electric field generated penetrates through the oxide and creates an inversion layer or channel at the semiconductor insulator interface The inversion layer provides a channel through which current can pass between source and drain terminals Varying the voltage between the gate and body modulates the conductivity of this layer and thereby controls the current flow between drain and source This is known as enhancement mode br br br Operation br br br Metal oxide semiconductor structure br The traditional metal oxide semiconductor MOS structure is obtained by growing a layer of silicon dioxide SiO on top of a silicon substrate commonly by thermal oxidation and depositing a layer of metal or polycrystalline silicon the latter is commonly used As silicon dioxide is a dielectric material its structure is equivalent to a planar capacitor with one of the electrodes replaced by a semiconductor br When a voltage is applied across a MOS structure it modifies the distribution of charges in the semiconductor If we consider a p type semiconductor with NA the density of acceptors p the density of holes p NA in neutral bulk a positive voltage VG from gate to body see figure creates a depletion layer by forcing the positively charged holes away from the gate insulator semiconductor interface leaving exposed a carrier free region of immobile negatively charged acceptor ions see doping If VG is high enough a high concentration of negative charge carriers forms in an inversion layer located in a thin layer next to the interface between the semiconductor and the insulator br Conventionally the gate voltage at which the volume density of electrons in the inversion layer is the same as the volume density of holes in the body is called the threshold voltage When the voltage between transistor gate and source VG exceeds the threshold voltage Vth the difference is known as overdrive voltage br This structure with p type body is the basis of the n type MOSFET which requires the addition of n type source and drain regions br br br MOS capacitors and band diagrams br br The MOS capacitor structure is the heart of the MOSFET Consider a MOS capacitor where the silicon base is of p type If a positive voltage is applied at the gate holes which are at the surface of the p type substrate will be repelled by the electric field generated by the voltage applied At first the holes will simply be repelled and what will remain on the surface will be immobile negative atoms of the acceptor type which creates a depletion region on the surface A hole is created by an acceptor atom e g boron which has one less electron than a silicon atom Holes are not actually repelled being non entities electrons are attracted by the positive field and fill these holes This creates a depletion region where no charge carriers exist because the electron is now fixed onto the atom and immobile br As the voltage at the gate increases there will be a point at which the surface above the depletion region will be converted from p type into n type as electrons from the bulk area will start to get attracted by the larger electric field This is known as inversion The threshold voltage at which this conversion happens is one of the most important parameters in a MOSFET br In the case of a p type MOSFET bulk inversion happens when the intrinsic energy level at the surface becomes smaller than the Fermi level at the surface This can be seen on a band diagram The Fermi level defines the type of semiconductor in discussion If the Fermi level is equal to the Intrinsic level the semiconductor is of intrinsic or pure type If the Fermi level lies closer to the conduction band valence band then the semiconductor type will be of n type p type br When the gate voltage is increased in a positive sense for the given example this will shift the intrinsic energy level band so that it will curve downwards towards the valence band If the Fermi level lies closer to the valence band for p type there will be a point when the Intrinsic level will start to cross the Fermi level and when the voltage reaches the threshold voltage the intrinsic level does cross the Fermi level and that is what is known as inversion At that point the surface of the semiconductor is inverted from p type into n type br If the Fermi level lies above the intrinsic level the semiconductor is of n type therefore at inversion when the intrinsic level reaches and crosses the Fermi level which lies closer to the valence band the semiconductor type changes at the surface as dictated by the relative positions of the Fermi and Intrinsic energy levels br br br Structure and channel formation br br A MOSFET is based on the modulation of charge concentration by a MOS capacitance between a body electrode and a gate electrode located above the body and insulated from all other device regions by a gate dielectric layer If dielectrics other than an oxide are employed the device may be referred to as a metal insulator semiconductor FET MISFET Compared to the MOS capacitor the MOSFET includes two additional terminals source and drain each connected to individual highly doped regions that are separated by the body region These regions can be either p or n type but they must both be of the same type and of opposite type to the body region The source and drain unlike the body are highly doped as signified by a sign after the type of doping br If the MOSFET is an n channel or nMOS FET then the source and drain are n regions and the body is a p region If the MOSFET is a p channel or pMOS FET then the source and drain are p regions and the body is a n region The source is so named because it is the source of the charge carriers electrons for n channel holes for p channel that flow through the channel similarly the drain is where the charge carriers leave the channel br The occupancy of the energy bands in a semiconductor is set by the position of the Fermi level relative to the semiconductor energy band edges br br With sufficient gate voltage the valence band edge is driven far from the Fermi level and holes from the body are driven away from the gate br At larger gate bias still near the semiconductor surface the conduction band edge is brought close to the Fermi level populating the surface with electrons in an inversion layer or n channel at the interface between the p region and the oxide This conducting channel extends between the source and the drain and current is conducted through it when a voltage is applied between the two electrodes Increasing the voltage on the gate leads to a higher electron density in the inversion layer and therefore increases the current flow between the source and drain For gate voltages below the threshold value the channel is lightly populated and only a very small subthreshold leakage current can flow between the source and the drain br When a negative gate source voltage positive source gate is applied it creates a p channel at the surface of the n region analogous to the n channel case but with opposite polarities of charges and voltages When a voltage less negative than the threshold value a negative voltage for the p channel is applied between gate and source the channel disappears and only a very small subthreshold current can flow between the source and the drain The device may comprise a silicon on insulator device in which a buried oxide is formed below a thin semiconductor layer If the channel region between the gate dielectric and the buried oxide region is very thin the channel is referred to as an ultrathin channel region with the source and drain regions formed on either side in or above the thin semiconductor layer Other semiconductor materials may be employed When the source and drain regions are formed above the channel in whole or in part they are referred to as raised source drain regions br br br Modes of operation br br The operation of a MOSFET can be separated into three different modes depending on the voltages at the terminals In the following discussion a simplified algebraic model is used Modern MOSFET characteristics are more complex than the algebraic model

threshold model the transistor is turned off and there is no conduction between drain and source A more accurate model considers the effect of thermal energy on the Fermi Dirac distribution of electron energies which allow some of the more energetic electrons at the source to enter the channel and flow to the drain This results in a subthreshold current that is an exponential function of gate source voltage While the current between drain and source should ideally be zero when the transistor is being used as a turned off switch there is a weak inversion current sometimes called

out and conduction is not through a narrow channel but through a broader two or three dimensional current distribution extending away from the interface and deeper in the substrate The onset of this region is also known as pinch off to indicate the lack of channel region near the drain Although the channel does not extend the full length of the device the electric field between the drain and the channel is very high and conduction continues The drain current is now weakly dependent upon drain voltage and controlled primarily by the gate source voltage and modeled approximately as br br br br

saturation region br If is taken as zero an infinite output resistance of the device results that leads to unrealistic circuit predictions particularly in analog circuits br As the channel length becomes very short these equations become quite inaccurate New physical effects arise For example carrier transport in the active mode may become limited by velocity saturation When velocity saturation dominates the saturation drain current is more nearly linear than quadratic in VGS At even shorter lengths carriers transport with near zero scattering known as quasi ballistic transport In the ballistic regime the carriers travel at an injection velocity that may exceed the saturation velocity and approaches the Fermi velocity at high inversion charge density In addition drain induced barrier lowering increases off state cutoff current and requires an increase in threshold voltage to compensate which in turn reduces the saturation current br br br Body effect br br The occupancy of the energy bands in a semiconductor is set by the position of the Fermi level relative to the semiconductor energy band edges Application of a source to substrate reverse bias of the source body pn junction introduces a split between the Fermi levels for electrons and holes moving the Fermi level for the channel further from the band edge lowering the occupancy of the channel The effect is to increase the gate voltage necessary to establish the channel as seen in the figure This change in channel strength by application of reverse bias is called the body effect br Simply put using an nMOS example the gate to body bias VGB positions the conduction band energy levels while the source to body bias VSB positions the electron Fermi level near the interface deciding occupancy of these levels near the interface and hence the strength of the inversion layer or channel br The body effect upon the channel can be described using a modification of the threshold voltage approximated by the

gate bias is sufficient to ensure that a channel is present As this equation shows a reverse bias VSB causes an increase in threshold voltage VTB and therefore demands a larger gate voltage before the channel populates br The body can be operated as a second gate and is sometimes referred to as the back gate the body effect is sometimes called the back gate effect br br br Circuit symbols br A variety of symbols are used for the MOSFET The basic design is generally a line for the channel with the source and drain leaving it at right angles and then bending back at right angles into the same direction as the channel Sometimes three line segments are used for enhancement mode and a solid line for depletion mode see depletion and enhancement modes Another line is drawn parallel to the channel for the gate br The bulk or body connection if shown is shown connected to the back of the channel with an arrow indicating pMOS or nMOS Arrows always point from P to N so an NMOS N channel in P well or P substrate has the arrow pointing in from the bulk to the channel If the bulk is connected to the source as is generally the case with discrete devices it is sometimes angled to meet up with the source leaving the transistor If the bulk is not shown as is often the case in IC design as they are generally common bulk an inversion symbol is sometimes used to indicate PMOS alternatively an arrow on the source may be used in the same way as for bipolar transistors out for nMOS in for pMOS br Comparison of enhancement mode and depletion mode MOSFET symbols along with JFET symbols The orientation of the symbols most significantly the position of source relative to drain is such that more positive voltages appear higher on the page than less positive voltages implying conventional current flowing down the page br br In schematics where G S D are not labeled the detailed features of the symbol indicate which terminal is source and which is drain For enhancement mode and depletion mode MOSFET symbols in columns two and five the source terminal is the one connected to the triangle Additionally in this diagram the gate is shown as an L shape whose input leg is closer to S than D also indicating which is which However these symbols are often drawn with a T shaped gate as elsewhere on this page so it is the triangle which must be relied upon to indicate the source terminal br For the symbols in which the bulk or body terminal is shown it is here shown internally connected to the source i e the black triangles in the diagrams in columns and This is a typical configuration but by no means the only important configuration In general the MOSFET is a four terminal device and in integrated circuits many of the MOSFETs share a body connection not necessarily connected to the source terminals of all the transistors br br br Applications br Digital integrated circuits such as microprocessors and memory devices contain thousands to billions of integrated MOSFET transistors on each device providing the basic switching functions required to implement logic gates and data storage Discrete devices are widely used in applications such as switch mode power supplies variable frequency drives and other power electronics applications where each device may be switching thousands of watts Radio frequency amplifiers up to the UHF spectrum use MOSFET transistors as analog signal and power amplifiers Radio systems also use MOSFETs as oscillators or mixers to convert frequencies MOSFET devices are also applied in audio frequency power amplifiers for public address systems sound reinforcement and home and automobile sound systems br br br MOS integrated circuits br Following the development of clean rooms to reduce contamination to levels never before thought necessary and of photolithography and the planar process to allow circuits to be made in very few steps the Si SiO system possessed the technical attractions of low cost of production on a per circuit basis and ease of integration Largely because of these two factors the MOSFET has become the most widely used type of transistor in the Institution of Engineering and Technology IET br General Microelectronics introduced the first commercial MOS integrated circuit in br Additionally the method of coupling two complementary MOSFETs P channel and N channel into one high low switch known as CMOS means that digital circuits dissipate very little power except when actually switched br The earliest microprocessors starting in were all MOS microprocessors i e fabricated entirely from PMOS logic or fabricated entirely from NMOS logic In the s MOS microprocessors were often contrasted with CMOS microprocessors and bipolar bit slice processors br br br CMOS circuits br The MOSFET is used in digital complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS logic which uses p and n channel MOSFETs as building blocks Overheating is a major concern in integrated circuits since ever more transistors are packed into ever smaller chips CMOS logic reduces power consumption because no current flows ideally and thus no power is consumed except when the inputs to logic gates are being switched CMOS accomplishes this current reduction by complementing every nMOSFET with a pMOSFET and connecting both gates and both drains together A high voltage on the gates will cause the nMOSFET to conduct and the pMOSFET not to conduct and a low voltage on the gates causes the reverse During the switching time as the voltage goes from one state to another both MOSFETs will conduct briefly This arrangement greatly reduces power consumption and heat generation br br br Digital br The growth of digital technologies like the microprocessor has provided the motivation to advance MOSFET technology faster than any other type of silicon based transistor A big advantage of MOSFETs for digital switching is that the oxide layer between the gate and the channel prevents DC current from flowing through the gate further reducing power consumption and giving a very large input impedance The insulating oxide between the gate and channel effectively isolates a MOSFET in one logic stage from earlier and later stages which allows a single MOSFET output to drive a considerable number of MOSFET inputs Bipolar transistor based logic such as TTL does not have such a high fanout capacity This isolation also makes it easier for the designers to ignore to some extent loading effects between logic stages independently That extent is defined by the operating frequency as frequencies increase the input impedance of the MOSFETs decreases br br br Analog br The MOSFET s advantages in digital circuits do not translate into supremacy in all analog circuits The two types of circuit draw upon different features of transistor behavior Digital circuits switch spending most of their time either fully on or fully off The transition from one to the other is only of concern with regards to speed and charge required Analog circuits depend on operation in the transition region where small changes to Vgs can modulate the output drain current The JFET and bipolar junction transistor BJT are preferred for accurate matching of adjacent devices in integrated circuits higher transconductance and certain temperature characteristics which simplify keeping performance predictable as circuit temperature varies br Nevertheless MOSFETs are widely used in many types of analog circuits because of their own advantages zero gate current high and adjustable output impedance and improved robustness vs BJTs which can be permanently degraded by even lightly breaking down the emitter base The characteristics and performance of many analog circuits can be scaled up or down by changing the sizes length and width of the MOSFETs used By comparison in bipolar transistors follow a different scaling law MOSFETs ideal characteristics regarding gate current zero and drain source offset voltage zero also make them nearly ideal switch elements and also make switched capacitor analog circuits practical In their linear region MOSFETs can be used as precision resistors which can have a much higher controlled resistance than BJTs In high power circuits MOSFETs sometimes have the advantage of not suffering from thermal runaway as BJTs do This means that complete analog circuits can be made on a silicon chip in a much smaller space and with simpler fabrication techniques MOSFETS are ideally suited to switch inductive loads because of tolerance to inductive kickback br Some ICs combine analog and digital MOSFET circuitry on a single mixed signal integrated circuit making the needed board space even smaller This creates a need to isolate the analog circuits from the digital circuits on a chip level leading to the use of isolation rings and silicon on insulator SOI Since MOSFETs require more space to handle a given amount of power than a BJT fabrication processes can incorporate BJTs and MOSFETs into a single device Mixed transistor devices are called bi FETs bipolar FETs if they contain just one BJT FET and BiCMOS bipolar CMOS if they contain complementary BJT FETs Such devices have the advantages of both insulated gates and higher current density br br br Analog switches br br MOSFET analog switches use the MOSFET to pass analog signals when on and as a high impedance when off Signals flow in both directions across a MOSFET switch In this application the drain and source of a MOSFET exchange places depending on the relative voltages of the source and drain electrodes The source is the more negative side for an N MOS or the more positive side for a P MOS All of these switches are limited on what signals they can pass or stop by their gate source gate drain and source drain voltages exceeding the voltage current or power limits will potentially damage the switch br br br Single type br This analog switch uses a four terminal simple MOSFET of either P or N type br In the case of an n type switch the body is connected to the most negative supply usually GND and the gate is used as the switch control Whenever the gate voltage exceeds the source voltage by at least a threshold voltage the MOSFET conducts The higher the voltage the more the MOSFET can conduct An N MOS switch passes all voltages less than Vgate Vtn When the switch is conducting it typically operates in the linear or ohmic mode of operation since the source and drain voltages will typically be nearly equal br In the case of a P MOS the body is connected to the most positive voltage and the gate is brought to a lower potential to turn the switch on The P MOS switch passes all voltages higher than Vgate Vtp threshold voltage Vtp is negative in the case of enhancement mode P MOS br br br Dual type CMOS br This complementary or CMOS type of switch uses one P MOS and one N MOS FET to counteract the limitations of the single type switch The FETs have their drains and sources connected in parallel the body of the P MOS is connected to the high potential VDD and the body of the N MOS is connected to the low potential gnd To turn the switch on the gate of the P MOS is driven to the low potential and the gate of the N MOS is driven to the high potential For voltages between VDD Vtn and gnd Vtp both FETs conduct the signal for voltages less than gnd Vtp the N MOS conducts alone and for voltages greater than VDD Vtn the P MOS conducts alone br The voltage limits for this switch are the gate source gate drain and source drain voltage limits for both FETs Also the P MOS is typically two to three times wider than the N MOS so the switch will be balanced for speed in the two directions br Tri state circuitry sometimes incorporates a CMOS MOSFET switch on its output to provide for a low ohmic full range output when on and a high ohmic mid level signal when off br br br Construction br br br Gate material br The primary criterion for the gate material is that it is a good conductor Highly doped polycrystalline silicon is an acceptable but certainly not ideal conductor and also suffers from some more technical deficiencies in its role as the standard gate material Nevertheless there are several reasons favoring use of polysilicon br br The threshold voltage and consequently the drain to source on current is modified by the work function difference between the gate material and channel material Because polysilicon is a semiconductor its work function can be modulated by adjusting the type and level of doping Furthermore because polysilicon has the same bandgap as the underlying silicon channel it is quite straightforward to tune the work function to achieve low threshold voltages for both NMOS and PMOS devices By contrast the work functions of metals are not easily modulated so tuning the work function to obtain low threshold voltages LVT becomes a significant challenge Additionally obtaining low threshold devices on both PMOS and NMOS devices sometimes requires the use of different metals for each device type br The silicon SiO interface has been well studied and is known to have relatively few defects By contrast many metal insulator interfaces contain significant levels of defects which can lead to Fermi level pinning charging or other phenomena that ultimately degrade device performance br In the MOSFET IC fabrication process it is preferable to deposit the gate material prior to certain high temperature steps in order to make better performing transistors Such high temperature steps would melt some metals limiting the types of metal that can be used in a metal gate based process br While polysilicon gates have been the de facto standard for the last twenty years they do have some disadvantages which have led to their likely future replacement by metal gates These disadvantages include br br Polysilicon is not a great conductor approximately times more resistive than metals which reduces the signal propagation speed through the material The resistivity can be lowered by increasing the level of doping but even highly doped polysilicon is not as conductive as most metals To improve conductivity further sometimes a high temperature metal such as tungsten titanium cobalt and more recently nickel is alloyed with the top layers of the polysilicon Such a blended material is called silicide The silicide polysilicon combination has better electrical properties than polysilicon alone and still does not melt in subsequent processing Also the threshold voltage is not significantly higher than with polysilicon alone because the silicide material is not near the channel The process in which silicide is formed on both the gate electrode and the source and drain regions is sometimes called salicide self aligned silicide br When the transistors are extremely scaled down it is necessary to make the gate dielectric layer very thin around nm in state of the art technologies A phenomenon observed here is the so called poly depletion where a depletion layer is formed in the gate polysilicon layer next to the gate dielectric when the transistor is in the inversion To avoid this problem a metal gate is desired A variety of metal gates such as tantalum tungsten tantalum nitride and titanium nitride are used usually in conjunction with high dielectrics An alternative is to use fully silicided polysilicon gates a process known as FUSI br Present high performance CPUs use metal gate technology together with high dielectrics a combination known as high metal gate HKMG The disadvantages of metal gates are overcome by a few techniques br br The threshold voltage is tuned by including a thin work function metal layer between the high dielectric and the main metal This layer is thin enough that the total work function of the gate is influenced by both the main metal and thin metal work functions either due to alloying during annealing or simply due to the incomplete screening by the thin metal The threshold voltage thus can be tuned by the thickness of the thin metal layer br High dielectrics are now well studied and their defects are understood br HKMG processes exist that do not require the metals to experience high temperature anneals other processes select metals that can survive the annealing step br br br Insulator br As devices are made smaller insulating layers are made thinner often through steps of thermal oxidation or localised oxidation of silicon LOCOS For nano scaled devices at some point tunneling of carriers through the insulator from the channel to the gate electrode takes place To reduce the resulting leakage current the insulator can be made thinner by choosing a material with a higher dielectric constant To see how thickness and dielectric constant are related note that Gauss s law connects field to charge as br br br br br Q br br br br br br br br br E br br br br

tins constant see the article on high dielectrics for more detail and the section in this article on gate oxide leakage br The insulator in a MOSFET is a dielectric which can in any event be silicon oxide formed by LOCOS but many other dielectric materials are employed The generic term for the dielectric is gate dielectric since the dielectric lies directly below the gate electrode and above the channel of the MOSFET br br br Junction design br The source to body and drain to body junctions are the object of much attention because of three major factors their design affects the current voltage I V characteristics of the device lowering output resistance and also the speed of the device through the loading effect of the junction capacitances and finally the component of stand by power dissipation due to junction leakage br br The drain induced barrier lowering of the threshold voltage and channel length modulation effects upon I V curves are reduced by using shallow junction extensions In addition halo doping can be used that is the addition of very thin heavily doped regions of the same doping type as the body tight against the junction walls to limit the extent of depletion regions br The capacitive effects are limited by using raised source and drain geometries that make most of the contact area border thick dielectric instead of silicon br These various features of junction design are shown with artistic license in the figure br br br Scaling br br Over the past decades the MOSFET as used for digital logic has continually been scaled down in size typical MOSFET channel lengths were once several micrometres but modern integrated circuits are incorporating MOSFETs with channel lengths of tens of nanometers Robert Dennard s work on scaling theory was pivotal in recognising that this ongoing reduction was possible Intel began production of a process featuring a nm feature size with the channel being even shorter in late The semiconductor industry maintains a roadmap the ITRS which sets the pace for MOSFET development Historically the difficulties with decreasing the size of the MOSFET have been associated with the semiconductor device fabrication process the need to use very low voltages and with poorer electrical performance necessitating circuit redesign and innovation small MOSFETs exhibit higher leakage currents and lower output resistance br Smaller MOSFETs are desirable for several reasons The main reason to make transistors smaller is to pack more and more devices in a given chip area This results in a chip with the same functionality in a smaller area or chips with more functionality in the same area Since fabrication costs for a semiconductor wafer are relatively fixed the cost per integrated circuits is mainly related to the number of chips that can be produced per wafer Hence smaller ICs allow more chips per wafer reducing the price per chip In fact over the past years the number of transistors per chip has been doubled every years once a new technology node is introduced For example the number of MOSFETs in a microprocessor fabricated in a nm technology can well be twice as many as in a nm chip This doubling of transistor density was first observed by Gordon Moore in and is commonly referred to as Moore s law It is also expected that smaller transistors switch faster For example one approach to size reduction is a scaling of the MOSFET that requires all device dimensions to reduce proportionally The main device dimensions are the channel length channel width and oxide thickness When they are scaled down by equal factors the transistor channel resistance does not change while gate capacitance is cut by that factor Hence the RC delay of the transistor scales with a similar factor While this has been traditionally the case for the older technologies for the state of the art MOSFETs reduction of the transistor dimensions does not necessarily translate to higher chip speed because the delay due to interconnections is more significant br Producing MOSFETs with channel lengths much smaller than a micrometre is a challenge and the difficulties of semiconductor device fabrication are always a limiting factor in advancing integrated circuit technology Though processes such as ALD have improved fabrication for small components the small size of the MOSFET less than a few tens of nanometers has created operational problems br br br Higher subthreshold conduction br As MOSFET geometries shrink the voltage that can be applied to the gate must be reduced to maintain reliability To maintain performance the threshold voltage of the MOSFET has to be reduced as well As threshold voltage is reduced the transistor cannot be switched from complete turn off to complete turn on with the limited voltage swing available the circuit design is a compromise between strong current in the on case and low current in the off case and the application determines whether to favor one over the other Subthreshold leakage including subthreshold conduction gate oxide leakage and reverse biased junction leakage which was ignored in the past now can consume upwards of half of the total power consumption of modern high performance VLSI chips br br br Increased gate oxide leakage br The gate oxide which serves as insulator between the gate and channel should be made as thin as possible to increase the channel conductivity and performance when the transistor is on and to reduce subthreshold leakage when the transistor is off However with current gate oxides with a thickness of around nm which in silicon is atoms thick the quantum mechanical phenomenon of electron tunneling occurs between the gate and channel leading to increased power consumption Silicon dioxide has traditionally been used as the gate insulator Silicon dioxide however has a modest dielectric constant Increasing the dielectric constant of the gate dielectric allows a thicker layer while maintaining a high capacitance capacitance is proportional to dielectric constant and inversely proportional to dielectric thickness All else equal a higher dielectric thickness reduces the quantum tunneling current through the dielectric between the gate and the channel br Insulators that have a larger dielectric constant than silicon dioxide referred to as high dielectrics such as group IVb metal silicates e g hafnium and zirconium silicates and oxides are being used to reduce the gate leakage from the nanometer technology node onwards On the other hand the barrier height of the new gate insulator is an important consideration the difference in conduction band energy between the semiconductor and the dielectric and the corresponding difference in valence band energy also affects leakage current level For the traditional gate oxide silicon dioxide the former barrier is approximately eV For many alternative dielectrics the value is significantly lower tending to increase the tunneling current somewhat negating the advantage of higher dielectric constant The maximum gate source voltage is determined by the strength of the electric field able to be sustained by the gate dielectric before significant leakage occurs As the insulating dielectric is made thinner the electric field strength within it goes up for a fixed voltage This necessitates using lower voltages with the thinner dielectric br br br Increased junction leakage br To make devices smaller junction design has become more complex leading to higher doping levels shallower junctions halo doping and so forth all to decrease drain induced barrier lowering see the section on junction design To keep these complex junctions in place the annealing steps formerly used to remove damage and electrically active defects must be curtailed increasing junction leakage Heavier doping is also associated with thinner depletion layers and more recombination centers that result in increased leakage current even without lattice damage br br br Drain induced barrier lowering and VT roll off br Drain induced barrier lowering DIBL and VT roll off Because of the short channel effect channel formation is not entirely done by the gate but now the drain and source also affect the channel formation As the channel length decreases the depletion regions of the source and drain come closer together and make the threshold voltage VT a function of the length of the channel This is called VT roll off VT also becomes function of drain to source voltage VDS As we increase the VDS the depletion regions increase in size and a considerable amount of charge is depleted by the VDS The gate voltage required to form the channel is then lowered and thus the VT decreases with an increase in VDS This effect is called drain induced barrier lowering DIBL br br br Lower output resistance br For analog operation good gain requires a high MOSFET output impedance which is to say the MOSFET current should vary only slightly with the applied drain to source voltage As devices are made smaller the influence of the drain competes more successfully with that of the gate due to the growing proximity of these two electrodes increasing the sensitivity of the MOSFET current to the drain voltage To counteract the resulting decrease in output resistance circuits are made more complex either by requiring more devices for example the cascode and cascade amplifiers or by feedback circuitry using operational amplifiers for example a circuit like that in the adjacent figure br br br Lower transconductance br The transconductance of the MOSFET decides its gain and is proportional to hole or electron mobility depending on device type at least for low drain voltages As MOSFET size is reduced the fields in the channel increase and the dopant impurity levels increase Both changes reduce the carrier mobility and hence the transconductance As channel lengths are reduced without proportional reduction in drain voltage raising the electric field in the channel the result is velocity saturation of the carriers limiting the current and the transconductance br br br Interconnect capacitance br Traditionally switching time was roughly proportional to the gate capacitance of gates However with transistors becoming smaller and more transistors being placed on the chip interconnect capacitance the capacitance of the metal layer connections between different parts of the chip is becoming a large percentage of capacitance Signals have to travel through the interconnect which leads to increased delay and lower performance br br br Heat production br The ever increasing density of MOSFETs on an integrated circuit creates problems of substantial localized heat generation that can impair circuit operation Circuits operate more slowly at high temperatures and have reduced reliability and shorter lifetimes Heat sinks and other cooling devices and methods are now required for many integrated circuits including microprocessors Power MOSFETs are at risk of thermal runaway As their on state resistance rises with temperature if the load is approximately a constant current load then the power loss rises correspondingly generating further heat When the heatsink is not able to keep the temperature low enough the junction temperature may rise quickly and uncontrollably resulting in destruction of the device br br br Process variations br With MOSFETs becoming smaller the number of atoms in the silicon that produce many of the transistor s properties is becoming fewer with the result that control of dopant numbers and placement is more erratic During chip manufacturing random process variations affect all transistor dimensions length width junction depths oxide thickness etc and become a greater percentage of overall transistor size as the transistor shrinks The transistor characteristics become less certain more statistical The random nature of manufacture means we do not know which particular example MOSFETs actually will end up in a particular instance of the circuit This uncertainty forces a less optimal design because the design must work for a great variety of possible component MOSFETs See process variation design for manufacturability reliability engineering and statistical process control br br br Modeling challenges br Modern ICs are computer simulated with the goal of obtaining working circuits from the first manufactured lot As devices are miniaturized the complexity of the processing makes it difficult to predict exactly what the final devices look like and modeling of physical processes becomes more challenging as well In addition microscopic variations in structure due simply to the probabilistic nature of atomic processes require statistical not just deterministic predictions These factors combine to make adequate simulation and right the first time manufacture difficult br br br Other types br br br Dual gate br br The dual gate MOSFET has a tetrode configuration where both gates control the current in the device It is commonly used for small signal devices in radio frequency applications where biasing the drain side gate at constant potential reduces the gain loss caused by Miller effect replacing two separate transistors in cascode configuration Other common uses in RF circuits include gain control and mixing frequency conversion The tetrode description though accurate does not replicate the vacuum tube tetrode Vacuum tube tetrodes using a screen grid exhibit much lower grid plate capacitance and much higher output impedance and voltage gains than triode vacuum tubes These improvements are commonly an order of magnitude times or considerably more Tetrode transistors whether bipolar junction or field effect do not exhibit improvements of such a great degree br The FinFET is a double gate silicon on insulator device one of a number of geometries being introduced to mitigate the effects of short channels and reduce drain induced barrier lowering The fin refers to the narrow channel between source and drain A thin insulating oxide layer on either side of the fin separates it from the gate SOI FinFETs with a thick oxide on top of the fin are called double gate and those with a thin oxide on top as well as on the sides are called triple gate FinFETs br br br Depletion mode br There are depletion mode MOSFET devices which are less commonly used than the standard enhancement mode devices already described These are MOSFET devices that are doped so that a channel exists even with zero voltage from gate to source To control the channel a negative voltage is applied to the gate for an n channel device depleting the channel which reduces the current flow through the device In essence the depletion mode device is equivalent to a normally closed on switch while the enhancement mode device is equivalent to a normally open off switch br Due to their low noise figure in the RF region and better gain these devices are often preferred to bipolars in RF front ends such as in TV sets br Depletion mode MOSFET families include the BF by Siemens and Telefunken and the BF in the s by Philips later to become NXP Semiconductors whose derivatives are still used in AGC and RF mixer front ends br br br Metal insulator semiconductor field effect transistor MISFET br Metal insulator semiconductor field effect transistor or MISFET is a more general term than MOSFET and a synonym to insulated gate field effect transistor IGFET All MOSFETs are MISFETs but not all MISFETs are MOSFETs br The gate dielectric insulator in a MISFET is a substrate oxide hence typically silicon dioxide in a MOSFET but other materials can also be employed The gate dielectric lies directly below the gate electrode and above the channel of the MISFET The term metal is historically used for the gate material even though now it is usually highly doped polysilicon or some other non metal br Insulator types may be br br Silicon dioxide in silicon MOSFETs br Organic insulators e g undoped trans polyacetylene cyanoethyl pullulan CEP for organic based FETs br br br NMOS logic br For devices of equal current driving capability n channel MOSFETs can be made smaller than p channel MOSFETs due to p channel charge carriers holes having lower mobility than do n channel charge carriers electrons and producing only one type of MOSFET on a silicon substrate is cheaper and technically simpler These were the driving principles in the design of NMOS logic which uses n channel MOSFETs exclusively However neglecting leakage current unlike CMOS logic NMOS logic consumes power even when no switching is taking place With advances in technology CMOS logic displaced NMOS logic in the mid s to become the preferred process for digital chips br br br Power MOSFET br br Power MOSFETs have a different structure As with most power devices the structure is vertical and not planar Using a vertical structure it is possible for the transistor to sustain both high blocking voltage and high current The voltage rating of the transistor is a function of the doping and thickness of the N epitaxial layer see cross section while the current rating is a function of the channel width the wider the channel the higher the current In a planar structure the current and breakdown voltage ratings are both a function of the channel dimensions respectively width and length of the channel resulting in inefficient use of the silicon estate With the vertical structure the component area is roughly proportional to the current it can sustain and the component thickness actually the N epitaxial layer thickness is proportional to the breakdown voltage br Power MOSFETs with lateral structure are mainly used in high end audio amplifiers and high power PA systems Their advantage is a better behaviour in the saturated region corresponding to the linear region of a bipolar transistor than the vertical MOSFETs Vertical MOSFETs are designed for switching applications br br br Double diffused metal oxide semiconductor DMOS br There are LDMOS lateral double diffused metal oxide semiconductor and VDMOS vertical double diffused metal oxide semiconductor Most power MOSFETs are made using this technology br br br Radiation hardened by design RHBD br Semiconductor sub micrometer and nanometer electronic circuits are the primary concern for operating within the normal tolerance in harsh radiation environments like outer space One of the design approaches for making a radiation hardened by design RHBD device is enclosed layout transistor ELT Normally the gate of the MOSFET surrounds the drain which is placed in the center of the ELT The source of the MOSFET surrounds the gate Another RHBD MOSFET is called H Gate Both of these transistors have very low leakage currents with respect to radiation However they are large in size and take up more space on silicon than a standard MOSFET In older STI shallow trench isolation designs radiation strikes near the silicon oxide region cause the channel inversion at the corners of the standard MOSFET due to accumulation of radiation induced trapped charges If the charges are large enough the accumulated charges affect STI surface edges along the channel near the channel interface gate of the standard MOSFET This causes a device channel inversion to occur along the channel edges creating an off state leakage path Subsequently the device turns on this process severely degrades the reliability of circuits The ELT offers many advantages including an improvement of reliability by reducing unwanted surface inversion at the gate edges which occurs in the standard MOSFET Since the gate edges are enclosed in ELT there is no gate oxide edge STI at gate interface and thus the transistor off state leakage is reduced very much Low power microelectronic circuits including computers communication devices and monitoring systems in space shuttles and satellites are very different from what is used on earth They are radiation high speed atomic particles like proton and neutron solar flare magnetic energy dissipation in Earth s space energetic cosmic rays like X ray gamma ray etc tolerant circuits These special electronics are designed by applying different techniques using RHBD MOSFETs to ensure safe space journeys and safe space
