A virtual reality headset or VR headset is a head mounted device that uses D near eye displays and positional tracking to provide a virtual reality environment for the user VR headsets are widely used with VR video games but they are also used in other applications including simulators and trainers VR headsets typically include a stereoscopic display providing separate images for each eye stereo sound and sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes for tracking the pose of the user s head to match the orientation of the virtual camera with the user s eye positions in the real world br VR headsets typically use at least one MEMS IMU for DOF motion tracking and optionally more tracking technology for DOF motion tracking DOF devices typically use a sensor fusion algorithm to merge the data from the IMU and any other tracking sources The sensor fusion algorithms that are used are often variants of a Kalman filter br Some VR headsets also have eye tracking sensors and gaming controllers The VR glasses use a technology called head tracking which changes the field of vision as a person turns their head The technology may not be perfect as there is latency if the head moves too fast Still it does offer an immersive experience br Virtual reality headsets and viewers have also been designed for smartphones Unlike headsets with integrated displays these units are essentially enclosures which a smartphone can be inserted into VR content is viewed from the screen of the device itself through lenses acting as a stereoscope rather than using dedicated internal displays br br br History br VPL Research was a company that made early VR headsets in the s br br The Sega VR was announced in and seen in early at the Winter CES It was never released for consoles but was utilized for the Sega VR motion simulator arcade attraction in Another early VR headset the Forte VFX was announced at CES in The VFX has stereoscopic displays axis head tracking and stereo headphones br Sony released the Glasstron in which has an optional positional sensor allowing the wearer to view the surroundings with the perspective moving as the user s head moves giving a deep sense of immersion These VR headsets gave MechWarrior players a new visual perspective of seeing the battlefield from inside the cockpit of their craft However these early headsets failed commercially due to their limited technology and they were described by John Carmack as like looking through toilet paper tubes br In a crowdfunding campaign began for a VR headset known as Oculus Rift the project was led by several prominent video game developers including John Carmack who later became the company s CTO In March the project s parent company Oculus VR was acquired by Facebook for billion The final consumer oriented release of Oculus Rift began shipping on March br In March Sony demonstrated a prototype headset for PlayStation which was later named PlayStation VR In Valve demonstrated some headset prototypes which led to a partnership with HTC to produce the Vive which focuses on room scale VR environments that users can naturally navigate within and interact with The Vive was released in April and PlayStation VR in October br Google released a series of specifications and associated DIY kits for virtual reality viewers known as Google Cardboard these viewers are capable of being constructed using low cost materials and a smartphone with a gyroscope such as cardboard hence the naming Samsung Electronics partnered with Oculus VR to co develop the Samsung Gear VR which is only compatible with some Samsung Galaxy devices LG Electronics developed a headset with dedicated displays for its LG G smartphone known as LG VR br In Oculus and PlayStation VR dominated the VR headset market br In June Valve released their own headset the Valve Index without a partnership with HTC br br br Technology br br br Resolution and display quality br There are different optics and visual qualities that affect how an individual perceives the image quality and how they experience the virtual world The image clarity depends on the display resolution optic quality refresh rate and field of view br Because virtual reality headsets stretch a single display across a wide field of view up to for some devices according to manufacturers the magnification factor makes flaws in display technology much more apparent One issue is the so called screen door effect where the gaps between rows and columns of pixels become visible kind of like looking through a screen door This was especially noticeable in earlier prototypes and development kits which had lower resolutions than the retail versions br br br Optics br br The lenses of the headset are responsible for mapping the up close display to a wide field of view while also providing a more comfortable distant point of focus One challenge with this is providing consistency of focus because eyes are free to turn within the headset it is important to avoid having to refocus to prevent eye strain br Fresnel lenses are commonly used in virtual reality headsets due to their compactness and lightweight structure The lenses do not use multiple pieces of material in their lenses like other lenses but the lens will be broken down into sections allowing the individual to have a wider range of view The issue seen with the lens consists of seeing the ridges of the lenses when the headset is not properly aligned on the head br The lenses introduce distortion and chromatic aberration which are typically corrected in software The lenses can also be adjusted dynamically to account for a user s eyeglass prescription so that the user can use the headset without corrective eyeglasses br br br Latency requirements br Virtual reality headsets have significantly higher requirements for latency the time it takes from a change in input to have a visual effect than ordinary video games If the system is too sluggish to react to head movement then it can cause the user to experience virtual reality sickness a kind of motion sickness According to a Valve engineer the ideal latency would be milliseconds br The graphics processing unit GPU also needs to be powerful enough to render the required amount of frames Oculus cited the limited processing power of Xbox One and PlayStation as the reason why they targeted the PC gaming market with their first devices br Foveated rendering is a new technique to reduce the rendering workload It uses eye tracking hardware to determine at what point the user is looking and reduces rendering resolution farther from the user s gaze This can be unnoticeable to the user because human peripheral vision is far less sensitive than the fovea br br br Uses in various fields br br br Medical training and diagnostics br Virtual reality headsets are being currently used as a means to train medical students for surgery It allows them to perform essential procedures in a virtual controlled environment Students perform surgeries on virtual patients which allows them to acquire the skills needed to perform surgeries on real patients It also allows the students to revisit the surgeries from the perspective of the lead surgeon br Traditionally students had to participate in surgeries and often they would miss essential parts Now with the use of VR headsets students can watch surgical procedures from the perspective of the lead surgeon without missing essential parts Students can also pause rewind and fast forward surgeries They also can perfect their techniques in a real headset mounted in a risk free environment br Besides training purposes augmented reality headsets are also already being used for image guided surgery br VR headset mounted smartphones have been used to capture high quality videos and images of the retina for documenting peripheral retinal lesions br br br Military training br Virtual reality headsets have been used by the United States Armed Forces It is a particularly useful tool for training military personnel without putting them in harm s way br The virtual reality headset allows military personnel to interact with virtual reality people to make it feel real They can talk to one another and do varying actions to make the virtual reality world feel like they are actually in the real world There are also disadvantages and advantages when military personnel use the headset The disadvantage is the headset is made for an indoor area with a cool environment and away from any heat so when military personnel has just the headset on no military equipment it is not like their basic training The advantages consist of repeating the situations multiple times and the cost of having the headset is less due to no military equipment being needed br br br Risks br br In researchers from the University of Chicago were able to exploit a vulnerability in Meta Platforms Quest VR system to obtain users login credentials and inject false details during online banking sessions In another study using Beat Saber the majority of the participants did not suspect anything when their VR headsets were attacked by the researchers This hack should be difficult to execute outside research settings but would make its target vulnerable to many risks such as phishing Internet fraud and grooming br br br See also br Augmented
