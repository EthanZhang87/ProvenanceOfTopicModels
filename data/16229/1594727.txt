title: Arrow keys
id: 1594727
Arrow keys or cursor movement keys are keys on a computer keyboard that are either programmed or designated to move the cursor in a specified direction br The term cursor movement key is distinct from arrow key in that the former term may refer to any of various keys on a computer keyboard designated for cursor movement whereas arrow keys generally refers to one of four specific keys typically marked with arrows br Arrow keys are typically located at the bottom of the keyboard to the left side of the numeric keypad usually arranged in an inverted T layout but also found in diamond shapes and linear shapes Arrow keys are commonly used for navigating around documents and for playing games br The inverted T layout was popularized by the Digital Equipment Corporation LK keyboard from br br br Historical development br br Before the computer mouse was widespread arrow keys were the primary way of moving a cursor on screen Mouse keys is a feature that allows controlling a mouse cursor with arrow keys instead A feature echoed in the Amiga whereby holding the Amiga key would allow a person to move the pointer with the cursor keys in the Workbench operating system but most games require a mouse or joystick The use of arrow keys in games has come back into fashion from the late s and early s when joysticks were a must and were usually used in preference to arrow keys with some games not supporting any keys It can be used instead of WASD keys to play games using those keys br The inverted T layout was popularized by the Digital Equipment Corporation LK keyboard from br Most Commodore bit computers used two cursor keys instead of four with directions selected using the shift key br The original Macintosh had no arrow keys at the insistence of Steve Jobs who felt that people should use the mouse instead They were deliberately excluded from the Macintosh launch design as a forcing device acclimating users to the new mouse input device and inducing software developers to conform to mouse driven design rather than easily porting previous terminal based software to the new platform Arrow keys were included in later Apple keyboards Early models with arrow keys but no middle section Home End etc placed them in one line below the right hand Shift key in an HJKL like fashion later versions had a standard inverted T layout either in the middle block or as half height keys at the bottom right of the main keyboard br br br Common uses br The arrow keys are used in many applications to do different things such as br br Moving text cursor to the right left previous line and next line br Moving player s character in video games br Scrolling down and up in different documents and web pages br Changing the current selected item in a list or selecting file icon near to the current selected file in a file explorer br Moving selected object in a drawing software br Moving forward and backward while playing multimedia files br br br Alternative keys br Although the arrow keys provide one convention for cursor movement on computers there are also other conventions for cursor movement that use entirely different keys br br br keys br This cursor key layout was seen in Sinclair ZX ZX and ZX Spectrum home computer designs These machines had key keyboards with number keys on the top row Each of the number keys had secondary functions requiring simultaneous use of a shift key CAPS SHIFT in particular from Spectrum onwards to activate them Of these to were designated as cursor control keys and were labelled with left down up and right arrow symbols printed on or directly above them in a colour matching the relevant shift key The sequence was adopted from Lear Siegler vi style see HJKL below The Jupiter Ace keyboard was similar but with up and down functions swapped The underlying character codes varied between machines but in Spectrum and Ace designs the order of up and down keys on the keyboard reflected which had the lesser and greater numeric value br In some software for these machines eg games the unshifted and keys were directly associated with direction control when they had no other purpose as this meant less complicated keypress detection routines could be used br Although the QL style keyboard on later Spectrum and K models introduced various dedicated keys including arrow keys either side of the space bar left right in a pair to its immediate left and up down to the immediate right and removed related labels either method produced the same signals and there was no difference between which of the alternatives was used as far as software was concerned br br br WASD keys br br WASD AOE on Dvorak keyboards ZQSD on AZERTY keyboards is a set of four keys on a QWERTY or QWERTZ computer keyboard that mimic the inverted T configuration of the arrow keys These keys are most commonly used to control the player character s movement in computer games W S control forward and backward while A D control strafing left and right br The main reason for this arrangement is that the arrow keys are not ergonomic to use with a right handed mouse During the early days of gaming this was not a problem as the mouse was not used the arrow keys controlled both movement as well as looking around with strafing done using modifier keys usually Alt However the introduction of mouselook a system that let one use the mouse to look around both vertically and horizontally enabled the player to perform techniques such as smooth circle strafing which although possible with the keyboard was difficult to perform and resulted in jagged movement Since the mouse was now used for looking the and keys for looking would be redundant and thus were altered to become strafe keys br The style was popularized in competitive play in Quake and subsequently QuakeWorld notably by professional player Dennis Fong where the advantages of WASD and mouselook were recognized over a purely keyboard based control system In the same year that Castle Wolfenstein was released the game Wizardry used the AWD keys for movement in a first person dungeon Both the programmers of Castle Wolfenstein and Wizardry were users of the earlier PLATO system where the game Moria used the AWD keys br Another advantage of WASD is that it allows the user to use the left hand thumb to press the space bar often the jump command and the left hand little finger to press the Ctrl or Shift keys often the crouch and sprint commands as opposed to the arrow keys which lack other keys in proximity to press Ctrl and Shift were chosen partly because they are larger keys and thus easier to hit but primarily because in older systems the computer could only recognize a couple of alphanumeric key presses a limitation circumvented by the use of modifier keys In later games the usage of the E key to interact with items or open up the inventory was also popularized due to its location next to the WASD keys allowing players to reach it quickly br Telengard may be the first game to use WASD keys Dark Castle may be the first to use WASD keys and mouse for control Half Life was one of the first mainstream games to use WASD by default After being popularized by first person shooters WASD became more common in other computer game genres as well Many of the games that have adopted this layout use a first person or over the shoulder third person perspective Some games that use overhead camera views also use WASD to move the camera such as some city building games and economic simulation games br br br ESDF keys br The ESDF variation is an alternative to WASD and is sometimes preferred because it provides access to movement independent keys for the little finger Q A Z which generally allows for more advanced manual binding Incidentally it allows the left hand to remain in the home row with the advantage of the F key home row marker available on most standard keyboards to easily return to position with the index finger Moreover these keys are compatible with both QWERTY and AZERTY keyboard layouts which is a major plus if the game is also released in France or Belgium br Perhaps the earliest game to use ESDF was Crossfire which used the keys for firing in multiple directions Dan vise Larsen from Quake Team Deathmatch clan clan Kapitol popularized ESDF versus WASD explaining that the player gains three additional keys to bind the Quake game s controls to It is the default configuration for several games such as Tribes The game Blackthorne used a combination of arrow keys for movement and ESDF for actions br Some players use RDFG or TFGH to give access to even more keys S and X for the little finger br br br DCAS keys br Another alternate to the WASD shooter movement style is DCAS sometimes called ASDC In this configuration D and C control forward and backward motion while A and S control side stepping strafing Typically the Alt key is utilized for crouching instead of the Ctrl key as it is more easily reached when the hand is positioned for DCAS br When Bungie s first person shooter Marathon was released in it featured up down look control and the option to fully control turning and aiming by mouse a feature later popularized by id s Quake as mouselook freelook However it did not include a set of default controls to handle this With WASD not yet a well known standard some people devised their own control schemes to handle combined keyboard movement with mouse aiming DCAS was one such control scheme br Like WASD DCAS allows the player to easily utilize the left modifier keys this is advantageous because on most keyboards the circuitry is better at tracking multiple key presses simultaneously if some of them are modifier keys But unlike WASD the position of the left hand for DCAS gameplay is very similar to the left hand s position on the home row keys This is very comfortable for right handed players and seen as the primary advantage over using WASD but it is ill suited for left handed mousing br br br IJKL keys br Two early games that used IJKL were Crossfire and Lode Runner br IJKL is used by a growing number of browser games These games cannot use the arrow keys because many browsers windows will scroll if the arrow keys are used thus hindering gameplay This is a problem specific to DHTML JavaScript games IJKL like WASD are arranged in an ergonomic inverted T shape and since they are used by the right hand adjustment is easy for people who commonly use the arrow keys br Also in many games that also use the WASD keys the IJKL keys are sometimes used as a secondary player control for games that have multiplayer br Devil May Cry by Capcom utilizes IJKL as the player s action keys such as Melee Attack Ranged Attack Special Attack etc as an alternative to mouse driven actions br br br IJKM keys br Some older computer games especially those on bit platforms often had the combination IJKM used as the standard control key combination which was more logically arranged if far less ergonomic than an inverted T In addition on the Apple II platform special support existed in ROM for Escape mode At the Applesoft BASIC prompt using the right and left arrow keys to move the cursor would add remove characters the cursor passed over to from the input buffer Pressing the Esc key entered a mode where pressing the I J K or M keys would move the cursor without altering the input buffer After exiting this mode by pressing Escape again normal behavior would resume This made it easy to edit lines of BASIC code by listing them then re inputting them with edits interspersed br br br AZ keys br The Apple II and Apple II Plus originally had left and right arrow keys but no up and down arrow keys Many programs written for these computers used A and Z to substitute for the missing up and down keys The IJKM combination was also popular on these computers Another fairly common variant on these machines was the combination of RETURN and slash with the left and right arrows as those four keys roughly form a diamond on the keyboard while the right Shift key would be in the more natural position for down pressing Shift alone was not detectable by software on an unmodified Apple II or Apple II plus All these keys fell somewhat out of favor after the release of the Apple IIe which had a full set of arrow keys br br br HJKL keys br br HJKL is a layout used in the Unix computer world a practice spawned by its use in the vi text editor The editor was written by Bill Joy for use on a Lear Siegler ADM A terminal which places arrow symbols on these letters since it did not have dedicated arrow keys on the keyboard These correspond to the functions of the corresponding control characters Ctrl H Ctrl J Ctrl K and Ctrl L when sent to the terminal moving the cursor left down up and right respectively The Ctrl H and Ctrl J functions were standard but the interpretations of Ctrl K and Ctrl L were unique to the ADM A This key arrangement is often referred to as vi keys HJKL keys are still ubiquitous in newly developed Unix software even though today s keyboards have arrow keys They have the advantage of letting touch typists move the cursor without taking their fingers off of the home row Examples of games that use HJKL are the text based graphic adventures like NetHack the Rogue series and Linley s Dungeon Crawl It is also used by some players of the Dance Dance Revolution clone StepMania where HJKL corresponds directly to the order of the arrows Gmail Google Labs keyboard shortcuts and other websites use J and K for next and previous br br br SDF SPACE and ASD SPACE br Another old style variation that spawned from games like Quake was the SDF SPACE layout In this layout S turn left D forward F turn right space backpedal E strafe left and R strafe right This layout allows the player to aim with the mouse while strafing sidestepping turning and running or backpedaling all at once creating slightly more complex movements This variation is not favoured any longer for two main reasons First because many players deem the turn commands useless because the mouse can act as a turning device and so they assign S and F to the sidestep commands and leave the turn commands unassigned The second and probably more prominent reason is in assigning both the turn and strafe commands performing movements and dodges can be much more confusing so newcomers tend to not prefer this key setup Though no longer widely used many FPS veterans and tournament players still employ this key setup br This variant adopted to newer games using mouse look doesn t really need worry about the turn left and turn right keys Instead S strafe left D strafe right A backpedal and space or F forward This is a more natural feel on the keyboard as your fingers rest on the home row The comfort and usability points from ESDF apply here Notice that jump is left out that is because in games like Quake jump was usually MOUSE With more alternate fire and aim down sights oriented games today you may have to play with F SPACE and MOUSE on what you want them to do br A similar layout is ASD SPACE Commonly used in D based fighting games ASD SPACE maps A S and D to left down and right movement while the spacebar is used for up jumping This allows an easier access to degree motions than a normal inverted T layout as well as being more ergonomic than simply placing all directions in a single row ex ASDF There is even a stickless arcade controller based around the concept called the Hitbox br br br WQSE keys br Another close variation is the WQSE combination which follows the belief that the index and ring fingers natural and more ergonomic positions when the middle finger is on W are Q and E rather than A and D respectively This can be attested to by the fact that the arrow keys were partly designed in the inverted T shape in order to avoid having the side buttons possibly directly underneath other keys It also has the advantage that there is less distance needed to travel to reach the number keys For similar reasons some gamers use the WQSD combination which is WASD with the A key moved up to Q or WQSE with the E moved down to D For players who prefer to keep the keyboard centered on the body this results in less wrist rotation as it places the index finger naturally over the D key when the left arm rests down to the left of the keyboard Another variation is EWDF which is the same shifted right one key as in ESDF SAZD is a slight variation on WQSE and WQSD in that it is both ergonomic and rotated but gives the fingers closer proximity to the Shift and SPACE keys br br br QAOP keys br QAOP sometimes called OPQA dates back to the ZX Spectrum The O P keys were used for left right movement and the Q A keys for up down or forward backwards movement With SPACE being located at the bottom right of the original rubber keyed Spectrum the M or sometimes N key would be used for fire action on later models the SPACE bar would be used br QAOP had its own variations such as ZXKM or WELP Many BBC Micro games used the keys ZX respectively for left right up and down with being the key above and right of where is on modern UK keyboards In each case one hand controls left right and the other hand controls up down movement A further variation is used when two players use the keyboard at the same time for example Gauntlet uses the combination QSD for Player and IKL for Player br br br ESDX keys br The ESDX keys known as the cursor movement diamond were used in the WordStar word processor and related applications in combination with the Control key These keys were also used and had arrows printed on them on the TI A computer br br br Numpad keys br The Model F keyboard that came with the original IBM PC didn t have dedicated arrow keys and instead used the keys with Num Lock turned off Therefore this was the scheme used by the earliest DOS games br The numpad or number pad keys are used quite often but are used mostly in driving simulator games This is mainly because these games usually have quite a large number of keys needed to control the vehicle properly and the number pad will have plenty of keys for that particular use Another reason this is commonly used is because left handed players will find this a more comfortable position than the IJKL keys see above and the number pad has fewer keys around it thus it is less likely the player will hit the wrong key by mistake br br br WAXD including QEZC br br Another variation is WAXD using either or keys surrounding the s key Eight directional arrows were printed on the keysets of PLATO terminals developed in the s and s and many games including Empire Dogfight and more than a dozen dungeon games such as Avatar utilize this layout The TUTOR language display editor character set bitmap editor and line set editor also use these keys on that system and its successors For ballistic targeting key combinations e g we de etc are used to get angles in multiples of degrees In many programs the s key is often used to either select or shoot depending upon the application br This layout also appears on the numeric keypads of some keyboards using including br br br Less common variations br Vaguely related is the ZXC layout used in many freeware games and a common setup for emulation and older D gaming using a keyboard br A few games from the s such as the Phantasie series use the WES layout which forms a diamond on QWERTY keyboards In this layout three of the four keys happen to correspond to the compass directions West East and South These games usually assign both N and to North br AZERTY users will use the ZQSD combination instead of WASD since those are the keys in place of WASD on a QWERTY keyboard Depending on the configuration QAOP may either still work or be vertically inverted On the Dvorak keyboard layout WASD is AOE br Left handed players may use the numeric keypad instead br A somewhat uncommon variant is YGHJ which while requiring the keyboard to be turned slightly clockwise can result in the thumb resting comfortably upon the right Alt key and the little finger resting on C This can be useful in games that utilize both jump and sprint functions as it allows the fingers to rest on smaller keys than Shift and Space The YGHJ configuration also places the hand closer to the center of the QWERTY section of the keyboard potentially opening up the entire board to custom keybindings br br The game QWOP uses the control scheme QWOP to control Qwop s arms and legs the Q and W keys control Qwop s thighs while the O and P keys control Qwop s calves making an intentionally difficult control system as a result br Layouts such as Shift Z Ctrl X where Shift is up and Ctrl is down allow all direction keys to be used in any combination without the delay of changing finger position But the use of modifier keys can be problematic as some games do not allow mapping of these keys br Professional Counter Strike Global Offensive player Fashr is known to use somewhat unorthodox keybindings Using the Right Mouse to move forward Semicolon to move backwards Comma for strafing left and a Full Stop to strafe right br br br See also br Arrow symbol br D pad br Pointing stick br QWERTY br Scroll Lock br br br Notes and references br br br External links br The Nerd Corner
