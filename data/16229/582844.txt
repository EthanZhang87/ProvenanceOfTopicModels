The Video Graphics Array VGA connector is a standard connector used for computer video output Originating with the IBM PS and its VGA graphics system the pin connector went on to become ubiquitous on PCs as well as many monitors projectors and high definition television sets br Other connectors have been used to carry VGA compatible signals such as mini VGA or BNC but VGA connector typically refers to this design br Devices continue to be manufactured with VGA connectors although newer digital interfaces such as DVI HDMI and DisplayPort are increasingly displacing VGA and many modern computers and other devices do not include it br br br Physical design br The VGA connector is a three row pin D subminiature connector referred to variously as DE HD or erroneously DB HD DE is the accurate nomenclature under the D sub specifications an E size D sub connector with pins in three rows br br br Predecessor and early variant br The standard pin VGA connector was derived from the earlier DE connector which used the same E D shell size hence that connector s misnomer of DB transferred its DB part to the new DE connector as well see above Though IBM always used DE connectors for their Video Graphics Array hardware several VGA clone hardware makers initially did not Instead some early VGA hardware both monitors and VGA cards used a DE connector for VGA just like what had been in use for MDA CGA Hercules and EGA This pin variant of the then emerging de facto standard pin connector omitted several pins which was considered acceptable because the autodetection features supported by those pins only evolved over time and prior to Windows there was no user expectation of graphics cards and displays being fully plug and play DE VGA connectors were generally compatible with each other and adaptors to the DE standard were available Ultimately all VGA hardware makers switched to standard DE connectors relegating the early variant to relative obscurity br br br Electrical design br All VGA connectors carry analog RGBHV red green blue horizontal sync vertical sync video signals Modern connectors also include VESA DDC pins for identifying attached display devices br In both its modern and original variants VGA utilizes multiple scan rates so attached devices such as monitors are multisync by necessity br The VGA interface includes no affordances for hot swapping the ability to connect or disconnect the output device during operation although in practice this can be done and usually does not cause damage to the hardware or other problems The VESA DDC specification does however include a standard for hot swapping br br br PS signaling br In the original IBM VGA implementation refresh rates were limited to two vertical and Hz and three horizontal frequencies all of which were communicated to the monitor using combinations of different polarity H and V sync signals br Some pins on the connector were also different pin was keyed by plugging the female connector hole and four pins carried the monitor ID br With the implementation of the VESA DDC specification several of the monitor ID pins were reassigned for use by DDC signaling and the key pin was replaced with a V DC output per the DDC spec Devices that comply with the DDC host system standard provide V from mA to A br br br PS signaling br The IBM PS Display Adapter redefined pin as V which signals the monitor to turn on when the system unit is powered on br br br EDID br br In order to advertise display capabilities VESA has introduced a scheme to redefining VGA connector pins and as a serial bus for a Display Data Channel DDC br br br Cable quality br br The same VGA cable can be used with a variety of supported VGA resolutions ranging from px Hz or px Hz MHz of signal bandwidth to px SXGA Hz MHz and up to px QXGA Hz MHz br There are no standards defining the quality required for each resolution but higher quality cables typically contain coaxial wiring and insulation that make them thicker br While shorter VGA cables are less likely to introduce significant signal degradation good quality cable should not suffer from signal crosstalk whereby signals in one wire induce unwanted currents in adjacent wires even at greater lengths br Ghosting occurs when impedance mismatches cause signals to be reflected A correctly impedance matched cable ohm should prevent this however ghosting with long cables may be caused by equipment with incorrect signal termination or by passive cable splitters rather than the cables themselves br br br Alternative connectors br br Some high end monitors and video cards used multiple BNC connectors instead of a single standard VGA connector providing a higher quality connection with less crosstalk by utilising five separate ohm coaxial cables The use of BNC RGB video cables predates VGA in other markets and industries br Within a pin connector the red green and blue signals pins cannot be shielded from each other so crosstalk is possible within the pin interconnect BNC prevents crosstalk by maintaining full coaxial shielding through the circular connectors but the connectors are very large and bulky The requirement to press and turn the plug shell to disconnect requires access space around each connector to allow grasping of each BNC plug shell Supplementary signals such as DDC are typically not supported with BNC br br Some laptops and other portable devices in the early to mid s contained a two row mini VGA connector that is much smaller than the three row DE connector as well as five separate BNC connectors br br br Adapters br br Various adapters can be purchased to convert VGA to other connector types One common variety is a DVI to VGA adapter which is possible because many DVI interfaces also carry VGA compatible analog signals Adapting from HDMI or DisplayPort to VGA without an active converter is not possible because those connectors don t output analog signals br For conversions to and from digital formats like HDMI or Displayport a scan converter is required VGA outputs to interfaces with different signaling more complex converters may be used Most of them need an external power source to operate and are inherently lossy However many modern displays are still made with multiple inputs including VGA in which case adapters are not necessary br VGA can also be adapted to SCART in some cases because the signals are electrically compatible if the correct sync rates are set by the host PC Many modern graphics adapters can modify their signal in software including refresh rate sync length polarity and number of blank lines Particular issues include interlace support and the use of the resolution in PAL countries Under these restrictive conditions a simple circuit to combine the VGA separate synchronization signals into SCART composite sync may suffice br br br Extenders br A VGA extender is an electronic device that increases the signal strength from a VGA port most often from a computer They are often used in schools businesses and homes when multiple monitors are being run off one VGA port or if the cable between the monitor and the computer will be excessively long often pictures appear blurry or have minor artifacts if the cable runs too far without an extender VGA extenders are sometimes called VGA boosters br br br
