A light pen is a computer input device in the form of a light sensitive wand used in conjunction with a computer s cathode ray tube CRT display br It allows the user to point to displayed objects or draw on the screen in a similar way to a touchscreen but with greater positional accuracy A light pen can work with any CRT based display but its ability to be used with LCDs was unclear though Toshiba and Hitachi displayed a similar idea at the Display show in Japan br A light pen detects changes in brightness of nearby screen pixels when scanned by cathode ray tube electron beam and communicates the timing of this event to the computer Since a CRT scans the entire screen one pixel at a time the computer can keep track of the expected time of scanning various locations on screen by the beam and infer the pen s position from the latest time stamps br br br History br The first light pen at this time still called light gun was created around as part of the Whirlwind I project at MIT where it was used to select discrete symbols on the screen and later at the SAGE project where it was used for tactical real time control of a radar networked airspace br One of the first more widely deployed uses was in the Situation Display consoles of the AN FSQ for military airspace surveillance This is not very surprising given its relationship with the Whirlwind projects See Semi Automatic Ground Environment for more details br During the s light pens were common on graphics terminals such as the IBM and were also available for the IBM text only terminal br The first nonlinear editor the CMX was controlled by a light pen where operator clicked symbols superimposed on edited footage br Light pen usage was expanded in the early s to music workstations such as the Fairlight CMI and personal computers such as the BBC Micro and Holborn IBM PC compatible MDA only early versions CGA HGC including HGC and InColor and some EGA graphics cards also featured a connector compatible with a light pen as did early Tandy computers the Thomson MO computer family the Amiga Atari bit Commodore bit some MSX computers and Amstrad PCW home computers For the MSX computers Sanyo produced a light pen interface cartridge br Because the user was required to hold their arm in front of the screen for long periods of time potentially causing gorilla arm or to use a desk that tilts the monitor the light pen fell out of use as a general purpose input device Light pen was also perceived as working well only on displays with low persistence which tend to flicker br br br See also br Bit banging br CueCat br Digital pen br Light gun br Pen computing br Stylus computing br br br Notes br br br br br br External links
