Simulation video games are a diverse super category of video games generally designed to closely simulate real world activities A simulation game attempts to copy various activities from real life in the form of a game for various purposes such as training analysis prediction or entertainment Usually there are no strictly defined goals in the game and the player is allowed to control a character or environment freely Well known examples are war games business games and role play simulation From three basic types of strategic planning and learning exercises games simulations and case studies a number of hybrids may be considered including simulation games that are used as case studies Comparisons of the merits of simulation games versus other teaching techniques have been carried out by many researchers and a number of comprehensive reviews have been published br br br Subgenres br br br Construction and management simulation br br Construction and management simulation CMS is a type of simulation game in which players build expand or manage fictional communities or projects with limited resources Strategy games sometimes incorporate CMS aspects into their game economy as players must manage resources while expanding their projects Pure CMS games differ from strategy games in that the player s goal is not to defeat an enemy but to build something within the context of an ongoing process Games in this category are sometimes also called management games br br br Life simulation br br Life simulation games or artificial life games are a subgenre of simulation video games in which the player lives or controls one or more artificial lifeforms A life simulation game can revolve around individuals and relationships or it could be a simulation of an ecosystem Social simulation games are one of its subgenres br br br Sports br br Some video games simulate the playing of sports Most sports have been recreated by video games including team sports athletics and extreme sports Some games emphasize playing the sport such as the Madden NFL series whilst others emphasize strategy and organization such as Football Manager Some such as Arch Rivals satirize the sport for comic effect This genre has been popular throughout the history of video games and is competitive just like real world sports A number of game series feature the names and characteristics of real teams and players and are updated continuously to reflect real world changes br br br Other types br br In medical simulation games the player takes the role of a surgeon Examples include the Trauma Center and LifeSigns series br In photography simulation games players take photographs of animals or people This includes games such as Pok mon Snap and Afrika br Military simulation games are wargames with higher degrees of realism than other wargames set in a fantasy or science fiction environment These attempt to simulate real warfare at either a tactical or strategic level br Some simulators like GeoCommander by Intelligence Gaming are designed for the US military to help new officers learn how to handle situations in a game setting before taking command in the field br Certain tactical shooters have higher degrees of realism than other shooters Sometimes called soldier sims these games try to simulate the feeling of being in combat This includes games such as Arma br br Vehicle simulation game br Flight simulators including amateur flight simulators combat flight simulators and space flight simulators br Racing video games including sim racing br Submarine simulator games br Train simulator games br Truck simulator games br Immersive sims are typically played from the first person perspective in a simulates a consistent lived in world and include elements of numerous gameplay systems that the player can use to complete objectives in many different manners creating a sense of player agency and emergent gameplay br Blue collar games that include both realistic and hyper realistic presentation of blue collar jobs in a game setting These can include some of the vehicle simulation games including the flight train and truck simulator titles hunting games like TheHunter series other job simulation games like House Flipper or PowerWash Simulator and games themed around these types of jobs like Overcooked br Digital card games simulating blackjack and poker including video poker br Video games designed to simulate mechanical or other real world games These may include simulations of pinball games and casino games such as slot machines pachinko and roulette br br br Simulation games in education br br Because Simulation games make learning a matter of direct experience they may relieve the tedium associated with more conventional modes of instruction as they demand increased participation rather than merely reading about or discussing concepts and ideas like discrimination culture stratification and norms Students will experience them by actually living the experiences Therefore the use of simulation games may increase students motivation and interest in learning br Simulation games can provide increased insights into how the world is seen like the moral and intellectual idiosyncrasies of others They may also increase empathy for others and help develop awareness of personal and interpersonal values by allowing players to see moral and ethical implications of the choices they make As such they can be used to change and improve students attitudes toward self environment and classroom learning br Many games are designed to change and develop specific skills of decision making problem solving and critical thinking such as those involved in survey sampling perception and communication br br br History br br The Sumerian Game a text based early mainframe game designed by Mabel Addis based on the ancient Sumerian city state of Lagash was the first economic simulation game In Cornell University funded several simulation games which were developed by Prof Robert Chase and his students These included Cornell Hotel Administration Simulation Exercise and Cornell Restaurant Administration Simulation Exercise Notably the restaurant game featured competitive play with teams managing competing restaurants The games drew attention from the relevant industries of the time and were made playable at national conventions for the American Hotel Motel Association and the Club Managers Association of America in br Another early economic sim by Danielle Bunten Berry M U L E released in br In the s it became a trend for arcade video games to use hydraulic motion simulator arcade cabinets The trend was sparked by Sega s taikan games with taikan meaning body sensation in Japanese Sega s first game to use a motion simulator cabinet was Space Tactics a space combat simulator that had a cockpit cabinet where the screen moved in sync with the on screen action The taikan trend later began when Yu Suzuki s team at Sega later known as Sega AM developed Hang On a racing video game where the player sits on and moves a motorbike replica to control the in game actions Suzuki s team at Sega followed it with hydraulic motion simulator cockpit cabinets for rail shooters such as Space Harrier racing games such as Out Run and combat flight simulators such as After Burner and G LOC Air Battle One of the most sophisticated motion simulator cabinets in arcades was Sega s R which simulated the full degree rotation of an aircraft Sega have since continued to manufacture motion simulator cabinets for arcade games through to the s br In the mid s Codemasters and the Oliver Twins released a number of games with Simulator in the title including BMX Simulator Grand Prix Simulator and Pro Boxing Simulator Richard and David Darling of Codemasters were inspired by Concertmaster s best selling games which were based on real sports such as football and BMX racing which had a pre existing popularity In a parody of the established simulator cliche Your Sinclair released a game titled Advanced Lawnmower Simulator in br The introduction of the city building simulation subgenre is closely associated with the release of SimCity by developer Will Wright However earlier city building titles had been published including the Colecovision title Fortune Builder Later games published by Wright s company Maxis including SimLife and SimEarth simulated worlds at a broader scale including recreations of genetics and global ecosystems br A study of adolescents who played SimCity found that those players had a greater appreciation and expectation of their government officials after playing br br br See also br Game classification br List of simulation games br Serious game br Simming br Simulated reality br
