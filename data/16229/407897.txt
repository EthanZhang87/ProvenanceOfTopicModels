either end to form a hexagon During gameplay players may deploy fighters and then deploy pilots and equipment upon those fighters Every card has its own Power Point cost players start with Power Points and gain two each turn The designers recommend pencil and paper for the keeping track of Power Points Finally certain cards feature Medals which also feature as a resource as some elite cards require the tapping of Medal bearing cards to deploy br Fighters with pilots and secondary armaments potentially attached move among the nav points fighting with each other and attacking the enemy carrier During combat either player may play Maneuver cards to fortify their fighters assuming the targeted craft has a high enough Maneuver statistic or Battle Damage cards to cripple their enemies both have Power Point costs Attacks are then resolved by comparison of the aggressor s Attack value with the defender s Defense value with Support values from allied ships augmenting as appropriate Each card lost results in the loss of one Power Point as well There are two ways to win to destroy the enemy carrier with the successful use of Torpedo cards or to reduce the opponent s Power Point pool to zero br br br br br br External links br Wing Commander Combat Information Center br Wing Commander series at MobyGames
