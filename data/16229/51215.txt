title: Airliner
id: 51215
An airliner is a type of airplane for transporting passengers and air cargo Such aircraft are most often operated by airlines The modern and most common variant of the airliner is a long tube shaped and jet powered aircraft The largest of them are wide body jets which are also called twin aisle because they generally have two separate aisles running from the front to the back of the passenger cabin These are usually used for long haul flights between airline hubs and major cities A smaller more common class of airliners is the narrow body or single aisle These are generally used for short to medium distance flights with fewer passengers than their wide body counterparts br Regional airliners typically seat fewer than passengers and may be powered by turbofans or turboprops These airliners are the non mainline counterparts to the larger aircraft operated by the major carriers legacy carriers and flag carriers and are used to feed traffic into the large airline hubs These regional routes then form the spokes of a hub and spoke air transport model br The lightest aircraft are short haul regional feeder airliner type aircraft that carry a small number of passengers are called commuter aircraft commuterliners feederliners and air taxis depending on their size engines how they are marketed region of the world and seating configurations The Beechcraft for example has only seats br br br History br br br Emergence br When the Wright brothers made the world s first sustained heavier than air flight they laid the foundation for what would become a major transport industry Their flight performed in the Wright Flyer during was just years before what is often defined as the world s first airliner By the s airliners had expanded capabilities making a significant impact on global society economics and politics br br During Igor Sikorsky developed the first large multi engine airplane the Russky Vityaz This aircraft was subsequently refined into the more practical Ilya Muromets being furnished with dual controls for a pilot and copilot and a comfortable cabin with a lavatory cabin heating and lighting br This large four engine biplane was further adapted into an early bomber aircraft preceding subsequent transport and bomber aircraft br It first flew on December and took off for its first demonstration flight with passengers aboard on February br However it was never used as a commercial airliner due to the onset of the First World War which led to military applications being prioritised br br br Interwar period br In shortly after the end of the First World War large numbers of ex military aircraft flooded the market One such aircraft was the French Farman F Goliath which had originally been designed as a long range heavy bomber a number were converted for commercial use into passenger airliners starting in being able to accommodate a maximum of seated passengers and around were built Initially several publicity flights were made including one on February when the Goliath flew passengers from Toussus le Noble to RAF Kenley near Croydon despite having no permission from the British authorities to land Dozens of early airlines subsequently procured the type One high profile flight made on August involved an F flying eight passengers and a ton of supplies from Paris via Casablanca and Mogador to Koufa km mi north of Saint Louis Senegal flying more than km mi br Another important airliner built in was the Airco DH a redesigned Airco DH A with a wider fuselage to accommodate an enclosed cabin seating four passengers plus pilot in an open cockpit In March the prototype first flew at Hendon Aerodrome Nine aircraft were built all but one being delivered to the nascent airline Aircraft Transport and Travel which used the first aircraft for pleasure flying and on August it inaugurated the first scheduled international airline service from London to Paris One aircraft was sold to the River Plate Aviation Company in Argentina to operate a cross river service between Buenos Aires and Montevideo br Meanwhile the competing Vickers converted its successful First World War era bomber the Vickers Vimy into a civilian version the Vimy Commercial It was redesigned with a larger diameter fuselage largely of spruce plywood and first flew from the Joyce Green airfield in Kent on April br The world s first all metal transport aircraft was the Junkers F which also made its first flight in Junkers marketed the aircraft towards business travellers and commercial operators and European entrepreneurs bought examples for their private use and business trips Over Junkers F s were built between and br The Dutch Fokker company produced the Fokker F II then the enlarged F III These were used by the Dutch airline KLM including on its Amsterdam London service in A relatively reliable aircraft for the era the Fokkers were flying to destinations across Europe including Bremen Brussels Hamburg and Paris br The Handley Page company in Britain produced the Handley Page Type W its first civil transport aircraft It housed two crew in an open cockpit and passengers in an enclosed cabin Powered by two hp kW Napier Lion engines the prototype first flew on December shortly after it was displayed at the Paris Air Show at Le Bourget It was ordered by the Belgian firm Sabena a further ten Type Ws were produced under license in Belgium by SABCA In the Air Ministry ordered three aircraft built as the W b for use by Handley Page Transport and later by Imperial Airways on services to Paris and Brussels br In France the Bleriot SPAD S was introduced during the early s It was commercially successful initially serving the Paris London route and later on continental routes The enclosed cabin could carry four passengers with an extra seat in the cockpit It was further developed into the Bl riot SPAD S Throughout the s companies in Britain and France were at the forefront of the civil airliner industry br By the capacity of airliners needed to be increased to achieve more favourable economics The English company de Havilland built the passenger DH monoplane while starting work on the design of the DH an eight seater biplane with a more economical but less powerful Rolls Royce Eagle engine For more capacity DH development was replaced by the DH biplane accommodating passengers A commercially successful aircraft Daimler Airway ordered a batch of nine br The Ford Trimotor had two engines mounted on the wings and one in the nose and a slabsided body it carried eight passengers and was produced from to It was an important early airliner in America It was used by the predecessor to Trans World Airlines and by other airlines long after production ceased The Trimotor helped to popularise numerous aspects of modern aviation infrastructure including paved runways passenger terminals hangars airmail and radio navigation Pan Am opened up transoceanic service in the late s and early s based on a series of large seaplanes the Sikorsky S through Sikorsky S br By the s the airliner industry had matured and large consolidated national airlines were established with regular international services that spanned the globe including Imperial Airways in Britain Lufthansa in Germany KLM in the Netherlands and United Airlines in America Multi engined aircraft were now capable of transporting dozens of passengers in comfort br During the s the British de Havilland Dragon emerged as a short haul low capacity airliner Its relatively simple design could carry six passengers each with lb kg of luggage on the London Paris route on a fuel consumption of gal L per hour The DH Dragon entered worldwide service During early August one performed the first non stop flight between the Canadian mainland and Britain in hours minutes although the intended destination had originally been Baghdad in Iraq British production of the Dragon ended in favour of the de Havilland Dragon Rapide a faster and more comfortable successor br By November series production of the Dragon Rapide had commenced De Havilland invested into advanced features including elongated rear windows cabin heating thickened wing tips and a strengthened airframe for a higher gross weight of lb kg Later aircraft were amongst the first airliners to be fitted with flaps for improved landing performance along with downwards facing recognition light and metal propellers which were often retrofitted to older aircraft It was also used in military roles civil Dragon Rapides were impressed into military service during the Second World War br br Metal airliners came into service in the s In the United States the Boeing and the passenger Douglas DC flew during the first half of the decade while the more powerful faster passenger Douglas DC first appeared in DC s were produced in quantity for the Second World War and were sold as surplus afterward becoming widespread within the commercial sector It was one of first airliners to be profitable without the support of postal or government subsidies br Long haul flights were expanded during the s as Pan American Airways and Imperial Airways competed on transatlantic travel using fleets of flying boats such as the British Short Empire and the American Boeing Imperial Airways order for Empire flying boats was viewed by some as a bold gamble At the time flying boats were the only practical means of building aircraft of such size and weight as land based aircraft would have unfeasibly poor field performance One Boeing registration NC became the first commercial plane to circumnavigate the globe during December and January br br br The postwar era br br br United Kingdom br br In the United Kingdom the Brabazon Committee was formed in under John Moore Brabazon st Baron Brabazon of Tara to forecast advances in aviation technology and the air transport needs of the postwar British Empire in South Asia Africa and the Near and Far East and Commonwealth Australia Canada New Zealand For British use multi engine aircraft types were allegedly split between the US for military transport aircraft and the UK for heavy bombers That such a policy was suggested or implemented have been disputed at least by Sir Peter Masefield British aircraft manufacturers were tied up to fulfill military requirements and had no free capacity to address other matters though the war br The committee final report pushed four designs for the state owned airlines British Overseas Airways Corporation BOAC and later British European Airways BEA three piston powered aircraft of varying sizes and a jet powered seat design at the request of Geoffrey de Havilland involved in the first jet fighters development br After a brief contest the Type I design was given to the Bristol Aeroplane Company building on a ton bomber submission This evolved into the Bristol Brabazon but this project folded in as BOAC lost interest and the first aircraft needed a costly wing re design to accommodate the Bristol Proteus engine br The Type II was split between the de Havilland Dove and Airspeed Ambassador conventional piston designs and the Vickers model powered by newly developed turboprops first flown in the VC Viceroy was the first turboprop design to enter service a commercial success with Viscounts built The Type III requirement led to the conventional Avro Tudor and the more ambitious Bristol Britannia although both aircraft suffered protracted developments with the latter entering service with BOAC in February over seven years following its order br The jet powered Type IV became the de Havilland Comet in It featured an aerodynamically clean design with four de Havilland Ghost turbojet engines buried in the wings a pressurised fuselage and large square windows On May the Comet took off on the world s first jetliner flight carrying fare paying passengers and simultaneously inaugurated scheduled service between London and Johannesburg However roughly one year after introduction three Comets broke up mid flight due to airframe metal fatigue not well understood at the time The Comet was grounded and tested to discover the cause while rival manufacturers heeded the lessons learned while developing their own aircraft The improved Comet and the prototype Comet culminated in the redesigned Comet series which debuted in and had a productive career over years but sales never fully recovered br By the s the UK had lost the airliner market to the US due to the Comet disaster and a smaller domestic market not regained by later designs like the BAC Vickers VC and Hawker Siddeley Trident The STAC committee was formed to consider supersonic designs and worked with Bristol to create the Bristol a passenger transatlantic airliner The effort was later merged with similar efforts in France to create the Concorde supersonic airliner to share the cost br br br United States br br The first batch of the Douglas DC s went to the U S Army and Air Forces and was named the C Skymaster Some ex military DC s were later converted into airliners with both passenger and cargo versions flooding the market shortly after the war s end Douglas also developed a pressurized version of the DC which it designated the Douglas DC Rival company Lockheed produced the Constellation a triple tailed aircraft with a wider fuselage than the DC br The Boeing Stratocruiser was based on the C Stratofreighter military transport it had a double deck and a pressurized fuselage br Convair produced the Convair a person pressurized airplane examples flew Convair later developed the Convair which was slightly larger and could accommodate between and passengers of which were produced The firm also commenced work on the Convair a relatively large double deck airliner that would have served transcontinental routes however the project was abandoned due to a lack of customer demand and its high development costs br Rival planes include the Martin and Martin but the had safety concerns and was unpressurized while the only sold around units br During the postwar years engines became much larger and more powerful and safety features such as deicing navigation and weather information were added to the planes American planes were allegedly more comfortable and had superior flight decks than those produced in Europe br br br France br In the French Air Ministry requested transatlantic flying boats that could hold at least passengers leading to three Lat co re s introduced by Air France in July However two crashed and the third was removed from service over safety concerns The SNCASE Languedoc was the first French post war airliner Accommodating up to seats aircraft were completed for Air France between October and April Air France withdrew the last Languedoc from its domestic routes in being replaced by later designs First flying in February the four engined Breguet Deux Ponts was a double decker transport for passengers and cargo Air France used it on its busiest routes including from Paris to the Mediterranean area and to London br br The Sud Aviation Caravelle was developed during the late s as the first short range jet airliner The nose and cockpit layout were licensed from the de Havilland Comet along with some fuselage elements Entering service in mid Caravelles had been sold within four years and six versions were in production by Sud Aviation then focused its design team on a Caravelle successor br The Super Caravelle was a supersonic transport project of similar size and range to the Caravelle It was merged with the similar Bristol Aeroplane Company project into the Anglo French Concorde The Concorde entered service in January as the second and last commercial supersonic transport after large overruns and delays costing billion All subsequent French airliner efforts were part of the Airbus pan European initiative br br br USSR br Soon after the war most of the Soviet fleet of airliners consisted of DC s or Lisunov Li s These planes were in desperate need of replacement and in the Ilyushin Il made its first flight The Il was very similar in design to American Convair except was unpressurized In the Ilyushin Il made its first flight and this version was equipped with much more powerful engines The main contribution that the Soviets made in regards to airliners was the Antonov An This plane is a biplane unlike most of the other airliners and sold more units than any other transport plane br br br Types br br br Narrow body airliners br br The most common airliners are the narrow body aircraft or single aisles br The earliest jet airliners were narrowbodies the initial de Havilland Comet the Boeing and its competitor the Douglas DC br They were followed by smaller models the Douglas DC and its MD MD Boeing derivatives the Boeing and using the cabin cross section or the Tupolev Tu Ilyushin Il and the Ilyushin Il br Currently produced narrow body airliners include the Airbus A A family Boeing Embraer E Jet family and Comac C generally used for medium haul flights with to passengers br They could be joined by the in development Irkut MC br br br Wide body airliners br br The larger wide body aircraft or twin aisle as they have two separate aisles in the cabin are used for long haul flights br The first was the Boeing quadjet followed by the trijets the Lockheed L and the Douglas DC then its MD stretch br Then other quadjets were introduced the Ilyushin Il and Il the Airbus A and the double deck A br Twinjets were also put into service the Airbus A A A and A the and br br br Regional aircraft br br Regional airliners seat fewer than passengers br These smaller aircraft are often used to feed traffic at large airline hubs to larger aircraft operated by the major mainline carriers legacy carriers or flag carriers often sharing the same livery br Regional jets include the Bombardier CRJ and Bombardier CRJ series or the Embraer ERJ family br Currently produced turboprop regional airliners include the Dash series and the ATR br br br Commuter aircraft br br Light aircraft can be used as small commuter airliners or as air taxis br Twin turboprops carrying up to passengers include the Beechcraft Fairchild Metro Jetstream DHC Twin Otter and Embraer EMB Bandeirante br Smaller airliners include the single engined turboprops like the Cessna Caravan and Pilatus PC or twin piston powered aircraft made by Cessna Piper Britten Norman and Beechcraft br They often lack lavatories stand up cabins pressurization galleys overhead storage bins reclining seats or a flight attendant br br br Engines br Until the beginning of the Jet Age piston engines were common on propliners such as the Douglas DC Nearly all modern airliners are now powered by turbine engines either turbofans or turboprops Gas turbine engines operate efficiently at much higher altitudes are more reliable than piston engines and produce less vibration and noise The use of a common fuel type kerosene based jet fuel is another advantage br br br Airliner variants br Some variants of airliners have been developed for carrying freight or for luxury corporate use Many airliners have also been modified for government use as VIP transports and for military functions such as airborne tankers for example the Vickers VC Lockheed L Boeing air ambulance USAF USN McDonnell Douglas DC reconnaissance Embraer ERJ Saab and Boeing as well as for troop carrying roles br br br Configuration br Modern jetliners are usually low wing designs with two engines mounted underneath the swept wings while turboprop aircraft are slow enough to use straight wings Smaller airliners sometimes have their engines mounted on either side of the rear fuselage Numerous advantages and disadvantages exist due to this arrangement Perhaps the most important advantage to mounting the engines under the wings is that the total aircraft weight is more evenly distributed across the wingspan which imposes less bending moment on the wings and allows for a lighter wing structure This factor becomes more important as aircraft weight increases and no in production airliners have both a maximum takeoff weight more than tons and engines mounted on the fuselage The Antonov An is the only in production jetliner with high mounted wings usually seen in military transport aircraft which reduces the risk of damage from unpaved runways br Except for a few experimental or military designs all aircraft built to date have had all of their weight lifted off the ground by airflow across the wings In terms of aerodynamics the fuselage has been a mere burden NASA and Boeing are currently developing a blended wing body design in which the entire airframe from wingtip to wingtip contributes lift This promises a significant gain in fuel efficiency br br br Current manufacturers br br The major manufacturers with large aircraft airliners currently in production include br br Airbus France Germany Spain United Kingdom Canada br Antonov Ukraine br ATR Aircraft France Italy br Boeing United States br Britten Norman United Kingdom br Comac China br De Havilland Canada Canada br Embraer Brazil br Irkut Corporation UAC Russia includes Sukhoi br Let Kunovice Czech Republic br Xi an Aircraft Industrial Corporation China br The narrow body and wide body airliner market is dominated by Airbus and Boeing and the regional airliner market is shared between ATR Aircraft De Havilland Canada and Embraer br Setting up a reliable customer support network ensuring uptime availability and support and anywhere is critical for the success of airliner manufacturers br Boeing and Airbus are ranked and in customer satisfaction for aftermarket support by a survey by Inside MRO and Air Transport World and this is a reason why Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation purchased the Bombardier CRJ program br It is an entry barrier for new entrants like the Xian MA

Apr RPKs are up by over a year and FTKs up by the IATA reports net aircraft went back from storage recalled and stored in April br It is the second month of storage contraction after eight of expansion and the largest in four years while new aircraft deliveries fell slightly to from due to supply chain issues and in service issues grounding others br Retirements were down by and utilization up by according to Canaccord Genuity driving used aircraft and engines values up while MRO shops have unexpected demand for legacy products like the PW and GE CF br br br Cabin configurations and features br br An airliner will usually have several classes of seating first class business class and or economy class which may be referred to as coach class or tourist class and sometimes has a separate premium economy section with more legroom and amenities The seats in more expensive classes are wider more comfortable and have more amenities such as lie flat seats for more comfortable sleeping on long flights Generally the more expensive the class the better the beverage and meal service br Domestic flights generally have a two class configuration usually first or business class and coach class although many airlines instead offer all economy seating International flights generally have either a two class configuration or a three class configuration depending on the airline route and aircraft type Many airliners offer movies or audio video on demand this is standard in first and business class on many international flights and may be available on economy Cabins of all classes have lavatory facilities reading lights and air vents Some larger airliners have a rest compartment reserved for crew use during breaks br br br Seats br br The types of seats that are provided and how much legroom is given to each passenger are decisions made by the individual airlines not the aircraft manufacturers Seats are mounted in tracks on the floor of the cabin and can be moved back and forth by the maintenance staff or removed altogether One driver of airline profitability is how many passengers can be seated in economy class cabins meaning that airline companies have an incentive to place seats close together to fit as many passengers in as possible In contrast premium class seat configurations provide more space for travelers br Passengers seated in an exit row the row of seats adjacent to an emergency exit usually have substantially more legroom than those seated in the remainder of the cabin while the seats directly in front of the exit row may have less legroom and may not even recline for evacuation safety reasons However passengers seated in an exit row may be required to assist cabin crew during an emergency evacuation of the aircraft opening the emergency exit and assisting fellow passengers to the exit As a precaution many airlines prohibit young people under the age of from being seated in the exit row br The seats are designed to withstand strong forces so as not to break or come loose from their floor tracks during turbulence or accidents The backs of seats are often equipped with a fold down tray for eating writing or as a place to set up a portable computer or a music or video player Seats without another row of seats in front of them have a tray that is either folded into the armrest or that clips into brackets on the underside of the armrests However seats in premium cabins generally have trays in the armrests or clip on trays regardless of whether there is another row of seats in front of them Seatbacks now often feature small colour LCD screens for videos television and video games Controls for this display as well as an outlet to plug in audio headsets are normally found in the armrest of each seat br br br Overhead bins br br The overhead bins also known as overhead lockers or pivot bins are used for stowing carry on baggage and other items While the airliner manufacturer will normally specify a standard version of the product to supply airlines can choose to have bins of differing size shape or color installed Over time overhead bins evolved out of what were originally overhead shelves that were used for little more than coat and briefcase storage As concerns about falling debris during turbulence or in accidents increased enclosed bins became the norm Bins have increased in size to accommodate the larger carry on baggage passengers can bring onto the aircraft Newer bin designs have included a handrail useful when moving through the cabin br br br Passenger service units br Above the passenger seats are Passenger Service Units PSU These typically contain reading lights air vents and a flight attendant call light On most narrowbody aircraft and some Airbus A s and A s the flight attendant call button and the buttons to control the reading lights are located directly on the PSU while on most widebody aircraft the flight attendant call button and the reading light control buttons are usually part of the in flight entertainment system The units frequently have small Fasten Seat Belt and No Smoking illuminated signage and may also contain a speaker for the cabin public address system On some newer aircraft a Turn off electronic devices sign is used instead of the No Smoking sign as smoking isn t permitted on board the aircraft anyway br The PSU will also normally contain the drop down oxygen masks which are activated if there is a sudden drop in cabin pressure These are supplied with oxygen by means of a chemical oxygen generator By using a chemical reaction rather than a connection to an oxygen tank these devices supply breathing oxygen for long enough for the airliner to descend to thicker more breathable air Oxygen generators do generate considerable heat in the process Because of this the oxygen generators are thermally shielded and are only allowed in commercial airliners when properly installed they are not permitted to be loaded as freight on passenger carrying flights ValuJet Flight crashed on May as a result of improperly loaded chemical oxygen generators br br br Cabin pressurization br br Airliners developed since the s have had pressurized cabins or more accurately pressurized hulls including baggage holds to enable them to carry passengers safely at high altitudes where low oxygen levels and air pressure would otherwise cause sickness or death High altitude flight enabled airliners to fly above most weather systems that cause turbulent or dangerous flying conditions and also to fly faster and further as there is less drag due to the lower air density Pressurization is applied using compressed air in most cases bled from the engines and is managed by an environmental control system which draws in clean air and vents stale air out through a valve br Pressurization presents design and construction challenges to maintain the structural integrity and sealing of the cabin and hull and to prevent rapid decompression Some of the consequences include small round windows doors that open inwards and are larger than the door hole and an emergency oxygen system br To maintain a pressure in the cabin equivalent to an altitude close to sea level would at a cruising altitude around m ft create a pressure difference between inside the aircraft and outside the aircraft that would require greater hull strength and weight Most people do not suffer ill effects up to an altitude of m ft and maintaining cabin pressure at this equivalent altitude significantly reduces the pressure difference and therefore the required hull strength and weight A side effect is that passengers experience some discomfort as the cabin pressure changes during ascent and descent to the majority of airports which are at low altitudes br br br Cabin climate control br The air bled from the engines is hot and requires cooling by air conditioning units It is also extremely dry at cruising altitude and this causes sore eyes dry skin and mucosa on long flights Although humidification technology could raise its relative humidity to comfortable middle levels this is not done since humidity promotes corrosion to the inside of the hull and risks condensation which could short electrical systems so for safety reasons it is deliberately kept to a low value around Another problem of the air coming from the ventilation unto which the oil lubrication system of the engines is hooked up is that fumes from components in the synthetic oils can sometimes travel along causing passengers pilots and crew to be intoxicated The illness it causes is called aerotoxic syndrome br br br Baggage holds br br Airliners must have space on board to store checked baggage that which will not safely fit in the passenger cabin br Designed to hold baggage as well as freight these compartments are called cargo bins baggage holds luggage holds or occasionally pits Occasionally baggage holds may be referred to as cargo decks on the largest of aircraft These compartments can be accessed through doors on the outside of the aircraft br Depending on the aircraft baggage holds are normally inside the hull and are therefore pressurized just like the passenger cabin although they may not be heated While lighting is normally installed for use by the loading crew typically the compartment is unlit when the door is closed br Baggage holds on modern airliners are equipped with fire detection equipment and larger aircraft have automated or remotely activated fire fighting devices installed br br br Narrow body airliners br Most narrow body airliners with more than seats have space below the cabin floor while smaller aircraft often have a special compartment separate from the passenger area but on the same level br Baggage is normally stacked within the bin by hand sorted by destination category Netting that fits across the width of the bin is secured to limit movement of the bags Airliners often carry items of freight and mail These may be loaded separately from the baggage or mixed in if they are bound for the same destination For securing bulky items hold down rings are provided to tie items into place br br br Wide body airliners br Wide body airliners frequently have a compartment like the ones described above typically called a bulk bin It is normally used for late arriving luggage or bags which may have been checked at the gate br However most baggage and loose freight items are loaded into containers called Unit Load Devices ULDs often referred to as cans ULDs come in a variety of sizes and shapes but the most common model is the LD This particular container has approximately the same height as the cargo compartment and fits across half of its width br ULDs are loaded with baggage and are transported to the aircraft on dolly carts and loaded into the baggage hold by a loader designed for the task By means of belts and rollers an operator can maneuver the ULD from the dolly cart up to the aircraft baggage hold door and into the aircraft Inside the hold the floor is also equipped with drive wheels and rollers that an operator inside can use to move the ULD properly into place Locks in the floor are used to hold the ULD in place during flight br For consolidated freight loads like a pallet of boxes or an item too oddly shaped to fit into a container flat metal pallets that resemble large baking sheets that are compatible with the loading equipment are used br br br See also br br br Lists br Regional jets br List of civil aircraft br List of regional
