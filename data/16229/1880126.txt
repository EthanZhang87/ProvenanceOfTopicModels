id: 1880126
Combat flight simulators are vehicle simulation games amateur flight simulation computer programs used to simulate military aircraft and their operations These are distinct from dedicated flight simulators used for professional pilot and military flight training which consist of realistic physical recreations of the actual aircraft cockpit often with a full motion platform br Combat flight simulation titles are more numerous than civilian flight simulators due to the variety of subject matter available and market demand Many free flight simulators such as the open source Linux Air Combat Falcon Digital Combat Simulator and Rise of Flight can be downloaded for free off the Internet br br br History br br br s br Prior to the rise of modern day video games electro mechanical games EM games were produced that used rear image projection in a manner similar to a zoetrope to produce moving animations on a screen This technology led to the rise of flight simulation arcade games initially in the form of EM games One such EM game was Jet Rocket a flight simulator released by Sega in that featured cockpit controls that could move the player s aircraft around a landscape displayed on a screen and shoot missiles at targets that would explode when hit The game displayed three dimensional terrain with buildings produced using special belt technology along with fluorescent paint to simulate a night view Upon its debut the game was cloned by three Chicago arcade manufacturers which led to the game under performing in North America Sega released several other similar EM flight combat games including Dive Bomber and Air Attack br Combat flight simulator video games began appearing from the late s In Taito released the arcade video game simulator Interceptor an early first person combat flight simulator that involved piloting a jet fighter using an eight way joystick to aim and shoot at enemy aircraft br Sega s last EM combat flight simulator was Heli Shooter which combines the use of a CPU processor with electro mechanical components screen projection and audio tape deck The gameplay involves the player piloting a helicopter using a throttle joystick to accelerate and decelerate and pedals to maneuver left and right across a realistic three dimensional landscape and shooting at military targets across the landscape In Japan it was one of the top ten highest grossing EM arcade games of and it released in North America the same year br br br s br The s experienced a wave of more advanced simulation video games with companies such as Atari Inc releasing their own game called Red Baron in which used QuadraScan graphics and sound effects to simulate first person flight combat Other games such as the earliest version of Microsoft Flight Simulator had crude graphics simple flight models and a combat option with dog fighting in a World War I Sopwith Camel Shortly after Microsoft Flight Simulator was released for the bit computer Microsoft released Jet in This simulator used simple filled wire frame graphics and a small generic battle space to allow players to fight MiGs in an F or F There were also titles released for the Atari that simulated flight combat two examples being Mattel s Air Raiders and Milton Bradley s Spitfire Attack br Later in the s it became a trend for arcade flight combat simulators to use hydraulic motion simulator arcade cabinets The trend was sparked by Sega s taikan games with taikan meaning body sensation in Japanese Yu Suzuki s team at Sega later known as Sega AM developed hydraulic motion simulator cockpit cabinets for flight combat games such as Space Harrier After Burner and the R games br br br s present br In the early s arcade flight combat simulators began adopting D polygon graphics Taito s Air Inferno was a D flight simulator utilizing a motion simulator cockpit cabinet Atari Games followed with the D flight combat simulator the following year Steel Talons Namco then followed with the D arcade combat flight simulator Air Combat br During the s to early s there was a transition from traditional video game platforms like arcades to consoles such as the original PlayStation for their ability to be played at home PC games remained popular during this time as many publishers continued to produce games primarily for the PC platform Due to the limitations and the relative simplicity of the controllers available for gaming consoles at the time flight simulators remained largely absent from consoles for years to come Several rival publishers rose during this period such as NovaLogic with titles like the Comanche Series that simulated helicopter combat and Electronic Arts with Jane s WWII Fighters which improved upon features such as detailed visible damage br Newer software in the genre include Digital Combat Simulator released in and mostly simulating modern aircraft Rise of Flight released in and set in World War I and IL Sturmovik Cliffs of Dover released in and set in World War II These three are examples of accurate simulation PC games as opposed to arcade style air combat games such as Bandai Namco Entertainment s highly successful Ace Combat series br br br Types br Combat flight simulators are classified according to their historical period type of aircraft and level of detail This method of classifying means that many simulators belong to more than one category which leads to arguments about what can be considered actual simulations instead of games Generally simulations are expected to be imitations of real world technology while games are not therefore every game with flying in them does not fit into the category of flight simulation br Simulator realism can be classified as the following br br Arcade game least realistic br Survey simulation br Study simulation most realistic br br br Arcade br Arcade style combat flight simulators have various elements that are less realistic than other simulators such as simplified controls and physics models compressed or non existent start up times emphasis on close range dogfighting over beyond visual range combat for modern jets and the ability to carry a physically impossible amount of weapons compared to real life aircraft loadouts Examples of console or PC games include Ace Combat H A W X and Project Wingman br Many arcade combat flight simulators in amusement arcades are housed in cockpit arcade cabinets that use motion simulator technology often incorporating hydraulics Popular examples include the original arcade versions of After Burner Thunder Blade and Air Combat Sega s R motion simulator cabinet notably features full degree rotation used by the arcade games G LOC Air Battle and Wing War br br br Survey br A survey simulation is a classification of simulator that includes a variety or survey of aircraft from the period in question This type of classification applies to many historical combat simulators and typically includes aircraft from all nations participating in the conflict Early simulators suffered from flight models and instrument panels that differed little between aircraft As the technology got better so did the diversity of aircraft which forced the virtual pilot to learn the carefully modelled strengths and weaknesses of the various types of aircraft e g the different fighting and flying styles of a Spitfire versus a Messerschmitt in IL Sturmovik or a Mitsubishi Zero versus a US Navy F F Wildcat in Combat Flight Simulator br Modern jet survey simulators have been developed as well such as US Navy Fighters USNF and Jane s USAF by Jane s Electronic Arts typically with simplified and generic modelling of radar navigation and weapons The turn of the century saw advancements in technology that increased the capabilities of these simulators simplifying and improving their weapon handling and flight models as well as updated visuals Titles featuring these improvements include Jane s Combat Simulations a line of flight simulations originally developed by Electronic Arts and later continued by the company Third Wire as well as the series Strike Fighters Project and Wings over Europe br br br Study br The study sim is a genre of simulation games that focuses on modelling an aircraft s systems as accurately as possible Advancing computer technology made this possible with the development of highly detailed models that improved upon the fidelity of avionics weapons systems physics flight models graphics etc and allowed for fully interactive cockpits where virtually every control was mapped and functional This was important as modern jet combat aircraft and helicopters have a variety of complex electronic and weapon systems that are specific to a particular aircraft br Early iterations of simulators in this genre include the release of EF by Digital Image Design DiD which quickly garnered a dedicated following including a user group that produced a detailed online manual of weapons and tactics as well as the popular Falcon a detailed simulation of the USAF F Fighting Falcon Other development of these simulators includes a collaborative and specialized effort between Electronic Arts and Jane s in the s with titles such as Jane s Longbow Jane s Longbow Jane s F and Jane s F A br Helicopter simulations began in with the title Gunship by MicroProse Nine years later in Digital Integration Ltd released Apache Longbow the most sophisticated helicopter simulation of the time In it was exceeded by Jane s AH D Longbow a game created by Origin Systems and released by Electronic Arts as part of the Jane s Combat Simulator series The sequel Jane s Longbow was one of the earliest simulations to take advantage of hardware accelerated graphics including advanced lighting saw the release of Enemy Engaged Apache vs Havoc by Empire Interactive which allowed players to choose to fly for either the US or Russia br The sophistication and intricacy of these simulators continued to grow and in the Digital Combat Simulator DCS released DCS Black Shark the first of a series of simulations that featured a complete and detailed cockpit with all the relevant switches accurately modelled and functional and mapped over key commands DCS also supported a variety of input devices aside from the traditional joystick throttle and pedals featuring built in support for TrackIR and virtual reality with degrees of freedom which in conjunction with the interactive D cockpit created a very realistic experience br br br Modern jet br Modern jet simulators are usually classified by their historical context or level of details study versus survey There have been many modern jet sims that concentrate on existing fighters several AV Harrier II sims and others such as Fleet Defender by MicroProse and F Lightning and F Raptor by NovaLogic whereas others concentrate on future fighters e g F Total Air War by Digital Image Design in While many simulators either classify as a study sim or a survey sim Lock On Modern Air Combat is an example of a game that attempts to bridge the study survey gap with highly detailed models of several US and Russian aircraft br br br Multi player br Before multiplayer games became popular many simulators could only be played by a single player This continued to be the standard until the late s when most titles included some sort of multi player network capability In single player combat simulators every entity other than the players own aircraft are controlled by the program s AI artificial intelligence and modern video games create very sophisticated and intelligent AI with independent behavior for adversaries and allies Multiplayer games which usually also contain AI allow players to oppose one or many human players After the growth of the internet many simulators were created that exist only or primarily as internet multiplayer versions e g Air Warrior the massively multiplayer Fighter Ace WarBirds Aces High World War II Online Ace Online War Thunder Fighter Wing and others br br br Gameplay br br br Missions campaigns mission builders br Many players of both video games and simulators seek games for their replay value Simulators enhance the replay value by offering a variety of single missions consisting of short randomly generated missions as well as longer campaigns consisting of several smaller mission or objectives Most campaigns are dynamic flowing which means they change according to the results of each successive mission e g if the player destroys a target of opportunity which turns out to be a truck carrying an enemy leader then the campaign starts to take a different path Some campaign models have been developed which are fully dynamic and where successive missions take place in an environment which is persistent if a building is destroyed in one mission it remains destroyed in the next and will only be rebuilt in view of limited resources realistic time and strategic priorities etc A notable pioneer in this area was Andy Hollis producer of the Jane s Longbow series Jane s AH D Longbow and Jane s Longbow Digital Image Design with their release of F Total Air War in allowed for a transparency into the larger strategic battlefield by use of multiple screens and a God s eye view Many simulators also include mission builders which allow the player to create their own missions br br br Controls and other hardware br Combat flight simulators are among the most computer and graphics demanding applications at any given time as they are real time applications with multiple processes happening at once This leads many simulation fans to constantly upgrade their hardware including the most advanced graphics cards These sims have also given rise to a variety of hardware add ons such as HOTAS hands on throttle and stick controllers that allow full control of most functions without touching the keyboard Voice control and head tracking view control systems are also available for home flight sim enthusiasts br br br Titles br The tables below define rough guidelines of what might classify as combat flight simulation games br br br World
