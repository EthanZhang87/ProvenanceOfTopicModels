title: Floppy disk
id: 10891
A floppy disk or floppy diskette casually referred to as a floppy a diskette or a disk is a type of disk storage composed of a thin and flexible disk of a magnetic storage medium in a square or nearly square plastic enclosure lined with a fabric that removes dust particles from the spinning disk The three most popular and commercially available floppy disks are the inch inch and inch floppy disks Floppy disks store digital data which can be read and written when the disk is inserted into a floppy disk drive FDD connected to or inside a computer or other device br The first floppy disks invented and made by IBM in had a disk diameter of inches mm Subsequently the inch mm and then the inch mm became a ubiquitous form of data storage and transfer into the first years of the st century inch floppy disks can still be used with an external USB floppy disk drive USB drives for inch inch and other size floppy disks are rare to non existent Some individuals and organizations continue to use older equipment to read or transfer data from floppy disks br Floppy disks were so common in late th century culture that many electronic and software programs continue to use save icons that look like floppy disks well into the st century as a form of skeuomorphic design While floppy disk drives still have some limited uses especially with legacy industrial computer equipment they have been superseded by data storage methods with much greater data storage capacity and data transfer speed such as USB flash drives memory cards optical discs and storage available through local computer networks and cloud storage br br br History br br The first commercial floppy disks developed in the late s were inches mm in diameter they became commercially available in as a component of IBM products and both drives and disks were then sold separately starting in by Memorex and others These disks and associated drives were produced and improved upon by IBM and other companies such as Memorex Shugart Associates and Burroughs Corporation The term floppy disk appeared in print as early as and although IBM announced its first media as the Type Diskette in the industry continued to use the terms floppy disk or floppy br In Shugart Associates introduced the inch FDD By there were more than ten manufacturers producing such FDDs There were competing floppy disk formats with hard and soft sector versions and encoding schemes such as differential Manchester encoding DM modified frequency modulation MFM M FM and group coded recording GCR The inch format displaced the inch one for most uses and the hard sectored disk format disappeared The most common capacity of the inch format in DOS based PCs was KB bytes for the Double Sided Double Density DSDD format using MFM encoding br In IBM introduced with its PC AT the MB bytes dual sided inch floppy disk but it never became very popular IBM started using the KB double density inch microfloppy disk on its Convertible laptop computer in and the MB high density version with the IBM Personal System PS line in These disk drives could be added to older PC models In Y E Data introduced a drive for MB Double Sided Extended Density DSED diskettes which was used by IBM in its top of the line PS and some RS models and in the second generation NeXTcube and NeXTstation however this format had limited market success due to lack of standards and movement to MB drives br Throughout the early s limits of the inch format became clear Originally designed to be more practical than the inch format it was becoming considered too large as the quality of recording media grew data could be stored in a smaller area Several solutions were developed with drives at and inches and Sony s mm mm in in disk offered by various companies They all had several advantages over the old format including a rigid case with a sliding metal or later sometimes plastic shutter over the head slot which helped protect the delicate magnetic medium from dust and damage and a sliding write protection tab which was far more convenient than the adhesive tabs used with earlier disks The large market share of the well established inch format made it difficult for these diverse mutually incompatible new formats to gain significant market share A variant on the Sony design introduced in by many manufacturers was then rapidly adopted By the inch was outselling the inch br Generally the term floppy disk persisted even though later style floppy disks have a rigid case around an internal floppy disk br By the end of the s inch disks had been superseded by inch disks During this time PCs frequently came equipped with drives of both sizes By the mid s inch drives had virtually disappeared as the inch disk became the predominant floppy disk The advantages of the inch disk were its higher capacity its smaller physical size and its rigid case which provided better protection from dirt and other environmental risks br br br Prevalence br br Floppy disks became commonplace during the s and s in their use with personal computers to distribute software transfer data and create backups Before hard disks became affordable to the general population floppy disks were often used to store a computer s operating system OS Most home computers from that time have an elementary OS and BASIC stored in read only memory ROM with the option of loading a more advanced OS from a floppy disk br By the early s the increasing software size meant large packages like Windows or Adobe Photoshop required a dozen disks or more In there were an estimated five billion standard floppy disks in use br An attempt to enhance the existing inch designs was the SuperDisk in the late s using very narrow data tracks and a high precision head guidance mechanism with a capacity of MB and backward compatibility with standard inch floppies a format war briefly occurred between SuperDisk and other high density floppy disk products although ultimately recordable CDs DVDs solid state flash storage and eventually cloud based online storage would render all these removable disk formats obsolete External USB based floppy disk drives are still available and many modern systems provide firmware support for booting from such drives br br br Gradual transition to other formats br br In the mid s mechanically incompatible higher density floppy disks were introduced like the Iomega Zip disk Adoption was limited by the competition between proprietary formats and the need to buy expensive drives for computers where the disks would be used In some cases failure in market penetration was exacerbated by the release of higher capacity versions of the drive and media being not backward compatible with the original drives dividing the users between new and old adopters Consumers were wary of making costly investments into unproven and rapidly changing technologies so none of the technologies became the established standard br Apple introduced the iMac G in with a CD ROM drive but no floppy drive this made USB connected floppy drives popular accessories as the iMac came without any writable removable media device br Recordable CDs were touted as an alternative because of the greater capacity compatibility with existing CD ROM drives and with the advent of re writeable CDs and packet writing a similar reusability as floppy disks However CD R RWs remained mostly an archival medium not a medium for exchanging data or editing files on the medium itself because there was no common standard for packet writing which allowed for small updates Other formats such as magneto optical discs had the flexibility of floppy disks combined with greater capacity but remained niche due to costs High capacity backward compatible floppy technologies became popular for a while and were sold as an option or even included in standard PCs but in the long run their use was limited to professionals and enthusiasts br Flash based USB thumb drives finally were a practical and popular replacement that supported traditional file systems and all common usage scenarios of floppy disks As opposed to other solutions no new drive type or special software was required that impeded adoption since all that was necessary was an already common USB port br br br Usage in the st century br br By most manufacturers still provided floppy disk drives as standard equipment to meet user demand for file transfer and an emergency boot device as well as for the general secure feeling of having the familiar device By this time the retail cost of a floppy drive had fallen to around equivalent to in so there was little financial incentive to omit the device from a system Subsequently enabled by the widespread support for USB flash drives and BIOS boot manufacturers and retailers progressively reduced the availability of floppy disk drives as standard equipment In February Dell one of the leading personal computer vendors announced that floppy drives would no longer be pre installed on Dell Dimension home computers although they were still available as a selectable option and purchasable as an aftermarket OEM add on By January only of computers sold in stores contained built in floppy disk drives br Floppy disks are used for emergency boots in aging systems lacking support for other bootable media and for BIOS updates since most BIOS and firmware programs can still be executed from bootable floppy disks If BIOS updates fail or become corrupt floppy drives can sometimes be used to perform a recovery The music and theatre industries still use equipment requiring standard floppy disks e g synthesizers samplers drum machines sequencers and lighting consoles Industrial automation equipment such as programmable machinery and industrial robots may not have a USB interface data and programs are then loaded from disks damageable in industrial environments This equipment may not be replaced due to cost or requirement for continuous availability existing software emulation and virtualization do not solve this problem because a customized operating system is used that has no drivers for USB devices Hardware floppy disk emulators can be made to interface floppy disk controllers to a USB port that can be used for flash drives br In May the United States Government Accountability Office released a report that covered the need to upgrade or replace legacy computer systems within federal agencies According to this document old IBM Series minicomputers running on inch floppy disks are still used to coordinate the operational functions of the United States nuclear forces The government planned to update some of the technology by the end of the fiscal year br Windows and Windows no longer come with drivers for floppy disk drives both internal and external However they will still support them with a separate device driver provided by Microsoft br The British Airways Boeing fleet up to its retirement in used inch floppy disks to load avionics software br Sony who had been in the floppy disk business since ended domestic sales of all six inch floppy disk models as of March This has been viewed by some as the end of the floppy disk While production of new floppy disk media has ceased sales and uses of this media from inventories is expected to continue until at least br br br Legacy br br For more than two decades the floppy disk was the primary external writable storage device used Most computing environments before the s were non networked and floppy disks were the primary means to transfer data between computers a method known informally as sneakernet Unlike hard disks floppy disks are handled and seen even a novice user can identify a floppy disk Because of these factors a picture of a inch floppy disk became an interface metaphor for saving data The floppy disk symbol is still used by software on user interface elements related to saving files such as LibreOffice even though physical floppy disks are largely obsolete br br br Design br br br Structure br br br inch and inch disks br br The inch and inch floppy disks contain a magnetically coated round plastic medium with a large circular hole in the center for a drive s spindle The medium is contained in a square plastic cover that has a small oblong opening in both sides to allow the drive s heads to read and write data and a large hole in the center to allow the magnetic medium to spin by rotating it from its middle hole br Inside the cover are two layers of fabric with the magnetic medium sandwiched in the middle The fabric is designed to reduce friction between the medium and the outer cover and catch particles of debris abraded off the disk to keep them from accumulating on the heads The cover is usually a one part sheet double folded with flaps glued or spot welded together br A small notch on the side of the disk identifies whether it is writable as detected by a mechanical switch or photoelectric sensor In the inch disk the notch being covered or not present enables writing while in the inch disk the notch being present and uncovered enables writing Tape may be used over the notch to change the mode of the disk Punch devices were sold to convert read only disks to writable ones and also to enable writing on the unused side of single sided disks for computers with single sided drives The latter worked because single and double sided disks typically contained essentially identical actual magnetic media for manufacturing efficiency Disks whose obverse and reverse sides were thus used separately in single sided drives were known as flippy disks Disk notching floppies for PCs was generally only required where users wanted to overwrite original disks of store bought software which somewhat commonly shipped with no notch present br Another LED photo transistor pair located near the center of the disk detects the index hole once per rotation in the magnetic disk Detection occurs whenever the drive s sensor the holes in the correctly inserted floppy s plastic envelope and a single hole in the rotating floppy disk medium line up This mechanism is used to detect the angular start of each track and whether or not the disk is rotating at the correct speed Early inch and inch disks also had holes for each sector in the enclosed magnetic medium in addition to the index hole with the same radial distance from the center for alignment with the same envelope hole These were termed hard sectored disks Later soft sectored disks have only one index hole in the medium and sector position is determined by the disk controller or low level software from patterns marking the start of a sector Generally the same drives are used to read and write both types of disks with only the disks and controllers differing Some operating systems using soft sectors such as Apple DOS do not use the index hole and the drives designed for such systems often lack the corresponding sensor this was mainly a hardware cost saving measure br br br inch disk br br The core of the inch disk is the same as the other two disks but the front has only a label and a small opening for reading and writing data protected by the shutter a spring loaded metal or plastic cover pushed to the side on entry into the drive Rather than having a hole in the center it has a metal hub which mates to the spindle of the drive Typical inch disk magnetic coating materials are br br DD m magnetic iron oxide br HD m cobalt doped iron oxide br ED m barium ferrite br Two holes at the bottom left and right indicate whether the disk is write protected and whether it is high density these holes are spaced as far apart as the holes in punched A paper allowing write protected high density floppy disks to be clipped into international standard ISO ring binders The dimensions of the disk shell are not quite square its width is slightly less than its depth so that it is impossible to insert the disk into a drive slot sideways i e rotated degrees from the correct shutter first orientation A diagonal notch at top right ensures that the disk is inserted into the drive in the correct orientation not upside down or label end first and an arrow at top left indicates direction of insertion The drive usually has a button that when pressed ejects the disk with varying degrees of force the discrepancy due to the ejection force provided by the spring of the shutter In IBM PC compatibles Commodores Apple II IIIs and other non Apple Macintosh machines with standard floppy disk drives a disk may be ejected manually at any time The drive has a disk change switch that detects when a disk is ejected or inserted Failure of this mechanical switch is a common source of disk corruption if a disk is changed and the drive and hence the operating system fails to notice br One of the chief usability problems of the floppy disk is its vulnerability even inside a closed plastic housing the disk medium is highly sensitive to dust condensation and temperature extremes As with all magnetic storage it is vulnerable to magnetic fields Blank disks have been distributed with an extensive set of warnings cautioning the user not to expose it to dangerous conditions Rough treatment or removing the disk from the drive while the magnetic media is still spinning is likely to cause damage to the disk drive head or stored data On the other hand the inch floppy disk has been lauded for its mechanical usability by human computer interaction expert Donald Norman br br A simple example of a good design is the inch magnetic diskette for computers a small circle of floppy magnetic material encased in hard plastic Earlier types of floppy disks did not have this plastic case which protects the magnetic material from abuse and damage A sliding metal cover protects the delicate magnetic surface when the diskette is not in use and automatically opens when the diskette is inserted into the computer The diskette has a square shape there are apparently eight possible ways to insert it into the machine only one of which is correct What happens if I do it wrong I try inserting the disk sideways Ah the designer thought of that A little study shows that the case really isn t square it s rectangular so you can t insert a longer side I try backward The diskette goes in only part of the way Small protrusions indentations and cutouts prevent the diskette from being inserted backward or upside down of the eight ways one might try to insert the diskette only one is correct and only that one will fit An excellent design br br br Operation br br A spindle motor in the drive rotates the magnetic medium at a certain speed while a stepper motor operated mechanism moves the magnetic read write heads radially along the surface of the disk Both read and write operations require the media to be rotating and the head to contact the disk media an action originally accomplished by a disk load solenoid Later drives held the heads out of contact until a front panel lever was rotated inch or disk insertion was complete inch To write data current is sent through a coil in the head as the media rotates The head s magnetic field aligns the magnetization of the particles directly below the head on the media When the current is reversed the magnetization aligns in the opposite direction encoding one bit of data To read data the magnetization of the particles in the media induce a tiny voltage in the head coil as they pass under it This small signal is amplified and sent to the floppy disk controller which converts the streams of pulses from the media into data checks it for errors and sends it to the host computer system br br br Formatting br br A blank unformatted diskette has a coating of magnetic oxide with no magnetic order to the particles During formatting the magnetizations of the particles are aligned forming tracks each broken up into sectors enabling the controller to properly read and write data The tracks are concentric rings around the center with spaces between tracks where no data is written gaps with padding bytes are provided between the sectors and at the end of the track to allow for slight speed variations in the disk drive and to permit better interoperability with disk drives connected to other similar systems br Each sector of data has a header that identifies the sector location on the disk A cyclic redundancy check CRC is written into the sector headers and at the end of the user data so that the disk controller can detect potential errors br Some errors are soft and can be resolved by automatically re trying the read operation other errors are permanent and the disk controller will signal a failure to the operating system if multiple attempts to read the data still fail br br br Insertion and ejection br After a disk is inserted a catch or lever at the front of the drive is manually lowered to prevent the disk from accidentally emerging engage the spindle clamping hub and in two sided drives engage the second read write head with the media br In some inch drives insertion of the disk compresses and locks an ejection spring which partially ejects the disk upon opening the catch or lever This enables a smaller concave area for the thumb and fingers to grasp the disk during removal br Newer inch drives and all inch drives automatically engage the spindle and heads when a disk is inserted doing the opposite with the press of the eject button br On Apple Macintosh computers with built in inch disk drives the ejection button is replaced by software controlling an ejection motor which only does so when the operating system no longer needs to access the drive The user could drag the image of the floppy drive to the trash can on the desktop to eject the disk In the case of a power failure or drive malfunction a loaded disk can be removed manually by inserting a straightened paper clip into a small hole at the drive s front panel just as one would do with a CD ROM drive in a similar situation The X has soft eject inch drives Some late generation IBM PS machines had soft eject inch disk drives as well for which some issues of DOS i e PC DOS and higher offered an EJECT command br br br Finding track zero br Before a disk can be accessed the drive needs to synchronize its head position with the disk tracks In some drives this is accomplished with a Track Zero Sensor while for others it involves the drive head striking an immobile reference surface br In either case the head is moved so that it is approaching track zero position of the disk When a drive with the sensor has reached track zero the head stops moving immediately and is correctly aligned For a drive without the sensor the mechanism attempts to move the head the maximum possible number of positions needed to reach track zero knowing that once this motion is complete the head will be positioned over track zero br Some drive mechanisms such as the Apple II inch drive without a track zero sensor produce characteristic mechanical noises when trying to move the heads past the reference surface This physical striking is responsible for the inch drive clicking during the boot of an Apple II and the loud rattles of its DOS and ProDOS when disk errors occurred and track zero synchronization was attempted br br br Finding sectors br All inch and some inch drives used a mechanical method to locate sectors known as either hard sectors or soft sectors and is the purpose of the small hole in the jacket off to the side of the spindle hole A light beam sensor detects when a punched hole in the disk is visible through the hole in the jacket br For a soft sectored disk there is only a single hole which is used to locate the first sector of each track Clock timing is then used to find the other sectors behind it which requires precise speed regulation of the drive motor br For a hard sectored disk there are many holes one for each sector row plus an additional hole in a half sector position that is used to indicate sector zero br The Apple II computer system is notable in that it did not have an index hole sensor and ignored the presence of hard or soft sectoring Instead it used special repeating data synchronization patterns written to the disk between each sector to assist the computer in finding and synchronizing with the data in each track br The later inch drives of the mid s did not use sector index holes but instead also used synchronization patterns br Most inch drives used a constant speed drive motor and contain the same number of sectors across all tracks This is sometimes referred to as Constant Angular Velocity CAV In order to fit more data onto a disk some inch drives notably the Macintosh External K and K drives instead use Constant Linear Velocity CLV which uses a variable speed drive motor that spins more slowly as the head moves away from the center of the disk maintaining the same speed of the head s relative to the surface s of the disk This allows more sectors to be written to the longer middle and outer tracks as the track length increases br br br Sizes br br While the original IBM inch disk was actually so defined the other sizes are defined in the metric system their usual names being but rough approximations br Different sizes of floppy disks are mechanically incompatible and disks can fit only one size of drive Drive assemblies with both inch and inch slots were available during the transition period between the sizes but they contained two separate drive mechanisms In addition there are many subtle usually software driven incompatibilities between the two inch disks formatted for use with Apple II computers would be unreadable and treated as unformatted on a Commodore As computer platforms began to form attempts were made at interchangeability For example the SuperDrive included from the Macintosh SE to the Power Macintosh G could read write and format IBM PC format inch disks but few IBM compatible computers had drives that did the reverse inch inch and inch drives were manufactured in a variety of sizes most to fit standardized drive bays Alongside the common disk sizes were non classical sizes for specialized systems br br br inch floppy disk br br Floppy disks of the first standard are inches in diameter protected by a flexible plastic jacket It was a read only device used by IBM as a way of loading microcode Read write floppy disks and their drives became available in but it was IBM s introduction of the data entry system that began the establishment of floppy disks called by IBM the Diskette as an industry standard for information interchange Formatted diskette for this system store bytes Early microcomputers used for engineering business or word processing often used one or more inch disk drives for removable storage the CP M operating system was developed for microcomputers with inch drives br The family of inch disks and drives increased over time and later versions could store up to MB many microcomputer applications did not need that much capacity on one disk so a smaller size disk with lower cost media and drives was feasible The inch drive succeeded the inch size in many applications and developed to about the same storage capacity as the original inch size using higher density media and recording techniques br br br inch floppy disk br br The head gap of an track high density MB in the MFM format inch drive a k a Mini diskette Mini disk or Minifloppy is smaller than that of a track double density KB if double sided drive but can also format read and write track disks provided the controller supports double stepping or has a switch to do so inch track drives were also called hyper drives A blank track disk formatted and written on an track drive can be taken to its native drive without problems and a disk formatted on a track drive can be used on an track drive Disks written on a track drive and then updated on an track drive become unreadable on any track drives due to track width incompatibility br Single sided disks were coated on both sides despite the availability of more expensive double sided disks The reason usually given for the higher price was that double sided disks were certified error free on both sides of the media Double sided disks could be used in some drives for single sided disks as long as an index signal was not needed This was done one side at a time by turning them over flippy disks more expensive dual head drives which could read both sides without turning over were later produced and eventually became used universally br br br inch floppy disk br br In the early s many manufacturers introduced smaller floppy drives and media in various formats A consortium of companies eventually settled on a inch design known as the Micro diskette Micro disk or Micro floppy similar to a Sony design but improved to support both single sided and double sided media with formatted capacities generally of KB and KB respectively Single sided drives of the consortium design first shipped in and double sided in The double sided high density MB actually KiB MiB disk drive which would become the most popular first shipped in The first Macintosh computers used single sided inch floppy disks but with KB formatted capacity These were followed in by double sided KB floppies The higher capacity was achieved at the same recording density by varying the disk rotation speed with head position so that the linear speed of the disk was closer to constant Later Macs could also read and write MB HD disks in PC format with fixed rotation speed Higher capacities were similarly achieved by Acorn s RISC OS KB for DD KB for HD and AmigaOS KB for DD KB for HD br All inch disks have a rectangular hole in one corner which if obstructed write enables the disk A sliding detented piece can be moved to block or reveal the part of the rectangular hole that is sensed by the drive The HD MB disks have a second unobstructed hole in the opposite corner that identifies them as being of that capacity br In IBM compatible PCs the three densities of inch floppy disks are backwards compatible higher density drives can read write and format lower density media It is also possible to format a disk at a lower density than that for which it was intended but only if the disk is first thoroughly demagnetized with a bulk eraser as the high density format is magnetically stronger and will prevent the disk from working in lower density modes br Writing at different densities than those at which disks were intended sometimes by altering or drilling holes was possible but not supported by manufacturers A hole on one side of a inch disk can be altered as to make some disk drives and operating systems treat the disk as one of higher or lower density for bidirectional compatibility or economical reasons Some computers such as the PS and Acorn Archimedes ignored these holes altogether br br br Other sizes br br Other smaller floppy sizes were proposed especially for portable or pocket sized devices that needed a smaller storage device br br inch floppies otherwise similar to inch floppies were proposed by Tabor and Dysan br Three inch disks similar in construction to inch were manufactured and used for a time particularly by Amstrad computers and word processors br A two inch nominal size known as the Video Floppy was introduced by Sony for use with its Mavica still video camera br An incompatible two inch floppy produced by Fujifilm called the LT was used in the Zenith Minisport portable computer br None of these sizes achieved much market success br br br Sizes performance and capacity br Floppy disk size is often referred to in inches even in countries using metric and though the size is defined in metric The ANSI specification of inch disks is entitled in part mm inch though mm is closer to inches Formatted capacities are generally set in terms of kilobytes and megabytes br br Data is generally written to floppy disks in sectors angular blocks and tracks concentric rings at a constant radius For example the HD format of inch floppy disks uses bytes per sector sectors per track tracks per side and two sides for a total of bytes per disk Some disk controllers can vary these parameters at the user s request increasing storage on the disk although they may not be able to be read on machines with other controllers For example Microsoft applications were often distributed on inch MB DMF disks formatted with sectors instead of they could still be recognized by a standard controller On the IBM PC MSX and most other microcomputer platforms disks were written using a constant angular velocity CAV format with the disk spinning at a constant speed and the sectors holding the same amount of information on each track regardless of radial location br Because the sectors have constant angular size the bytes in each sector are compressed more near the disk s center A more space efficient technique would be to increase the number of sectors per track toward the outer edge of the disk from to for instance thereby keeping nearly constant the amount of physical disk space used for storing each sector an example is zone bit recording Apple implemented this in early Macintosh computers by spinning the disk more slowly when the head was at the edge while maintaining the data rate allowing KB of storage per side and an extra KB on a double sided disk This higher capacity came with a disadvantage the format used a unique drive mechanism and control circuitry meaning that Mac disks could not be read on other computers Apple eventually reverted to constant angular velocity on HD floppy disks with their later machines still unique to Apple as they supported the older variable speed formats br Disk formatting is usually done by a utility program supplied by the computer OS manufacturer generally it sets up a file storage directory system on the disk and initializes its sectors and tracks Areas of the disk unusable for storage due to flaws can be locked marked as bad sectors so that the operating system does not attempt to use them This was time consuming so many environments had quick formatting which skipped the error checking process When floppy disks were often used disks pre formatted for popular computers were sold The unformatted capacity of a floppy disk does not include the sector and track headings of a formatted disk the difference in storage between them depends on the drive s application Floppy disk drive and media manufacturers specify the unformatted capacity for example MB for a standard inch HD floppy It is implied that this should not be exceeded since doing so will most likely result in performance problems DMF was introduced permitting MB to fit onto an otherwise standard inch disk utilities then appeared allowing disks to be formatted as such br Mixtures of decimal prefixes and binary sector sizes require care to properly calculate total capacity Whereas semiconductor memory naturally favors powers of two size doubles each time an address pin is added to the integrated circuit the capacity of a disk drive is the product of sector size sectors per track tracks per side and sides which in hard disk drives with multiple platters can be greater than Although other sector sizes have been known in the past formatted sector sizes are now almost always set to powers of two bytes bytes etc and in some cases disk capacity is calculated as multiples of the sector size rather than only in bytes leading to a combination of decimal multiples of sectors and binary sector sizes For example MB inch HD disks have the M prefix peculiar to their context coming from their capacity of byte sectors KiB consistent with neither a decimal megabyte nor a binary mebibyte MiB Hence these disks hold MB or MiB Usable data capacity is a function of the disk format used which in turn is determined by the FDD controller and its settings Differences between such formats can result in capacities ranging from approximately to KiB MB on a standard inch high density floppy and up to nearly MB with utilities such as M MGUI The highest capacity techniques require much tighter matching of drive head geometry between drives something not always possible and unreliable For example the LS drive supports a MB capacity on standard inch HD disks but this is a write once technique and requires its own drive br The raw maximum transfer rate of inch ED floppy drives MB is nominally kilobits s or approximately that of single speed CD ROM of audio CD This represents the speed of raw data bits moving under the read head however the effective speed is somewhat less due to space used for headers gaps and other format fields and can be even further reduced by delays to seek between tracks br br br See also br br Berg connector
