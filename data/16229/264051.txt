id: 264051
The history of computing hardware starting at is marked by the conversion from vacuum tube to solid state devices such as transistors and then integrated circuit IC chips Around to discrete transistors started being considered sufficiently reliable and economical that they made further vacuum tube computers uncompetitive Metal oxide semiconductor MOS large scale integration LSI technology subsequently led to the development of semiconductor memory in the mid to late s and then the microprocessor in the early s This led to primary computer memory moving away from magnetic core memory devices to solid state static and dynamic semiconductor memory which greatly reduced the cost size and power consumption of computers These advances led to the miniaturized personal computer PC in the s starting with home computers and desktop computers followed by laptops and then mobile computers over the next several decades br br br Second generation br br For the purposes of this article the term second generation refers to computers using discrete transistors even when the vendors referred to them as third generation By transistorized computers were replacing vacuum tube computers offering lower cost higher speeds and reduced power consumption The marketplace was dominated by IBM and the seven dwarfs br br IBM br The BUNCH br Burroughs br UNIVAC br NCR br Control Data Corporation CDC br Honeywell br General Electric br RCA br Some examples of s second generation computers from those vendors are br br the IBM the IBM and the IBM System br the Burroughs series br the UNIVAC br the NCR br the CDC and the CDC series br the Honeywell Honeywell and Honeywell br the GE series and the GE series br the RCA and the Spectra series br However some smaller companies made significant contributions Also towards the end of the second generation Digital Equipment Corporation DEC was a serious contender in the small and medium machine marketplace br Meanwhile second generation computers were also being developed in the USSR as e g the Razdan family of general purpose digital computers created at the Yerevan Computer Research and Development Institute br The second generation computer architectures initially varied they included character based decimal computers sign magnitude decimal computers with a digit word sign magnitude binary computers and ones complement binary computers although Philco RCA and Honeywell for example had some computers that were character based binary computers and Digital Equipment Corporation DEC and Philco for example had two s complement computers With the advent of the IBM System two s complement became the norm for new product lines br The most common word sizes for binary mainframes were and bits although entry level and midrange machines used smaller words e g bits bits bits bits All but the smallest machines had asynchronous I O channels and interrupts Typically binary computers with word size up to bits had one instruction per word binary computers with bits per word had two instructions per word and the CDC bit machines could have two three or four instructions per word depending on the instruction mix the Burroughs B B B and B lines are notable exceptions to this br First generation computers with data channels I O channels had a basic DMA interface to the channel cable The second generation saw both simpler e g channels on the CDC series had no DMA and more sophisticated designs e g the on the IBM had limited computational conditional branching and interrupt system br By magnetic core was the dominant memory technology although there were still some new machines using drums and delay lines during the s br Magnetic thin film and rod memory were used on some second generation machines but advances in core technology meant they remained niche players until semiconductor memory displaced both core and thin film br In the first generation word oriented computers typically had a single accumulator and an extension referred to as e g Upper and Lower Accumulator Accumulator and Multiplier Quotient MQ register In the second generation it became common for computers to have multiple addressable accumulators On some computers e g PDP the same registers served as accumulators and index registers making them an early example of general purpose registers br In the second generation there was considerable development of new address modes including truncated addressing on e g the Philco TRANSAC S the UNIVAC III and automatic index register incrementing on e g the RCA UNIVAC and the GE series Although index registers were introduced in the first generation under the name B line their use became much more common in the second generation Similarly indirect addressing became more common in the second generation either in conjunction with index registers or instead of them While first generation computers typically had a small number of index registers or none several lines of second generation computers had large numbers of index registers e g Atlas Bendix G IBM br The first generation had pioneered the use of special facilities for calling subroutines e g TSX on the IBM In the second generation such facilities were ubiquitous In the descriptions below NSI is the next sequential instruction the return address Some examples are br br Automatically record the NSI in a register for all or most successful branch instructions br The Jump Address JA Register on the Philco TRANSAC S br The Sequence History SH and Cosequence History CSH registers on the Honeywell br The B register on an IBM with the indexing feature br Automatically record the NSI at a standard memory location following all or most successful branches br Store P STP locations on RCA and RCA br Call instructions that save the NSI in the first word of the subroutine br Return Jump RJ on the UNIVAC br Return Jump RJ on CDC and CDC series br Call instructions that save the NSI in an implicit or explicit register br Branch and Load Location in Index Word BLX on the IBM br Transfer and Set Xn TSXn on the GE series br Branch and Link BAL on the IBM System br Call instructions that use an index register as a stack pointer and push return information onto the stack br Push jump PUSHJ on the DEC PDP br Implicit call with return information pushed onto the stack br Program descriptors on the Burroughs B line br Program descriptors on the Burroughs B line br The second generation saw the introduction of features intended to support multiprogramming and multiprocessor configurations including master slave supervisor problem mode storage protection keys limit registers protection associated with address translation and atomic instructions br br br Third generation br br The mass increase in the use of computers accelerated with Third Generation computers starting around in the commercial market These generally relied on early sub transistor integrated circuit technology The third generation ends with the microprocessor based fourth generation br In Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments invented the hybrid integrated circuit hybrid IC which had external wire connections making it difficult to mass produce In Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor invented the monolithic integrated circuit IC chip It was made of silicon whereas Kilby s chip was made of germanium The basis for Noyce s monolithic IC was Fairchild s planar process which allowed integrated circuits to be laid out using the same principles as those of printed circuits The planar process was developed by Noyce s colleague Jean Hoerni in early based on the silicon surface passivation and thermal oxidation processes developed by Mohamed M Atalla at Bell Labs in the late s br Computers using IC chips began to appear in the early s For example the Semiconductor Network Computer Molecular Electronic Computer Mol E Com the first monolithic integrated circuit general purpose computer built for demonstration purposes programmed to simulate a desk calculator was built by Texas Instruments for the US Air Force br Some of their early uses were in embedded systems notably used by NASA for the Apollo Guidance Computer by the military in the LGM Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile the Honeywell ALERT airborne computer and in the Central Air Data Computer used for flight control in the US Navy s F A Tomcat fighter jet br An early commercial use was the SDS IBM first used ICs in computers for the logic of the System Model shipped in and then made extensive use of ICs in its System which began shipment in br br The integrated circuit enabled the development of much smaller computers The minicomputer was a significant innovation in the s and s It brought computing power to more people not only through more convenient physical size but also through broadening the computer vendor field Digital Equipment Corporation became the number two computer company behind IBM with their popular PDP and VAX computer systems Smaller affordable hardware also brought about the development of important new operating systems such as Unix br In November Hewlett Packard introduced the A minicomputer one of the first commercial bit computers It used CT L Complementary Transistor MicroLogic in integrated circuits from Fairchild Semiconductor Hewlett Packard followed this with similar bit computers such as the A in the A in and others br In Data General introduced the Nova and shipped a total of at each The popularity of bit computers such as the Hewlett Packard xx series and the Data General Nova led the way toward word lengths that were multiples of the bit byte The Nova was first to employ medium scale integration MSI circuits from Fairchild Semiconductor with subsequent models using large scale integrated LSI circuits Also notable was that the entire central processor was contained on one inch printed circuit board br Large mainframe computers used ICs to increase storage and processing abilities The IBM System mainframe computer family are sometimes called third generation computers however their logic consisted primarily of SLT hybrid circuits which contained discrete transistors and diodes interconnected on a substrate with printed wires and printed passive components the S M and M did use ICs for some of their circuits IBM s System used ICs for their logic and later models used semiconductor memory br By the ILLIAC IV supercomputer was the fastest computer in the world using about a quarter million small scale ECL logic gate integrated circuits to make up sixty four parallel data processors br Third generation computers were offered well into the s for example the IBM ES X announced April used ECL chips to make a way processor Other third generation computers offered in the s included the DEC VAX built from ECL gate arrays and custom chips and the Cray T br br br Fourth generation br Third generation minicomputers were essentially scaled down versions of mainframe computers whereas the fourth generation s origins are fundamentally different The basis of the fourth generation is the microprocessor a computer processor contained on a single large scale integration LSI MOS integrated circuit chip br Microprocessor based computers were originally very limited in their computational ability and speed and were in no way an attempt to downsize the minicomputer They were addressing an entirely different market br Processing power and storage capacities have grown beyond all recognition since the s but the underlying technology has remained basically the same of large scale integration LSI or very large scale integration VLSI microchips so it is widely regarded that most of today s computers still belong to the fourth generation br br br Microprocessors br br The microprocessor has origins in the MOS integrated circuit MOS IC chip The MOS IC was fabricated by Fred Heiman and Steven Hofstein at RCA in Due to rapid MOSFET scaling MOS IC chips rapidly increased in complexity at a rate predicted by Moore s law leading to large scale integration LSI with hundreds of transistors on a single MOS chip by the late s The application of MOS LSI chips to computing was the basis for the first microprocessors as engineers began recognizing that a complete computer processor could be contained on a single MOS LSI chip br The earliest multi chip microprocessors were the Four Phase Systems AL in and Garrett AiResearch MP in each using several MOS LSI chips On November Intel released the world s first single chip microprocessor the on a single MOS LSI chip Its development was led by Federico Faggin using silicon gate MOS technology along with Ted Hoff Stanley Mazor and Masatoshi Shima It was developed for a Japanese calculator company called Busicom as an alternative to hardwired circuitry but computers were developed around it with much of their processing abilities provided by one small microprocessor chip The dynamic RAM DRAM chip was based on the MOS DRAM memory cell developed by Robert Dennard of IBM offering kilobits of memory on one chip Intel coupled the RAM chip with the microprocessor allowing fourth generation computers to be smaller and faster than prior computers The was only capable of instructions per second but its successors brought ever growing speed and power to computers including the Intel used in many computers using the CP M operating system and the family The IBM personal computer PC and compatibles use processors that are still backward compatible with the Other producers also made microprocessors which were widely used in microcomputers br The following table shows a timeline of significant microprocessor development br br br Supercomputers br br The powerful supercomputers of the era were at the other end of the computing spectrum from the microcomputers and they also used integrated circuit technology In the Cray was developed by Seymour Cray who had left Control Data in to form his own company This machine was the first supercomputer to make vector processing practical It had a characteristic horseshoe shape to speed processing by shortening circuit paths Vector processing uses one instruction to perform the same operation on many arguments it has been a fundamental supercomputer processing method ever since The Cray could calculate million floating point operations per second megaflops were shipped at a price of million each The Cray had a CPU that was mostly constructed of SSI and MSI ECL ICs br br br Mainframes and minicomputers br br Computers were generally large costly systems owned by large institutions before the introduction of the microprocessor in the early s corporations universities government agencies and the like Users were experienced specialists who did not usually interact with the machine itself but instead prepared tasks for the computer on off line equipment such as card punches A number of assignments for the computer would be gathered up and processed in batch mode After the jobs had completed users could collect the output printouts and punched cards In some organizations it could take hours or days between submitting a job to the computing center and receiving the output br A more interactive form of computer use developed commercially by the middle s In a time sharing system multiple teleprinter and display terminals let many people share the use of one mainframe computer processor with the operating system assigning time slices to each user s jobs This was common in business applications and in science and engineering br A different model of computer use was foreshadowed by the way in which early pre commercial experimental computers were used where one user had exclusive use of a processor Some of the first computers that might be called personal were early minicomputers such as the LINC and PDP and later on VAX and larger minicomputers from Digital Equipment Corporation DEC Data General Prime Computer and others They originated as peripheral processors for mainframe computers taking on some routine tasks and freeing the processor for computation br By today s standards they were physically large about the size of a refrigerator and costly typically tens of thousands of US dollars and thus were rarely purchased by individuals However they were much smaller less expensive and generally simpler to operate than the mainframe computers of the time and thus affordable by individual laboratories and research projects Minicomputers largely freed these organizations from the batch processing and bureaucracy of a commercial or university computing center br In addition minicomputers were more interactive than mainframes and soon had their own operating systems The minicomputer Xerox Alto was a landmark step in the development of personal computers because of its graphical user interface bit mapped high resolution screen large internal and external memory storage mouse and special software br br br Microcomputers br br br Microprocessor and cost reduction br In the minicomputer ancestors of the modern personal computer processing was carried out by circuits with large numbers of components arranged on multiple large printed circuit boards Minicomputers were consequently physically large and expensive to produce compared with later microprocessor systems After the computer on a chip was commercialized the cost to produce a computer system dropped dramatically The arithmetic logic and control functions that previously occupied several costly circuit boards were now available in one integrated circuit which was very expensive to design but cheap to produce in large quantities Concurrently advances in developing solid state memory eliminated the bulky costly and power hungry magnetic core memory used in prior generations of computers br br br Micral N br br In France the company R E R alisations et Etudes Electroniques formed by five former engineers of the Intertechnique company Andr Truong Trong Thi and Fran ois Gernelle introduced in February a microcomputer the Micral N based on the Intel br Originally the computer had been designed by Gernelle Lacombe Beckmann and Benchitrite for the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique to automate hygrometric measurements The Micral N cost a fifth of the price of a PDP about FF br The clock of the Intel was set at kHz the memory was kilobytes br A bus called Pluribus was introduced and allowed connection of up to boards br Different boards for digital I O analog I O memory floppy disk were available from R E br br br Altair and IMSAI br br The development of the single chip microprocessor was an enormous catalyst to the popularization of cheap easy to use and truly personal computers The Altair introduced in a Popular Electronics magazine article in the January issue at the time set a new low price point for a computer bringing computer ownership to an admittedly select market in the s This was followed by the IMSAI computer with similar abilities and limitations The Altair and IMSAI were essentially scaled down minicomputers and were incomplete to connect a keyboard or teleprinter to them required heavy expensive peripherals These machines both featured a front panel with switches and lights which communicated with the operator in binary To program the machine after switching it on the bootstrap loader program had to be entered without error in binary then a paper tape containing a BASIC interpreter loaded from a paper tape reader Keying the loader required setting a bank of eight switches up or down and pressing the load button once for each byte of the program which was typically hundreds of bytes long The computer could run BASIC programs once the interpreter had been loaded br br The MITS Altair the first commercially successful microprocessor kit was featured on the cover of Popular Electronics magazine in January It was the world s first mass produced personal computer kit as well as the first computer to use an Intel processor It was a commercial success with Altairs being shipped The Altair also inspired the software development efforts of Paul Allen and his high school friend Bill Gates who developed a BASIC interpreter for the Altair and then formed Microsoft br The MITS Altair effectively created a new industry of microcomputers and computer kits with many others following such as a wave of small business computers in the late s based on the Intel Zilog Z and Intel microprocessor chips Most ran the CP M operating system developed by Gary Kildall at Digital Research CP M was the first popular microcomputer operating system to be used by many different hardware vendors and many software packages were written for it such as WordStar and dBase II br Many hobbyists during the mid s designed their own systems with various degrees of success and sometimes banded together to ease the job Out of these house meetings the Homebrew Computer Club developed where hobbyists met to talk about what they had done exchange schematics and software and demonstrate their systems Many people built or assembled their own computers as per published designs For example many thousands of people built the Galaksija home computer later in the early s br The Altair was influential It came before Apple Computer as well as Microsoft which produced and sold the Altair BASIC programming language interpreter Microsoft s first product The second generation of microcomputers those that appeared in the late s sparked by the unexpected demand for the kit computers at the electronic hobbyist clubs were usually known as home computers For business use these systems were less capable and in some ways less versatile than the large business computers of the day They were designed for fun and educational purposes not so much for practical use And although you could use some simple office productivity applications on them they were generally used by computer enthusiasts for learning to program and for running computer games for which the personal computers of the period were less suitable and much too expensive For the more technical hobbyists home computers were also used for electronically interfacing to external devices such as controlling model railroads and other general hobbyist pursuits br br br Microcomputer emerges br br The advent of the microprocessor and solid state memory made home computing affordable Early hobby microcomputer systems such as the Altair and Apple I introduced around marked the release of low cost bit processor chips which had sufficient computing power to be of interest to hobby and experimental users By pre assembled systems such as the Apple II Commodore PET and TRS later dubbed the Trinity by Byte Magazine began the era of mass market home computers much less effort was required to obtain an operating computer and applications such as games word processing and spreadsheets began to proliferate Distinct from computers used in homes small business systems were typically based on CP M until IBM introduced the IBM PC which was quickly adopted The PC was heavily cloned leading to mass production and consequent cost reduction throughout the s This expanded the PC s presence in homes replacing the home computer category during the s and leading to the current monoculture of architecturally identical personal computers br br br Timeline of computer systems
