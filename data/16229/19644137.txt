A mobile phone or cell phone is a portable telephone that can make and receive calls over a radio frequency link while the user is moving within a telephone service area as opposed to a fixed location phone landline phone The radio frequency link establishes a connection to the switching systems of a mobile phone operator which provides access to the public switched telephone network PSTN Modern mobile telephone services use a cellular network architecture and therefore mobile telephones are called cellphones or cell phones in North America In addition to telephony digital mobile phones support a variety of other services such as text messaging multimedia messaging email Internet access via LTE G NR or Wi Fi short range wireless communications infrared Bluetooth satellite access navigation messaging connectivity business applications payments via NFC multimedia playback and streaming radio television digital photography and video games Mobile phones offering only basic capabilities are known as feature phones slang dumbphones mobile phones that offer greatly advanced computing capabilities are referred to as smartphones br The first handheld mobile phone was demonstrated by Martin Cooper of Motorola in New York City on April using a handset weighing c kilograms lbs In Nippon Telegraph and Telephone NTT launched the world s first cellular network in Japan In the DynaTAC x was the first commercially available handheld mobile phone From to worldwide mobile phone subscriptions grew to over seven billion enough to provide one for every person on Earth In the first quarter of the top smartphone developers worldwide were Samsung Apple and Huawei smartphone sales represented percent of total mobile phone sales For feature phones as of the top selling brands were Samsung Nokia and Alcatel br Mobile phones are considered an important human invention as they have been one of the most widely used and sold pieces of consumer technology The growth in popularity has been rapid in some places for example in the UK the total number of mobile phones overtook the number of houses in Today mobile phones are globally ubiquitous and in almost half the world s countries over of the population owns at least one br br br History br br A handheld mobile radio telephone service was envisioned in the early stages of radio engineering In Finnish inventor Eric Tigerstedt filed a patent for a pocket size folding telephone with a very thin carbon microphone Early predecessors of cellular phones included analog radio communications from ships and trains The race to create truly portable telephone devices began after World War II with developments taking place in many countries The advances in mobile telephony have been traced in successive generations starting with the early zeroth generation G services such as Bell System s Mobile Telephone Service and its successor the Improved Mobile Telephone Service These G systems were not cellular supported a few simultaneous calls and were very expensive br br The first handheld cellular mobile phone was demonstrated by John F Mitchell and Martin Cooper of Motorola in using a handset weighing kilograms lb The first commercial automated cellular network G analog was launched in Japan by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone in This was followed in by the simultaneous launch of the Nordic Mobile Telephone NMT system in Denmark Finland Norway and Sweden Several other countries then followed in the early to mid s These first generation G systems could support far more simultaneous calls but still used analog cellular technology In the DynaTAC x was the first commercially available handheld mobile phone br In the second generation G digital cellular technology was launched in Finland by Radiolinja on the GSM standard This sparked competition in the sector as the new operators challenged the incumbent G network operators The GSM standard is a European initiative expressed at the CEPT Conf rence Europ enne des Postes et Telecommunications European Postal and Telecommunications conference The Franco German R D cooperation demonstrated the technical feasibility and in a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between European countries that agreed to launch a commercial service by The first version of the GSM standard had pages The IEEE and RSE awarded Thomas Haug and Philippe Dupuis the James Clerk Maxwell medal for their contributions to the first digital mobile telephone standard In the GSM was used by over billion people in over countries The GSM G has evolved into G G and G The standardization body for GSM started at the CEPT Working Group GSM Group Special Mobile in under the umbrella of CEPT In ETSI was established and all CEPT standardization activities were transferred to ETSI Working Group GSM became Technical Committee GSM In it became Technical Committee SMG Special Mobile Group when ETSI tasked the committee with UMTS G In addition to transmitting voice over digital signals the G network introduced data services for mobile starting with SMS text messages then expanding to Multimedia Messaging Service MMS and mobile internet with a theoretical maximum transfer speed of kbit s kB s br br In the third generation G was launched in Japan by NTT DoCoMo on the WCDMA standard This was followed by G or G enhancements based on the high speed packet access HSPA family allowing UMTS networks to have higher data transfer speeds and capacity G is able to provide mobile broadband access of several Mbit s to smartphones and mobile modems in laptop computers This ensures it can be applied to mobile Internet access VoIP video calls and sending large e mail messages as well as watching videos typically in standard definition quality br By it had become clear that at some point G networks would be overwhelmed by the growth of bandwidth intensive applications such as streaming media Consequently the industry began looking to data optimized fourth generation G technologies with the promise of speed improvements up to tenfold over existing G technologies The first publicly available LTE service was launched in Scandinavia by TeliaSonera in In the s G technology has found diverse applications across various sectors showcasing its versatility in delivering high speed wireless communication such as mobile broadband the internet of things IoT fixed wireless access and multimedia streaming including music video radio and television br Deployment of fifth generation G cellular networks commenced worldwide in The term G was originally used in research papers and projects to denote the next major phase in mobile telecommunication standards beyond the G IMT Advanced standards The GPP defines G as any system that adheres to the G NR G New Radio standard G can be implemented in low band mid band or high band millimeter wave with download speeds that can achieve gigabit per second Gbit s range aiming for a network latency of ms This near real time responsiveness and improved overall data performance are crucial for applications like online gaming augmented and virtual reality autonomous vehicles IoT and critical communication services br br br Types br br br Smartphone br br Smartphones have a number of distinguishing features The International Telecommunication Union measures those with Internet connection which it calls Active Mobile Broadband subscriptions which includes tablets etc In the developed world smartphones have now overtaken the usage of earlier mobile systems However in the developing world they account for around of mobile telephony br br br Feature phone br br Feature phone is a term typically used as a retronym to describe mobile phones which are limited in capabilities in contrast to a modern smartphone Feature phones typically provide voice calling and text messaging functionality in addition to basic multimedia and Internet capabilities and other services offered by the user s wireless service provider A feature phone has additional functions over and above a basic mobile phone which is only capable of voice calling and text messaging Feature phones and basic mobile phones tend to use a proprietary custom designed software and user interface By contrast smartphones generally use a mobile operating system that often shares common traits across devices br br br Infrastructure br br The critical advantage that modern cellular networks have over predecessor systems is the concept of frequency reuse allowing many simultaneous telephone conversations in a given service area This allows efficient use of the limited radio spectrum allocated to mobile services and lets thousands of subscribers converse at the same time within a given geographic area br Former systems would cover a service area with one or two powerful base stations with a range of up to tens of kilometers miles using only a few sets of radio channels frequencies Once these few channels were in use by customers no further customers could be served until another user vacated a channel It would be impractical to give every customer a unique channel since there would not be enough bandwidth allocated to the mobile service As well technical limitations such as antenna efficiency and receiver design limit the range of frequencies a customer unit could use br A cellular network mobile phone system gets its name from dividing the service area into many small cells each with a base station with for example a useful range on the order of a kilometer mile These systems have dozens or hundreds of possible channels allocated to them When a subscriber is using a given channel for a telephone connection that frequency is unavailable for other customers in the local cell and in the adjacent cells However cells further away can re use that channel without interference as the subscriber s handset is too far away to be detected The transmitter power of each base station is coordinated to efficiently service its own cell but not to interfere with the cells further away br Automation embedded in the customer s handset and in the base stations control all phases of the call from detecting the presence of a handset in a service area temporary assignment of a channel to a handset making a call interface with the land line side of the network to connect to other subscribers and collection of billing information for the service The automation systems can control the hand off of a customer handset moving between one cell and another so that a call in progress continues without interruption changing channels if required In the earliest mobile phone systems by contrast all control was done manually the customer would search for an unoccupied channel and speak to a mobile operator to request connection of a call to a landline number or another mobile At the termination of the call the mobile operator would manually record the billing information br Mobile phones communicate with cell towers that are placed to give coverage across a telephone service area which is divided up into cells Each cell uses a different set of frequencies from neighboring cells and will typically be covered by three towers placed at different locations The cell towers are usually interconnected to each other and the phone network and the internet by wired connections Due to bandwidth limitations each cell will have a maximum number of cell phones it can handle at once The cells are therefore sized depending on the expected usage density and may be much smaller in cities In that case much lower transmitter powers are used to avoid broadcasting beyond the cell br In order to handle the high traffic multiple towers can be set up in the same area using different frequencies This can be done permanently or temporarily such as at special events or in disasters Cell phone companies will bring a truck with equipment to host the abnormally high traffic br Capacity was further increased when phone companies implemented digital networks With digital one frequency can host multiple simultaneous calls br Additionally short range Wi Fi infrastructure is often used by smartphones as much as possible as it offloads traffic from cell networks on to local area networks br br br Hardware br br The common components found on all mobile phones are br br A central processing unit CPU the processor of phones The CPU is a microprocessor fabricated on a metal oxide semiconductor MOS integrated circuit IC chip br A battery providing the power source for the phone functions A modern handset typically uses a lithium ion battery LIB whereas older handsets used nickel metal hydride Ni MH batteries br An input mechanism to allow the user to interact with the phone These are a keypad for feature phones and touch screens for most smartphones typically with capacitive sensing br A display which echoes the user s typing and displays text messages contacts and more The display is typically either a liquid crystal display LCD or organic light emitting diode OLED display br Speakers for sound br Subscriber identity module SIM cards and removable user identity module R UIM cards br A hardware notification LED on some phones br Low end mobile phones are often referred to as feature phones and offer basic telephony Handsets with more advanced computing ability through the use of native software applications are known as smartphones The first GSM phones and many feature phones had NOR flash memory from which processor instructions could be executed directly in an execute in place architecture and allowed for short boot times With smartphones NAND flash memory was adopted as it has larger storage capacities and lower costs but causes longer boot times because instructions cannot be executed from it directly and must be copied to RAM memory first before execution br br br Central processing unit br Mobile phones have central processing units CPUs similar to those in computers but optimised to operate in low power environments br Mobile CPU performance depends not only on the clock rate generally given in multiples of hertz but also the memory hierarchy also greatly affects overall performance Because of these problems the performance of mobile phone CPUs is often more appropriately given by scores derived from various standardized tests to measure the real effective performance in commonly used applications br br br Display br br One of the main characteristics of phones is the screen Depending on the device s type and design the screen fills most or nearly all of the space on a device s front surface Many smartphone displays have an aspect ratio of but taller aspect ratios became more common in br Screen sizes are often measured in diagonal inches or millimeters feature phones generally have screen sizes below millimetres in Phones with screens larger than millimetres in are often called phablets Smartphones with screens over millimetres in in size are commonly difficult to use with only a single hand since most thumbs cannot reach the entire screen surface they may need to be shifted around in the hand held in one hand and manipulated by the other or used in place with both hands Due to design advances some modern smartphones with large screen sizes and edge to edge designs have compact builds that improve their ergonomics while the shift to taller aspect ratios have resulted in phones that have larger screen sizes whilst maintaining the ergonomics associated with smaller displays br Liquid crystal displays are the most common others are IPS LED OLED and AMOLED displays Some displays are integrated with pressure sensitive digitizers such as those developed by Wacom and Samsung and Apple s D Touch system br br br Sound br In sound smartphones and feature phones vary little Some audio quality enhancing features such as Voice over LTE and HD Voice have appeared and are often available on newer smartphones Sound quality can remain a problem due to the design of the phone the quality of the cellular network and compression algorithms used in long distance calls Audio quality can be improved using a VoIP application over WiFi Cellphones have small speakers so that the user can use a speakerphone feature and talk to a person on the phone without holding it to their ear The small speakers can also be used to listen to digital audio files of music or speech or watch videos with an audio component without holding the phone close to the ear br br br Battery br The average phone battery lasts two three years at best Many of the wireless devices use a Lithium Ion Li Ion battery which charges times depending on how users take care of the battery and the charging techniques used It is only natural for these rechargeable batteries to chemically age which is why the performance of the battery when used for a year or two will begin to deteriorate Battery life can be extended by draining it regularly not overcharging it and keeping it away from heat br br br SIM card br br Mobile phones require a small microchip called a Subscriber Identity Module or SIM card in order to function The SIM card is approximately the size of a small postage stamp and is usually placed underneath the battery in the rear of the unit The SIM securely stores the service subscriber key IMSI and the Ki used to identify and authenticate the user of the mobile phone The SIM card allows users to change phones by simply removing the SIM card from one mobile phone and inserting it into another mobile phone or broadband telephony device provided that this is not prevented by a SIM lock The first SIM card was made in by Munich smart card maker Giesecke Devrient for the Finnish wireless network operator Radiolinja br A hybrid mobile phone can hold up to four SIM cards with a phone having a different device identifier for each SIM Card SIM and R UIM cards may be mixed together to allow both GSM and CDMA networks to be accessed From onwards such phones became popular in emerging markets and this was attributed to the desire to obtain the lowest calling costs br When the removal of a SIM card is detected by the operating system it may deny further operation until a reboot br br br Software br br br Software platforms br br Feature phones have basic software platforms Smartphones have advanced software platforms Android OS has been the best selling OS worldwide on smartphones since br br br Mobile app br br A mobile app is a computer program designed to run on a mobile device such as a smartphone The term app is a shortening of the term software application br br Messaging br br A common data application on mobile phones is Short Message Service SMS text messaging The first SMS message was sent from a computer to a mobile phone in in the UK while the first person to person SMS from phone to phone was sent in Finland in The first mobile news service delivered via SMS was launched in Finland in and subsequently many organizations provided on demand and instant news services by SMS Multimedia Messaging Service MMS was introduced in March br br br Application stores br br The introduction of Apple s App Store for the iPhone and iPod Touch in July popularized manufacturer hosted online distribution for third party applications software and computer programs focused on a single platform There are a huge variety of apps including video games music products and business tools Up until that point smartphone application distribution depended on third party sources providing applications for multiple platforms such as GetJar Handango Handmark and PocketGear Following the success of the App Store other smartphone manufacturers launched application stores such as Google s Android Market later renamed to the Google Play Store RIM s BlackBerry App World or Android related app stores like Aptoide Cafe Bazaar F Droid GetJar and Opera Mobile Store In February of mobile developers were targeting smartphones first for mobile app development br br br Sales br br br By manufacturer br br As of the top five manufacturers worldwide were Samsung Apple Xiaomi Oppo and Vivo br br History br From to Motorola was market leader in mobile phones Nokia was the market leader in mobile phones from to In Q Samsung surpassed Nokia selling million units as against Nokia s million units Samsung has retained its top position since then br Aside from Motorola European brands such as Nokia Siemens and Ericsson once held large sway over the global mobile phone market and many new technologies were pioneered in Europe By the influence of European companies had significantly decreased due to fierce competition from American and Asian companies to where most technical innovation had shifted Apple and Google both of the United States also came to dominate mobile phone software br br br By mobile phone operator br The world s largest individual mobile operator by number of subscribers is China Mobile which has over million mobile phone subscribers as of June Over mobile operators have over ten million subscribers each and over mobile operators had at least one million subscribers by the end of In there were more than seven billion mobile phone subscribers worldwide a number that is expected to keep growing br br br Use br br Mobile phones are used for a variety of purposes such as keeping in touch with family members for conducting business and in order to have access to a telephone in the event of an emergency Some people carry more than one mobile phone for different purposes such as for business and personal use Multiple SIM cards may be used to take advantage of the benefits of different calling plans For example a particular plan might provide for cheaper local calls long distance calls international calls or roaming br The mobile phone has been used in a variety of diverse contexts in society For example br br A study by Motorola found that one in ten mobile phone subscribers have a second phone that is often kept secret from other family members These phones may be used to engage in such activities as extramarital affairs or clandestine business dealings br Some organizations assist victims of domestic violence by providing mobile phones for use in emergencies These are often refurbished phones br The advent of widespread text messaging has resulted in the cell phone novel the first literary genre to emerge from the cellular age via text messaging to a website that collects the novels as a whole br Mobile telephony also facilitates activism and citizen journalism br The United Nations reported that mobile phones have spread faster than any other form of technology and can improve the livelihood of the poorest people in developing countries by providing access to information in places where landlines or the Internet are not available especially in the least developed countries Use of mobile phones also spawns a wealth of micro enterprises by providing such work as selling airtime on the streets and repairing or refurbishing handsets br In Mali and other African countries people used to travel from village to village to let friends and relatives know about weddings births and other events This can now be avoided in areas with mobile phone coverage which are usually more extensive than areas with just land line penetration br The TV industry has recently started using mobile phones to drive live TV viewing through mobile apps advertising social TV and mobile TV It is estimated that of Americans use their mobile phone while watching TV br In some parts of the world mobile phone sharing is common Cell phone sharing is prevalent in urban India as families and groups of friends often share one or more mobile phones among their members There are obvious economic benefits but often familial customs and traditional gender roles play a part It is common for a village to have access to only one mobile phone perhaps owned by a teacher or missionary which is available to all members of the village for necessary calls br Smartphones also have the use for individuals who suffer from diabetes There are apps for patients with diabetes to self monitor their blood sugar and can sync with flash monitors The apps have a feature to send automated feedback or possible warnings to other family members or healthcare providers in the case of an emergency br br br Content distribution br In one of the first examples of distributing and selling media content through the mobile phone was the sale of ringtones by Radiolinja in Finland Soon afterwards other media content appeared such as news video games jokes horoscopes TV content and advertising Most early content for mobile phones tended to be copies of legacy media such as banner advertisements or TV news highlight video clips Recently unique content for mobile phones has been emerging from ringtones and ringback tones to mobisodes video content that has been produced exclusively for mobile phones br br br Mobile banking and payment br br In many countries mobile phones are used to provide mobile banking services which may include the ability to transfer cash payments by secure SMS text message Kenya s M PESA mobile banking service for example allows customers of the mobile phone operator Safaricom to hold cash balances which are recorded on their SIM cards Cash can be deposited or withdrawn from M PESA accounts at Safaricom retail outlets located throughout the country and can be transferred electronically from person to person and used to pay bills to companies br Branchless banking has also been successful in South Africa and the Philippines A pilot project in Bali was launched in by the International Finance Corporation and an Indonesian bank Bank Mandiri br Mobile payments were first trialled in Finland in when two Coca Cola vending machines in Espoo were enabled to work with SMS payments Eventually the idea spread and in the Philippines launched the country s first commercial mobile payments systems with mobile operators Globe and Smart br Some mobile phones can make mobile payments via direct mobile billing schemes or through contactless payments if the phone and the point of sale support near field communication NFC Enabling contactless payments through NFC equipped mobile phones requires the co operation of manufacturers network operators and retail merchants br br br Mobile tracking br br Mobile phones are commonly used to collect location data While the phone is turned on the geographical location of a mobile phone can be determined easily whether it is being used or not using a technique known as multilateration to calculate the differences in time for a signal to travel from the mobile phone to each of several cell towers near the owner of the phone br The movements of a mobile phone user can be tracked by their service provider and if desired by law enforcement agencies and their governments Both the SIM card and the handset can be tracked br China has proposed using this technology to track the commuting patterns of Beijing city residents In the UK and US law enforcement and intelligence services use mobile phones to perform surveillance operations br Hackers have been able to track a phone s location read messages and record calls through obtaining a subscribers phone number br br br Electronic waste regulation br br Studies have shown that around of the environmental impact of mobile phones occurs during the manufacture of their printed wiring boards and integrated circuits br The average user replaces their mobile phone every to months and the discarded phones then contribute to electronic waste Mobile phone manufacturers within Europe are subject to the WEEE directive and Australia has introduced a mobile phone recycling scheme br Apple Inc had an advanced robotic disassembler and sorter called Liam specifically for recycling outdated or broken iPhones br br br Theft br According to the Federal Communications Commission one out of three robberies involve the theft of a cellular phone Police data in San Francisco show that half of all robberies in were thefts of cellular phones An online petition on Change org called Secure our Smartphones urged smartphone manufacturers to install kill switches in their devices to make them unusable if stolen The petition is part of a joint effort by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and San Francisco District Attorney George Gasc n and was directed to the CEOs of the major smartphone manufacturers and telecommunication carriers On June Apple announced that it would install a kill switch on its next iPhone operating system due to debut in October br All mobile phones have a unique identifier called IMEI Anyone can report their phone as lost or stolen with their Telecom Carrier and the IMEI would be blacklisted with a central registry Telecom carriers depending upon local regulation can or must implement blocking of blacklisted phones in their network There are however a number of ways to circumvent a blacklist One method is to send the phone to a country where the telecom carriers are not required to implement the blacklisting and sell it there another involves altering the phone s IMEI number Even so mobile phones typically have less value on the second hand market if the phones original IMEI is blacklisted br br br Conflict minerals br br Demand for metals used in mobile phones and other electronics fuelled the Second Congo War which claimed almost million lives In a news story The Guardian reported In unsafe mines deep underground in eastern Congo children are working to extract minerals essential for the electronics industry The profits from the minerals finance the bloodiest conflict since the second world war the war has lasted nearly years and has recently flared up again For the last years the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been a major source of natural resources for the mobile phone industry The company Fairphone has worked to develop a mobile phone that does not contain conflict minerals br br br Kosher phones br Due to concerns by the Orthodox Jewish rabbinate in Britain that texting by youths could waste time and lead to immodest communication the rabbinate recommended that phones with text messaging capability not be used by children to address this they gave their official approval to a brand of Kosher phones with no texting capabilities Although these phones are intended to prevent immodesty some vendors report good sales to adults who prefer the simplicity of the devices other Orthodox Jews question the need for them br In Israel similar phones to kosher phones with restricted features exist to observe the sabbath under Orthodox Judaism the use of any electrical device is generally prohibited during this time other than to save lives or reduce the risk of death or similar needs Such phones are approved for use by essential workers such as health security and public service workers br br br Restrictions br Restrictions on the use of mobile phones are applied in a number of different contexts often with the goal of health safety security or proper functioning of an establishment or as a matter of etiquette Such contexts include br br br While driving br br Mobile phone use while driving including talking on the phone texting or operating other phone features is common but controversial It is widely considered dangerous due to distracted driving Being distracted while operating a motor vehicle has been shown to increase the risk of accidents In September the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA reported that people were killed by drivers distracted by cell phones In March a US insurance company State Farm Insurance announced the results of a study which showed of drivers surveyed accessed the Internet on a smartphone while driving Many jurisdictions prohibit the use of mobile phones while driving In Egypt Israel Japan Portugal and Singapore both handheld and hands free use of a mobile phone which uses a speakerphone is banned In other countries including the UK and France and in many US states only handheld phone use is banned while hands free use is permitted br A study reported that over of college students surveyed text initiate reply or read while driving br The scientific literature on the dangers of driving while sending a text message from a mobile phone or texting while driving is limited A simulation study at the University of Utah found a sixfold increase in distraction related accidents when texting br Due to the increasing complexity of mobile phones they are often more like mobile computers in their available uses This has introduced additional difficulties for law enforcement officials when attempting to distinguish one usage from another in drivers using their devices This is more apparent in countries which ban both handheld and hands free usage rather than those which ban handheld use only as officials cannot easily tell which function of the mobile phone is being used simply by looking at the driver This can lead to drivers being stopped for using their device illegally for a phone call when in fact they were using the device legally for example when using the phone s incorporated controls for car stereo GPS or satnav br A study reviewed the incidence of mobile phone use while cycling and its effects on behaviour and safety In a national survey in the US reported the number of drivers who reported using their cellphones to access the Internet while driving had risen to nearly one of four A study conducted by the University of Vienna examined approaches for reducing inappropriate and problematic use of mobile phones such as using mobile phones while driving br Accidents involving a driver being distracted by talking on a mobile phone have begun to be prosecuted as negligence similar to speeding In the United Kingdom from February motorists who are caught using a hand held mobile phone while driving will have three penalty points added to their license in addition to the fine of This increase was introduced to try to stem the increase in drivers ignoring the law Japan prohibits all mobile phone use while driving including use of hands free devices New Zealand has banned hand held cell phone use since November Many states in the United States have banned texting on cell phones while driving Illinois became the th American state to enforce this law As of July states had banned texting while driving with Kentucky becoming the most recent addition on July br Public Health Law Research maintains a list of distracted driving laws in the United States This database of laws provides a comprehensive view of the provisions of laws that restrict the use of mobile communication devices while driving for all states and the District of Columbia between when first law was passed through December The dataset contains information on dichotomous continuous or categorical variables including for example activities regulated e g texting versus talking hands free versus handheld targeted populations and exemptions br br br On aircraft br br br While walking br br In an estimated pedestrians were injured in the US while using a cellphone and some jurisdictions have attempted to ban pedestrians from using their cellphones Other countries such as China and the Netherlands have introduced special lanes for smartphone users to help direct and manage them br br br In prisons br br br In hospitals br As of some hospitals had banned mobile devices due to a common misconception that their use would create significant electromagnetic interference br br br Health effects br br Screen time the amount of time using a device with a screen has become an issue for mobile phones since the adaptation of smartphones Research is being conducted to show the correlation between screen time and the mental and physical harm in child development To prevent harm some parents and even governments have placed restrictions on its usage br There have been rumors that mobile phone use can cause cancer but this is a myth br While there are rumors of mobile phones causing cancer there was a study conducted by International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC that stated the there could be an increase risk of brain tumors with the use of smartphones this is not confirmed They also stated that with the lack of data for the research and the usage periods of years will warrant further research for smartphones and the cause of brain tumors br br br Educational impact br br A study by the London School of Economics found that banning mobile phones in schools could increase pupils academic performance providing benefits equal to one extra week of schooling per year br br br Culture and popularity br br Mobile phones are considered an important human invention as it has been one of the most widely used and sold pieces of consumer technology They have also become culturally symbolic In Japanese mobile phone culture for example mobile phones are often decorated with charms They have also become fashion symbols at times The Motorola Razr V and LG Chocolate are two examples of devices that were popular for being fashionable while not necessarily focusing on the original purpose of mobile phones i e a device to provide mobile telephony br Some have also suggested that mobile phones or smartphones are a status symbol For example a research paper suggested that owning specifically an Apple iPhone was seen to be a status symbol br Text messaging which are performed on mobile phones has also led to the creation of SMS language It also led to the growing popularity of emojis br br br See also br br br Notes br br
