A zero turn riding lawn mower colloquially a z turn or zero turn is a standard riding lawn mower with a turning radius that is effectively zero when the two drive wheels rotate in opposite direction like a tank turning in place br Different brands and models achieve this in different ways with hydraulic speed control of each drive wheel being the most common method when a gasoline or diesel engine is used Battery powered models simply use two electric motors Both commercial duty and homeowner models exist with varying engine power options size of cutting decks and prices A z turn mower typically drives faster and costs more than a similarly sized conventional riding mower that has steerable front wheels br Most current models have four wheels two small swiveling front tires and two large drive tires in the back Bush Hog Inc of Selma Alabama mowers sometimes come with a small pivoting fifth wheel mounted in the center behind the driver Instead of controlling the swiveling tires to steer the machine the large drive tires rotate independently of each other based on the driver s input They may rotate in opposite directions The mower can pivot around a point midway between the drive wheels the classic z turn or it can pivot around either one of the drive wheels if one is stationary or it can turn in a circle of any radius Reversal of the direction of travel can be accomplished by causing both wheels to rotate in reverse br br br History br In Warrensburg MO resident Max B Swisher invented the very first commercially available zero turn mower and called it the Ride King It was a three wheeled machine one drive wheel in front and two in the rear The patented system had a driven front wheel that was capable of turning degrees The wheel was driven by the motor in the same direction at all times In order to reverse or utilize the zero turn capabilities the driver simply turned the steering wheel degrees and the mower would move backwards br In John Regier an employee at Hesston Corporation developed a zero turn lawnmower based on the company s agricultural swather which used a counter rotating belt and pulley mechanism to cut hay alfalfa and other farming materials and lay them out in windrows Regier s lawnmower used two independent drive levers instead of the steering wheel common on most riding mowers Regier s patent was eventually sold to Excel Industries the parent company of Hustler Turf and BigDog Mower Co br In the Dixon company coined the term zero turn radius on their entrance into the mower market br In the Hustler Zeon became the first fully electric zero turn mower with four volt lead acid batteries As of most fully electric zero turn mowers use lithium ion batteries ranging from to volts br As of there are more than three dozen zero turn mower manufacturers offering a range of mid mounted and out front mowing deck options and accessories br br br Steering br For most zero turn mowers today steering is simply changing the speeds of the drive tires a method called differential steering The tire speed is controlled by two levers that protrude on either side of the driver and typically extend over the lap aka lap bars It is not that different from steering a shopping cart When both levers are pushed forward simultaneously with the same force the mower moves forward when both levers are pulled back simultaneously with the same force the mower moves backward Push one lever more than the other and the mower makes a gentle turn Push one lever forward and pull the other back and the mower pivots from the drive wheels creating a zero radius turn br Zero turn mowers can use steering wheels but must be designed much differently For example Cub Cadet is one of the few zero turns to use a steering wheel by connecting the back wheels to an axle The axle is mounted in its midpoint to the body of the mower br br br Operation br Zero turn mowers are designed to cut so closely around obstacles that there is virtually no need to trim These mowers pivot through degrees without leaving any uncut grass Maximum lever movement means maximum fluid flow which translates into a rapidly turning wheel If one drive wheel turns more rapidly than the other the machine moves along a curved path If both wheels turn at the same speed the machine follows a straight path If one wheel stops and the other turns or if the wheels turn in opposite directions the mower pivots br This drive system can be used on two types of zero turn mowers br br Mid mount where the mower is suspended under a wheel chassis with front caster wheels and rear drive wheels br Out front where the mower is front mounted and thus terrain following providing a higher level of balance comfort safety and performance The Out front models use a centralised main drive wheel system with front and rear caster wheels br As both types use traction only as a steering system care must be taken on any sloping terrain Loss of traction causes total loss of steering br br br
