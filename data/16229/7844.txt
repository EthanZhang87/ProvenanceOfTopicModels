The chimpanzee Pan troglodytes also simply known as the chimp is a species of great ape native to the forests and savannahs of tropical Africa It has four confirmed subspecies and a fifth proposed one When its close relative the bonobo was more commonly known as the pygmy chimpanzee this species was often called the common chimpanzee or the robust chimpanzee The chimpanzee and the bonobo are the only species in the genus Pan Evidence from fossils and DNA sequencing shows that Pan is a sister taxon to the human lineage and is thus humans closest living relative The chimpanzee is covered in coarse black hair but has a bare face fingers toes palms of the hands and soles of the feet It is larger and more robust than the bonobo weighing kg lb for males and kg lb for females and standing cm ft in br The chimpanzee lives in groups that range in size from to members although individuals travel and forage in much smaller groups during the day The species lives in a strict male dominated hierarchy where disputes are generally settled without the need for violence Nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded using tools modifying sticks rocks grass and leaves and using them for hunting and acquiring honey termites ants nuts and water The species has also been found creating sharpened sticks to spear small mammals Its gestation period is eight months The infant is weaned at about three years old but usually maintains a close relationship with its mother for several years more br The chimpanzee is listed on the IUCN Red List as an endangered species Between and individuals are estimated across its range The biggest threats to the chimpanzee are habitat loss poaching and disease Chimpanzees appear in Western popular culture as stereotyped clown figures and have featured in entertainments such as chimpanzees tea parties circus acts and stage shows Although many chimpanzees have been kept as pets their strength aggressiveness and unpredictability makes them dangerous in this role Some hundreds have been kept in laboratories for research especially in the United States Many attempts have been made to teach languages such as American Sign Language to chimpanzees with limited success br br br Etymology br br The English word chimpanzee is first recorded in It is derived from Vili ci mpenze or Tshiluba language chimpenze with a meaning of ape or mockman The colloquialism chimp was most likely coined some time in the late s The genus name Pan derives from the Greek god while the specific name troglodytes was taken from the Troglodytae a mythical race of cave dwellers br br br Taxonomy br The first great ape known to Western science in the th century was the orang outang genus Pongo the local Malay name being recorded in Java by the Dutch physician Jacobus Bontius In the Dutch anatomist Nicolaes Tulp applied the name to a chimpanzee or bonobo brought to the Netherlands from Angola Another Dutch anatomist Peter Camper dissected specimens from Central Africa and Southeast Asia in the s noting the differences between the African and Asian apes The German naturalist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach classified the chimpanzee as Simia troglodytes by Another German naturalist Lorenz Oken coined the genus Pan in The bonobo was recognised as distinct from the chimpanzee by br br br Evolution br br Despite a large number of Homo fossil finds Pan fossils were not described until Existing chimpanzee populations in West and Central Africa do not overlap with the major human fossil sites in East Africa but chimpanzee fossils have now been reported from Kenya This indicates that both humans and members of the Pan clade were present in the East African Rift Valley during the Middle Pleistocene br According to studies published in by researchers at George Washington University bonobos along with chimpanzees split from the human line about million years ago then bonobos split from the common chimpanzee line about million years ago Another genetic study suggests ancient gene flow introgression between and years ago from the bonobo into the ancestors of central and eastern chimpanzees br br br Subspecies and population status br Four subspecies of the chimpanzee have been recognised with the possibility of a fifth br br Central chimpanzee or the tschego Pan troglodytes troglodytes found in Cameroon the Central African Republic Equatorial Guinea Gabon the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo with about individuals existing in the wild br Western chimpanzee P troglodytes verus found in Ivory Coast Guinea Liberia Mali Sierra Leone Guinea Bissau Senegal and Ghana with about individuals still in existence br Nigeria Cameroon chimpanzee P troglodytes ellioti also known as P t vellerosus that live within forested areas across Nigeria and Cameroon with individuals still in existence br Eastern chimpanzee P troglodytes schweinfurthii found in the Central African Republic South Sudan the Democratic Republic of the Congo Uganda Rwanda Burundi Tanzania and Zambia with approximately individuals still existing in the wild br Southeastern chimpanzee P troglodytes marungensis in Burundi Rwanda Tanzania and Uganda Colin Groves argues that this is a subspecies created by enough variation between the northern and southern populations of P t schweinfurthii but it is not recognised by the IUCN br br br Genome br br A draft version of the chimpanzee genome was published in and encodes proteins compared to in the human proteome The DNA sequences of humans and chimpanzees are very similar and the difference in protein number mostly arises from incomplete sequences in the chimpanzee genome Both species differ by about million single nucleotide changes five million insertion deletion events and various chromosomal rearrangements Typical human and chimpanzee protein homologs differ in an average of only two amino acids About of all human proteins are identical in sequence to the corresponding chimpanzee protein Duplications of small parts of chromosomes have been the major source of differences between human and chimpanzee genetic material about of the corresponding modern genomes represent differences produced by gene duplications or deletions since humans and chimpanzees diverged from their common evolutionary ancestor br br br Characteristics br br Adult chimpanzees have an average standing height of cm ft in Wild adult males weigh between and kg and lb with females weighing between and kg and lb In exceptional cases certain individuals may considerably exceed these measurements standing over cm ft in on two legs and weighing up to kg lb in captivity br The chimpanzee is more robustly built than the bonobo but less than the gorilla The arms of a chimpanzee are longer than its legs and can reach below the knees The hands have long fingers with short thumbs and flat fingernails The feet are adapted for grasping and the big toe is opposable The pelvis is long with an extended ilium A chimpanzee s head is rounded with a prominent and prognathous face and a pronounced brow ridge It has forward facing eyes a small nose rounded non lobed ears and a long mobile upper lip Additionally adult males have sharp canine teeth Like all great apes it has a dental formula of that is two incisors one canine two premolars and three molars on both halves of each jaw Chimpanzees lack the prominent sagittal crest and associated head and neck musculature of gorillas br br Chimpanzee bodies are covered by coarse hair except for the face fingers toes palms of the hands and soles of the feet Chimpanzees lose more hair as they age and develop bald spots The hair of a chimpanzee is typically black but can be brown or ginger As they get older white or grey patches may appear particularly on the chin and lower region Chimpanzee skin that is covered with body hair is white while exposed areas vary white which ages into a dark muddy colour in eastern chimpanzees freckled on white which ages to a heavily mottled muddy colour in central chimpanzees and black with a butterfly shaped white mask that darkens with age in western chimpanzees Facial pigmentation increases with age and exposure to ultraviolet light Females develop swelling pink skin when in oestrus br Chimpanzees are adapted for both arboreal and terrestrial locomotion Arboreal locomotion consists of vertical climbing and brachiation On the ground chimpanzees move both quadrupedally and bipedally These movements appear to have similar energy costs As with bonobos and gorillas chimpanzees move quadrupedally by knuckle walking which probably evolved independently in Pan and Gorilla Their muscles are stronger per weight than those of humans due to higher content of fast twitch muscle fibres one of the chimpanzee s adaptations for climbing and swinging According to Japan s Asahiyama Zoo the grip strength of an adult chimpanzee is estimated to be kg lb while other sources claim figures of up to kg lb br br br Ecology br br The chimpanzee is a highly adaptable species It lives in a variety of habitats including dry savanna evergreen rainforest montane forest swamp forest and dry woodland savanna mosaic In Gombe the chimpanzee mostly uses semideciduous and evergreen forest as well as open woodland At Bossou the chimpanzee inhabits multistage secondary deciduous forest which has grown after shifting cultivation as well as primary forest and grassland At Ta it is found in the last remaining tropical rain forest in Ivory Coast The chimpanzee has an advanced cognitive map of its home range and can repeatedly find food The chimpanzee builds a sleeping nest in a tree in a different location each night never using the same nest more than once Chimpanzees sleep alone in separate nests except for infants or juvenile chimpanzees which sleep with their mothers br br br Diet br br The chimpanzee is an omnivorous frugivore It prefers fruit above all other food items but also eats leaves leaf buds seeds blossoms stems pith bark and resin A study in Budongo Forest Uganda found that of their feeding time concentrated on fruits of which being ripe particularly those from two species of Ficus Maesopsis eminii and Celtis gomphophylla In addition of feeding time was spent on arboreal leaves mostly Broussonetia papyrifera and Celtis mildbraedii While the chimpanzee is mostly herbivorous it does eat honey soil insects birds and their eggs and small to medium sized mammals including other primates Insect species consumed include the weaver ant Oecophylla longinoda Macrotermes termites and honey bees The red colobus ranks at the top of preferred mammal prey Other mammalian prey include red tailed monkeys infant and juvenile yellow baboons bush babies blue duikers bushbucks and common warthogs br Despite the fact that chimpanzees are known to hunt and to collect both insects and other invertebrates such food actually makes up a very small portion of their diet from as little as yearly to as much as grams of animal flesh per day for each adult chimpanzee in peak hunting seasons This also varies from troop to troop and year to year However in all cases the majority of their diet consists of fruits leaves roots and other plant matter Female chimpanzees appear to consume much less animal flesh than males according to several studies Jane Goodall documented many occasions within Gombe Stream National Park of chimpanzees and western red colobus monkeys ignoring each other despite close proximity br Chimpanzees do not appear to directly compete with gorillas in areas where they overlap When fruit is abundant gorilla and chimpanzee diets converge but when fruit is scarce gorillas resort to vegetation The two apes may also feed on different species whether fruit or insects Interactions between them can range from friendly and even stable social bonding to avoidance to aggression and even predation of infants on the part of chimpanzees br br br Mortality and health br br The average lifespan of a chimpanzee in the wild is relatively short usually less than years although individuals that reach years may live an additional years On rare occasions wild chimpanzees may live nearly years Captive chimpanzees tend to live longer than most wild ones with median lifespans of years for males and years for females The oldest known male captive chimpanzee to have been documented lived to years and the oldest female Little Mama was over years old br Leopards prey on chimpanzees in some areas It is possible that much of the mortality caused by leopards can be attributed to individuals that have specialised in killing chimpanzees Chimpanzees may react to a leopard s presence with loud vocalising branch shaking and throwing objects There is at least one record of chimpanzees killing a leopard cub after mobbing it and its mother in their den Four chimpanzees could have fallen prey to lions at Mahale Mountains National Park Although no other instances of lion predation on chimpanzees have been recorded lions likely do kill chimpanzees occasionally and the larger group sizes of savanna chimpanzees may have developed as a response to threats from these big cats Chimpanzees may react to lions by fleeing up trees vocalising or hiding in silence br br Chimpanzees and humans share only of their parasite and microbe species This is due to the differences in environmental and dietary adaptations human internal parasite species overlap more with omnivorous savanna dwelling baboons The chimpanzee is host to the louse species Pediculus schaeffi a close relative of P humanus which infests human head and body hair By contrast the human pubic louse Pthirus pubis is closely related to Pthirus gorillae which infests gorillas A study of gastrointestinal parasites of wild chimpanzees in degraded forest in Uganda found nine species of protozoa five nematodes one cestode and one trematode The most prevalent species was the protozoan Troglodytella abrassarti br br br Behaviour br Recent studies have suggested that human observers influence chimpanzee behaviour One suggestion is that drones camera traps and remote microphones should be used to record and monitor chimpanzees rather than direct human observation br br br Group structure br br Chimpanzees live in communities that typically range from around to more than members but spend most of their time traveling in small temporary groups consisting of a few individuals These groups may consist of any combination of age and sexes Both males and females sometimes travel alone This fission fusion society may include groups of four types all male adult females and offspring adults of both sexes or one female and her offspring These smaller groups emerge in a variety of types for a variety of purposes For example an all male troop may be organised to hunt for meat while a group consisting of lactating females serves to act as a nursery group for the young br At the core of social structures are males which patrol the territory protect group members and search for food Males remain in their natal communities while females generally emigrate at adolescence Males in a community are more likely to be related to one another than females are to each other Among males there is generally a dominance hierarchy and males are dominant over females However this unusual fission fusion social structure in which portions of the parent group may on a regular basis separate from and then rejoin the rest is highly variable in terms of which particular individual chimpanzees congregate at a given time This is caused mainly by the large measure of individual autonomy that individuals have within their fission fusion social groups As a result individual chimpanzees often forage for food alone or in smaller groups as opposed to the much larger parent group which encompasses all the chimpanzees which regularly come into contact with each other and congregate into parties in a particular area br br Male chimpanzees exist in a linear dominance hierarchy Top ranking males tend to be aggressive even during dominance stability This is probably due to the chimpanzee s fission fusion society with male chimpanzees leaving groups and returning after extended periods of time With this a dominant male is unsure if any political maneuvering has occurred in his absence and must re establish his dominance Thus a large amount of aggression occurs within five to fifteen minutes after a reunion During these encounters displays of aggression are generally preferred over physical attacks br Males maintain and improve their social ranks by forming coalitions which have been characterised as exploitative and based on an individual s influence in agonistic interactions Being in a coalition allows males to dominate a third individual when they could not by themselves as politically apt chimpanzees can exert power over aggressive interactions regardless of their rank Coalitions can also give an individual male the confidence to challenge a dominant or larger male The more allies a male has the better his chance of becoming dominant However most changes in hierarchical rank are caused by dyadic interactions Chimpanzee alliances can be very fickle and one member may suddenly turn on another if it is to his advantage br br Low ranking males frequently switch sides in disputes between more dominant individuals Low ranking males benefit from an unstable hierarchy and often find increased sexual opportunities if a dispute or conflict occurs In addition conflicts between dominant males cause them to focus on each other rather than the lower ranking males Social hierarchies among adult females tend to be weaker Nevertheless the status of an adult female may be important for her offspring Females in Ta have also been recorded to form alliances While chimpanzee social structure is often referred to as patriarchal it is not entirely unheard of for females to forge coalitions against males There is also at least one recorded case of females securing a dominant position over males in their respective troop albeit in a captive environment Social grooming appears to be important in the formation and maintenance of coalitions It is more common among adult males than either between adult females or between males and females br br Chimpanzees have been described as highly territorial and will frequently kill other chimpanzees although Margaret Power wrote in her book The Egalitarians that the field studies from which the aggressive data came Gombe and Mahale used artificial feeding systems that increased aggression in the chimpanzee populations studied Thus the behaviour may not reflect innate characteristics of the species as a whole In the years following her artificial feeding conditions at Gombe Jane Goodall described groups of male chimpanzees patrolling the borders of their territory brutally attacking chimpanzees that had split off from the Gombe group A study published in found that the chimpanzees wage wars over territory not mates Patrols from smaller groups are more likely to avoid contact with their neighbours Patrols from large groups even take over a smaller group s territory gaining access to more resources food and females While it was traditionally accepted that only female chimpanzees immigrate and males remain in their natal troop for life there are confirmed cases of adult males safely integrating themselves into new communities among West African chimpanzees suggesting they are less territorial than other subspecies br br br Mating and parenting br br Chimpanzees mate throughout the year although the number of females in oestrus varies seasonally in a group Female chimpanzees are more likely to come into oestrus when food is readily available Oestrous females exhibit sexual swellings Chimpanzees are promiscuous during oestrus females mate with several males in their community while males have large testicles for sperm competition Other forms of mating also exist A community s dominant males sometimes restrict reproductive access to females A male and female can form a consortship and mate outside their community In addition females sometimes leave their community and mate with males from neighboring communities These alternative mating strategies give females more mating opportunities without losing the support of the males in their community Infanticide has been recorded in chimpanzee communities in some areas and the victims are often consumed Male chimpanzees practice infanticide on unrelated young to shorten the interbirth intervals in the females Females sometimes practice infanticide This may be related to the dominance hierarchy in females or may simply be pathological br Inbreeding was studied in a relatively undisturbed eastern bisexual chimpanzee community Despite an increased inbreeding risk incurred by females who do not disperse before reaching reproductive age these females were still able to avoid producing inbred offspring br Copulation is brief lasting approximately seven seconds The gestation period is eight months Care for the young is provided mostly by their mothers The survival and emotional health of the young is dependent on maternal care Mothers provide their young with food warmth and protection and teach them certain skills In addition a chimpanzee s future rank may be dependent on its mother s status Male chimpanzees continue to associate with the females they impregnated and interact with and support their offspring Newborn chimpanzees are helpless For example their grasping reflex is not strong enough to support them for more than a few seconds For their first days infants cling to their mother s bellies Infants are unable to support their own weight for their first two months and need their mothers support br When they reach five to six months infants ride on their mothers backs They remain in continual contact for the rest of their first year When they reach two years of age they are able to move and sit independently and start moving beyond the arms reach of their mothers By four to six years chimpanzees are weaned and infancy ends The juvenile period for chimpanzees lasts from their sixth to ninth years Juveniles remain close to their mothers but interact an increasing amount with other members of their community Adolescent females move between groups and are supported by their mothers in agonistic encounters Adolescent males spend time with adult males in social activities like hunting and boundary patrolling A captive study suggests males can safely immigrate to a new group if accompanied by immigrant females who have an existing relationship with this male This gives the resident males reproductive advantages with these females as they are more inclined to remain in the group if their male friend is also accepted br br br Communication br br Chimpanzees use facial expressions postures and sounds to communicate with each other Chimpanzees have expressive faces that are important in close up communications When frightened a full closed grin causes nearby individuals to be fearful as well Playful chimpanzees display an open mouthed grin Chimpanzees may also express themselves with the pout which is made in distress the sneer which is made when threatening or fearful and compressed lips face which is a type of display When submitting to a dominant individual a chimpanzee crunches bobs and extends a hand When in an aggressive mode a chimpanzee swaggers bipedally hunched over and arms waving in an attempt to exaggerate its size While travelling chimpanzees keep in contact by beating their hands and feet against the trunks of large trees an act that is known as drumming They also do this when encountering individuals from other communities br Vocalisations are also important in chimpanzee communication The most common call in adults is the pant hoot which may signal social rank and bond along with keeping groups together Pant hoots are made of four parts starting with soft hoos the introduction that gets louder and louder the build up and climax into screams and sometimes barks these die down back to soft hoos during the letdown phase as the call ends Grunting is made in situations like feeding and greeting Submissive individuals make pant grunts towards their superiors Whimpering is made by young chimpanzees as a form of begging or when lost from the group Chimpanzees use distance calls to draw attention to danger food sources or other community members Barks may be made as short barks when hunting and tonal barks when sighting large snakes br br br Hunting br When hunting small monkeys such as the red colobus chimpanzees hunt where the forest canopy is interrupted or irregular This allows them to easily corner the monkeys when chasing them in the appropriate direction Chimpanzees may also hunt as a coordinated team so that they can corner their prey even in a continuous canopy During an arboreal hunt each chimpanzee in the hunting groups has a role Drivers serve to keep the prey running in a certain direction and follow them without attempting to make a catch Blockers are stationed at the bottom of the trees and climb up to block prey that takes off in a different direction Chasers move quickly and try to make a catch Finally ambushers hide and rush out when a monkey nears While both adults and infants are taken adult male colobus monkeys will attack the hunting chimps When caught and killed the meal is distributed to all hunting party members and even bystanders br Male chimpanzees hunt in groups more than females Female chimpanzees tend to hunt solitarily If a female chimpanzee were to participate in the hunting group and catch a Red Colobus it would likely immediately be taken by an adult male Female chimpanzees are estimated to hunt of a community s vertebrates br br br Intelligence br br Chimpanzees display numerous signs of intelligence from the ability to remember symbols to cooperation tool use and varied language capabilities They are among species that have passed the mirror test suggesting self awareness In one study two young chimpanzees showed retention of mirror self recognition after one year without access to mirrors Chimpanzees have been observed to use insects to treat their own wounds and those of others They catch them and apply them directly to the injury Chimpanzees also display signs of culture among groups with the learning and transmission of variations in grooming tool use and foraging techniques leading to localized traditions br A year study at Kyoto University s Primate Research Institute has shown that chimpanzees are able to learn to recognise the numbers to and their values The chimpanzees further show an aptitude for eidetic memory demonstrated in experiments in which the jumbled digits are flashed onto a computer screen for less than a quarter of a second One chimpanzee Ayumu was able to correctly and quickly point to the positions where they appeared in ascending order Ayumu performed better than human adults who were given the same test br In controlled experiments on cooperation chimpanzees show a basic understanding of cooperation and recruit the best collaborators In a group setting with a device that delivered food rewards only to cooperating chimpanzees cooperation first increased then due to competitive behaviour decreased before finally increasing to the highest level through punishment and other arbitrage behaviours br Great apes show laughter like vocalisations in response to physical contact such as wrestling play chasing or tickling This is documented in wild and captive chimpanzees Chimpanzee laughter is not readily recognisable to humans as such because it is generated by alternating inhalations and exhalations that sound more like breathing and panting Instances in which nonhuman primates have expressed joy have been reported Humans and chimpanzees share similar ticklish areas of the body such as the armpits and belly The enjoyment of tickling in chimpanzees does not diminish with age br Chimpanzees have displayed different behaviours in response to a dying or dead group member When witnessing a sudden death the other group members act in frenzy with vocalisations aggressive displays and touching of the corpse In one case chimpanzees cared for a dying elder then attended and cleaned the corpse Afterward they avoided the spot where the elder died and behaved in a more subdued manner Mothers have been reported to carry around and groom their dead infants for several days br Experimenters now and then witness behaviour that cannot be readily reconciled with chimpanzee intelligence or theory of mind Wolfgang K hler for instance reported insightful behaviour in chimpanzees but he likewise often observed that they experienced special difficulty in solving simple problems Researchers also reported that when faced with a choice between two persons chimpanzees were just as likely to beg food from a person who could see the begging gesture as from a person who could not thereby raising the possibility that chimpanzees lack theory of mind br br br Tool use br br Nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded using tools They modify sticks rocks grass and leaves and use them when foraging for termites and ants nuts honey algae or water Despite the lack of complexity forethought and skill are apparent in making these tools Chimpanzees have used stone tools since at least years ago br A chimpanzee from the Kasakela chimpanzee community was the first nonhuman animal reported making a tool by modifying a twig to use as an instrument for extracting termites from their mound At Ta chimpanzees simply use their hands to extract termites When foraging for honey chimpanzees use modified short sticks to scoop the honey out of the hive if the bees are stingless For hives of the dangerous African honeybees chimpanzees use longer and thinner sticks to extract the honey br Chimpanzees also fish for ants using the same tactic Ant dipping is difficult and some chimpanzees never master it West African chimpanzees crack open hard nuts with stones or branches Some forethought in this activity is apparent as these tools are not found together or where the nuts are collected Nut cracking is also difficult and must be learned Chimpanzees also use leaves as sponges or spoons to drink water br West African chimpanzees in Senegal were found to sharpen sticks with their teeth which were then used to spear Senegal bushbabies out of small holes in trees An eastern chimpanzee has been observed using a modified branch as a tool to capture a squirrel br Whilst experimental studies on captive chimpanzees have found that many of their species typical tool use behaviours can be individually learnt by each chimpanzees a study on their abilities to make and use stone flakes in a similar way as hypothesised for early hominins did not find this behaviour across two populations of chimpanzees suggesting that this behaviour is outside the chimpanzee species typical range br br br Language br br Scientists have attempted to teach human language to several species of great ape One early attempt by Allen and Beatrix Gardner in the s involved spending months teaching American Sign Language to a chimpanzee named Washoe The Gardners reported that Washoe learned signs and had spontaneously taught them to other chimpanzees including her adopted son Loulis Over a longer period of time Washoe was reported to have learned over signs br Debate is ongoing among scientists such as David Premack about chimpanzees ability to learn language Since the early reports on Washoe numerous other studies have been conducted with varying levels of success One involved a chimpanzee jokingly named Nim Chimpsky in allusion to the theorist of language Noam Chomsky trained by Herbert Terrace of Columbia University Although his initial reports were quite positive in November Terrace and his team including psycholinguist Thomas Bever re evaluated the videotapes of Nim with his trainers analyzing them frame by frame for signs as well as for exact context what was happening both before and after Nim s signs In the reanalysis Terrace and Bever concluded that Nim s utterances could be explained merely as prompting on the part of the experimenters as well as mistakes in reporting the data Much of the apes behaviour is pure drill he said Language still stands as an important definition of the human species In this reversal Terrace now argued Nim s use of ASL was not like human language acquisition Nim never initiated conversations himself rarely introduced new words and mostly imitated what the humans did More importantly Nim s word strings varied in their ordering suggesting that he was incapable of syntax Nim s sentences also did not grow in length unlike human children whose vocabulary and sentence length show a strong positive correlation br br br Human relations br br br In culture br br Chimpanzees are rarely represented in African culture as people find their resemblance to humans discomforting The Gio people of Liberia and the Hemba people of the Congo make chimpanzee masks Gio masks are crude and blocky and worn when teaching young people how not to behave The Hemba masks have a smile that suggests drunken anger insanity or horror and are worn during rituals at funerals representing the awful reality of death The masks may also serve to guard households and protect both human and plant fertility Stories have been told of chimpanzees kidnapping and raping women br In Western popular culture chimpanzees have occasionally been stereotyped as childlike companions sidekicks or clowns They are especially suited for the latter role on account of their prominent facial features long limbs and fast movements which humans often find amusing Accordingly entertainment acts featuring chimpanzees dressed up as humans with lip synchronised human voices have been traditional staples of circuses stage shows and TV shows like Lancelot Link Secret Chimp and The Chimp Channel From until London Zoo followed by several other zoos around the world held a chimpanzees tea party daily inspiring a long running series of advertisements for PG Tips tea featuring such a party Animal rights groups have urged a stop to such acts considering them abusive br br Chimpanzees in media include Judy on the television series Daktari in the s and Darwin on The Wild Thornberrys in the s In contrast to the fictional depictions of other animals such as dogs as in Lassie dolphins Flipper horses The Black Stallion or even other great apes King Kong chimpanzee characters and actions are rarely relevant to the plot Depictions of chimpanzees as individuals rather than stock characters and as central rather than incidental to the plot can be found in science fiction Robert A Heinlein s short story Jerry Was a Man concerns a genetically enhanced chimpanzee suing for better treatment The film Conquest of the Planet of the Apes the third sequel of the film Planet of the Apes portrays a futuristic revolt of enslaved apes led by the only talking chimpanzee Caesar against their human masters br br br As pets br Chimpanzees have traditionally been kept as pets in a few African villages especially in the Democratic Republic of Congo In Virunga National Park in the east of the country the park authorities regularly confiscate chimpanzees from people keeping them as pets Outside their range chimpanzees are popular as exotic pets despite their strength and aggression Even in places where keeping non human primates as pets is illegal the exotic pet trade continues to prosper leading to injuries from attacks br br br Use in research br br Hundreds of chimpanzees have been kept in laboratories for research Most such laboratories either conduct or make the animals available for invasive research defined as inoculation with an infectious agent surgery or biopsy conducted for the sake of research and not for the sake of the chimpanzee and or drug testing Research chimpanzees tend to be used repeatedly over decades for up to years unlike the pattern of use of most laboratory animals Two federally funded American laboratories use chimpanzees the Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University in Atlanta Georgia and the Southwest National Primate Center in San Antonio Texas Five hundred chimpanzees have been retired from laboratory use in the US and live in animal sanctuaries in the US or Canada br A five year moratorium was imposed by the US National Institutes of Health in because too many chimpanzees had been bred for HIV research and it has been extended annually since With the publication of the chimpanzee genome plans to increase the use of chimpanzees in America were reportedly increasing in some scientists arguing that the federal moratorium on breeding chimpanzees for research should be lifted However in the NIH made the moratorium permanent br br Other researchers argue that chimpanzees either should not be used in research or should be treated differently for instance with legal status as persons Pascal Gagneux an evolutionary biologist and primate expert at the University of California San Diego argues given chimpanzees sense of self tool use and genetic similarity to human beings studies using chimpanzees should follow the ethical guidelines used for human subjects unable to give consent A recent study suggests chimpanzees which are retired from labs exhibit a form of post traumatic stress disorder Stuart Zola director of the Yerkes laboratory disagrees He told National Geographic I don t think we should make a distinction between our obligation to treat humanely any species whether it s a rat or a monkey or a chimpanzee No matter how much we may wish it chimps are not human br Only one European laboratory the Biomedical Primate Research Centre in Rijswijk the Netherlands used chimpanzees in research It formerly held chimpanzees among non human primates The Dutch ministry of science decided to phase out research at the centre from Trials already under way were however allowed to run their course Chimpanzees including the female Ai have been studied at the Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University Japan formerly directed by Tetsuro Matsuzawa since chimpanzees are currently held at the facility br Two chimpanzees have been sent into outer space as NASA research subjects Ham the first great ape in space was launched in the Mercury Redstone capsule on January and survived the suborbital flight Enos the third primate to orbit Earth after Soviet cosmonauts Yuri Gagarin and Gherman Titov flew on Mercury Atlas on November of the same year br br br Field study br br Jane Goodall undertook the first long term field study of the chimpanzee begun in Tanzania at Gombe Stream National Park in Other long term studies begun in the s include Adriaan Kortlandt s in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and Toshisada Nishida s in Mahale Mountains National Park in Tanzania Current understanding of the species typical behaviours and social organisation has been formed largely from Goodall s ongoing year Gombe research study br br br Attacks br Chimpanzees have attacked humans In Uganda several attacks on children have happened some of them fatal Some of these attacks may have been due to the chimpanzees being intoxicated from alcohol obtained from rural brewing operations and becoming aggressive towards humans Human interactions with chimpanzees may be especially dangerous if the chimpanzees perceive humans as potential rivals At least six cases of chimpanzees snatching and eating human babies are documented br A chimpanzee s strength and sharp teeth mean that attacks even on adult humans can cause severe injuries This was evident after the attack and near death of former NASCAR driver St James Davis who was mauled by two escaped chimpanzees while he and his wife were celebrating the birthday of their former pet chimpanzee Another example of chimpanzees being aggressive toward humans occurred in in Stamford Connecticut when a kilogram lb year old pet chimpanzee named Travis attacked his owner s friend who lost her hands eyes nose and part of her maxilla from the attack br br br Human immunodeficiency virus br Two primary classes of human immunodeficiency virus HIV infect humans HIV and HIV HIV is the more virulent and easily transmitted and is the source of the majority of HIV infections throughout the world HIV occurs mostly in west Africa Both types originated in west and central Africa jumping from other primates to humans HIV has evolved from a simian immunodeficiency virus SIVcpz found in the subspecies P t troglodytes of southern Cameroon Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo has the greatest genetic diversity of HIV so far discovered suggesting the virus has been there longer than anywhere else HIV crossed species from a different strain of HIV found in the sooty mangabey monkeys in Guinea Bissau br br br Conservation br br The chimpanzee is on the IUCN Red List as an endangered species Chimpanzees are legally protected in most of their range and are found both in and outside national parks Between and individuals are thought to be living in the wild a decrease from about a million chimpanzees in the early s Chimpanzees are listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species CITES meaning that commercial international trade in wild sourced specimens is prohibited and all other international trade including in parts and derivatives is regulated by the CITES permitting system br The biggest threats to the chimpanzee are habitat destruction poaching and disease Chimpanzee habitats have been limited by deforestation in both West and Central Africa Road building has caused habitat degradation and fragmentation of chimpanzee populations and may allow poachers more access to areas that had not been seriously affected by humans Although deforestation rates are low in western Central Africa selective logging may take place outside national parks br Chimpanzees are a common target for poachers In Ivory Coast chimpanzees make up of bushmeat sold in urban markets They are also taken often illegally for the pet trade and are hunted for medicinal purposes in some areas Farmers sometimes kill chimpanzees that threaten their crops others are unintentionally maimed or killed by snares meant for other animals br Infectious diseases are a main cause of death for chimpanzees They succumb to many diseases that afflict humans
