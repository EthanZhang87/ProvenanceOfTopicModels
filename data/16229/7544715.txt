An electronic centralised aircraft monitoring ECAM or electronic centralized aircraft monitoring is a system that monitors aircraft functions and relays them to the pilots It also produces messages detailing failures and in certain cases lists procedures to undertake to correct the problem br br br History br ECAM is similar to other systems known as Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System EICAS used by Boeing Bombardier COMAC Dornier Embraer Saab and Xi an Centralized Fault Detection System CFDS on McDonnell Douglas or Engine Warning Display EWD on ATR which display data concerning aircraft systems and also failures Airbus developed ECAM such that it not only provided the features of EICAS but also displayed corrective action to be taken by the pilot as well as system limitations after the failures Using a colour coded scheme the pilots can instantly assess the situation and decide on the actions to be taken It was designed to ease pilot stress in abnormal and emergency situations by designing a paperless cockpit in which all the procedures are instantly available br br br System design br ECAM is a series of systems designed to work in unison to display information to the pilots in a quick and effective manner Sensors placed throughout the aircraft monitoring key parameters feed their data into two System Data Acquisition Concentrator SDACs which in turn process the data and feed it to two Flight Warning Computers FWCs The FWCs check for discrepancies in the data and then display the data on the ECAM displays through the three Display Management Computers DMCs In the event of a fault the FWCs generate the appropriate warning messages and sounds More vital systems are routed directly through the FWCs such that failures in them can still be detected even with the loss of both SDACs The whole system can continue to operate even with a failure of one SDAC and one FWC br Failures are classed by importance ranging from level failures to level failures In the event of simultaneous failures the most critical failure is displayed first The warning hierarchy is as follows br br Level Failures red warnings situations that require immediate crew action and that place the flight in danger For example an engine fire or loss of cabin pressure They are enunciated with a red master warning light a warning red ECAM message and a continuous repetitive chime or a specific sound or a synthetic voice The chime can be silenced by pressing the master warning push button br Level Failures amber cautions failures that require crew attention but not immediate action For example air bleed failure or fuel fault They have no direct consequence to flight safety and are shown to the crew through an amber master caution light a caution amber ECAM message and a single chime br Level Failures Cautions failures and faults that lead to a loss of system redundancy they require monitoring but present no hazard Examples include the loss of DMC when not in use Level failures are enunciated by a caution amber ECAM message only no aural warning br In addition to the three failure levels are following status messages br br Advisory System parameters monitoring It causes an automatic call of the relevant system page on the system display S D The affected parameter pulses green br MEMO Information Recalls normal or automatic selection of functions which are temporarily used It causes a green amber or magenta message on engine warning display E WD br br br Alternative systems br Some alternatives are br br Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System EICAS on Boeing Bombardier Dornier Embraer and Saab br Centralized Fault Detection System CFDS on McDonnell Douglas br Flight Warning System FWS on Fokker br Engine Warning Display EWD on ATR br on Antonov br br br Presence br Airbus developed jetliners have ECAM since the A and A br The Airbus A has EICAS as it was originally a Bombardier product br br br Limitations br The Qantas Flight engine failure generated more than ECAM alerts whose treatment took over an hour to complete br The A and A are the only Airbus developed jetliners with fully integrated checklists br br br See also br Glass cockpit br Electronic flight instrument system br br br
