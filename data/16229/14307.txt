title: Hall effect
id: 14307
The Hall effect is the production of a potential difference the Hall voltage across an electrical conductor that is transverse to an electric current in the conductor and to an applied magnetic field perpendicular to the current It was discovered by Edwin Hall in br The Hall coefficient is defined as the ratio of the induced electric field to the product of the current density and the applied magnetic field It is a characteristic of the material from which the conductor is made since its value depends on the type number and properties of the charge carriers that constitute the current br br br Discovery br br Wires carrying current in a magnetic field experience a mechanical force perpendicular to both the current and magnetic field Andr Marie Amp re in the s observed this underlying mechanism that led to the discovery of the Hall effect However it was not until a solid mathematical basis for electromagnetism was systematized by James Clerk Maxwell s On Physical Lines of Force published in that details of the interaction between magnets and electric current could be understood br Edwin Hall then explored the question of whether magnetic fields interacted with the conductors or the electric current and reasoned that if the force was specifically acting on the current it should crowd current to one side of the wire producing a small measurable voltage In he discovered this Hall effect while he was working on his doctoral degree at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore Maryland Eighteen years before the electron was discovered his measurements of the tiny effect produced in the apparatus he used were an experimental tour de force published under the name On a New Action of the Magnet on Electric Currents br br br Hall effect within voids br The term ordinary Hall effect can be used to distinguish the effect described in the introduction from a related effect which occurs across a void or hole in a semiconductor or metal plate when current is injected via contacts that lie on the boundary or edge of the void The charge then flows outside the void within the metal or semiconductor material The effect becomes observable in a perpendicular applied magnetic field as a Hall voltage appearing on either side of a line connecting the current contacts It exhibits apparent sign reversal in comparison to the ordinary effect occurring in the simply connected specimen It depends only on the current injected from within the void br br br Hall effect superposition br Superposition of these two forms of the effect the ordinary and void effects can also be realized First imagine the ordinary configuration a simply connected void less thin rectangular homogeneous element with current contacts on the external boundary This develops a Hall voltage in a perpendicular magnetic field Next imagine placing a rectangular void within this ordinary configuration with current contacts as mentioned above on the interior boundary of the void For simplicity imagine the contacts on the boundary of the void lined up with the ordinary configuration contacts on the exterior boundary In such a combined configuration the two Hall effects may be realized and observed simultaneously in the same doubly connected device A Hall effect on the external boundary that is proportional to the current injected only via the outer boundary and an apparently sign reversed Hall effect on the interior boundary that is proportional to the current injected only via the interior boundary The superposition of multiple Hall effects may be realized by placing multiple voids within the Hall element with current and voltage contacts on the boundary of each void br Further Hall effects may have additional physical mechanisms but are built on these basics br br br Theory br The Hall effect is due to the nature of the current in a conductor Current consists of the movement of many small charge carriers typically electrons holes ions see Electromigration or all three When a magnetic field is present these charges experience a force called the Lorentz force When such a magnetic field is absent the charges follow approximately straight paths between collisions with impurities phonons etc However when a magnetic field with a perpendicular component is applied their paths between collisions are curved thus moving charges accumulate on one face of the material This leaves equal and opposite charges exposed on the other face where there is a scarcity of mobile charges The result is an asymmetric distribution of charge density across the Hall element arising from a force that is perpendicular to both the straight path and the applied magnetic field The separation of charge establishes an electric field that opposes the migration of further charge so a steady electric potential is established for as long as the charge is flowing br In classical electromagnetism electrons move in the opposite direction of the current I by convention current describes a theoretical hole flow In some metals and semiconductors it appears holes are actually flowing because the direction of the voltage is opposite to the derivation below br br For a simple metal where there is only one type of charge carrier electrons the Hall voltage VH can be derived by using the Lorentz force and seeing that in the steady state condition charges are not moving in the y axis direction Thus the magnetic force on each electron in the y axis direction is cancelled by a y axis electrical force due to the buildup of charges The vx term is the drift velocity of the current which is assumed at this point to be holes by convention The vxBz term is negative in the y axis direction by the right hand rule br br br br br br F br br br q br br br br br

t IB frac ne br br br The units of RH are usually expressed as m C or cm G or other variants As a result the Hall effect is very useful as a means to measure either the carrier density or the magnetic field br One very important feature of the Hall effect is that it differentiates between positive charges moving in one direction and negative charges moving in the opposite In the diagram above the Hall effect with a negative charge carrier the electron is presented But consider the same magnetic field and current are applied but the current is carried inside the Hall effect device by a positive particle The particle would of course have to be moving in the opposite direction of the electron in order for the current to be the same down in the diagram not up like the electron is And thus mnemonically speaking your thumb in the Lorentz force law representing conventional current would be pointing the same direction as before because current is the same an electron moving up is the same current as a positive charge moving down And with the fingers magnetic field also being the same interestingly the charge carrier gets deflected to the left in the diagram regardless of whether it is positive or negative But if positive carriers are deflected to the left they would build a relatively positive voltage on the left whereas if negative carriers namely electrons are they build up a negative voltage on the left as shown in the diagram Thus for the same current and magnetic field the electric polarity of the Hall voltage is dependent on the internal nature of the conductor and is useful to elucidate its inner workings br This property of the Hall effect offered the first real proof that electric currents in most metals are carried by moving electrons not by protons It also showed that in some substances especially p type semiconductors it is contrarily more appropriate to think of the current as positive holes moving rather than negative electrons A common source of confusion with the Hall effect in such materials is that holes moving one way are really electrons moving the opposite way so one expects the Hall voltage polarity to be the same as if electrons were the charge carriers as in most metals and n type semiconductors Yet we observe the opposite polarity of Hall voltage indicating positive charge carriers However of course there are no actual positrons or other positive elementary particles carrying the charge in p type semiconductors hence the name holes In the same way as the oversimplistic picture of light in glass as photons being absorbed and re emitted to explain refraction breaks down upon closer scrutiny this apparent contradiction too can only be resolved by the modern quantum mechanical theory of quasiparticles wherein the collective quantized motion of multiple particles can in a real physical sense be considered to be a particle in its own right albeit not an elementary one br Unrelatedly inhomogeneity in the conductive sample can result in a spurious sign of the Hall effect even in ideal van der Pauw configuration of electrodes For example a Hall effect consistent with positive carriers was observed in evidently n type semiconductors Another source of artefact in uniform materials occurs when the sample s aspect ratio is not long enough the full Hall voltage only develops far away from the current introducing contacts since at the contacts the transverse voltage is shorted out to zero br br br Hall effect in semiconductors br When a current carrying semiconductor is kept in a magnetic field the charge carriers of the semiconductor experience a force in a direction perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the current At equilibrium a voltage appears at the semiconductor edges br The simple formula for the Hall coefficient given above is usually a good explanation when conduction is dominated by a single charge carrier However in semiconductors and many metals the theory is more complex because in these materials conduction can involve significant simultaneous contributions from both electrons and holes which may be present in different concentrations and have different mobilities

large magnetic field strength and low temperature one can observe the quantum Hall effect in which the Hall conductance undergoes quantum Hall transitions to take on the quantized values br br br Spin Hall effect br br The spin Hall effect consists in the spin accumulation on the lateral boundaries of a current carrying sample No magnetic field is needed It was predicted by Mikhail Dyakonov and V I

orbit coupling in zero magnetic field at low temperature the quantum spin Hall effect has been observed in br br br Anomalous Hall effect br In ferromagnetic materials and paramagnetic materials in a magnetic field the Hall resistivity includes an additional contribution known as the anomalous Hall effect or the extraordinary Hall effect which depends directly on the magnetization of the material and is often much larger than the ordinary Hall effect Note that this effect is not due to the contribution of the magnetization to the total magnetic field For example in nickel the anomalous Hall coefficient is about times larger than the ordinary Hall coefficient near the Curie temperature but the two are similar at very low temperatures Although a well recognized phenomenon there is still debate about its origins in the various materials The anomalous Hall effect can be either an extrinsic disorder related effect due to spin dependent scattering of the charge carriers or an intrinsic effect which can be described in terms of the Berry phase effect in the crystal momentum space k space br br br Hall effect in ionized gases br The Hall effect in an ionized gas plasma is significantly different from the Hall effect in solids where the Hall parameter is always much less than unity In a plasma the Hall parameter can take any value The Hall parameter in a plasma is the

when the Hall parameter is low their motion between two encounters with heavy particles neutral or ion is almost linear But if the Hall parameter is high the electron movements are highly curved The current density vector J is no longer collinear with the electric field vector E The two vectors J and E make the Hall angle which also gives the Hall parameter br br br br br br br tan br br br br br

a rectangular one Because of its shape the Corbino disc allows the observation of Hall effect based magnetoresistance without the associated Hall voltage br A radial current through a circular disc subjected to a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the disc produces a circular current through the disc br The absence of the free transverse boundaries renders the interpretation of the
