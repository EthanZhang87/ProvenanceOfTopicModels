upkeep of the list and became the new KLOV Keeper a title used to refer to the maintainer of the KLOV by the Usenet collector community at the time The KLOV launched as a full brand on or before November Johnson was instrumental in developing the KLOV s web site from a simple list to a full web based encyclopedia Johnson s efforts included breaking up the list into a complete online encyclopedia with distinct pages for each entry rewriting all the content including pictures in as many listings as was possible and in general creating a user friendly and searchable website Visitors could submit suggested changes to Johnson who could then edit any entries by hand br br In late the KLOV finally reached entries By this time the increasing level of submissions and suggestions was becoming nearly unmanageable for any single person to keep up with and the work load began to exceed Johnson s available time br br In January Greg McLemore became the KLOV Keeper His company WebMagic registered the Internet domain name KLOV com for the site on January and continues to provide substantial financial support for the KLOV to this day as a chief sponsor br Community message forums were
