Fritz X was the most common name for a German guided anti ship glide bomb used during World War II Fritz X was the world s first precision guided weapon deployed in combat and the first to sink a ship in combat Fritz X was a nickname used both by Allied and Luftwaffe personnel Alternative names include Ruhrstahl SD X Kramer X PC X or FX the latter along with the unguided PC Fritz nickname is the origin for the name Fritz X br br br History br br Fritz X was a further development of the PC Panzersprengbombe Cylindrisch kg armour piercing high explosive bomb itself bearing the nickname Fritz It was a penetration weapon intended to be used against armored targets such as heavy cruisers and battleships It was given a more aerodynamic nose four stub wings and a box shaped tail unit consisting of a roughly sided annular set of fixed surfaces and a cruciform tail with thick surfaces within the annulus which contained the Fritz X s aerodynamic controls br The Luftwaffe recognised the difficulty of hitting moving ships during the Spanish Civil War German engineer Max Kramer who worked at the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt f r Luftfahrt DVL had been experimenting since with remote controlled free falling kg lb bombs and in fitted radio controlled spoilers In Ruhrstahl AG was invited to join the development since they already had experience in the development and production of unguided bombs br Fritz X was guided by a Kehl Stra burg radio control link which sent signals to the movable spoilers in the thick vertical and horizontal tail fin surfaces within the annular tail fin structure This control system was also used for the unarmored rocket boosted Henschel Hs anti ship ordnance itself first deployed on August The Stra burg receiver antenna installations on the Fritz X were aerodynamically integrated into the trailing edge of the annular surfaces of the tail fin non metallically encapsulated within a quartet of bulged sections in the trailing edge This design feature of the FuG Stra burg receiver installation is not entirely unlike the Azon US contemporary guided bomb which had its own receiving antennas placed in the quartet of diagonal struts bracing the fixed sections of its tail fins br Minimum launch height was m ft although m ft was preferred and a range of km mi nmi was necessary As it was an MCLOS guidance ordnance design the operator had to keep the bomb in sight at all times a tail flare was provided as with the Azon to assist the operator in tracking the weapon and the control aircraft had to hold course which made evading gunfire or fighters impossible Approximately examples including trial models were produced br br br Control setup br br The Fritz X possessed a spoiler based control setup on its tailfin unit using three sets of aerodynamic control spoiler systems with two of them giving the ordnance control in both the pitch and yaw axes differentially operating and constantly oscillating rapidly under direct control from the Kehl Stra burg radio control link The roll control setup operating autonomously and not under control from the deploying aircraft similarly oscillated to those under the externally controlled sets and were located on the outboard sections of the horizontal tailfin surfaces within the annular set of outer tailfin surfaces These were like the American Azon ordnance s own aileron control surfaces in their purpose commanded by an internal gyroscope in the tail s central housing in both the Azon and Fritz X to keep the ordnance level during its trajectory The inboard set of spoiler surfaces in the tailfin s horizontal surfaces which used a set of wing fence like flat surfaces for airflow separation from the autonomous roll control spoilers controlled the pitch angle after release and were controlled by the radio control link giving the Fritz X s bombardier in the deploying aircraft the ability to control the range of the drop a capability that the Azon ordnance did not have The yaw control spoilers housed in the vertical tailfin surfaces were also under control through the radio link and had similar fence surfaces to guide airflow over them All three spoiler surface sets when deployed barely protruded from the surface during operation with the pair of spoiler systems under external control having a degree of proportionality in their operation by varying the dwell time spent on one side or the other during their rapid rate of oscillation from side to side when a control input was sent to them br br br Combat procedure br br The Fritz X was steered by the bombardier in the launching aircraft over a radio link between the aircraft s Kehl transmitter and the weapon s Stra burg receiver The bombardier had to be able to see the target at all times and like the Azon ordnance the Fritz X bomb had a flare in the tail so it could be seen from the controlling aircraft for its MCLOS form guidance to control it properly The disadvantage with this in comparison to fully autonomous guidance glide bombs like the operational U S Navy s Bat radar homing glide bomb used against Japan in were that the aircraft had to be flown toward the target on a steady course and that as the missile neared its target it became possible to misguide by jamming its radio channel br Unlike the Hs which was deployed against merchant ships and light escorting warships the Fritz X was intended to be used against armoured ships such as heavy cruisers and battleships The Fritz X had to be released at least kilometres mi from the target The plane had to decelerate immediately after bomb release so the bombardier could see the bomb and guide it this deceleration was achieved by making a steep climb and then levelling out The bombardier could make a maximum correction of metres ft in range and metres ft in bearing The bomber was vulnerable to fighter attack as well as ship based air defense weapons while maintaining a slow steady course so the bombardier could maintain visual contact to guide the bomb When working properly the missile was able to pierce mm in of armor br Accuracy is the main reason for developing a weapon system of this kind rather than continuing to use so called dumb bombs A skilled bombardier could manage to guide of the bombs to within a m ft radius of the aiming point and about hit within a m ft radius other sources say hits within metre radius br br br Usage in combat br br The only Luftwaffe unit to deploy the Fritz X was Gruppe III of Kampfgeschwader Wiking Viking designated III KG the bomber wing itself evolved as the larger sized descendant of the earlier Kampfgruppe unit in mid December This unit employed the medium range Dornier Do K bomber on almost all of its attack missions though in a few cases toward the end of its deployment history Dornier Do K and M variants were also used The Fritz X had been initially tested with a Heinkel He bomber although it was never taken into combat by this aircraft A few special variants of the troublesome Heinkel He A Greif long range bomber were equipped with the Kehl transmitter and proper bombracks to carry the Fritz X and it is thought that this combination might have seen limited combat service at least with the combinations known to have been involved in test drops It was found that the launch aircraft had to toss the bomb slightly climbing and then descending to keep it in view ahead br The Fritz X was first deployed on July in a raid on Augusta harbour in Sicily A number of additional attacks around Sicily and Messina followed though no confirmed hits were made and it appears the Allies were unaware that the large bombs being dropped were radio guided weapons br On September the Luftwaffe achieved their greatest success with the weapon After Pietro Badoglio publicly announced the Italian armistice with the Allies on September the Italian fleet had steamed out from La Spezia and headed to Tunisia To prevent the ships from falling into Allied hands six Do K s from III Gruppe of KG III KG took off each carrying a single Fritz X The Italian battleship Roma flagship of the Italian fleet received two hits and one near miss and sank after her magazines exploded men including Admiral Carlo Bergamini died Her sister ship Italia was also seriously damaged but reached Tunisia br The American light cruiser USS Savannah was hit by Fritz Xs at AM on September during the invasion of Salerno and was forced to retire to the United States for eight months of repairs A single Fritz X passed through the roof of C turret and killed the turret crew and a damage control party when it exploded in the lower ammunition handling room The blast tore a large hole in the ship s bottom opened a seam in her side and blew out all fires in her boiler rooms Savannah lay dead in the water with her forecastle nearly awash and eight hours elapsed before her boilers were relit allowing the Savannah to get under way for Malta USS Savannah lost crewmen in this attack Fifteen other sailors were seriously wounded and four more were trapped in a watertight compartment for hours These four sailors were not rescued until Savannah had already arrived at Grand Harbor Valletta Malta on September br br Savannah s sister ship USS Philadelphia had been targeted earlier that same morning While it is often believed that the ship was hit by a Fritz X in fact the bomb just missed the ship exploding about meters away Damage was minimal br The Royal Navy s light cruiser HMS Uganda was hit by a Fritz X off Salerno at on September The Fritz X passed through seven decks and straight through her keel exploding underwater just under the keel The concussive shock of the Fritz X s underwater detonation close to Uganda s hull extinguished all her boiler fires and resulted in sixteen men being killed with Uganda taking on tons of water Uganda was towed to Malta for repairs br Two merchant ships may have been hit by Fritz X bombs at Salerno though the evidence is uncertain SS Bushrod Washington was hit by a glide bomb either a Fritz X or a Hs on September while offloading a cargo of gasoline SS James W Marshall was set afire by a conventional bomb Hs or Fritz X on September As with Bushrod Washington the nature of the weapon that damaged James W Marshall is uncertain A witness aboard a ship nearby Joseph A Yannacci attributes the attack to Ju Stuka dive bombers which were too small to carry glide bombs While an attack with a Fritz X cannot be ruled out there is at least an equal case to suggest that if a glide bomb was involved the culprit was actually a Hs from II KG Luftwaffe records show that II KG armed only with Hs glide bombs was active over Salerno that day br br KG achieved another success with Fritz X while the British battleship HMS Warspite was providing gunfire support at Salerno on September One bomb penetrated six decks before exploding in number boiler room This explosion put out all fires and blew out the double bottom A second Fritz X near missed Warspite holing her at the waterline She took on a total of tonnes of water and lost steam and consequently all power both to the ship herself and to all her systems but although the damage had been considerable Warspite s casualties amounted to only nine killed and fourteen wounded She was towed to Malta by tugs Hopi and Moreno then returned to Britain via Gibraltar and was out of action for nearly months she was never completely repaired but returned to action to bombard German positions in Normandy during Operation Overlord br The last Fritz X attack at Salerno lightly damaged the US light cruiser Philadelphia with two near misses on September This attack is sometimes reported as taking place on September However according to US Navy records the cruiser Philadelphia departed Salerno the night of September Moreover according to Luftwaffe records III KG the Luftwaffe unit armed with the Fritz X flew its last mission on September Other ships damaged by Fritz X included Dutch sloop Flores and British destroyer Loyal br br br Electronic countermeasures br The control system used by the Fritz X relied on radio contact between the bomb and the guidance unit and was susceptible to electronic countermeasures After the initial attacks in August the Allies went to considerable effort to develop jamming devices These were first deployed in late September too late for Salerno The system met with some success although it proved cumbersome and easily overwhelmed if large numbers of weapons were deployed simultaneously br In early as the U S Army was engaged in the Battle of Anzio the United Kingdom began to deploy its Type transmitter which employed a different approach to interfering with the FuG radio link on a Fritz X by jamming the Stra burg receiver s intermediate frequency IF section The FuG receiver s IF section operated at a MHz frequency and the Type appears to have been quite successful in interfering with Fritz X ordnance deployments especially because the operator did not have to attempt to find which of the eighteen selected Kehl Stra burg command frequencies were in use and then manually tune the jamming transmitter to one of them The Type automatically defeated the receiver regardless which radio frequency had been selected for a missile br By the time of the Normandy landings a combination of Allied air supremacy keeping the Luftwaffe s bombers at bay and ship mounted jammers meant that the Fritz X had no significant effect on the invasion fleet Some accounts report that the Norwegian destroyer Svenner was hit by a Fritz X at dawn on D Day This is unlikely as III KG the unit which had carried the Fritz X into combat had largely been re equipped with the Hs by that time for its anti ship missions and the attack on Svenner occurred before the first glide bombers launched their assaults on the Normandy beaches br The Fritz X has been credited as responsible for the loss of the hospital ship HMHS Newfoundland at Salerno as well as the destroyer HMS Janus and the light cruiser HMS Spartan at Anzio however these ships were actually hit by Hs s as demonstrated by the nature of the damage inflicted as well as by reports from witnesses in the case of Janus either an Hs or a conventional torpedo was responsible br br br Operators br Luftwaffe
