In computing a hybrid drive solid state hybrid drive SSHD is a logical or physical storage device that combines a faster storage medium such as solid state drive SSD with a higher capacity hard disk drive HDD The intent is adding some of the speed of SSDs to the cost effective storage capacity of traditional HDDs The purpose of the SSD in a hybrid drive is to act as a cache for the data stored on the HDD improving the overall performance by keeping copies of the most frequently used data on the faster SSD drive br There are two main configurations for implementing hybrid drives dual drive hybrid systems and solid state hybrid drives In dual drive hybrid systems physically separate SSD and HDD devices are installed in the same computer having the data placement optimization performed either manually by the end user or automatically by the operating system through the creation of a hybrid logical device In solid state hybrid drives SSD and HDD functionalities are built into a single piece of hardware where data placement optimization is performed either entirely by the device self optimized mode or through placement hints supplied by the operating system host hinted mode br br br Types br br There are two main hybrid storage technologies that combine NAND flash memory or SSDs with the HDD technology dual drive hybrid systems and solid state hybrid drives br br br Dual drive hybrid systems br Dual drive hybrid systems combine the usage of separate SSD and HDD devices installed in the same computer Performance optimizations are managed in one of three ways br br By the computer user who manually places more frequently accessed data onto the faster drive br By the computer s operating system software which combines SSD and HDD into a single hybrid volume providing an easier experience to the end user Examples of hybrid volumes implementations in operating systems are ZFS hybrid storage pools bcache and dm cache on Linux Intel s Hystor and Apple s Fusion Drive and other Logical Volume Management based implementations on OS X br By chipsets external to the individual storage drives An example is the use of flash cache modules FCMs FCMs combine the use of separate SSD usually an mSATA SSD module and HDD components while managing performance optimizations via host software device drivers or a combination of both One example is Intel Smart Response Technology SRT which is implemented through a combination of certain Intel chipsets and Intel storage drivers is the most common implementation of FCM hybrid systems today What distinguished this dual drive system from an SSHD system is that each drive maintains its ability to be addressed independently by the operating system if desired br br br Solid state hybrid drive br Solid state hybrid drive also known by the initialism SSHD refers to products that incorporate a significant amount of NAND flash memory into a hard disk drive HDD resulting in a single integrated device The term SSHD is a more precise term than the more general hybrid drive which has previously been used to describe SSHD devices and non integrated combinations of solid state drives SSDs and hard disk drives The fundamental design principle behind SSHDs is to identify data elements that are most directly associated with performance frequently accessed data boot data etc and store these data elements in the NAND flash memory This has been shown to be effective in delivering significantly improved performance over the standard HDD br An example of an often confused dual drive system being considered an SSHD is the use of laptops which combine separate SSD and HDD components into the same inch HDD size unit while at the same time unlike SSHDs keeping these two components visible and accessible to the operating system as two distinct partitions WD s Black drive is a typical example the drive can either be used as a distinct SSD and HDD by partitioning it appropriately or software can be used to automatically manage the SSD portion and present the drive to the user as a single large volume br br br Operation br In the two forms of hybrid storage technologies dual drive hybrid systems and SSHDs the goal is to combine HDD and a faster technology often NAND flash memory to provide a balance of improved performance and high capacity storage availability In general this is achieved by placing hot data or data that is most directly associated with improved performance on the faster part of the storage architecture br Making decisions about which data elements are prioritized for NAND flash memory is at the core of SSHD technology Products offered by various vendors may achieve this with device firmware device drivers or software modules and device drivers br br br Modes of operation br Self optimized mode br In this mode of operation the SSHD works independently from the host operating system or host device drives to make all decisions related to identifying data that will be stored in NAND flash memory This mode results in a storage product that appears and operates to a host system exactly as a traditional hard drive would br Host optimized mode or host hinted mode br In this mode of operation the SSHD enables an extended set of SATA commands defined in the so called Hybrid Information feature introduced in version of the Serial ATA International Organization SATA IO standards for the SATA interface Using these SATA commands decisions about which data elements are placed in the NAND flash memory come from the host operating system device drivers file systems or a combination of these host level components br Some of the specific features of SSHD drives such as the host hinted mode require software support from within the operating system Microsoft added support for the host hinted operation into Windows while patches for the Linux kernel are available since October pending their inclusion into the Linux kernel mainline br br br History br br Hybrid drive technology has come a long way with modern implementations improving over the past decade beginning in br br In Seagate and Samsung introduced the first hybrid drives with the Seagate Momentus PSD and Samsung SpinPoint MH products Both models were inch drives featuring MB or MB NAND flash memory options Seagate s Momentus PSD emphasized power efficiency for a better mobile experience and relied on Windows Vista s ReadyDrive The products were not widely adopted br In May Seagate introduced a new hybrid product called the Momentus XT and used the term solid state hybrid drive This product focused on delivering the combined benefits of hard drive capacity points with SSD like performance It shipped as a GB HDD with GB of integrated NAND flash memory br In November Seagate introduced what they referred to as their second generation SSHD which increased the capacity to GB and pushed the integrated NAND flash memory to GB br In March Seagate introduced their third generation laptop SSHDs with two models a GB and TB both with GB of integrated NAND flash memory br In September Toshiba announced its first SSHD delivering SSD like performance and responsiveness by combining GB of Toshiba s own SLC NAND flash memory and innovative self learning algorithms with up to TB of storage capacity br In September Western Digital WD announced a hybrid technology platform pairing cost effective MLC NAND flash memory with magnetic disks to deliver high performance large capacity integrated storage systems br In November Apple Inc released the factory configured dual drive hybrid system named Fusion Drive br In October TarDisk introduced the plug and play dual drive hybrid system TarDisk Pear with flash memory size options up to GB br In August Western Digital introduced OptiNAND a New Flash Enhanced HDD Architecture It uses a new iNAND read write cache system for performance This feature is for when power is lost during a write phase to prevent data loss The System on a Chip SoC of an OptiNAND drive in under a second will use the rotational power generated by the already spinning disk platter inside the drive to power internal capacitors until the iNAND cached data transfers to non volatile NAND br br br Benchmarks br Late and early benchmarks using an SSHD consisting of a GB HDD and GB of NAND cache found that SSHDs did not offer SSD performance on random read write and sequential read write but were faster than HDDs for application startup and shutdown br The benchmark included loading an image of a system that had been used heavily running many applications to bypass the performance advantage of a freshly installed system it found in real world tests that performance was much closer to an SSD than to a mechanical HDD Different benchmark tests found the SSHD to be between an HDD and SSD but usually significantly slower than an SSD In the case of uncached random access performance multiple KB random reads and writes the SSHD was no faster than a comparable HDD there is advantage only with data that is cached The author concluded that the SSHD drive was the best non SSD type of drive by a significant margin and that the larger the solid state cache the better the performance br br br See also br ExpressCache br Fusion Drive br Hybrid array br ReadyBoost br br br Linux topics br bcache
