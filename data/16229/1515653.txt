A satellite navigation or satnav system is a system that uses satellites to provide autonomous geopositioning A satellite navigation system with global coverage is termed global navigation satellite system GNSS As of four global systems are operational the United States s Global Positioning System GPS Russia s Global Navigation Satellite System GLONASS China s BeiDou Navigation Satellite System BDS and the European Union s Galileo br Satellite based augmentation systems SBAS designed to enhance the accuracy of GNSS include Japan s Quasi Zenith Satellite System QZSS and the European EGNOS both based on GPS br Stand alone operational regional navigation satellite systems RNSS include earlier generations of the BeiDou navigation system and the current Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System IRNSS or NavIC br Satellite navigation devices determine their location longitude latitude and altitude elevation to high precision within a few centimeters to meters using time signals transmitted along a line of sight by radio from satellites The system can be used for providing position navigation or for tracking the position of something fitted with a receiver satellite tracking The signals also allow the electronic receiver to calculate the current local time to a high precision which allows time synchronisation These uses are collectively known as Positioning Navigation and Timing PNT Satnav systems operate independently of any telephonic or internet reception though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the positioning information generated br Global coverage for each system is generally achieved by a satellite constellation of medium Earth orbit MEO satellites spread between several orbital planes The actual systems vary but all use orbital inclinations of and orbital periods of roughly twelve hours at an altitude of about kilometres or miles br br br Classification br br GNSS systems that provide enhanced accuracy and integrity monitoring usable for civil navigation are classified as follows br br GNSS is the first generation system and is the combination of existing satellite navigation systems GPS and GLONASS with Satellite Based Augmentation Systems SBAS or Ground Based Augmentation Systems GBAS In the United States the satellite based component is the Wide Area Augmentation System WAAS in Europe it is the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service EGNOS and in Japan it is the Multi Functional Satellite Augmentation System MSAS Ground based augmentation is provided by systems like the Local Area Augmentation System LAAS br GNSS is the second generation of systems that independently provide a full civilian satellite navigation system exemplified by the European Galileo positioning system These systems will provide the accuracy and integrity monitoring necessary for civil navigation including aircraft Initially this system consisted of only Upper L Band frequency sets L for GPS E for Galileo and G for GLONASS In recent years GNSS systems have begun activating Lower L Band frequency sets L and L for GPS E a and E b for Galileo and G for GLONASS for civilian use they feature higher aggregate accuracy and fewer problems with signal reflection As of late a few consumer grade GNSS devices are being sold that leverage both They are typically called Dual band GNSS or Dual band GPS devices br By their roles in the navigation system systems can be classified as br br There are four core satellite navigation systems currently GPS United States GLONASS Russian Federation Beidou China and Galileo European Union br Global Satellite Based Augmentation Systems SBAS such as OmniSTAR and StarFire br Regional SBAS including WAAS US EGNOS EU MSAS Japan GAGAN India and SDCM Russia br Regional Satellite Navigation Systems such as India s NAVIC and Japan s QZSS br Continental scale Ground Based Augmentation Systems GBAS for example the Australian GRAS and the joint US Coast Guard Canadian Coast Guard US Army Corps of Engineers and US Department of Transportation National Differential GPS DGPS service br Regional scale GBAS such as CORS networks br Local GBAS typified by a single GPS reference station operating Real Time Kinematic RTK corrections br As many of the global GNSS systems and augmentation systems use similar frequencies and signals around L many Multi GNSS receivers capable of using multiple systems have been produced While some systems strive to interoperate with GPS as well as possible by providing the same clock others do not br br br History br br Ground based radio navigation is decades old The DECCA LORAN GEE and Omega systems used terrestrial longwave radio transmitters which broadcast a radio pulse from a known master location followed by a pulse repeated from a number of slave stations The delay between the reception of the master signal and the slave signals allowed the receiver to deduce the distance to each of the slaves providing a fix br The first satellite navigation system was Transit a system deployed by the US military in the s Transit s operation was based on the Doppler effect the satellites travelled on well known paths and broadcast their signals on a well known radio frequency The received frequency will differ slightly from the broadcast frequency because of the movement of the satellite with respect to the receiver By monitoring this frequency shift over a short time interval the receiver can determine its location to one side or the other of the satellite and several such measurements combined with a precise knowledge of the satellite s orbit can fix a particular position Satellite orbital position errors are caused by radio wave refraction gravity field changes as the Earth s gravitational field is not uniform and other phenomena A team led by Harold L Jury of Pan Am Aerospace Division in Florida from to found solutions and or corrections for many error sources Using real time data and recursive estimation the systematic and residual errors were narrowed down to accuracy sufficient for navigation br br br Principles br br Part of an orbiting satellite s broadcast includes its precise orbital data Originally the US Naval Observatory USNO continuously observed the precise orbits of these satellites As a satellite s orbit deviated the USNO sent the updated information to the satellite Subsequent broadcasts from an updated satellite would contain its most recent ephemeris br Modern systems are more direct The satellite broadcasts a signal that contains orbital data from which the position of the satellite can be calculated and the precise time the signal was transmitted Orbital data include a rough almanac for all satellites to aid in finding them and a precise ephemeris for this satellite The orbital ephemeris is transmitted in a data message that is superimposed on a code that serves as a timing reference The satellite uses an atomic clock to maintain synchronization of all the satellites in the constellation The receiver compares the time of broadcast encoded in the transmission of three at sea level or four which allows an altitude calculation also different satellites measuring the time of flight to each satellite Several such measurements can be made at the same time to different satellites allowing a continual fix to be generated in real time using an adapted version of trilateration see GNSS positioning calculation for details br Each distance measurement regardless of the system being used places the receiver on a spherical shell at the measured distance from the broadcaster By taking several such measurements and then looking for a point where they meet a fix is generated However in the case of fast moving receivers the position of the signal moves as signals are received from several satellites In addition the radio signals slow slightly as they pass through the ionosphere and this slowing varies with the receiver s angle to the satellite because that changes the distance through the ionosphere The basic computation thus attempts to find the shortest directed line tangent to four oblate spherical shells centred on four satellites Satellite navigation receivers reduce errors by using combinations of signals from multiple satellites and multiple correlators and then using techniques such as Kalman filtering to combine the noisy partial and constantly changing data into a single estimate for position time and velocity br Einstein s theory of general relativity is applied to GPS time correction the net result is that time on a GPS satellite clock advances faster than a clock on the ground by about microseconds per day br br br Applications br br The original motivation for satellite navigation was for military applications Satellite navigation allows precision in the delivery of weapons to targets greatly increasing their lethality whilst reducing inadvertent casualties from mis directed weapons See Guided bomb Satellite navigation also allows forces to be directed and to locate themselves more easily reducing the fog of war br Now a global navigation satellite system such as Galileo is used to determine users location and the location of other people or objects at any given moment The range of application of satellite navigation in the future is enormous including both the public and private sectors across numerous market segments such as science transport agriculture insurance energy etc br The ability to supply satellite navigation signals is also the ability to deny their availability The operator of a satellite navigation system potentially has the ability to degrade or eliminate satellite navigation services over any territory it desires br br br Global navigation
