Light gun shooter also called light gun game or simply gun game is a shooter video game genre in which the primary design element is to simulate a shooting gallery by having the player aiming and discharging a gun shaped controller at a screen Light gun shooters revolve around the protagonist shooting virtual targets either antagonists or inanimate objects and generally feature action or horror themes and some may employ a humorous parodic treatment of these conventions These games typically feature on rails movement which gives the player control only over aiming the protagonist s other movements are determined by the game Games featuring this device are sometimes termed rail shooters though this term is also applied to games of other genres in which on rails movement is a feature Some particularly later games give the player greater control over movement and in still others the protagonist does not move at all On home computer conversions of light gun shooters mouse has been often an optional or non optional replacement for a light gun br Light gun shooters typically employ light gun controllers so named because they function through the use of light sensors However not all light gun shooters use optical light guns but some may also use alternative pointing devices such as positional guns or motion controllers Mechanical games using light guns had existed since the s though they operated differently from those used in video games Throughout the s mechanical games were replaced by electronic video games and in the s popular light gun shooters such as Duck Hunt emerged The genre was most popular in the s subsequent to the release of Virtua Cop the formula of which was later improved upon by Time Crisis The genre is less popular in the new millennium as well as being hampered by compatibility issues but retains a niche appeal for fans of old school gameplay br br br Definition br Light gun shooters light gun games or gun games are games in which the protagonist shoots at targets whether antagonists or objects and which use a gun shaped controller termed a light gun with which the player aims While light gun games may feature a first person perspective they are distinct from first person shooters which use more conventional input devices Light gun games which feature on rails movement are sometimes termed rail shooters though this term is also applied to other types of shooters featuring similar movement The light gun itself is so termed because it functions through the use of a light sensor pulling the trigger allows it to detect light from the on screen targets br br br Design br br Targets in light gun shooters may be threatening antagonists such as criminals terrorists or zombies or they may be inanimate objects such as apples or bottles Although these games may be played without a light gun the use of more conventional input methods has been deemed inferior Light gun shooters typically feature generic action or horror themes though some later games employ more humorous self referential styles br Light gun shooters primarily revolve around shooting large numbers of enemies attacking in waves The protagonist may be required to defend themself by taking cover or by shooting incoming thrown weapons such as axes or grenades The player may also compete against the clock however with some games also featuring boss battles Games may also reward the player for accurate shooting with extra points power ups or secrets Games which do not pit the player against antagonists instead feature elaborate challenges constructed mainly from inanimate objects testing the player s speed and accuracy More conventional games may feature these types of challenges as minigames br Light gun shooters typically feature on rails movement which gives the player no control over the direction the protagonist moves in the player only has control over aiming and shooting Some games however may allow the protagonist to take cover at the push of a button Other games may eschew on rails movement altogether and allow the player to move the protagonist freely around the game s environment still others may feature a static environment Light gun shooters use a first person perspective for aiming though some games may allow the player to switch to a third person perspective in order to maneuver the protagonist br br br History br br br Mechanical and electro mechanical precursors s to early s br br Gun games had existed in arcades before the emergence of electronic video games Shooting gallery carnival games date back to the late th century Mechanical gun games first appeared in England s amusement arcades around the turn of the th century and before appearing in America by the s The British cinematic shooting gallery game Life Targets was a mechanical interactive film game where players shot at a cinema screen displaying film footage of targets br The first light guns appeared in the s with the Seeburg Ray O Lite Games using this toy rifle were mechanical and the rifle fired beams of light at targets wired with sensors A later gun game from Seeburg Corporation Shoot the Bear introduced the use of mechanical sound effects By the s mechanical gun games had evolved into shooting electro mechanical games A popular sophisticated example was Periscope by Namco and Sega with other examples including Captain Kid Rifle by Midway Manufacturing and Arctic Gun by Williams The use of a mounted gun dates back to a Midway mechanical game in the s br Between the late s and early s Sega produced gun games which resemble first person light gun shooter video games but were in fact electro mechanical games that used rear image projection in a manner similar to a zoetrope to produce moving animations on a screen It was a fresh approach to gun games that Sega introduced with Duck Hunt which began location testing in and released in January It had animated moving targets which disappear from the screen when shot solid state electronic sound effects and a higher score for head shots It also printed out the player s score on a ticket and the sound effects were volume controllable br br br D and pseudo D light gun shooter video games s to mid s br Throughout the s electro mechanical arcade games were gradually replaced by electronic video games following the release of Pong in with s Space Invaders dealing a yet more powerful blow to the popularity of electro mechanical games In the s EM gun games evolved into light gun shooter video games Light guns used in electronic video games work in the opposite manner to their mechanical counterparts the sensor is in the gun and pulling the trigger allows it to receive light from the on screen targets br Computer light pens had been used for

like Mortal Kombat br Light guns were suppressed for a time in the United States after the Columbine High School massacre and its attendant controversy over video games and gun crime Since the late s light gun controllers have been generally manufactured to look like toys by painting them in bright colours In Japan which lacks the gun crime found in the United States and in which civilians cannot legally own guns more realistic light guns are widely available Light gun rail shooters began declining in the late s as FPS games became more popular Light gun shooters became less popular in the s

peripheral used with Time Crisis Others have used the PlayStation Move motion control system The Joy Con of the Nintendo Switch have been used as a light gun substitute for various games such as The House of the Dead Remake though they are less precise than the Wii Remote due to their sole reliance on gyroscopic sensors for aiming br br br See also br List of light gun games br br br Notes br br
