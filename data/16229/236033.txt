Street Fighter II The World Warrior is a D fighting game developed by Capcom and originally released for arcades in It is the second installment in the Street Fighter series and the sequel to s Street Fighter It is Capcom s fourteenth game to use the CP System arcade system board Street Fighter II vastly improved many of the concepts introduced in the first game including the use of special command based moves a combo system a six button configuration and a wider selection of playable characters each with a unique fighting style br It prominently features a popular two player mode that obligates direct human to human competitive play which prolonged the survival of the declining video game arcade business market by stimulating business and driving the fighter genre It inspired grassroots tournament events culminating in Evolution Championship Series EVO Street Fighter II shifted the arcade competitive dynamic from achieving personal best high scores to head to head competition including large groups br Street Fighter II became the best selling game since the golden age of arcade video games By it had been played by an estimated million people in the United States alone Due to its major success a series of updated versions were released with additional features and characters Worldwide more than arcade cabinets and million software units of all versions of Street Fighter II have been sold grossing an estimated billion in total revenue making it one of the top three highest grossing video games of all time as of and the best selling fighting game until More than million Super Nintendo SNES cartridges of Street Fighter II have been sold making it Capcom s best selling single software game for the next two decades its best selling game on a single platform and the highest selling third party game on the SNES br Street Fighter II is regarded as one of the greatest video games of all time and the most important and influential fighting game ever made Its launch is seen as a revolutionary moment within its genre credited with popularizing the fighting genre during the s and inspiring other producers to create their own fighting series The game s soundtrack has been considered one of the greatest of all time br br br Gameplay br br Street Fighter II follows several conventions and rules established by its predecessor Street Fighter The player engages opponents in a series of timed one on one close quarters combat matches In order to win a round the player must either completely drain the opponent s health bar by landing attacks or have more health left than the opponent when the timer runs out Neither fighter wins the round if they have equal health when time expires or if they simultaneously knock each other out The first fighter to win two rounds is declared the victor of the match br While a single player game is in progress a second player may join at any time immediately starting a head to head match The winner continues the game in single player mode br The original Street Fighter II allowed up to rounds per match this maximum is reduced to four rounds starting with Champion Edition If there is no clear winner by the end of the final round either the computer controlled opponent will win by default in a single player match or both fighters will lose in a two player match After every third match in the single player mode a bonus stage gives a chance to earn additional points by smashing a car wooden barrels or metal oil drums After each match the location for the next one is selected on a world map br br Like in Street Fighter the controls are an eight directional joystick and six attack buttons The joystick can jump crouch walk left and right and block A tradeoff of strength and speed are given by three punch buttons and three kick buttons each of light medium and heavy The player can perform a variety of basic moves in any position including new grabbing and throwing attacks Special moves are performed by combinations of directional and button based commands br Street Fighter II differs from its predecessor due to the selection of multiple playable characters each with distinct fighting styles and special moves including combos According to IGN the concept of combinations linked attacks that can t be blocked when they re timed correctly came about more or less by accident Street Fighter II s designers didn t quite mean for it to happen but players of the original game eventually found out that certain moves naturally flowed into other ones This combo system was later adopted as a standard feature of fighting games and was expanded upon in this series br br br Plot br The leader of the Shadaloo organization M Bison in his global domination plan sets up a world fighting tournament to select the best fighters to work in his Shadaloo organization through brainwashing br br br Characters br The original Street Fighter II features a roster of eight playable characters This includes Ryu and Ken the main protagonists from Street Fighter plus six new international newcomers In the single player tournament the player fights the other seven main fighters then the final opponents a group of four CPU only opponents known as the Grand Masters which includes Sagat from Street Fighter br br Playable characters br br Ryu a Japanese martial artist seeking no fame or even the crown of champion but only to hone his Ansatsuken Karate skills with the inner power of Chi He dedicates his life to perfect his own potential while abandoning everything else in life such as having no family and few friends his only bond is with Ken He is the winner of the previous tournament He is not convinced that he is the greatest fighter in the world and comes to this tournament in search of fresh competition br E Honda a sumo wrestler from Japan He aims to improve the negative reputation of sumo wrestling by proving to competitors that he is a legitimate athlete br Blanka a beast like mutant from Brazil who was raised in the jungle He enters the tournament to uncover more origins about his forgotten past br Guile a former United States Air Force special forces operative seeking to defeat M Bison who killed his best friend Charlie br Ken Ryu s best friend greatest rival and former training partner from the United States Ryu s personal challenge rekindled Ken s fighting spirit and persuaded him to enter the World Warrior tournament as well as feeling lackadaisical in his fighting potential due to spending too much time with his fianc e br Chun Li a Chinese martial artist who works as an Interpol officer Much like Guile she does not enter the World Warrior tournament for any personal glory except proving that she can defeat any man who challenges her Chun Li s ambition in the past was tracking down the movements of the smuggling operation known as Shadaloo Her goal now is her trail being led to the tournament by seeking to avenge her deceased father by holding the Grand Master s leader of the crime syndicate responsible br Zangief a professional wrestler and sambo fighter from the Soviet Union He aims to prove Soviet Strength is the strongest form of strength particularly by defeating American opponents with his bare hands br Dhalsim a fire breathing yoga master from India Even though he is a pacifist he uses the money earned from fighting in order to lift people out of poverty br CPU exclusive characters in the order of appearance br br Balrog an American boxer with a similar appearance to Mike Tyson Called M Bison in Japan Once one of the world s greatest heavyweight boxers he began working for Shadaloo for easy money br Vega a Spanish bullfighter who wields a claw and uses a unique style of ninjutsu Called Balrog in Japan He is vain and wishes to eliminate ugly people from the world br Sagat a Muay Thai kickboxer from Thailand and former World Warrior champion from the original Street Fighter He was once known as The King of Street Fighters until he got demoted as The King of Muai Thai in his own tournament due to a narrow defeat at the hands of Ryu s shoryuken rising dragon punch which left a deep gash across his chest Ever since that moment he felt disgrace and will do anything to have a grudge match with Ryu to get his title back even if it takes joining forces with Shadaloo br M Bison the leader of the criminal organization Shadaloo who uses a mysterious power known as Psycho Power and the final opponent of the game Called Vega in Japan br Takayuki Nakayama stated in an interview that many character design ideas were trialled and dropped along the development process Rejected character designs for Street Fighter II included another bullfighter and an American amateur wrestler br br br Regional differences br With the exception of Sagat the Shadaloo Bosses have different names in the Japanese version The African American boxer known as Balrog in the international versions was designed as a pastiche of real life boxer Mike Tyson and was originally named M Bison short for Mike Bison with Mike being one of the American opponents faced in Street Fighter Vega and M Bison were originally named Balrog and Vega respectively When Street Fighter II was localized for the overseas market the names of the bosses were rotated out of concern that the boxer s similarities to Tyson could have led to a likeness infringement lawsuit br The characters in the Japanese version have more than one win quote and if the player loses a match against the CPU in the Japanese version a random playing tip will be shown at the bottom of the continue screen While the ending text for the characters was originally translated literally a few changes were made due to creative differences from Capcom s U S marketing staff For example the name of Guile s fallen friend who later debuted as a playable fighter in Street Fighter Alpha was changed from Nash to Charlie since a staff member from Capcom USA said that Nash is not a natural sounding English name br br br Development br Although the original punching pad cabinet of Street Fighter had not been very popular the alternate six button version was more successful which began to generate interest in a sequel Capcom began to make fighting games a priority after Final Fight was commercially successful in the United States Yoshiki Okamoto recounted The basic idea at Capcom was to revive Street Fighter a good game concept to make it a better playing arcade game br Development of Street Fighter II took about two years and about to people with Noritaka Funamizu as a producer and Akira Nishitani and Akira Yasuda in charge of the game and character design respectively The budget was estimated at equivalent to in br Funamizu notes that the developers did not particularly prioritize Street Fighter II s balance he primarily ascribes the game s success to its appealing animation patterns The quality of animation benefited from the developers use of the CPS hardware with advantages including allowing different characters to occupy different amounts of memory For example Ryu can occupy megabits and Zangief megabits br The combo system came about by accident br br While I was making a bug check during the car bonus stage I noticed something strange curious I taped the sequence and we saw that during the punch timing it was possible to add a second hit and so on I thought this was something impossible to make useful inside a game as the timing balance was so hard to catch So we decided to leave the feature as a hidden one The most interesting thing is that this became the base for future titles Later we were able to make the timing more comfortable and the combo into a real feature In Street Fighter II we thought if you got the perfect timing you could place several hits up to four I think Then we managed to place eight A bug Maybe br The vast majority of in game music was composed by Yoko Shimomura This is ultimately the only game in the series on which Shimomura worked as she left the company for Square two years later Isao Abe a Capcom newcomer handled a few additional tracks Versus Screen Sagat s Theme and Here Comes A New Challenger for Street Fighter II and became the main composer on the subsequent versions The sound programming and sound effects were overseen by
