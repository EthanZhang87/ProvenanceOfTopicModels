A light gun is a pointing device for computers and a control device for arcade and video games typically shaped to resemble a pistol br br br Early history br br The first light guns were produced in the s following the development of light sensing vacuum tubes In the technology was introduced in arcade shooting games beginning with the Seeburg Ray O Lite br These games evolved throughout subsequent decades culminating in Sega s Periscope released in as the company s first successful game which requires the player to target cardboard ships Periscope is an early electro mechanical game and the first arcade game to cost one quarter per play Sega s game Missile features electronic sound and a moving film strip to represent the targets on a projection screen and its game Killer Shark features a mounted light gun with targets whose movement and reactions are displayed using back image projection onto a screen Nintendo released the Beam Gun in and the Laser Clay Shooting System in followed in by the arcade game Wild Gunman which uses film projection to display the target on the screen In Sega released the early co operative light gun shooters Balloon Gun and Bullet Mark br br br Sequential targets br The first detection method used by the NES Zapper involves drawing each target sequentially in white light after the screen blacks out The computer knows that if the diode detects light as it is drawing a square or after the screen refreshes then that is the target at which the gun is pointed Essentially the diode tells the computer whether or not the player hit something and for n objects the sequence of the drawing of the targets tell the computer which target the player hit after ceil log n refreshes one refresh to determine if any target at all was hit and ceil log n to do a binary search for the object that was hit br A side effect of this is that in some games a player can point the gun at a light bulb or other bright light source pull the trigger and cause the system to falsely detect a hit on the first target every time Some games account for this either by detecting if all targets appear to match or by displaying a black screen and verifying that no targets match br br br Infrared emitters br The Wii Remote uses an infrared video camera in the handheld controller rather than a simple sensor Wesley Yin Poole stated that the Wii Remote was not as accurate as a traditional light gun br GunCon is an infrared light gun used for arcade games br br br Rectangular positioning br Rectangular positioning is similar to image capture except it disregards any on screen details and only determines the rectangular outline of the game screen By determining the size and distortion of the rectangle outline of the screen it is possible to calculate where exactly the light gun is pointing This method was introduced by the Sinden Lightgun br br br Positional gun br br The positional gun is common in video arcades as a non optical alternative to a light gun The positional gun is permanently mounted on a swivel on the cabinet as an analog joystick for aiming crosshairs onscreen This is typically more expensive initially but easier to maintain and repair Positional gun games include Silent Scope the arcade version of Resident Evil Survivor Space Gun Revolution X and Terminator Judgment Day Console conversions may use light guns br A positional gun is essentially an analog joystick that records the position of the gun to determine the player s aim on the screen The gun must be calibrated which usually happens after powering up Early examples of a positional gun include Sega s Sea Devil in Taito s Attack in and Cross Fire in and Nintendo s Battle Shark in br br br Models br br br See also br Light gun shooter br List of light gun games br Laser pistol sport br br br
