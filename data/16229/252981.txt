id: 252981
Shoot em ups also known as shmups or STGs are a sub genre of action games There is no consensus as to which design elements compose a shoot em up some restrict the definition to games featuring spacecraft and certain types of character movement while others allow a broader definition including characters on foot and a variety of perspectives br The genre s roots can be traced back to earlier shooting games including target shooting electro mechanical games of the mid th century and the early mainframe game Spacewar The shoot em up genre was established by the hit arcade game Space Invaders which popularised and set the general template for the genre in and spawned many clones The genre was then further developed by arcade hits such as Asteroids and Galaxian in Shoot em ups were popular throughout the s to early s diversifying into a variety of subgenres such as scrolling shooters run and gun games and rail shooters In the mid s shoot em ups became a niche genre based on design conventions established in the s and increasingly catered to specialist enthusiasts particularly in Japan Bullet hell games are a subgenre of shooters that features overwhelming numbers of enemy projectiles often in visually impressive formations br br br Definition br A shoot em up also known as a shmup or STG the common Japanese abbreviation for shooting games is a game in which the protagonist combats a large number of enemies by shooting at them while dodging their fire The controlling player must rely primarily on reaction times to succeed Beyond this critics differ on exactly which design elements constitute a shoot em up Some restrict the genre to games featuring some kind of craft using fixed or scrolling movement Others widen the scope to include games featuring such protagonists as robots or humans on foot as well as including games featuring on rails or into the screen and run and gun movement Mark Wolf restricts the definition to games featuring multiple antagonists em being short for them calling games featuring one on one shooting combat games Formerly critics described any game where the primary design element was shooting as a shoot em up but later shoot em ups became a specific inward looking genre based on design conventions established in those shooting games of the s br br br Common elements br Shoot em ups are a subgenre of action game These games are usually viewed from a top down or side view perspective and players must use ranged weapons to take action at a distance The player s avatar is typically a vehicle or spacecraft under constant attack Thus the player s goal is to shoot as quickly as possible at anything that moves or threatens them to reach the end of the level with a boss battle In some games the player s character can withstand some damage or a single hit will result in their destruction The main skills required in shoot em ups are fast reactions and memorising enemy attack patterns Some games feature overwhelming numbers of enemy projectiles and the player has to memorise their patterns to survive These games belong to one of the fastest paced video game genres br Large numbers of enemy characters programmed to behave in an easily predictable manner are typically featured These enemies may behave in a certain way dependent on their type or attack in formations that the player can learn to predict The basic gameplay tends to be straightforward with many varieties of weapons Shoot em ups rarely have realistic physics Characters can instantly change direction with no inertia and projectiles move in a straight line at constant speeds The player s character can collect power ups which may afford the character s greater protection an extra life health shield or upgraded weaponry Different weapons are often suited to different enemies but these games seldom keep track of ammunition As such players tend to fire indiscriminately and their weapons only damage legitimate targets br br br Types br Shoot em ups are categorized by their design elements particularly viewpoint and movement br Fixed shooters restrict the player and enemies to a single screen and the player primarily moves along a single axis such as back and forth along the bottom of the screen Examples include Space Invaders Galaxian Phoenix and Galaga In Pooyan the fixed axis of movement is vertical along the right side of the screen In Centipede and Gorf the player primarily moves left and right along the bottom but several inches of vertical motion are also allowed within an invisible box br Multidirectional shooters allow degree movement where the protagonist may rotate and move in any direction such as Asteroids and Mad Planets Multidirectional shooters with one joystick for movement and one joystick for firing in any direction independent of movement are called twin stick shooters One of the first games to popularize twin stick controls was Robotron br br Space shooters are a thematic variant of involving spacecraft in outer space Following the success of Space Invaders space shooters were the dominant subgenre during the late s to early s These games can overlap with other subgenres as well as space combat games br Tube shooters feature craft flying through an abstract tube such as Tempest and Gyruss There is still a single axis of motion making these a subset of fixed shooters br Rail shooters limit the player to moving around the screen while following a specific route these games often feature an into the screen viewpoint with which the action is seen from behind the player character and moves into the screen while the player retains control over dodging Examples include Space Harrier Captain Skyhawk Starblade Star Fox Star Wars Rebel Assault Panzer Dragoon and Sin and Punishment Rail shooters that use light guns are called light gun shooters such as Operation Wolf Lethal Enforcers Virtua Cop Point Blank Time Crisis The House of the Dead and Elemental Gearbolt Light gun games that are on rails are usually not considered to be in the shoot em up category but rather their own first person light gun shooter category br Cute em ups feature brightly colored graphics depicting surreal settings and enemies Cute em ups tend to have unusual oftentimes completely bizarre opponents for the player to fight with Twinbee and Fantasy Zone first pioneering the subgenre along with Parodius Cotton and Harmful Park being additional key games Some cute em ups may employ overtly sexual characters and innuendo br br br Scrolling shooters br Vertically scrolling shooters present the action from above and scroll up or occasionally down the screen br Horizontally scrolling shooters usually present a side on view and scroll left to right or less often right to left br Isometrically scrolling shooters or isometric shooters such as Sega s Zaxxon use an isometric point of view br A popular implementation style of scrolling shooters has the player s flying vehicle moving forward at a fixed rate through an environment Examples are Scramble Xevious Gradius Darius R Type Einh nder In contrast Defender allows the player to move left or right at will br Run and gun games have protagonists that move through the world on foot and shoot attackers Examples include the vertically scrolling overhead view games Front Line Commando and Ikari Warriors Side scrolling run and gun games often combine elements from platform games such as the ability to jump Contra Metal Slug and Cuphead Run and gun games may also use isometric viewpoints and may have multidirectional movement br br br Bullet hell br br Bullet hell danmaku literally barrage or bullet curtain is a subgenre of shooters in which the screen becomes crowded with complex curtain fire enemy patterns It is also characterized by collision boxes that are smaller than the sprites themselves to accommodate maneuvering through these crowded firing patterns This style of game also known as manic shooters or maniac shooters originated in the mid s as an offshoot of scrolling shooters The DonPachi and Touhou Project series are early titles establishing the principle of bullet hells br A bullet heaven or reverse bullet hell is a subgenre characterized by the player character collecting or unlocking abilities and attacks whose visuals overlap and clutter the game screen as the game progresses They also share a feature of many enemy characters commonly called hordes walking toward the player from off screen This genre is generally attributed to Vampire Survivors released in br br br Trance shooters br A small subgenre of shooter games that emphasizes chaotic reflex based gameplay designed to put the player in a trance like state In trance shooters enemy patterns usually have randomized elements forcing the player to rely on reflexes rather than pattern memorization Games of this type usually feature colorful abstract visuals and electronic music often techno music Jeff Minter is commonly credited with originating the style with Tempest and subsequent games including Space Giraffe Gridrunner and Polybius Other examples include the Geometry Wars series Space Invaders Extreme Super Stardust HD and Resogun br br br History br br br Origins br br The concept of shooting games existed before video games dating back to shooting gallery carnival games in the late th century and target sports such as archery bowling and darts Mechanical target shooting games first appeared in England s amusement arcades around the turn of the th century before appearing in America by the s Shooting gallery games eventually evolved into more sophisticated target shooting electro mechanical games EM games such as Sega s influential Periscope Shooting video games have roots in EM shooting games br Video game journalist Brian Ashcraft argues the early mainframe game Spacewar was the first shoot em up video game It was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in for the developers amusement and presents a space battle between two craft It was remade four times as an arcade video game in the s br br br Emergence of shoot em up genre late s br Space Invaders is most frequently cited as the first or original in the genre A seminal game created by Tomohiro Nishikado of Japan s Taito it led to proliferation of shooter games It pitted the player against multiple enemies descending from the top of the screen at a constantly increasing speed Nishikado conceived the game by combining elements of Breakout with those of earlier target shooting games and simple alien creatures inspired by H G Wells The War of the Worlds The hardware was unable to render the movement of aircraft so the game was set in space with a black background It had a more interactive style of play than earlier target shooting games with multiple enemies who responded to the player controlled cannon s movement and fired back at the player The game ended when the player was killed by the enemies While earlier shooting games allowed the player to shoot at targets Space Invaders was the first where multiple enemies fired back at the player It also introduced the idea of giving the player multiple lives and popularized the concept of achieving a high score br With these elements Space Invaders set the general template for the shoot em up genre It became one of the most widely cloned shooting games spawning more than imitators with only the most minor differences if any from the original Most shooting games released since then have followed its multiple life progressively difficult level paradigm according to Eugene Jarvis br br br Golden age and refinement late s to early s br br Following the success of Space Invaders shoot em ups became the dominant genre for much of the golden age of arcade video games from the late s up until the early s particularly the space shooter subgenre In Namco s Galaxian the granddaddy of all top down shooters according to IGN was released Its use of colour graphics and individualised antagonists were considered strong evolutionary concepts among space ship games In Gorf brought joystick control and limited vertical as well as horizontal movement to the vertically oriented fixed shooter genre while Space Invaders and Galaxian have only horizontal movement controlled by a pair of buttons Atari s Asteroids was a hit multi directional shooter taking from Spacewar the ability for the player s ship to roam the entire screen and to rotate move and shoot in any direction br The Space Invaders format evolved into the vertical scrolling shooter sub genre SNK s debut shoot em up Ozma Wars featured vertical scrolling backgrounds and enemies and it was the first action game to feature a supply of energy similar to hit points Namco s Xevious released in was one of the first and most influential vertical scrolling shooters Xevious is also the first to convincingly portray dithered shaded organic landscapes as opposed to blocks in space or wireframe obstacles br Side scrolling shoot em ups emerged in the early s Defender introduced by Williams Electronics in late and entering production in early allowed side scrolling in both directions in a wrap around game world unlike most later games in the genre The scrolling helped remove design limitations associated with the screen and it also featured a minimap radar Scramble released by Konami in early had continuous scrolling in a single direction and was the first side scrolling shooter with multiple distinct levels br In the early s Japanese arcade developers began moving away from space shooters towards character action games whereas American arcade developers continued to focus on space shooters during the early s up until the end of the arcade golden age According to Eugene Jarvis American developers were greatly influenced by Japanese space shooters but took the genre in a different direction from the more deterministic scripted pattern type gameplay of Japanese games towards a more programmer centric design culture emphasizing algorithmic generation of backgrounds and enemy dispatch and an emphasis on random event generation particle effect explosions and physics as seen in arcade games such as his own Defender and Robotron as well as Atari s Asteroids Robotron was an influential game in the multi directional shooter subgenre br Some games experimented with pseudo D perspectives at the time Nintendo s attempt at the genre Radar Scope borrowed heavily from Space Invaders and Galaxian but added a three dimensional third person perspective the game was a commercial failure however Atari s Tempest was one of the earliest tube shooters and a more successful attempt to incorporate a D perspective into shooter games Tempest went on to influence several later rail shooters Sega s Zaxxon introduced isometric video game graphics to the genre br The term shmup is believed to have been coined in by the British Commodore magazine Zzap In the July issue the term was used by the editor Chris Anderson and reviewer Julian Rignall br saw the release of Konami s Gradius which gave the player greater control over the choice of weaponry thus introducing another element of strategy The game also introduced the need for the player to memorise levels in order to achieve any measure of success Gradius with its iconic protagonist defined the side scrolling shoot em up and spawned a series spanning several sequels The following year saw the emergence of one of Sega s forefront series with its game Fantasy Zone The game received acclaim for its surreal graphics and setting and the protagonist Opa Opa was for a time considered Sega s mascot The game borrowed Defender s device of allowing the player to control the direction of flight and along with the earlier TwinBee is an early archetype of the cute em up subgenre In Taito released KiKi KaiKai an overhead multi directional shooter The game is notable for using a traditional fantasy setting in contrast to most shoot em up games filled with science fiction motifs R Type an acclaimed side scrolling shoot em up was released in by Irem employing slower paced scrolling than usual with difficult claustrophobic levels calling for methodical strategies s Raiden was the beginning of another acclaimed and enduring series to emerge from this period br br br Run and gun and rail shooters s to early s br Run and gun games became popular in the mid s These games feature characters on foot rather than spacecraft and often have military themes The origins of this type of shooter go back to Sheriff by Nintendo released in SNK s Sasuke vs Commander which had relatively detailed background graphics for its time pit a samurai against a horde of ninjas along with boss fights Taito s Front Line introduced the vertical scrolling format later popularized by Capcom s Commando which established the standard formula used by later run and gun games Sega s Ninja Princess which released slightly before Commando was a run and gun game that was distinctive for its feudal Japan setting and female ninja protagonist who throws shuriken and knives SNK s TNK III released later in combined the Front Line tank shooter format with unique rotary joystick controls which they later combined with Commando inspired run and gun gameplay to develop Ikari Warriors which further popularized run and gun shooters Ikari Warriors also drew inspiration from the action film Rambo First Blood Part II which it was originally intended to be an adaptation of Contemporary critics considered military themes and protagonists similar to Rambo or Schwarzenegger prerequisites for a shoot em up as opposed to an action adventure game The success of Commando and Ikari Warriors led to run and gun games becoming the dominant style of shoot em up during the late s to early s with the term shoot em up itself becoming synonymous with run and gun during this period br Konami s Green Beret known as Rush n Attack in North America adapted the Commando formula to a side scrolling format Later notable side scrolling run and gun shooters include Namco s Rolling Thunder which added cover mechanics to the formula and Data East s RoboCop In Konami created Contra a side scrolling coin op arcade game and later a NES game that was particularly acclaimed for its multi directional aiming and two player cooperative gameplay By the early s and the popularity of bit consoles the scrolling shooter genre was overcrowded with developers struggling to make their games stand out with exceptions such as the inventive Gunstar Heroes by Treasure br Sega s pseudo D rail shooter Buck Rogers Planet of Zoom demonstrated the potential of D shoot em up gameplay in Sega s Space Harrier a rail shooter released in broke new ground graphically and its wide variety of settings across multiple levels gave players more to aim for than high scores In Arsys Software released WiBArm a shooter that switched between a D side scrolling view in outdoor areas to a fully D polygonal third person perspective inside buildings while bosses were fought in an arena style D battle with the game featuring a variety of weapons and equipment In Square s D WorldRunner was an early stereoscopic D shooter played from a third person perspective followed later that year by its sequel JJ and the following year by Space Harrier D which used the SegaScope D shutter glasses That same year Sega s Thunder Blade switched between both a top down view and a third person view and featured the use of force feedback where the joystick vibrates br br br Bullet hell and niche appeal mid s to present br br Over the course of the s a new subgenre of shooters evolved known as danmaku barrage in Japan and often referred to as bullet hell or manic shooters in English speaking regions These games are characterized by high numbers of enemy projectiles often in complex curtain fire patterns as well as collision boxes that are smaller than the sprites themselves allowing the player to fit between the narrow gaps in enemy fire br Bullet hell games were first popularized in Japanese arcades during a time when D games and fighting games were eclipsing other games The flashy firing patterns were intended to grab players attention Toaplan s Batsugun is often considered a pivotal point in the development of this subgenre After the closure of Toaplan the following year a number of studios formed from former Toaplan staff that would continue to develop this style including Cave formed by Batsugun s main creator Tsuneki Ikeda who released s seminal DonPachi and Takumi who would develop the GigaWing series Bullet hell games marked another point where the shooter genre began to cater to more dedicated players Games such as Gradius had been more difficult than Space Invaders or Xevious but bullet hell games were yet more inward looking and aimed at dedicated fans of the genre looking for greater challenges While shooter games featuring protagonists on foot largely moved to D based genres popular long running series such as Contra and Metal Slug continued to receive new sequels Rail shooters have rarely been released in the new millennium with only Rez and Panzer Dragoon Orta achieving cult recognition br Treasure s shoot em up Radiant Silvergun introduced an element of narrative to the genre It was critically acclaimed for its refined design though it was not released outside Japan and remains a much sought after collector s item Its successor Ikaruga featured improved graphics and was again acclaimed as one of the best games in the genre Both Radiant Silvergun and Ikaruga were later released on Xbox Live Arcade The Touhou Project series spans years and games as of and was listed in the Guinness World Records in October for being the most prolific fan made shooter series The genre has undergone something of a resurgence with the release of the Xbox PlayStation and Wii online services while in Japan arcade shoot em ups retain a deep rooted niche popularity Geometry Wars Retro Evolved was released on Xbox Live Arcade in and in particular stood out from the various re releases and casual games available on the service The PC has also seen its share of d jin shoot em ups like Crimzon Clover Jamestown Legend of the Lost Colony Xenoslaive Overdrive and the eXceed series However despite the genre s continued appeal to an enthusiastic niche of players shoot em up developers are increasingly embattled financially by the power of home consoles and their attendant genres br br br See also br br Beat em up br Space flight simulation game br br br br br br Bibliography br Ashcraft Brian Arcade Mania The Turbo Charged World of Japan s Game Centers
