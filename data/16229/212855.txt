A memory card is an electronic data storage device used for storing digital information typically using flash memory These are commonly used in digital portable electronic devices such as Digital cameras as well as in many early games consoles such as the Nintendo Wii They allow adding memory to such devices using a card in a socket instead of protruding USB flash drives br Common types of flash memory card include SD cards including microSD Sony s Memory Stick and CompactFlash As of SD cards are the most common type of memory cards br br br History br The basis for memory card technology is flash memory It was invented by Fujio Masuoka at Toshiba in and commercialized by Toshiba in br The development of memory cards was driven in the s by the need for an alternative to floppy disk drives that had lower power consumption had less weight and occupied less volume in laptops Some were also marketed as a lower cost alternative to ROM cartridges Several competing and incompatible memory card formats were developed by several vendors such as for example the Bee Card Astron SoftCards Sega Cards NEC UltraLite memory cards and the Mitsubishi Melcard which came in variants using and connector pins The Sega Card was developed as a cheaper alternative to game cartridges Some memory cards were used for memory expansion in laptops br JEIDA the Japan Electronic Industry Development Association began to work on a standard for memory cards in and developed the JEIDA memory card in br The Personal Computer Memory Card International Association PCMCIA was an industry association created in to promote a standard for memory cards in PCs and worked closely with JEIDA adopting their pin connector design The specification for PCMCIA type I cards later renamed PC Cards was first released in and unified the JEIDA memory card standard with the PC Card standard This format later included support for other devices besides memory cards PC Card was among the first commercial memory card formats to come out but is now mainly used in industrial applications and to connect I O devices such as modems br Some early memory cards used SRAM as a storage medium which required a lithium battery to keep the contents in the SRAM These cards were faster than their flash counterparts Some of the first PCMCIA cards had capacities of to MB and cost US per MB Other early cards such as the Bee Card contained non modifiable ROM Write once read many EPROM or rewriteable EEPROM memory In SanDisk introduced FlashDisk a PCMCIA card and one of the first memory cards that did not require battery power to retain its contents as it used flash memory br Since a number of memory card formats smaller than the PC Card arrived The first one was CompactFlash and later SmartMedia and Miniature Card The desire for smaller cards for cell phones PDAs and compact digital cameras drove a trend that left the previous generation of compact cards looking big In the SD card was announced SD was envisioned as a single memory card format for several kinds of electronic devices that could also function as an expansion slot for adding new capabilities for a device In SmartMedia alone captured of the digital camera market and CF had captured the professional digital camera market br However by SD and similar MMC cards had nearly taken over SmartMedia s spot though not to the same level and with stiff competition coming from Memory Stick variants as well as CompactFlash In industrial and embedded fields even the venerable PC card PCMCIA memory cards still manage to maintain a niche while in mobile phones and PDAs the memory card has become smaller br Initially memory cards were expensive costing US per megabyte of capacity in this led to the development of miniaturized rotating disk memory devices such as the Microdrive PocketZip and Dataplay The Microdrive had higher capacities than memory cards at the time All three concepts became obsolete once flash memory prices became lower and their capacities became higher by br Since new products of Sony previously only using Memory Stick and Olympus previously only using XD Card have been offered with an additional SD Card slot Effectively the format war has turned in SD Card s favor br br br Data table of selected memory card formats br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br

video game consoles used memory cards to hold saved game data Cartridge based systems primarily used battery backed volatile RAM within each individual cartridge to hold saves for that game Cartridges without this RAM may have used a password system or would not save progress at all The Neo Geo AES released in by SNK was the first video game console able to use a memory card AES memory cards were also compatible with Neo Geo MVS arcade cabinets allowing players to migrate saves between home and arcade systems and vice versa Memory cards became commonplace when home consoles moved to read only optical discs for storing the game program beginning with systems such as the TurboGrafx CD and Sega CD br Until the sixth generation of video game consoles memory cards were based on proprietary formats Later systems used established industry formats for memory cards such as FAT br Home consoles now commonly use hard disk drive storage for saved games and allow the use of USB flash drives or other card formats via a memory card reader to transport game saves and other game information Though some consoles have implemented cloud storage saving most portable gaming systems still rely on custom memory cartridges to store program data due to their low power consumption smaller physical size and reduced mechanical complexity br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br
