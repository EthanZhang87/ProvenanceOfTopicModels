The yaw string also known as a slip string is a simple device for indicating a slip or skid in an aircraft in flight It performs the same function as the slip skid indicator ball but is more sensitive and does not require the pilot to look down at the instrument panel Technically it measures sideslip angle not yaw angle but this indicates how the aircraft must be yawed to return the sideslip angle to zero br It is typically constructed from a short piece or tuft of yarn placed in the free air stream where it is visible to the pilot In closed cockpit aircraft it is usually taped to the aircraft canopy It may also be mounted on the aircraft s nose either directly on the skin or elevated on a mast in which case it may also be fitted with a small paper cone at the trailing end They are commonly used on gliders but may also be found on jet aircraft especially fighters ultralight aircraft light sport aircraft autogyros airplanes and helicopters Its usefulness on airplanes with a tractor configuration single propeller at the nose is limited because the propeller creates turbulence and the spiral slipstream displaces the string to one side br The yaw string is considered a primary flight reference instrument on gliders which must be flown with near zero sideslip angle to reduce drag as much as possible It is valued for its high sensitivity and the fact that it is presented in a head up display Even the most sophisticated modern racing sailplanes are fitted with yaw strings by their pilots who reference them constantly throughout the flight br br br History br The yaw string dates from the earliest days of aviation and actually was the first flight instrument The Wright Brothers used a yaw string on their glider tied on their front mounted elevator Wilbur Wright is credited with its invention having applied it concurrently with the movable rudder invented by his brother Orville in October although others may have used it before Glenn Curtiss also used it on his early airplanes br br br Operation br br In flight the rule to remember is simple step on the head of the yaw string the head is the front of the string where the string is taped to the canopy If the head of the yaw string is to the right of the yaw string tail then the pilot needs to apply right rudder pressure If the head of the yaw string is to the left of the yaw string tail then the pilot should apply left rudder pressure Or think of the attached point of the yaw string as an arrow head pointing to the rudder pedal needing the application of pressure According to Helmut Reichmann rudder against the string and or aileron toward the string In a spin the string always points to the inside To center the ball on an inclinometer apply rudder pressure on the side to which the ball is deflected Use the simple rule step on the ball to remember which rudder pedal to press br br br Use on powered aircraft br Yaw strings are also fitted to the Lockheed U high altitude surveillance aircraft and variants of the Grumman F Tomcat A flat spin caused by excessive sideslip even in level flight happens much more easily at high altitudes Some light twin engine airplane pilots place yaw strings on their aircraft to help maintain control in the event of an engine failure because the slip skid indicator ball is not accurate in this case br In a multiengine airplane with an inoperative engine br the centered ball is no longer the indicator of zero br sideslip due to asymmetrical thrust The yaw string is the only br flight instrument that will directly tell the pilot the br flight conditions for zero sideslip br Yaw strings are also used on some especially smaller helicopters br br br Side string br br A variation of the yaw string is the side string used in gliders for a determination of the angle of attack In this way the speed for best glide angle the best thermalling speed and the stall speed can be observed independently of other parameters like air speed aircraft weight acceleration due to turning stick movements and gusts br Investigations of the side string and on its use in glider flight were performed by the Akaflieg K ln br br br See also br Glider sailplane br Gliding br Sideslip angle br Slip aerodynamic br Tuft br Tell tale sailing br Critical engine br br br br br This article incorporates public domain material from Instrument Flying Handbook United States Government
