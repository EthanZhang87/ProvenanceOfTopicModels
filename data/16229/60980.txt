Digital Visual Interface DVI is a video display interface developed by the Digital Display Working Group DDWG The digital interface is used to connect a video source such as a video display controller to a display device such as a computer monitor It was developed with the intention of creating an industry standard for the transfer of uncompressed digital video content br DVI devices manufactured as DVI I have support for analog connections and are compatible with the analog VGA interface by including VGA pins while DVI D devices are digital only This compatibility along with other advantages led to its widespread acceptance over competing digital display standards Plug and Display P D and Digital Flat Panel DFP Although DVI is predominantly associated with computers it is sometimes used in other consumer electronics such as television sets and DVD players br br br History br An earlier attempt to promulgate an updated standard to the analog VGA connector was made by the Video Electronics Standards Association VESA in and with the Enhanced Video Connector EVC which was intended to consolidate cables between the computer and monitor EVC used a pin Molex MicroCross connector and carried analog video input and output analog stereo audio input and output and data via USB and FireWire At the same time with the increasing availability of digital flat panel displays the priority shifted to digital video transmission which would remove the extra analog digital conversion steps required for VGA and EVC the EVC connector was reused by VESA which released the Plug Display P D standard in P D offered single link TMDS digital video with as an option analog video output and data USB and FireWire using a pin MicroCross connector similar to EVC the analog audio and video input lines from EVC were repurposed to carry digital video for P D br Because P D was a physically large expensive connector a consortium of companies developed the DFP standard which was focused solely on digital video transmission using a pin micro ribbon connector and omitted the analog video and data capabilities of P D DVI instead chose to strip just the data functions from P D using a pin MicroCross connector to carry digital and analog video Critically DVI allows dual link TMDS signals meaning it supports higher resolutions than the single link P D and DFP connectors which led to its successful adoption as an industry standard Compatibility of DVI with P D and DFP is accomplished typically through passive adapters that provide appropriate physical interfaces as all three standards use the same DDC EDID handshaking protocols and TMDS digital video signals br DVI made its way into products starting in One of the first DVI monitors was Apple s original Cinema Display which launched in br br br Technical overview br DVI s digital video transmission format is based on panelLink a serial format developed by Silicon Image that utilizes a high speed serial link called transition minimized differential signaling TMDS br br br TMDS br Digital video pixel data is transported using multiple TMDS twisted pairs At the electrical level these pairs are highly resistant to electrical noise and other forms of analog distortion br br br Single link br A single link DVI connection has four TMDS pairs Three data pairs carry their designated bit RGB component red green or blue of the video signal for a total of bits per pixel The fourth pair carries the TMDS clock The binary data is encoded using b b encoding DVI does not use packetization but rather transmits the pixel data as if it were a rasterized analog video signal As such the complete frame is drawn during each vertical refresh period The full active area of each frame is always transmitted without compression Video modes typically use horizontal and vertical refresh timings that are compatible with cathode ray tube CRT displays though this is not a requirement In single link mode the maximum TMDS clock frequency is MHz which supports a maximum resolution of megapixels including blanking interval at Hz refresh For practical purposes this allows a maximum screen resolution of at Hz br br br Dual link br To support higher resolution display devices the DVI specification contains a provision for dual link Dual link DVI doubles the number of TMDS data pairs effectively doubling the video bandwidth which allows higher resolutions up to at Hz or higher refresh rates for lower resolutions br br br Compatibility br For backward compatibility with displays using analog VGA signals some of the contacts in the DVI connector carry the analog VGA signals br To ensure a basic level of interoperability DVI compliant devices are required to support one baseline display mode low pixel format at Hz br br br DDC br Like modern analog VGA connectors the DVI connector includes pins for the display data channel DDC which allows the graphics adapter to read the monitor s extended display identification data EDID When a source and display using the DDC revision are connected the source first queries the display s capabilities by reading the monitor EDID block over an I C link The EDID block contains the display s identification color characteristics such as gamma value and table of supported video modes The table can designate a preferred mode or native resolution Each mode is a set of timing values that define the duration and frequency of the horizontal vertical sync the positioning of the active display area the horizontal resolution vertical resolution and refresh rate br br br Cable length br The maximum length recommended for DVI cables is not included in the specification since it is dependent on the TMDS clock frequency In general cable lengths up to metres ft will work for display resolutions up to Longer cables up to metres ft in length can be used with display resolutions or lower For greater distances the use of a DVI booster a signal repeater which may use an external power supply is recommended to help mitigate signal degradation br br br Connector br br The DVI connector on a device is given one of three names depending on which signals it implements br br DVI I integrated combines digital and analog in the same connector digital may be single or dual link br DVI D digital only single link or dual link br DVI A analog only br Most DVI connector types the exception is DVI A have pins that pass digital video signals These come in two varieties single link and dual link Single link DVI employs a single transmitter with a TMDS clock up to MHz that supports resolutions up to at Hz Dual link DVI adds six pins at the center of the connector for a second transmitter increasing the bandwidth and supporting resolutions up to at Hz A connector with these additional pins is sometimes referred to as DVI DL dual link Dual link should not be confused with dual display also known as dual head which is a configuration consisting of a single computer connected to two monitors sometimes using a DMS connector for two single link DVI connections br In addition to digital some DVI connectors also have pins that pass an analog signal which can be used to connect an analog monitor The analog pins are the four that surround the flat blade on a DVI I or DVI A connector A VGA monitor for example can be connected to a video source with DVI I through the use of a passive adapter Since the analog pins are directly compatible with VGA signaling passive adapters are simple and cheap to produce providing a cost effective solution to support VGA on DVI The long flat pin on a DVI I connector is wider than the same pin on a DVI D connector so even if the four analog pins were manually removed it still wouldn t be possible to connect a male DVI I to a female DVI D It is possible however to join a male DVI D connector with a female DVI I connector br DVI is the only widespread video standard that includes analog and digital transmission in the same connector Competing standards are exclusively digital these include a system using low voltage differential signaling LVDS known by its proprietary names FPD Link flat panel display and FLATLINK and its successors the LVDS Display Interface LDI and OpenLDI br Some DVD players HDTV sets and video projectors have DVI connectors that transmit an encrypted signal for copy protection using the High bandwidth Digital Content Protection HDCP protocol Computers can be connected to HDTV sets over DVI but the graphics card must support HDCP to play content protected by digital rights management DRM br br br Specifications br br br Digital br Minimum TMDS clock frequency MHz br Used for the mandatory low pixel format display mode VGA x Hz br Maximum single link TMDS clock frequency

desired the least significant bits are sent on the second link br Pixels per TMDS clock cycle br single link at bits or less per pixel and dual link for to bits per pixel or br dual link at bits or

CVT RB blanking pixels per MHz TMDS clock br WQXGA Hz with CVT RB blanking pixels per MHz TMDS clock br WQUXGA Hz with CVT RB blanking pixels per MHz TMDS clock br Generalized Timing Formula GTF is a VESA standard which can easily be calculated with the Linux gtf utility Coordinated Video Timings Reduced Blanking CVT RB is a VESA standard which offers reduced horizontal and vertical blanking for non CRT based displays br br br Digital data encoding br One of the purposes of DVI stream encoding is to provide a DC balanced output that reduces decoding errors This goal is achieved by using bit symbols for bit or less characters and using the extra bits for the DC balancing br Like other ways of transmitting video there are two different regions the active region where pixel data is sent and the control region where synchronization signals are sent The active region is encoded using transition minimized differential signaling where the control region is encoded with a fixed b b encoding As the two schemes yield different bit symbols a receiver can fully differentiate between active and control regions br When DVI was designed most computer monitors were still of the cathode ray tube type that require analog video synchronization signals The timing of the digital synchronization signals matches the equivalent analog ones so the process of transforming DVI to and from an analog signal does not require extra high speed memory expensive at the time br HDCP is an extra layer that transforms the bit symbols before transmitting Only after correct authorization can the receiver undo the HDCP encryption Control regions are not encrypted in order to let the receiver know when the active region starts br br br Clock and data relationship br DVI provide one TMDS clock pair and TMDS data pairs in single link mode or TMDS data pairs in dual link mode TMDS data pairs operate at a gross bit rate that is times the frequency of the TMDS clock In each TMDS clock period there is a bit symbol per TMDS data pair representing bits of pixel color In single link mode each set of three bit symbols represents one bit pixel while in dual link mode each set of six bit symbols either represents two bit pixels or one pixel of up to bit color depth br The specification document allows the data and the clock to not be aligned However as the ratio between the TMDS clock and gross bit rate per TMDS pair is fixed at the unknown alignment is kept over time The receiver must recover the bits on the stream using any of the techniques of clock data recovery to find the correct symbol boundary The DVI specification allows the TMDS clock to vary between MHz and MHz This ratio can make clock recovery difficult as phase locked loops if used need to work over a large frequency range One benefit of DVI over other interfaces is that it is relatively straightforward to transform the signal from the digital domain into the analog domain using a video DAC as both clock and synchronization signals are transmitted Fixed frequency interfaces like DisplayPort need to reconstruct the clock from the transmitted data br br br Display power management br The DVI specification includes signaling for reducing power consumption Similar to the analog VESA display power management signaling DPMS standard a connected device can turn a monitor off when the connected device is powered down or programmatically if the display controller of the device supports it Devices with this capability can also attain Energy Star certification br br br Analog br The analog section of the DVI specification document is brief and points to other specifications like VESA VSIS for electrical characteristics and GTFS for timing information The motivation for including analog is to keep compatibility with the previous VGA cables and connectors VGA pins for HSync Vsync and three video channels are available in both DVI I or DVI A but not DVI D connectors and are electrically compatible while pins for DDC clock and data and V power and ground are kept in all DVI connectors Thus a passive adapter can interface between DVI I or DVI A but not DVI D and VGA connectors br br br DVI and HDMI compatibility br HDMI is a newer digital audio video interface developed and promoted by the consumer electronics industry DVI and HDMI have the same electrical specifications for their TMDS and VESA DDC twisted pairs However HDMI and DVI differ in several key ways br br HDMI lacks VGA compatibility and does not include analog signals br DVI is limited to the RGB color model while HDMI also supports YCbCr and YCbCr color spaces which are generally not used for computer graphics br In addition to digital video HDMI supports the transport of packets used for digital audio br HDMI sources differentiate between legacy DVI displays and HDMI capable displays by reading the display s EDID block br To promote interoperability between DVI D and HDMI devices HDMI source components and displays support DVI D signalling For example an HDMI display can be driven by a DVI D source because HDMI and DVI D both define an overlapping minimum set of supported resolutions and frame buffer formats br Some DVI D sources use non standard extensions to output HDMI signals including audio e g ATI series and NVIDIA GTX series Some multimedia displays use a DVI to HDMI adapter to input the HDMI signal with audio Exact capabilities vary by video card specifications br In the reverse scenario a DVI display that lacks optional support for HDCP might be unable to display protected content even though it is otherwise compatible with the HDMI source Features specific to HDMI such as remote control audio transport xvYCC and deep color are not usable in devices that support only DVI signals HDCP compatibility between source and destination devices is subject to manufacturer specifications for each device br br br Proposed successors br IEEE was proposed by High Definition Audio Video Network Alliance HANA Alliance for all cabling needs including video over coaxial or cable as a combined data stream However this interface does not have enough throughput to handle uncompressed HD video so it is unsuitable for applications such as video games and interactive program guides br High Definition Multimedia Interface HDMI a forward compatible standard that also includes digital audio transmission br Unified Display Interface UDI was proposed by Intel to replace both DVI and HDMI but was deprecated in favor of DisplayPort br DisplayPort a license free standard proposed by VESA to succeed DVI that has optional DRM mechanisms Mini DisplayPort br Thunderbolt an interface that uses the USB C connector from Thunderbolt and onward the Mini DisplayPort connector was used for Thunderbolt and but combines PCI Express PCIe and DisplayPort DP into one serial signal permitting the connection of PCIe devices in addition to video displays It provides DC power as well br In December Intel AMD and several computer and display manufacturers announced they would stop supporting DVI I VGA and LVDS technologies from and instead speed up adoption of DisplayPort and HDMI They also stated Legacy interfaces such as VGA DVI and LVDS have not kept pace and newer standards such as DisplayPort and HDMI clearly provide the best connectivity options moving forward In our opinion DisplayPort is the future interface for PC monitors along with HDMI a for TV connectivity br br br See also br DMS a single DVI sized connector providing two single link DVI or VGA channels br List of
