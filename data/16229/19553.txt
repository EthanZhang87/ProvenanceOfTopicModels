id: 19553
A microprocessor is a computer processor for which the data processing logic and control is included on a single integrated circuit IC or a small number of ICs The microprocessor contains the arithmetic logic and control circuitry required to perform the functions of a computer s central processing unit CPU The IC is capable of interpreting and executing program instructions and performing arithmetic operations The microprocessor is a multipurpose clock driven register based digital integrated circuit that accepts binary data as input processes it according to instructions stored in its memory and provides results also in binary form as output Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic and operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary number system br The integration of a whole CPU onto a single or a few integrated circuits using Very Large Scale Integration VLSI greatly reduced the cost of processing power Integrated circuit processors are produced in large numbers by highly automated metal oxide semiconductor MOS fabrication processes resulting in a relatively low unit price Single chip processors increase reliability because there are fewer electrical connections that can fail As microprocessor designs improve the cost of manufacturing a chip with smaller components built on a semiconductor chip the same size generally stays the same according to Rock s law br Before microprocessors small computers had been built using racks of circuit boards with many medium and small scale integrated circuits typically of TTL type Microprocessors combined this into one or a few large scale ICs While there is disagreement over who deserves credit for the invention of the microprocessor the first commercially available microprocessor was the Intel designed by Federico Faggin and introduced in br Continued increases in microprocessor capacity have since rendered other forms of computers almost completely obsolete see history of computing hardware with one or more microprocessors used in everything from the smallest embedded systems and handheld devices to the largest mainframes and supercomputers br A microprocessor is distinct from a microcontroller including a system on a chip A microprocessor is related but distinct from a digital signal processor br br br Structure br br The complexity of an integrated circuit is bounded by physical limitations on the number of transistors that can be put onto one chip the number of package terminations that can connect the processor to other parts of the system the number of interconnections it is possible to make on the chip and the heat that the chip can dissipate Advancing technology makes more complex and powerful chips feasible to manufacture br A minimal hypothetical microprocessor might include only an arithmetic logic unit ALU and a control logic section The ALU performs addition subtraction and operations such as AND or OR Each operation of the ALU sets one or more flags in a status register which indicate the results of the last operation zero value negative number overflow or others The control logic retrieves instruction codes from memory and initiates the sequence of operations required for the ALU to carry out the instruction A single operation code might affect many individual data paths registers and other elements of the processor br As integrated circuit technology advanced it was feasible to manufacture more and more complex processors on a single chip The size of data objects became larger allowing more transistors on a chip allowed word sizes to increase from and bit words up to today s bit words Additional features were added to the processor architecture more on chip registers sped up programs and complex instructions could be used to make more compact programs Floating point arithmetic for example was often not available on bit microprocessors but had to be carried out in software Integration of the floating point unit first as a separate integrated circuit and then as part of the same microprocessor chip sped up floating point calculations br Occasionally physical limitations of integrated circuits made such practices as a bit slice approach necessary Instead of processing all of a long word on one integrated circuit multiple circuits in parallel processed subsets of each word While this required extra logic to handle for example carry and overflow within each slice the result was a system that could handle for example bit words using integrated circuits with a capacity for only four bits each br The ability to put large numbers of transistors on one chip makes it feasible to integrate memory on the same die as the processor This CPU cache has the advantage of faster access than off chip memory and increases the processing speed of the system for many applications Processor clock frequency has increased more rapidly than external memory speed so cache memory is necessary if the processor is not to be delayed by slower external memory br The design of some processors has become complicated enough to be difficult to fully test and this has caused problems at large cloud providers br br br Special purpose designs br A microprocessor is a general purpose processing entity Several specialized processing devices have followed br br A digital signal processor DSP is specialized for signal processing br Graphics processing units GPUs are processors designed primarily for realtime rendering of images br Other specialized units exist for video processing and machine vision See Hardware acceleration br Microcontrollers in embedded systems and peripheral devices br Systems on chip SoCs often integrate one or more microprocessor and microcontroller cores with other components such as radio modems and are used in smartphones and tablet computers br br br Speed and power considerations br br Microprocessors can be selected for differing applications based on their word size which is a measure of their complexity Longer word sizes allow each clock cycle of a processor to carry out more computation but correspond to physically larger integrated circuit dies with higher standby and operating power consumption or bit processors are widely integrated into microcontrollers operating embedded systems Where a system is expected to handle larger volumes of data or require a more flexible user interface or bit processors are used An or bit processor may be selected over a bit processor for system on a chip or microcontroller applications that require extremely low power electronics or are part of a mixed signal integrated circuit with noise sensitive on chip analog electronics such as high resolution analog to digital converters or both br Some people say that running bit arithmetic on an bit chip could end up using more power as the chip must execute software with multiple instructions br However others say that modern bit chips are always more power efficient than bit chips when running equivalent software routines br br br Embedded applications br Thousands of items that were traditionally not computer related include microprocessors These include household appliances vehicles and their accessories tools and test instruments toys light switches dimmers and electrical circuit breakers smoke alarms battery packs and hi fi audio visual components from DVD players to phonograph turntables Such products as cellular telephones DVD video system and HDTV broadcast systems fundamentally require consumer devices with powerful low cost microprocessors Increasingly stringent pollution control standards effectively require automobile manufacturers to use microprocessor engine management systems to allow optimal control of emissions over the widely varying operating conditions of an automobile Non programmable controls would require bulky or costly implementation to achieve the results possible with a microprocessor br A microprocessor control program embedded software can be tailored to fit the needs of a product line allowing upgrades in performance with minimal redesign of the product Unique features can be implemented in product line s various models at negligible production cost br Microprocessor control of a system can provide control strategies that would be impractical to implement using electromechanical controls or purpose built electronic controls For example an internal combustion engine s control system can adjust ignition timing based on engine speed load temperature and any observed tendency for knocking allowing the engine to operate on a range of fuel grades br br br History br br The advent of low cost computers on integrated circuits has transformed modern society General purpose microprocessors in personal computers are used for computation text editing multimedia display and communication over the Internet Many more microprocessors are part of embedded systems providing digital control over myriad objects from appliances to automobiles to cellular phones and industrial process control Microprocessors perform binary operations based on Boolean logic named after George Boole The ability to operate computer systems using Boolean Logic was first proven in a thesis by master s student Claude Shannon who later went on to become a professor Shannon is considered The Father of Information Theory In Microprogramming was invented by Maurice Wilkes at the University of Manchester UK from the realisation that the central processor could be controlled by a specialised program in a dedicated ROM Wilkes is also credited with the idea of symbolic labels macros and subroutine libraries br Following the development of MOS integrated circuit chips in the early s MOS chips reached higher transistor density and lower manufacturing costs than bipolar integrated circuits by MOS chips further increased in complexity at a rate predicted by Moore s law leading to large scale integration LSI with hundreds of transistors on a single MOS chip by the late s The application of MOS LSI chips to computing was the basis for the first microprocessors as engineers began recognizing that a complete computer processor could be contained on several MOS LSI chips Designers in the late s were striving to integrate the central processing unit CPU functions of a computer onto a handful of MOS LSI chips called microprocessor unit MPU chipsets br While there is disagreement over who invented the microprocessor the first commercially available microprocessor was the Intel released as a single MOS LSI chip in The single chip microprocessor was made possible with the development of MOS silicon gate technology SGT The earliest MOS transistors had aluminium metal gates which Italian physicist Federico Faggin replaced with silicon self aligned gates to develop the first silicon gate MOS chip at Fairchild Semiconductor in Faggin later joined Intel and used his silicon gate MOS technology to develop the along with Marcian Hoff Stanley Mazor and Masatoshi Shima in The was designed for Busicom which had earlier proposed a multi chip design in before Faggin s team at Intel changed it into a new single chip design Intel introduced the first commercial microprocessor the bit Intel in It was soon followed by the bit microprocessor Intel in The MP chipset used in the F Central Air Data Computer in has also been cited as an early microprocessor but was not known to the public until declassified in br Other embedded uses of bit and bit microprocessors such as terminals printers various kinds of automation etc followed soon after Affordable bit microprocessors with bit addressing also led to the first general purpose microcomputers from the mid s on br The first use of the term microprocessor is attributed to Viatron Computer Systems describing the custom integrated circuit used in their System small computer system announced in br Since the early s the increase in capacity of microprocessors has followed Moore s law this originally suggested that the number of components that can be fitted onto a chip doubles every year With present technology it is actually every two years and as a result Moore later changed the period to two years br br br First projects br These projects delivered a microprocessor at about the same time Garrett AiResearch s Central Air Data Computer CADC Texas Instruments TMS NC September and Intel s November based on an earlier Busicom design Arguably Four Phase Systems AL microprocessor was also delivered in br br br Four Phase Systems AL br The Four Phase Systems AL was an bit bit slice chip containing eight registers and an ALU It was designed by Lee Boysel in At the time it formed part of a nine chip bit CPU with three AL s It was later called a microprocessor when in response to s litigation by Texas Instruments Boysel constructed a demonstration system where a single AL formed part of a courtroom demonstration computer system together with RAM ROM and an input output device br br br Garrett AiResearch CADC br br In Garrett AiResearch who employed designers Ray Holt and Steve Geller was invited to produce a digital computer to compete with electromechanical systems then under development for the main flight control computer in the US Navy s new F Tomcat fighter The design was complete by and used a MOS based chipset as the core CPU The design was significantly approximately times smaller and much more reliable than the mechanical systems it competed against and was used in all of the early Tomcat models This system contained a bit pipelined parallel multi microprocessor The Navy refused to allow publication of the design until Released in the documentation on the CADC and the MP chipset are well known Ray Holt s autobiographical story of this design and development is presented in the book The Accidental Engineer br br Ray Holt graduated from California State Polytechnic University Pomona in and began his computer design career with the CADC From its inception it was shrouded in secrecy until when at Holt s request the US Navy allowed the documents into the public domain Holt has claimed that no one has compared this microprocessor with those that came later According to Parab et al The scientific papers and literature published around reveal that the MP digital processor used for the F Tomcat aircraft of the US Navy qualifies as the first microprocessor Although interesting it was not a single chip processor as was not the Intel they both were more like a set of parallel building blocks you could use to make a general purpose form It contains a CPU RAM ROM and two other support chips like the Intel It was made from the same P channel technology operated at military specifications and had larger chips an excellent computer engineering design by any standards Its design indicates a major advance over Intel and two year earlier It actually worked and was flying in the F when the Intel was announced It indicates that today s industry theme of converging DSP microcontroller architectures was started in This convergence of DSP and microcontroller architectures is known as a digital signal controller br br br Gilbert Hyatt br In American engineer Gilbert Hyatt was awarded U S Patent No which was based on a bit serial computer he built at his Northridge California home in from boards of bipolar chips after quitting his job at Teledyne in though the patent had been submitted in December and prior to Texas Instruments filings for the TMX and TMS Hyatt s invention was never manufactured This nonetheless led to claims that Hyatt was the inventor of the microprocessor and the payment of substantial royalties through a Philips N V subsidiary until Texas Instruments prevailed in a complex legal battle in when the U S Patent Office overturned key parts of the patent while allowing Hyatt to keep it Hyatt said in a Los Angeles Times article that his invention would have been created had his prospective investors backed him and that the venture investors leaked details of his chip to the industry though he did not elaborate with evidence to support this claim In the same article The Chip author T R Reid was quoted as saying that historians may ultimately place Hyatt as a co inventor of the microprocessor in the way that Intel s Noyce and TI s Kilby share credit for the invention of the chip in Kilby got the idea first but Noyce made it practical The legal ruling finally favored Noyce but they are considered co inventors The same could happen here Hyatt would go on to fight a decades long legal battle with the state of California over alleged unpaid taxes on his patent s windfall after which would culminate in a landmark Supreme Court case addressing states sovereign immunity in Franchise Tax Board of California v Hyatt br br br Texas Instruments TMX br Along with Intel who developed the Texas Instruments developed in a one chip CPU replacement for the Datapoint terminal the TMX later TMC Like the it was rejected by customer Datapoint According to Gary Boone the TMX never reached production Still it reached a working prototype state at February therefore it is the world s first bit microprocessor Since it was built to the same specification its instruction set was very similar to the Intel br br br Texas Instruments TMS NC br The TMS NC was announced September and implemented a four function calculator The TMS NC despite its designation was not part of the TMS series it was later redesignated as part of the TMS series which was used in the TI Datamath calculator Although marketed as a calculator on a chip the TMS NC was fully programmable including on the chip a CPU with an bit instruction word bits instructions of ROM and bits of RAM br br br Pico General Instrument br br In Pico Electronics and General Instrument GI introduced their first collaboration in ICs a complete single chip calculator IC for the Monroe Litton Royal Digital III calculator This chip could also arguably lay claim to be one of the first microprocessors or microcontrollers having ROM RAM and a RISC instruction set on chip The layout for the four layers of the PMOS process was hand drawn at x scale on mylar film a significant task at the time given the complexity of the chip br Pico was a spinout by five GI design engineers whose vision was to create single chip calculator ICs They had significant previous design experience on multiple calculator chipsets with both GI and Marconi Elliott The key team members had originally been tasked by Elliott Automation to create an bit computer in MOS and had helped establish a MOS Research Laboratory in Glenrothes Scotland in br Calculators were becoming the largest single market for semiconductors so Pico and GI went on to have significant success in this burgeoning market GI continued to innovate in microprocessors and microcontrollers with products including the CP IOB and PIC In the GI Microelectronics business was spun out into the Microchip PIC microcontroller business br br br Intel br br The Intel is often falsely regarded as the first true microprocessor built on a single chip priced at US equivalent to in The claim of being the first is definitely false as the earlier TMS NC was also a true microprocessor built on a single chip and the same applies for the prototype only bit TMX The first known advertisement for the is dated November and appeared in Electronic News The microprocessor was designed by a team consisting of Italian engineer Federico Faggin American engineers Marcian Hoff and Stanley Mazor and Japanese engineer Masatoshi Shima br The project that produced the originated in when Busicom a Japanese calculator manufacturer asked Intel to build a chipset for high performance desktop calculators Busicom s original design called for a programmable chip set consisting of seven different chips Three of the chips were to make a special purpose CPU with its program stored in ROM and its data stored in shift register read write memory Ted Hoff the Intel engineer assigned to evaluate the project believed the Busicom design could be simplified by using dynamic RAM storage for data rather than shift register memory and a more traditional general purpose CPU architecture Hoff came up with a four chip architectural proposal a ROM chip for storing the programs a dynamic RAM chip for storing data a simple I O device and a bit central processing unit CPU Although not a chip designer he felt the CPU could be integrated into a single chip but as he lacked the technical know how the idea remained just a wish for the time being br br While the architecture and specifications of the MCS came from the interaction of Hoff with Stanley Mazor a software engineer reporting to him and with Busicom engineer Masatoshi Shima during Mazor and Hoff moved on to other projects In April Intel hired Italian engineer Federico Faggin as project leader a move that ultimately made the single chip CPU final design a reality Shima meanwhile designed the Busicom calculator firmware and assisted Faggin during the first six months of the implementation Faggin who originally developed the silicon gate technology SGT in at Fairchild Semiconductor and designed the world s first commercial integrated circuit using SGT the Fairchild had the correct background to lead the project into what would become the first commercial general purpose microprocessor Since SGT was his very own invention Faggin also used it to create his new methodology for random logic design that made it possible to implement a single chip CPU with the proper speed power dissipation and cost The manager of Intel s MOS Design Department was Leslie L Vad sz at the time of the MCS development but Vad sz s attention was completely focused on the mainstream business of semiconductor memories so he left the leadership and the management of the MCS project to Faggin who was ultimately responsible for leading the project to its realization Production units of the were first delivered to Busicom in March and shipped to other customers in late br br br bit designs br br The Intel was followed in by the Intel intel s first bit microprocessor The was not however an extension of the design but instead the culmination of a separate design project at Intel arising from a contract with Computer Terminals Corporation of San Antonio TX for a chip for a terminal they were designing the Datapoint fundamental aspects of the design came not from Intel but from CTC In CTC s Vic Poor and Harry Pyle developed the original design for the instruction set and operation of the processor In CTC contracted two companies Intel and Texas Instruments to make a single chip implementation known as the CTC In late or early TI dropped out being unable to make a reliable part In with Intel yet to deliver the part CTC opted to use their own implementation in the Datapoint using traditional TTL logic instead thus the first machine to run code was not in fact a microprocessor at all and was delivered a year earlier Intel s version of the microprocessor arrived in late but was too late slow and required a number of additional support chips CTC had no interest in using it CTC had originally contracted Intel for the chip and would have owed them US equivalent to in for their design work To avoid paying for a chip they did not want and could not use CTC released Intel from their contract and allowed them free use of the design Intel marketed it as the in April as the world s first bit microprocessor It was the basis for the famous Mark computer kit advertised in the magazine Radio Electronics in This processor had an bit data bus and a bit address bus br The was the precursor to the successful Intel which offered improved performance over the and required fewer support chips Federico Faggin conceived and designed it using high voltage N channel MOS The Zilog Z was also a Faggin design using low voltage N channel with depletion load and derivative Intel bit processors all designed with the methodology Faggin created for the Motorola released the competing in August and the similar MOS Technology was released in both designed largely by the same people The family rivaled the Z in popularity during the s br A low overall cost little packaging simple computer bus requirements and sometimes the integration of extra circuitry e g the Z s built in memory refresh circuitry allowed the home computer revolution to accelerate sharply in the early s This delivered such inexpensive machines as the Sinclair ZX which sold for US equivalent to in A variation of the the MOS Technology was used in the Commodore and yet another variant the powered the Commodore br The Western Design Center Inc WDC introduced the CMOS WDC C in and licensed the design to several firms It was used as the CPU in the Apple IIe and IIc personal computers as well as in medical implantable grade pacemakers and defibrillators automotive industrial and consumer devices WDC pioneered the licensing of microprocessor designs later followed by ARM bit and other microprocessor intellectual property IP providers in the s br Motorola introduced the MC in It was an ambitious and well thought through bit design that was source compatible with the and implemented using purely hard wired logic subsequent bit microprocessors typically used microcode to some extent as CISC design requirements were becoming too complex for pure hard wired logic br Another early bit microprocessor was the Signetics which enjoyed a brief surge of interest due to its innovative and powerful instruction set architecture br A seminal microprocessor in the world of spaceflight was RCA s RCA aka CDP RCA COSMAC introduced in which was used on board the Galileo probe to Jupiter launched arrived RCA COSMAC was the first to implement CMOS technology The CDP was used because it could be run at very low power and because a variant was available fabricated using a special production process silicon on sapphire SOS which provided much better protection against cosmic radiation and electrostatic discharge than that of any other processor of the era Thus the SOS version of the was said to be the first radiation hardened microprocessor br The RCA had a static design meaning that the clock frequency could be made arbitrarily low or even stopped This let the Galileo spacecraft use minimum electric power for long uneventful stretches of a voyage Timers or sensors would awaken the processor in time for important tasks such as navigation updates attitude control data acquisition and radio communication Current versions of the Western Design Center C and C also have static cores and thus retain data even when the clock is completely halted br br br bit designs br The Intersil family consisted of a bit microprocessor the and a range of peripheral support and memory ICs The microprocessor recognised the DEC PDP minicomputer instruction set As such it was sometimes referred to as the CMOS PDP Since it was also produced by Harris Corporation it was also known as the Harris HM By virtue of its CMOS technology and associated benefits the was being incorporated into some military designs until the early s br br br bit designs br br The first multi chip bit microprocessor was the National Semiconductor IMP introduced in early An bit version of the chipset was introduced in as the IMP br Other early multi chip bit microprocessors include the MCP that Digital Equipment Corporation DEC used in the LSI OEM board set and the packaged PDP minicomputer and the Fairchild Semiconductor MicroFlame both introduced in In late National introduced the first bit single chip microprocessor the National Semiconductor PACE which was later followed by an NMOS version the INS br Next in list is the General Instrument CP released in February which was used mainly in the Intellivision console br Another early single chip bit microprocessor was TI s TMS which was also compatible with their TI line of minicomputers The was used in the TI minicomputer the TI A home computer and the TM line of OEM microcomputer boards The chip was packaged in a large ceramic pin DIP package while most bit microprocessors such as the Intel used the more common smaller and less expensive plastic pin DIP A follow on chip the TMS was designed to compete with the Intel had the full TI bit instruction set used a plastic pin package moved data bits at a time but could only address KB A third chip the TMS was a new design The family later expanded to include the and br The Western Design Center WDC introduced the CMOS bit upgrade of the WDC CMOS C in The bit microprocessor was the core of the Apple IIGS and later the Super Nintendo Entertainment System making it one of the most popular bit designs of all time br Intel upsized their design into the bit Intel the first member of the x family which powers most modern PC type computers Intel introduced the as a cost effective way of porting software from the lines and succeeded in winning much business on that premise The a version of the that used an bit external data bus was the microprocessor in the first IBM PC Intel then released the and the and in the bit cementing their PC market dominance with the processor family s backwards compatibility The and were essentially versions of the and enhanced with some onboard peripherals and a few new instructions Although Intel s and were not used in IBM PC type designs second source versions from NEC the V and V frequently were The and successors had an innovative but limited method of memory segmentation while the introduced a full featured segmented memory management unit MMU The introduced a flat bit memory model with paged memory management br The bit Intel x processors up to and including the do not include floating point units FPUs Intel introduced the and math coprocessors to add hardware floating point and transcendental function capabilities to the through CPUs The works with the and the works with the but not the the works with the and the works with the The combination of an x CPU and an x coprocessor forms a single multi chip microprocessor the two chips are programmed as a unit using a single integrated instruction set The and coprocessors are connected in parallel with the data and address buses of their parent processor and directly execute instructions intended for them The and coprocessors are interfaced to the CPU through I O ports in the CPU s address space this is transparent to the program which does not need to know about or access these I O ports directly the program accesses the coprocessor and its registers through normal instruction opcodes br br br bit designs br br bit designs had only been on the market briefly when bit implementations started to appear br The most significant of the bit designs is the Motorola MC introduced in The k as it was widely known had bit registers in its programming model but used bit internal data paths three bit Arithmetic Logic Units and a bit external data bus to reduce pin count and externally supported only bit addresses internally it worked with full bit addresses In PC based IBM compatible mainframes the MC internal microcode was modified to emulate the bit System IBM mainframe Motorola generally described it as a bit processor The combination of high performance large megabytes or bytes memory space and fairly low cost made it the most popular CPU design of its class The Apple Lisa and Macintosh designs made use of the as did other designs in the mid s including the Atari ST and Amiga br The world s first single chip fully bit microprocessor with bit data paths bit buses and bit addresses was the AT T Bell Labs BELLMAC A with first samples in and general production in After the divestiture of AT T in it was renamed the WE WE for Western Electric and had two follow on generations the WE and WE These microprocessors were used in the AT T B and B minicomputers in the B the world s first desktop super microcomputer in the Companion the world s first bit laptop computer and in Alexander the world s first book sized super microcomputer featuring ROM pack memory cartridges similar to today s gaming consoles All these systems ran the UNIX System V operating system br The first commercial single chip fully bit microprocessor available on the market was the HP FOCUS br Intel s first bit microprocessor was the iAPX which was introduced in but was not a commercial success It had an advanced capability based object oriented architecture but poor performance compared to contemporary architectures such as Intel s own introduced which was almost four times as fast on typical benchmark tests However the results for the iAPX was partly due to a rushed and therefore suboptimal Ada compiler br Motorola s success with the led to the MC which added virtual memory support The MC introduced in added full bit data and address buses The became hugely popular in the Unix supermicrocomputer market and many small companies e g Altos Charles River Data Systems Cromemco produced desktop size systems The MC was introduced next improving upon the previous design by integrating the MMU into the chip The continued success led to the MC which included an FPU for better math performance The failed to achieve its performance goals and was not released and the follow up MC was released into a market saturated by much faster RISC designs The k family faded from use in the early s br Other large companies designed the and follow ons into embedded equipment At one point there were more s in embedded equipment than there were Intel Pentiums in PCs The ColdFire processor cores are derivatives of the br During this time early to mid s National Semiconductor introduced a very similar bit pinout bit internal microprocessor called the NS later renamed the full bit version named the NS Later National Semiconductor produced the NS which allowed two CPUs to reside on the same memory bus with built in arbitration The NS outperformed the MC but the NS which arrived at approximately the same time as the MC did not have enough performance The third generation chip the NS was different It had about double the performance of the MC which was released around the same time The appearance of RISC processors like the AM and MC now both dead influenced the architecture of the final core the NS Technically advanced with a superscalar RISC core bit bus and internally overclocked it could still execute Series instructions through real time translation br When National Semiconductor decided to leave the Unix market the chip was redesigned into the Swordfish Embedded processor with a set of on chip peripherals The chip turned out to be too expensive for the laser printer market and was killed The design team went to Intel and there designed the Pentium processor which is very similar to the NS core internally The big success of the Series was in the laser printer market where the NS CG with microcoded BitBlt instructions had very good price performance and was adopted by large companies like Canon By the mid s Sequent introduced the first SMP server class computer using the NS This was one of the design s few wins and it disappeared in the late s The MIPS R and R were highly successful bit RISC microprocessors They were used in high end workstations and servers by SGI among others Other designs included the Zilog Z which arrived too late to market to stand a chance and disappeared quickly br The ARM first appeared in This is a RISC processor design which has since come to dominate the bit embedded systems processor space due in large part to its power efficiency its licensing model and its wide selection of system development tools Semiconductor manufacturers generally license cores and integrate them into their own system on a chip products only a few such vendors such as Apple are licensed to modify the ARM cores or create their own Most cell phones include an ARM processor as do a wide variety of other products There are microcontroller oriented ARM cores without virtual memory support as well as symmetric multiprocessor SMP applications processors with virtual memory br From to the bit x architectures became increasingly dominant in desktop laptop and server markets and these microprocessors became faster and more capable Intel had licensed early versions of the architecture to other companies but declined to license the Pentium so AMD and Cyrix built later versions of the architecture based on their own designs During this span these processors increased in complexity transistor count and capability instructions second by at least three orders of magnitude Intel s Pentium line is probably the most famous and recognizable bit processor model at least with the public at broad br br br bit designs in personal computers br While bit microprocessor designs have been in use in several markets since the early s including the Nintendo gaming console in the early s saw the introduction of bit microprocessors targeted at the PC market br With AMD s introduction of a bit architecture backwards compatible with x x also called AMD in September followed by Intel s near fully compatible bit extensions first called IA e or EM T later renamed Intel the bit desktop era began Both versions can run bit legacy applications without any performance penalty as well as new bit software With operating systems Windows XP x Windows Vista x Windows x Linux BSD and macOS that run bit natively the software is also geared to fully utilize the capabilities of such processors The move to bits is more than just an increase in register size from the IA as it also doubles the number of general purpose registers br The move to bits by PowerPC had been intended since the architecture s design in the early s and was not a major cause of incompatibility Existing integer registers are extended as are all related data pathways but as was the case with IA both floating point and vector units had been operating at or above bits for several years Unlike what happened when IA was extended to x no new general purpose registers were added in bit PowerPC so any performance gained when using the bit mode for applications making no use of the larger address space is minimal br In ARM introduced the new bit ARM architecture br br br RISC br br In the mid s to early s a crop of new high performance reduced instruction set computer RISC microprocessors appeared influenced by discrete RISC like CPU designs such as the IBM and others RISC microprocessors were initially used in special purpose machines and Unix workstations but then gained wide acceptance in other roles br The first commercial RISC microprocessor design was released in by MIPS Computer Systems the bit R the R was not released In HP released its first system with a PA RISC CPU In in the non Unix Acorn computers bit then cache less ARM based Acorn Archimedes became the first commercial success using the ARM architecture then known as Acorn RISC Machine ARM first silicon ARM in The R made the design truly practical and the R introduced the world s first commercially available bit RISC microprocessor Competing projects would result in the IBM POWER and Sun SPARC architectures Soon every major vendor was releasing a RISC design including the AT T CRISP AMD Intel i and Intel i Motorola DEC Alpha br In the late s only two bit RISC architectures were still produced in volume for non embedded applications SPARC and Power ISA but as ARM has become increasingly powerful in the early s it became the third RISC architecture in the general computing segment br br br SMP and multi core design br br SMP symmetric multiprocessing is a configuration of two four or more CPU s in pairs that are typically used in servers certain workstations and in desktop personal computers since the s A multi core processor is a single CPU that contains more than one microprocessor core br This popular two socket motherboard from Abit was released in as the first SMP enabled PC motherboard the Intel Pentium Pro was the first commercial CPU offered to system builders and enthusiasts The Abit BP supports two Intel Celeron CPU s and when used with a SMP enabled operating system Windows NT Linux many applications obtain much higher performance than a single CPU The early Celerons are easily overclockable and hobbyists used these relatively inexpensive CPU s clocked as high as Mhz far beyond Intel s specification After discovering the capacity of these motherboards Intel removed access to the multiplier in later CPU s br In IBM released the POWER CPU it was a processor that was developed over five years of research began in using a team of researchers The effort to accomplish the impossible was buttressed by development of and through remote collaboration and assigning younger engineers to work with more experienced engineers The teams work achieved success with the new microprocessor Power It is a two in one CPU that more than doubled performance at half the price of the competition and a major advance in computing The business magazine eWeek wrote The newly designed GHz Power represents a tremendous leap over its predecessor An industry analyst Brad Day of Giga Information Group said IBM is getting very aggressive and this server is a game changer br The Power won Analysts Choice Award for Best Workstation Server Processor of and it broke notable records including winning a contest against the best players on the Jeopardy U S television show br Intel s codename Yonah CPU s launched on Jan and were manufactured with two dies packaged on a multi chip module In a hotly contested marketplace AMD and others released new versions of multi core CPU s AMD s SMP enabled Athlon MP CPU s from the AthlonXP line in Sun released the Niagara and Niagara with eight cores AMD s Athlon X was released in June The companies were engaged in a never ending race for speed indeed more demanding software mandated more processing power and faster CPU speeds br By dual and quad core processors became widely used in PCs and laptops newer processors similar to the higher cost professional level Intel Xeon s with additional cores that execute instructions in parallel so software performance typically increases provided the software is designed to utilize advanced hardware Operating systems provided support for multiple cores and SMD CPU s many software applications including large workload and resource intensive applications such as D games are programmed to take advantage of multiple core and multi CPU systems br Apple Intel and AMD currently lead the market with multiple core desktop and workstation CPU s Although they frequently leapfrog each other for the lead in the performance tier Intel retains higher frequencies and thus has the fastest single core performance while AMD is often the leader in multi threaded routines due to a more advanced ISA and the process node the CPU s are fabricated on br Multiprocessing concepts for multi core multi cpu configurations are related to Amdahl s law br br br Market statistics br In about of all CPUs sold in the world were bit microcontrollers of which over billion were sold br In less than of all the CPUs sold in the world were bit or more Of all the bit CPUs sold about are used in desktop or laptop personal computers Most microprocessors are used in embedded control applications such as household appliances automobiles and computer peripherals Taken as a whole the average price for a microprocessor microcontroller or DSP is just over US equivalent to in br In about billion equivalent to about billion in worth of microprocessors were manufactured and sold Although about half of that money was spent on CPUs used in desktop or laptop personal computers those count for only about of all CPUs sold The quality
