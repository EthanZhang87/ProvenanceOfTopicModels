id: 1088870
An output device is any piece of computer hardware that converts information or data into a human perceptible form or historically into a physical machine readable form for use with other non computerized equipment It can be text graphics tactile audio or video Examples include monitors printers speakers headphones projectors GPS devices optical mark readers and braille readers br In an industrial setting output devices also include printers for paper tape and punched cards especially where the tape or cards are subsequently used to control industrial equipment such as an industrial loom with electrical robotics which is not fully computerized br br br Visual br br A display device is the most common form of output device which presents output visually on computer screen The output appears temporarily on the screen and can easily be altered or erased br With all in one PCs notebook computers hand held PCs and other devices the term display screen is used for the display device The display devices are also used in home entertainment systems mobile systems cameras and video game systems br Display devices form images by illuminating a desired configuration of Raster display devices are organized in the form of a dimensional matrix with rows and columns This is done many times within a second typically or Hz on consumer devices br br br Interface br br The interface between a computer s CPU and the display is a Graphics Processing Unit GPU This processor is used to form images on a framebuffer When the image is to be sent to the display the GPU sends its image through a video display controller to generate a video signal which is then sent to a display interface such as HDMI VGA or DVI br GPUs can be divided into discrete and integrated units the former being an external unit and the latter of which is included within a CPU die Discrete graphics cards are almost always connected to the host through the PCI Express bus while older graphics cards may have used AGP or PCI Some mobile computers support an external graphics card through Thunderbolt via PCIe br br br Form factors br br br Monitor br br A monitor is a standalone display commonly used with a desktop computer or in conjunction to a laptop as an external display The monitor is connected to the host through the use of a display cable such as HDMI DisplayPort VGA and more br Older monitors use CRT technology while modern monitors are typically flat panel displays using a plethora of technologies such as TFT LCD LED OLED and more br br br Internal display br Almost all mobile devices incorporate an internal display These internal displays are connected to the computer through an internal display interface such as LVDS or eDP The chief advantage of these displays is their portability br br br Terminal br br Prior to the development of modern pixel oriented displays computer terminals were used composed of a character oriented display device known as a VDU and a computer keyboard br These terminals were often monochromatic and could only display text Rudimentary graphics could be displayed through the use of ASCII art along with box drawing characters Teleprinters were the precursors to these devices br br br Projector br br A projector is a display that projects the computer image onto a surface through the use of a high power lamp These displays are seen in use to show slideshow presentations or in movie screenings br br br Technologies br br Display technologies can be classified based on working principle lighting or lack thereof pixel layout and more br br Cathode ray tube CRT br CRT screens produce an image using electron tube which fires electrons at a phosphorous coated screen to light up pixels in order to display images br Liquid crystal display LCD br An LCD is a display technology employing the use of liquid crystals to form images br Thin film transistor TFT br A TFT refers to the thin layer of transistors used with an LCD br LED backlit LCD br An LCD display which uses LEDs as a backlight Prior to the use of LED based backlighting Cold Cathode Fluorescent CCFL tubes were used LED displays use an array of LEDs to form an image br Organic Light Emitting Diode OLED br Unlike an LED display an OLED display does not use a backlight br Electronic paper e ink br An e ink display uses encapsulated pigment to form an image resembling printed paper commonly used in e book readers br br br Color output br br br Monochromatic display br A monochrome display is a type of CRT common in the early days of computing from the s through the s before color monitors became popular br They are still widely used in applications such as computerized cash register systems Green screen was the common name for a monochrome monitor using a green P phosphor screen br br br Colored display br Color monitors sometimes called RGB monitors accept three separate signals red green and blue unlike a monochromatic display which accepts one Color monitors implement the RGB color model by using three different phosphors that appear red green and blue when activated By placing the phosphors directly next to each other and activating them with different intensities color monitors can create an unlimited number of colors In practice however the real number of colors that any monitor can display is controlled by the video adapter br br br Auditory br br A speaker is an output device that produces sound through an oscillating transducer called a driver The equivalent input device is a microphone br Speakers are plugged into a computer s sound card via a myriad of interfaces such as a phone connector for analog audio or SPDIF for digital audio While speakers can be connected through cables wireless speakers are connected to the host device through radio technology such as Bluetooth br Speakers are most often used in pairs which allows the speaker system to produce positional audio When more than one pair is used it is referred to as surround sound br Certain models of computers includes a built in speaker which may sacrifice audio quality in favor of size For example the built in speaker of a smartphone allows the users to listen to media without attaching an external speaker br br br Interface br br The interface between an auditory output device and a computer is the sound card Sound cards may be included on a computer s motherboard installed as an expansion card or as a desktop unit br The sound card may offer either an analog or digital output In the latter case output is often transmitted using SPDIF as either an electrical signal or an optical interface known as TOSLINK Digital outputs are then decoded by an AV receiver br In the case of wireless audio the computer merely transmits a radio signal and responsibility of decoding and output is shifted to the speaker br br br Form factors br br br Computer speakers br br While speakers can be used for any purpose there are computer speakers which are built for computer use These speakers are designed to sit on a desk and as such cannot be as large as conventional speakers br Computer speakers may be powered via USB and are most often connected through a mm phone connector br br br PC speaker br br The PC speaker is a simple loudspeaker built into IBM PC compatible computers Unlike a speaker used with a sound card the PC speaker is only meant to produce square waves to produce sounds such as beeping br Modern computers utilize a piezoelectric buzzer or a small speaker as the PC speaker br PC speakers are used during Power on self test to identify errors during the computer s boot process without needing a video output device to be present and functional br br br Studio monitor br br A Studio monitor is a speaker used in a studio environment These speakers optimize for accuracy A monitor produces a flat linear frequency response which does not emphasize or de emphasize of particular frequencies br br br Headphones br br Headphones earphones and earpieces are a kind of speaker which is supported either on the user s head or the user s ear br Unlike a speaker headphones are not meant to be audible to people nearby which suits them for use in the public office or other quiet environments br Noise cancelling headphones are built with ambient noise reduction capabilities which may employ active noise cancelling br br br Technology br Loudspeakers are composed of several components within an enclosure such as several drivers active amplifiers crossovers and other electronics Multiple drivers are used to reproduce the full frequency range of human hearing with tweeters producing high pitches and woofers producing low pitches Full range speakers use only one driver to produce as much of a frequency response as possible br While Hi Fi speakers attempt to produce high quality sound computer speakers may compromise on these aspects due to their limited size and to be inexpensive and the latter often uses full range speakers as a result br br br Tactile br br br Braille display br br A refreshable braille display outputs braille characters through the use of pins raised out of holes on its surface It is ordinarily used by visually impaired individuals as an alternative to a screen reader br br br Haptic technology br br Haptic technology involves the use of vibration and other motion to induce a sense of touch Haptic technology was introduced in the late s for use in game controllers to provide tactile feedback while a user is playing a video game Haptic feedback has seen further uses in the automotive field aircraft simulation systems and brain computer interfaces br In mobile devices Apple added haptic technology in various devices marketed as D Touch and Force Touch In this form several devices could sense the amount of force exerted on its touchscreen while MacBooks could sense two levels of force on its touchpad which will produce a haptic sensation br br br Printing devices br br br Printer br br A printer is a device that outputs data to be put on a physical item usually a piece of paper Printers operate by transferring ink onto this medium in the form of the image received from the host br Early printers could only print text but later developments allowed printing of graphics Modern printers can receive data in multiple forms like vector graphics as an image a program written in a page description language or a string of characters br Multiple types of printers exist br br Inkjet printers br An inkjet printer injects tiny droplets onto the printing medium via a series of nozzles on a printing head br Laser printers br A laser printer uses a laser to charge a drum of toner in order to mark points where the toner would stick onto the medium br Thermal printers br A printer which heats up a thermally sensitive roll of paper to reveal ink Most often seen in retail stores to print receipts br Dot matrix printer br A printer which uses impact to transfer ink from a ribbon to the medium br br br Plotter br br A plotter is a type of printer used to print vector graphics Instead of drawing pixels onto the printing medium the plotter draws lines which may be done with a writing implement such as a pencil or pen br br br Teleprinter br br A teleprinter or teletypewriter TTY is a type of printer that is meant for sending and receiving messages Before displays were used to display data visually early computers would only have a teleprinter for use to access the system console As the operator would enter commands into its keyboard the teleprinter would output the results onto a piece of paper The teleprinter would ultimately be succeeded by a computer terminal which had a display instead of a printer br br br Headless operation br br A computer can still function without an output device as is commonly done with servers where the primary interaction is typically over a data network A number of protocols exist over serial ports or LAN cables to determine operational status and to gain control over low level configuration from a remote location without having a local display device If the server is configured with a video output it is often possible to connect a temporary display device for maintenance or administration purposes while the server continues to operate normally sometimes several servers are multiplexed to a single display device though a KVM switch or equivalent br Some methods to use remote systems are br br Remote access br The computer s console can be accessed through a network connection such as the Internet using protocols such as telnet or SSH br Remote desktop br Allows a Graphical User Interface to be accessed through remote access even without a monitor br KVM switch br Multiple computers are connected to a single display device which can be switched between computers br Serial port br A serial console can be connected to access the device s console br br br See
