title: Air data inertial reference unit
id: 7019701
An Air Data Inertial Reference Unit ADIRU is a key component of the integrated Air Data Inertial Reference System ADIRS which supplies air data airspeed angle of attack and altitude and inertial reference position and attitude information to the pilots electronic flight instrument system displays as well as other systems on the aircraft such as the engines autopilot aircraft flight control system and landing gear systems An ADIRU acts as a single fault tolerant source of navigational data for both pilots of an aircraft It may be complemented by a secondary attitude air data reference unit SAARU as in the Boeing design br This device is used on various military aircraft as well as civilian airliners starting with the Airbus A and Boeing br br br Description br An ADIRS consists of up to three fault tolerant ADIRUs located in the aircraft electronic rack an associated control and display unit CDU in the cockpit and remotely mounted air data modules ADMs The No ADIRU is a redundant unit that may be selected to supply data to either the commander s or the co pilot s displays in the event of a partial or complete failure of either the No or No ADIRU There is no cross channel redundancy between the Nos and ADIRUs as No ADIRU is the only alternate source of air and inertial reference data An inertial reference IR fault in ADIRU No or will cause a loss of attitude and navigation information on their associated primary flight display PFD and navigation display ND screens An air data reference ADR fault will cause the loss of airspeed and altitude information on the affected display In either case the information can only be restored by selecting the No ADIRU br Each ADIRU comprises an ADR and an inertial reference IR component br br br Air data reference br br The air data reference ADR component of an ADIRU provides airspeed Mach number angle of attack temperature and barometric altitude data Ram air pressure and static pressures used in calculating airspeed are measured by small ADMs located as close as possible to the respective pitot and static pressure sensors ADMs transmit their pressures to the ADIRUs through ARINC data buses br br br Inertial reference br The IR component of an ADIRU gives attitude flight path vector ground speed and positional data The ring laser gyroscope is a core enabling technology in the system and is used together with accelerometers GPS and other sensors to provide raw data The primary benefits of a ring laser over older mechanical gyroscopes are that there are no moving parts it is rugged and lightweight frictionless and does not resist a change in precession br br br Complexity in redundancy br Analysis of complex systems is itself so difficult as to be subject to errors in the certification process Complex interactions between flight computers and ADIRUs can lead to counter intuitive behaviour for the crew in the event of a failure In the case of Qantas Flight the captain switched the source of IR data from ADIRU to ADIRU following a failure of ADIRU however ADIRU continued to supply ADR data to the captain s primary flight display In addition the master flight control computer PRIM was switched from PRIM to PRIM then PRIM back to PRIM thereby creating a situation of uncertainty for the crew who did not know which redundant systems they were relying upon br Reliance on redundancy of aircraft systems can also lead to delays in executing needed repairs as airline operators rely on the redundancy to keep the aircraft system working without having to repair faults immediately br br br Failures and directives br br br FAA Airworthiness directive br On May the FAA issued airworthiness directive addressing dual critical failures during flight attributed to power supply issues affecting early Honeywell HG and HG ADIRU ring laser gyros used on several Boeing Airbus A A A A and A models br br br Airworthiness directive br On January the FAA issued airworthiness directive later superseded by AD which called for modification to the mounting of ADIRU in Airbus A family aircraft to prevent failure and loss of critical attitude and airspeed data br br br Alitalia A br br On June an Alitalia Airbus A registered as I BIKE departed Milan with a defective ADIRU as permitted by the Minimum Equipment List While approaching London Heathrow Airport during deteriorating weather another ADIRU failed leaving only one operable In the subsequent confusion the third was inadvertently reset losing its reference heading and disabling several automatic functions The crew was able to effect a safe landing after declaring a Pan pan br br br Malaysia Airlines Flight br br On August a serious incident involving Malaysia Airlines Flight occurred when an ADIRU fault in a Boeing H ER M MRG flying from Perth to Kuala Lumpur International caused the aircraft to act on false indications resulting in uncommanded manoeuvres In that incident the incorrect data impacted all planes of movement while the aircraft was climbing through feet m The aircraft pitched up and climbed to around feet m with the stall warning activated The pilots recovered the aircraft with the autopilot disengaged and requested a return to Perth During the return to Perth both the left and right autopilots were briefly activated by the crew but in both instances the aircraft pitched down and banked to the right The aircraft was flown manually for the remainder of the flight and landed safely in Perth There were no injuries and no damage to the aircraft The ATSB found that the main probable cause of this incident was a latent software error which allowed the ADIRU to use data from a failed accelerometer br The US Federal Aviation Administration issued Emergency Airworthiness Directive AD requiring all operators to install upgraded software to resolve the error br br br Qantas Flight br br On September Qantas Flight Airbus A registration VH QPA from Singapore to Perth exhibited ADIRU problems but without causing any disruption to the flight At feet m and estimated position nautical miles km north of Learmonth Western Australia NAV IR FAULT then minutes later NAV ADR FAULT notifications were received on the ECAM identifying navigation system faults in Inertial Reference Unit then in ADR respectively The crew reported to the later Qantas Flight investigation involving the same airframe and ADIRU that they had received numerous warning and caution messages which changed too quickly to be dealt with While investigating the problem the crew noticed a weak and intermittent ADR FAULT light and elected to switch off ADR after which they experienced no further problems There was no impact on the flight controls throughout the event The ADIRU manufacturer s recommended maintenance procedures were carried out after the flight and system testing found no further fault br br br Jetstar Flight br br On February a similar aircraft VH EBC operated by Qantas subsidiary Jetstar Airways was involved in a similar occurrence while conducting the JQ service from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam In this event which occurred nautical miles km east of Learmonth many of the same errors occurred in the ADIRU unit The crew followed the relevant procedure applicable at the time and the flight continued without problems br The ATSB has yet to confirm if this event is related to the other Airbus A ADIRU occurrences br br br Airworthiness directive br On August the FAA issued airworthiness directive expanding on the requirements of the earlier AD which had been determined to be an insufficient remedy In some cases it called for replacement of ADIRUs with newer models but allowed months from October to implement the directive br br br Qantas Flight br On October Qantas Flight using the same aircraft involved in the Flight incident departed Singapore for Perth Some time into the flight while cruising at ft a failure in the No ADIRU led to the autopilot automatically disengaging followed by two sudden uncommanded pitch down manoeuvres according to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau ATSB The accident injured up to passengers and crew ranging from minor to serious injuries The aircraft was able to make an emergency landing without further injuries The aircraft was equipped with a Northrop Grumman made ADIRS which investigators sent to the manufacturer for further testing br br br Qantas Flight br br On December Qantas Flight from Perth to Singapore a different Qantas A with registration VH QPG was involved in an incident at feet approximately nautical miles km north west of Perth and nautical miles km south of Learmonth Airport at WST The autopilot disconnected and the crew received an alert indicating a problem with ADIRU Number br br br Emergency Airworthiness Directive No E br On January the European Aviation Safety Agency issued Emergency Airworthiness Directive No E to address the above A and A Northrop Grumman ADIRU problem of incorrectly responding to a defective inertial reference In the event of a NAV IR fault the directed crew response is now to select OFF the relevant IR select OFF the relevant ADR and then turn the IR rotary mode selector to the OFF position The effect is to ensure that the faulted IR is powered off so that it no longer can send erroneous data to other systems br br br Air France Flight br On June Air France Flight an Airbus A en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris crashed in the Atlantic Ocean after transmitting automated messages indicating faults with various equipment including the ADIRU While examining possibly related events of weather related loss of ADIRS the NTSB decided to investigate two similar cases on cruising A s On a May Miami Sao Paulo TAM Flight registered as PT MVB and on a June Hong Kong Tokyo Northwest Airlines Flight registered as N NW each saw sudden loss of airspeed data at cruise altitude and consequent loss of ADIRS control br br br Ryanair Flight br On October the Boeing operating the flight from Porto Airport to Edinburgh Airport suffered a left ADIRU failure that resulted in the aircraft pitching up and climbing feet The left ADIRU was put in ATT attitude only mode in accordance with the Quick Reference Handbook but it continued to display erroneous attitude information to the captain The remainder of the flight was flown manually with an uneventful landing The UK s AAIB released the final report on October with the following recommendation It is recommended that Boeing Commercial Aircraft amend the Boeing Quick Reference Handbook to include a non normal checklist for situations when pitch and roll comparator annunciations appear on the attitude display br br br See also br
