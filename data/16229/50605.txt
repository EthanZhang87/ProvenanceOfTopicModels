Cerebral palsy CP is a group of movement disorders that appear in early childhood Signs and symptoms vary among people and over time but include poor coordination stiff muscles weak muscles and tremors There may be problems with sensation vision hearing and speech Often babies with cerebral palsy do not roll over sit crawl or walk as early as other children Other symptoms include seizures and problems with thinking or reasoning While symptoms may get more noticeable over the first years of life underlying problems do not worsen over time br Cerebral palsy is caused by abnormal development or damage to the parts of the brain that control movement balance and posture Most often the problems occur during pregnancy but may occur during childbirth or shortly afterwards Often the cause is unknown Risk factors include preterm birth being a twin certain infections or exposure to methylmercury during pregnancy a difficult delivery and head trauma during the first few years of life About of cases are believed to be due to an inherited genetic cause br Sub types are classified based on the specific problems present For example those with stiff muscles have spastic cerebral palsy poor coordination in locomotion have ataxic cerebral palsy and writhing movements have dyskinetic cerebral palsy Diagnosis is based on the child s development Blood tests and medical imaging may be used to rule out other possible causes br Some causes of CP are preventable through immunization of the mother and efforts to prevent head injuries in children such as improved safety There is no known cure for CP but supportive treatments medication and surgery may help individuals This may include physical therapy occupational therapy and speech therapy Mouse NGF has been shown to improve outcomes and has been available in China since Medications such as diazepam baclofen and botulinum toxin may help relax stiff muscles Surgery may include lengthening muscles and cutting overly active nerves Often external braces and Lycra splints and other assistive technology are helpful with mobility Some affected children can achieve near normal adult lives with appropriate treatment While alternative medicines are frequently used there is no evidence to support their use Potential treatments are being examined including stem cell therapy However more research is required to determine if it is effective and safe br Cerebral palsy is the most common movement disorder in children occurring in about per live births It has been documented throughout history with the first known descriptions occurring in the work of Hippocrates in the th century BCE Extensive study began in the th century by William John Little after whom spastic diplegia was called Little s disease William Osler first named it cerebral palsy from the German zerebrale Kinderl hmung cerebral child paralysis br br br Signs and symptoms br Cerebral palsy is defined as a group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and posture causing activity limitation that are attributed to non progressive disturbances that occurred in the developing fetal or infant brain While movement problems are the central feature of CP difficulties with thinking learning feeling communication and behavior often co occur with having epilepsy having difficulties with communication at least having problems with their vision and having learning disabilities Muscle contractions in people with cerebral palsy related high muscle tone are commonly thought to arise from overactivation Although most people with CP have problems with increased muscle tone some have low muscle tone instead High muscle tone can either be due to spasticity or dystonia br Cerebral palsy is characterized by abnormal muscle tone reflexes or motor development and coordination The neurological lesion is primary and permanent while orthopedic manifestations are secondary to high muscle tone and progressive In cerebral palsy with high muscle tone unequal growth between muscle tendon units and bone eventually leads to bone and joint deformities At first deformities are dynamic Over time deformities tend to become static and joint contractures develop Deformities in general and static deformities in specific joint contractures cause increasing gait difficulties in the form of tip toeing gait due to tightness of the Achilles tendon and scissoring gait due to tightness of the hip adductors These gait patterns are among the most common gait abnormalities in children with cerebral palsy However orthopaedic manifestations of cerebral palsy are diverse Additionally crouch gait also described as knee flexion gait is prevalent among children who possess the ability to walk The effects of cerebral palsy fall on a continuum of motor dysfunction which may range from slight clumsiness at the mild end of the spectrum to impairments so severe that they render coordinated movement virtually impossible at the other end of the spectrum br Babies born with severe cerebral palsy often have irregular posture their bodies may be either very floppy or very stiff Birth defects such as spinal curvature a small jawbone or a small head sometimes occur along with CP Symptoms may appear or change as a child gets older Babies born with cerebral palsy do not immediately present with symptoms Classically CP becomes evident when the baby reaches the developmental stage at to months and is starting to mobilise where preferential use of limbs asymmetry or gross motor developmental delay is seen br Drooling is common among children with cerebral palsy which can have a variety of impacts including social rejection impaired speaking damage to clothing and books and mouth infections It can additionally cause choking br An average of of people with cerebral palsy experience lower urinary tract symptoms more commonly excessive storage issues than voiding issues Those with voiding issues and pelvic floor overactivity can deteriorate as adults and experience upper urinary tract dysfunction br Children with CP may also have sensory processing issues Adults with cerebral palsy have a higher risk of respiratory failure br br br Skeleton br For bones to attain their normal shape and size they require the stresses from normal musculature People with cerebral palsy are at risk of low bone mineral density The shafts of the bones are often thin gracile and become thinner during growth When compared to these thin shafts diaphyses the centres metaphyses often appear quite enlarged ballooning Due to more than normal joint compression caused by muscular imbalances articular cartilage may atrophy leading to narrowed joint spaces Depending on the degree of spasticity a person with the spastic form of CP may exhibit a variety of angular joint deformities Because vertebral bodies need vertical gravitational loading forces to develop properly spasticity and an abnormal gait can hinder proper or full bone and skeletal development People with CP tend to be shorter in height than the average person because their bones are not allowed to grow to their full potential Sometimes bones grow to different lengths so the person may have one leg longer than the other br Children with CP are prone to low trauma fractures particularly children with higher Gross Motor Function Classification System GMFCS levels who cannot walk This further affects a child s mobility strength and experience of pain and can lead to missed schooling or child abuse suspicions These children generally have fractures in the legs whereas non affected children mostly fracture their arms in the context of sporting activities br Hip dislocation and ankle equinus or plantar flexion deformity are the two most common deformities among children with cerebral palsy Additionally flexion deformity of the hip and knee can occur Torsional deformities of long bones such as the femur and tibia are also encountered among others Children may develop scoliosis before the age of estimated prevalence of scoliosis in children with CP is between and Higher levels of impairment on the GMFCS are associated with scoliosis and hip dislocation Scoliosis can be corrected with surgery but CP makes surgical complications more likely even with improved techniques Hip migration can be managed by soft tissue procedures such as adductor musculature release Advanced degrees of hip migration or dislocation can be managed by more extensive procedures such as femoral and pelvic corrective osteotomies Both soft tissue and bony procedures aim at prevention of hip dislocation in the early phases or aim at hip containment and restoration of anatomy in the late phases of disease Equinus deformity is managed by conservative methods especially when dynamic If fixed static deformity ensues surgery may become mandatory br Growth spurts during puberty can make walking more difficult for people with CP and high muscle tone br br br Eating br Due to sensory and motor impairments those with CP may have difficulty preparing food holding utensils or chewing and swallowing An infant with CP may not be able to suck swallow or chew Gastro oesophageal reflux is common in children with CP Children with CP may have too little or too much sensitivity around and in the mouth Poor balance when sitting lack of control of the head mouth and trunk not being able to bend the hips enough to allow the arms to stretch forward to reach and grasp food or utensils and lack of hand eye coordination can make self feeding difficult Feeding difficulties are related to higher GMFCS levels Dental problems can also contribute to difficulties with eating Pneumonia is also common where eating difficulties exist caused by undetected aspiration of food or liquids Fine finger dexterity like that needed for picking up a utensil is more frequently impaired than gross manual dexterity like that needed for spooning food onto a plate Grip strength impairments are less common br Children with severe cerebral palsy particularly with oropharyngeal issues are at risk of undernutrition Triceps skin fold tests have been found to be a very reliable indicator of malnutrition in children with cerebral palsy Due to challenges in feeding evidence has shown that children with cerebral palsy are at a greater risk of malnutrition br br br Language br Speech and language disorders are common in people with cerebral palsy The incidence of dysarthria is estimated to range from to and around a quarter of people with CP are non verbal Speech problems are associated with poor respiratory control laryngeal and velopharyngeal dysfunction and oral articulation disorders that are due to restricted movement in the oral facial muscles There are three major types of dysarthria in cerebral palsy spastic dyskinetic athetotic and ataxic br Early use of augmentative and alternative communication systems may assist the child in developing spoken language skills Overall language delay is associated with problems of cognition deafness and learned helplessness Children with cerebral palsy are at risk of learned helplessness and becoming passive communicators initiating little communication Early intervention with this clientele and their parents often targets situations in which children communicate with others so that they learn that they can control people and objects in their environment through this communication including making choices decisions and mistakes br br br Pain and sleep br Pain is common and may result from the inherent deficits associated with the condition along with the numerous procedures children typically face When children with cerebral palsy are in pain they experience worse muscle spasms Pain is associated with tight or shortened muscles abnormal posture stiff joints unsuitable orthosis etc Hip migration or dislocation is a recognizable source of pain in CP children and especially in the adolescent population Nevertheless the adequate scoring and scaling of pain in CP children remains challenging Pain in CP has a number of different causes and different pains respond to different treatments br There is also a high likelihood of chronic sleep disorders secondary to both physical and environmental factors Children with cerebral palsy have significantly higher rates of sleep disturbance than typically developing children Babies with cerebral palsy who have stiffness issues might cry more and be harder to put to sleep than non disabled babies or floppy babies might be lethargic Chronic pain is under recognized in children with cerebral palsy even though three out of four children with cerebral palsy experience pain Adults with CP also experience more pain than the general population br br br Associated disorders br Associated disorders include intellectual disabilities seizures muscle contractures abnormal gait osteoporosis communication disorders malnutrition sleep disorders and mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety Epilepsy is often found in the child before they are year old or also before they are four or five In addition to these functional gastrointestinal abnormalities contributing to bowel obstruction vomiting and constipation may also arise Adults with cerebral palsy may have ischemic heart disease cerebrovascular disease cancer and trauma more often Obesity in people with cerebral palsy or a more severe Gross Motor Function Classification System assessment in particular are considered risk factors for multimorbidity Other medical issues can be mistaken for being symptoms of cerebral palsy and so may not be treated correctly br Related conditions can include apraxia sensory impairments urinary incontinence fecal incontinence or behavioural disorders br Seizure management is more difficult in people with CP as seizures often last longer Epilepsy and asthma are common co occurring diseases in adults with CP The associated disorders that co occur with cerebral palsy may be more disabling than the motor function problems br Managing respiratory illnesses in children with severe CP is considered complex due to the need to manage oropharyngeal dysphagia of both food drink and saliva gastroesophageal reflux motor disorders upper airway obstruction during sleep malnutrition among other factors br br br Causes br br Cerebral palsy is due to abnormal development or damage occurring to the developing brain This damage can occur during pregnancy delivery the first month of life or less commonly in early childhood Structural problems in the brain are seen in of cases most commonly within the white matter br More than three quarters of cases are believed to result from issues that occur during pregnancy Most children who are born with cerebral palsy have more than one risk factor associated with CP Cerebral palsy is not contagious and cannot be contracted in adulthood CP is almost always developed en utero or prior to birth br While in certain cases there is no identifiable cause typical causes include problems in intrauterine development e g exposure to radiation infection fetal growth restriction hypoxia of the brain thrombotic events placental insufficiency umbilical cord prolapse birth trauma during labor and delivery and complications around birth or during childhood br In Africa birth asphyxia high bilirubin levels and infections in newborns of the central nervous system are main cause Many cases of CP in Africa could be prevented with better resources available br br br Preterm birth br Between and of all children who develop cerebral palsy were born prematurely Most of these cases are believed to be due to issues that occur around the time of birth often just after birth Multiple birth infants are also more likely than single birth infants to have CP They are also more likely to be born with a low birth weight br In those who are born with a weight between kg lbs and kg lbs CP occurs in Among those born before weeks of gestation it occurs in Genetic factors are believed to play an important role in prematurity and cerebral palsy generally In those who are born between and weeks the risk is three times normal br br br Term infants br In babies who are born at term risk factors include problems with the placenta birth defects low birth weight breathing meconium into the lungs a delivery requiring either the use of instruments or an emergency Caesarean section birth asphyxia seizures just after birth respiratory distress syndrome low blood sugar and infections in the baby br As of it was unclear how much of a role birth asphyxia plays as a cause It is unclear if the size of the placenta plays a role As of it is evident that in advanced countries most cases of cerebral palsy in term or near term neonates have explanations other than asphyxia br br br Genetics br br Cerebral palsy is not commonly considered a genetic disease About of all CP cases are expected to be inherited with glutamate decarboxylase being one of the possible enzymes involved Most inherited cases are autosomal recessive However the vast majority of CP cases are connected to brain damage during birth and in infancy There is a small percentage of CP cases caused by brain damage that stemmed from the prenatal period which is estimated to be less than of CP cases overall Moreover there is no one reason why some CP cases come from prenatal brain damage and it is not known if those cases have a genetic basis br Cerebellar hypoplasia is sometimes genetic and can cause ataxic cerebral palsy br br br Early childhood br After birth other causes include toxins severe jaundice lead poisoning physical brain injury stroke abusive head trauma incidents involving hypoxia to the brain such as near drowning and encephalitis or meningitis br br br Others br Infections in the mother even those not easily detected can triple the risk of the child developing cerebral palsy Infection of the fetal membranes known as chorioamnionitis increases the risk br Intrauterine and neonatal insults many of which are infectious increase the risk br Rh blood type incompatibility can cause the mother s immune system to attack the baby s red blood cells br It has been hypothesised that some cases of cerebral palsy are caused by the death in very early pregnancy of an identical twin br br br Diagnosis br The diagnosis of cerebral palsy has historically rested on the person s history and physical examination and is generally assessed at a young age A general movements assessment which involves measuring movements that occur spontaneously among those less than four months of age appears most accurate Children who are more severely affected are more likely to be noticed and diagnosed earlier Abnormal muscle tone delayed motor development and persistence of primitive reflexes are the main early symptoms of CP Symptoms and diagnosis typically occur by the age of two although depending on factors like malformations and congenital issues persons with milder forms of cerebral palsy may be over the age of five if not in adulthood when finally diagnosed br Cognitive assessments and medical observations are also useful to help confirm a diagnosis Additionally evaluations of the child s mobility speech and language hearing vision gait feeding and digestion are also useful to determine the extent of the disorder Early diagnosis and intervention are seen as being a key part of managing cerebral palsy Machine learning algorithms facilitate automatic early diagnosis with methods such as deep neural network and geometric feature fusion producing high accuracy in predicting cerebral palsy from short videos It is a developmental disability br Once a person is diagnosed with cerebral palsy further diagnostic tests are optional Neuroimaging with CT or MRI is warranted when the cause of a person s cerebral palsy has not been established An MRI is preferred over CT due to diagnostic yield and safety When abnormal evidence from neuroimaging may suggest the timing of the initial damage The CT or MRI is also capable of revealing treatable conditions such as hydrocephalus porencephaly arteriovenous malformation subdural hematomas and hygromas and a vermian tumour which a few studies suggest are present of the time Furthermore abnormalities detected by neuroimaging may indicate a high likelihood of associated conditions such as epilepsy and intellectual disability There is a small risk associated with sedating children to facilitate a clear MRI br The age when CP is diagnosed is important but medical professionals disagree over the best age to make the diagnosis The earlier CP is diagnosed correctly the better the opportunities are to provide the child with physical and educational help but there might be a greater chance of confusing CP with another problem especially if the child is months of age or younger Infants may have temporary problems with muscle tone or control that can be confused with CP which is permanent A metabolism disorder or tumors in the nervous system may appear to be CP metabolic disorders in particular can produce brain problems that look like CP on an MRI Disorders that deteriorate the white matter in the brain and problems that cause spasms and weakness in the legs may be mistaken for CP if they first appear early in life However these disorders get worse over time and CP does not although it may change in character In infancy it may not be possible to tell the difference between them In the UK not being able to sit independently by the age of months is regarded as a clinical sign for further monitoring Fragile X syndrome a cause of autism and intellectual disability and general intellectual disability must also be ruled out Cerebral palsy specialist John McLaughlin recommends waiting until the child is months of age before making a diagnosis because by that age motor capacity is easier to assess br br br Classification br CP is classified by the types of motor impairment of the limbs or organs and by restrictions to the activities an affected person may perform The Gross Motor Function Classification System Expanded and Revised and the Manual Ability Classification System are used to describe mobility and manual dexterity in people with cerebral palsy and recently the Communication Function Classification System and the Eating and Drinking Ability Classification System have been proposed to describe those functions There are three main CP classifications by motor impairment spastic ataxic and dyskinetic Additionally there is a mixed type that shows a combination of features of the other types These classifications reflect the areas of the brain that are damaged br Cerebral palsy is also classified according to the topographic distribution of muscle spasticity This method classifies children as diplegic bilateral involvement with leg involvement greater than arm involvement hemiplegic unilateral involvement or quadriplegic bilateral involvement with arm involvement equal to or greater than leg involvement br br br Spastic br br Spastic cerebral palsy is the type of cerebral palsy characterized by spasticity or high muscle tone often resulting in stiff jerky movements Itself an umbrella term encompassing spastic hemiplegia spastic diplegia spastic quadriplegia and where solely one limb or one specific area of the body is affected spastic monoplegia Spastic cerebral palsy affects the motor cortex of the brain a specific portion of the cerebral cortex responsible for the planning and completion of voluntary movement Spastic CP is the most common type of overall cerebral palsy representing about of cases Botulinum toxin is effective in decreasing spasticity It can help increase range of motion which could help mitigate CPs effects on the growing bones of children There may be an improvement in motor functions in the children and ability to walk however the main benefit derived from botulinum toxin A comes from its ability to reduce muscle tone and spasticity and thus prevent or delay the development of fixed muscle contractures br br br Ataxic br br Ataxic cerebral palsy is observed in approximately of all cases of cerebral palsy making it the least frequent form of cerebral palsy Ataxic cerebral palsy is caused by damage to cerebellar structures Because of the damage to the cerebellum which is essential for coordinating muscle movements and balance patients with ataxic cerebral palsy experience problems in coordination specifically in their arms legs and trunk Ataxic cerebral palsy is known to decrease muscle tone The most common manifestation of ataxic cerebral palsy is intention action tremor which is especially apparent when carrying out precise movements such as tying shoe laces or writing with a pencil This symptom gets progressively worse as the movement persists making the hand shake As the hand gets closer to accomplishing the intended task the trembling intensifies which makes it even more difficult to complete br br br Dyskinetic br br Dyskinetic cerebral palsy sometimes abbreviated DCP is primarily associated with damage to the basal ganglia and the substantia nigra in the form of lesions that occur during brain development due to bilirubin encephalopathy and hypoxic ischemic brain injury DCP is characterized by both hypertonia and hypotonia due to the affected individual s inability to control muscle tone Clinical diagnosis of DCP typically occurs within months of birth and is primarily based upon motor function and neuroimaging techniques br Dyskinetic cerebral palsy is an extrapyramidal form of cerebral palsy Dyskinetic cerebral palsy can be divided into two different groups choreoathetosis and dystonia Choreo athetotic CP is characterized by involuntary movements whereas dystonic CP is characterized by slow strong contractions which may occur locally or encompass the whole body br br br Mixed br Mixed cerebral palsy has symptoms of dyskinetic ataxic and spastic CP appearing simultaneously each to varying degrees and both with and without symptoms of each Mixed CP is the most difficult to treat as it is extremely heterogeneous and sometimes unpredictable in its symptoms and development over the lifespan br br br Gait classification br br In patients with spastic hemiplegia or diplegia various gait patterns can be observed the exact form of which can only be described with the help of complex gait analysis systems In order to facilitate interdisciplinary communication in the interdisciplinary team between those affected doctors physiotherapists and orthotists a simple description of the gait pattern is useful J Rodda and H K Graham already described in how gait patterns of CP patients can be more easily recognized and defined gait types which they compared in a classification They also described that gait patterns can vary with age Building on this the Amsterdam Gait Classification was developed at the free university in Amsterdam the VU medisch centrum br A special feature of this classification is that it makes different gait patterns very easy to recognize and can be used in CP patients in whom only one leg and both legs are affected According to the Amsterdam Gait Classification five gait types are described To assess the gait pattern the patient is viewed visually or via a video recording from the side of the leg to be assessed At the point in time at which the leg to be viewed is in mid stance and the leg not to be viewed is in mid swing the knee angle and the contact of the foot with the ground are assessed on the one hand br Classification of the gait pattern according to the Amsterdam Gait Classification In gait type the knee angle is normal and the foot contact is complete In gait type the knee angle is hyperextended and the foot contact is complete In gait type the knee angle is hyperextended and foot contact is incomplete only on the forefoot In gait type the knee angle is bent and foot contact is incomplete only on the forefoot With gait type the knee angle is bent and the foot contact is complete br Gait types is also known as crouch gait br br br Prevention br Because the causes of CP are varied a broad range of preventive interventions have been investigated br Electronic fetal monitoring has not helped to prevent CP and in the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada have acknowledged that there are no long term benefits of electronic fetal monitoring Before this electronic fetal monitoring was widely used to prop up obstetric litigation br In those at risk of an early delivery magnesium sulphate appears to decrease the risk of cerebral palsy It is unclear if it helps those who are born at term In those at high risk of preterm labor a review found that moderate to severe CP was reduced by the administration of magnesium sulphate and that adverse effects on the babies from the magnesium sulphate were not significant Mothers who received magnesium sulphate could experience side effects such as respiratory depression and nausea However guidelines for the use of magnesium sulfate in mothers at risk of preterm labour are not strongly adhered to in only in eligible women in the UK received the medication despite it being recommended by NICE guidelines An NHS quality improvement programme increased its usage in England from in to in br Caffeine is used to treat apnea of prematurity and reduces the risk of cerebral palsy in premature babies but there are also concerns of long term negative effects A moderate quality level of evidence indicates that giving women antibiotics during preterm labor before her membranes have ruptured water is not yet not broken may increase the risk of cerebral palsy for the child Additionally for preterm babies for whom there is a chance of fetal compromise allowing the birth to proceed rather than trying to delay the birth may lead to an increased risk of cerebral palsy in the child Corticosteroids are sometimes taken by pregnant women expecting a preterm birth to provide neuroprotection to their baby Taking corticosteroids during pregnancy is shown to have no significant correlation with developing cerebral palsy in preterm births br Cooling high risk full term babies shortly after birth may reduce disability but this may only be useful for some forms of the brain damage that causes CP br br br Management br br Over time the approach to CP management has shifted away from narrow attempts to fix individual physical problems such as spasticity in a particular limb to making such treatments part of a larger goal of maximizing the person s independence and community engagement However the evidence base for the effectiveness of intervention programs reflecting the philosophy of independence has not yet caught up effective interventions for body structures and functions have a strong evidence base but evidence is lacking for effective interventions targeted toward participation environment or personal factors There is also no good evidence to show that an intervention that is effective at the body specific level will result in an improvement at the activity level or vice versa Although such cross over benefit might happen not enough high quality studies have been done to demonstrate it br Because cerebral palsy has varying severity and complexity across the lifespan it can be considered a collection of conditions for management purposes A multidisciplinary approach for cerebral palsy management is recommended focusing on maximising individual function choice and independence in line with the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health s goals The team may include a paediatrician a health visitor a social worker a physiotherapist an orthotist a speech and language therapist an occupational therapist a teacher specialising in helping children with visual impairment an educational psychologist an orthopaedic surgeon a neurologist and a neurosurgeon br Various forms of therapy are available to people living with cerebral palsy as well as caregivers and parents Treatment may include one or more of the following physical therapy occupational therapy speech therapy water therapy drugs to control seizures alleviate pain or relax muscle spasms e g benzodiazepines surgery to correct anatomical abnormalities or release tight muscles braces and other orthotic devices rolling walkers and communication aids such as computers with attached voice synthesisers Intensive rehabilitation is practiced in certain countries but obtaining reliable data on its medium and long term effectiveness is challenging br Surgical intervention in CP children may include various orthopaedic or neurological surgeries to improve quality of life such as tendon releases hip rotation spinal fusion selective dorsal rhizotomy or placement of an intrathecal baclofen pump br A Cochrane review published in found a trend toward the benefit of speech and language therapy for children with cerebral palsy but noted the need for high quality research A systematic review found that many of the therapies used to treat CP have no good evidence base the treatments with the best evidence are medications anticonvulsants botulinum toxin bisphosphonates diazepam therapy bimanual training casting constraint induced movement therapy context focused therapy fitness training goal directed training hip surveillance home programmes occupational therapy after botulinum toxin pressure care and surgery There is also research on whether the sleeping position might improve hip migration but there are not yet high quality evidence studies to support that theory Research papers also call for an agreed consensus on outcome measures which will allow researchers to cross reference research Also the terminology used to describe orthoses needs to be standardised to ensure studies can be reproduced and readily compared and evaluated br br br Orthotics in the concept of therapy br br To improve the gait pattern orthotics can be included in the therapy concept An orthosis can support physiotherapeutic treatment in setting the right motor impulses in order to create new cerebral connections The orthosis must meet the requirements of the medical prescription In addition the orthosis must be designed by the orthotist in such a way that it achieves the effectiveness of the necessary levers matching the gait pattern in order to support the proprioceptive approaches of physiotherapy The characteristics of the stiffness of the orthosis shells and the adjustable dynamics in the ankle joint are important elements of the orthosis to be considered br Due to these requirements the development of orthoses has changed significantly in recent years especially since around At about the same time care concepts were developed that deal intensively with the orthotic treatment of the lower extremities in cerebral palsy Modern materials and new functional elements enable the rigidity to be specifically adapted to the requirements that fits to the gait pattern of the CP patient The adjustment of the stiffness has a decisive influence on the gait pattern and on the energy cost of walking It is of great advantage if the stiffness of the orthosis can be adjusted separately from one another via resistances of the two functional elements in the two directions of movement dorsiflexion and plantar flexion br br br Prognosis br CP is not a progressive disorder meaning the brain damage does not worsen but the symptoms can become more severe over time A person with the disorder may improve somewhat during childhood if he or she receives extensive care but once bones and musculature become more established orthopedic surgery may be required People with CP can have varying degrees of cognitive impairment or none whatsoever The full intellectual potential of a child born with CP is often not known until the child starts school People with CP are more likely to have learning disorders but have normal intelligence Intellectual level among people with CP varies from genius to intellectually disabled as it does in the general population and experts have stated that it is important not to underestimate the capabilities of a person with CP and to give them every opportunity to learn br The ability to live independently with CP varies widely depending partly on the severity of each person s impairment and partly on the capability of each person to self manage the logistics of life Some individuals with CP require personal assistant services for all activities of daily living Others only need assistance with certain activities and still others do not require any physical assistance But regardless of the severity of a person s physical impairment a person s ability to live independently often depends primarily on the person s capacity to manage the physical realities of his or her life autonomously In some cases people with CP recruit hire and manage a staff of personal care assistants PCAs PCAs facilitate the independence of their employers by assisting them with their daily personal needs in a way that allows them to maintain control over their lives br Puberty in young adults with cerebral palsy may be precocious or delayed Delayed puberty is thought to be a consequence of nutritional deficiencies There is currently no evidence that CP affects fertility although some of the secondary symptoms have been shown to affect sexual desire and performance Adults with CP were less likely to get routine reproductive health screening as of Gynecological examinations may have to be performed under anesthesia due to spasticity and equipment is often not accessible Breast self examination may be difficult so partners or carers may have to perform it Men with CP have higher levels of cryptorchidism at the age of br CP can significantly reduce a person s life expectancy depending on the severity of their condition and the quality of care they receive of children with CP die in childhood particularly where seizures and intellectual disability also affect the child The ability to ambulate roll and self feed has been associated with increased life expectancy While there is a lot of variation in how CP affects people it has been found that independent gross motor functional ability is a very strong determinant of life expectancy According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics in Australians died of cerebral palsy The most common causes of death in CP are related to respiratory causes but in middle age cardiovascular issues and neoplastic disorders become more prominent br br br Self care br For many children with CP parents are heavily involved in self care activities Self care activities such as bathing dressing and grooming can be difficult for children with CP as self care depends primarily on the use of the upper limbs For those living with CP impaired upper limb function affects almost of children and is considered the main factor contributing to decreased activity and participation As the hands are used for many self care tasks sensory and motor impairments of the hands make daily self care more difficult Motor impairments cause more problems than sensory impairments The most common impairment is that of finger dexterity which is the ability to manipulate small objects with the fingers Compared to other disabilities people with cerebral palsy generally need more help in performing daily tasks Occupational therapists are healthcare professionals that help individuals with disabilities gain or regain their independence through the use of meaningful activities br br br Productivity br The effects of sensory motor and cognitive impairments affect self care occupations in children with CP and productivity occupations Productivity can include but is not limited to school work household chores or contributing to the community br Play is included as a productive occupation as it is often the primary activity for children If play becomes difficult due to a disability like CP this can cause problems for the child These difficulties can affect a child s self esteem In addition the sensory and motor problems experienced by children with CP affect how the child interacts with their surroundings including the environment and other people Not only do physical limitations affect a child s ability to play the limitations perceived by the child s caregivers and playmates also affect the child s play activities Some children with disabilities spend more time playing by themselves When a disability prevents a child from playing there may be social emotional and psychological problems which can lead to increased dependence on others less motivation and poor social skills br In school students are asked to complete many tasks and activities many of which involve handwriting Many children with CP have the capacity to learn and write in the school environment However students with CP may find it difficult to keep up with the handwriting demands of school and their writing may be difficult to read In addition writing may take longer and require greater effort on the student s part Factors linked to handwriting include postural stability sensory and perceptual abilities of the hand and writing tool pressure br Speech impairments may be seen in children with CP depending on the severity of brain damage Communication in a school setting is important because communicating with peers and teachers is very much a part of the school experience and enhances social interaction Problems with language or motor dysfunction can lead to underestimating a student s intelligence In summary children with CP may experience difficulties in school such as difficulty with handwriting carrying out school activities communicating verbally and interacting socially br br br Leisure br Leisure activities can have several positive effects on physical health mental health life satisfaction and psychological growth for people with physical disabilities like CP Common benefits identified are stress reduction development of coping skills companionship enjoyment relaxation and a positive effect on life satisfaction In addition for children with CP leisure appears to enhance adjustment to living with a disability br Leisure can be divided into structured formal and unstructured informal activities Children and teens with CP engage in less habitual physical activity than their peers Children with CP primarily engage in physical activity through therapies aimed at managing their CP or through organized sport for people with disabilities It is difficult to sustain behavioural change in terms of increasing physical activity of children with CP Gender manual dexterity the child s preferences cognitive impairment and epilepsy were found to affect children s leisure activities with manual dexterity associated with more leisure activity Although leisure is important for children with CP they may have difficulties carrying out leisure activities due to social and physical barriers br Children with cerebral palsy may face challenges when it comes to participating in sports This comes with being discouraged from physical activity because of these perceived limitations imposed by their medical condition br br br Participation and barriers br Participation is involvement in life situations and everyday activities Participation includes self care productivity and leisure In fact communication mobility education home life leisure and social relationships require participation and indicate the extent to which children function in their environment Barriers can exist on three levels micro meso and macro First the barriers at the micro level involve the person Barriers at the micro level include the child s physical limitations motor sensory and cognitive impairments or their subjective feelings regarding their ability to participate For example the child may not participate in group activities due to lack of confidence Second barriers at the meso level include the family and community These may include negative attitudes of people toward disability or lack of support within the family or in the community br One of the main reasons for this limited support appears to be the result of a lack of awareness and knowledge regarding the child s ability to engage in activities despite his or her disability Third barriers at the macro level incorporate the systems and policies that are not in place or hinder children with CP These may be environmental barriers to participation such as architectural barriers lack of relevant assistive technology and transportation difficulties due to limited wheelchair access or public transit that can accommodate children with CP For example a building without an elevator can prevent the child from accessing higher floors br A review stated that outcomes for adults with cerebral palsy without intellectual disability in the s were that completed high school completed college up to were living independently in the community were competitively employed and were involved in long term relationships with partners or had established families Adults with cerebral palsy may not seek physical therapy due to transport issues financial restrictions and practitioners not feeling like they know enough about cerebral palsy to take people with CP on as clients br br br Aging br Children with CP may not successfully transition into using adult services because they are not referred to one upon turning and may decrease their use of services Quality of life outcomes tend to decline for adults with cerebral palsy Because children with cerebral palsy are often told that it is a non progressive disease they may be unprepared for the greater effects of the aging process as they head into their s Young adults with cerebral palsy experience problems with aging that non disabled adults experience much later in life or more adults with cerebral palsy who can walk experience increasing difficulties walking with age Hand function does not seem to have similar declines Chronic disease risk such as obesity is also higher among adults with cerebral palsy than the general population Common problems include increased pain reduced flexibility increased spasms and contractures post impairment syndrome and increasing problems with balance Increased fatigue is also a problem When adulthood and cerebral palsy is discussed as of it is not discussed in terms of the different stages of adulthood About half of people with CP report some loss of function as of their s br Like they did in childhood adults with cerebral palsy experience psychosocial issues related to their CP chiefly the need for social support self acceptance and acceptance by others Workplace accommodations may be needed to enhance continued employment for adults with CP as they age Rehabilitation or social programs that include salutogenesis may improve the coping potential of adults with CP as they age br br br Epidemiology br Cerebral palsy occurs in about per live births In those born at term rates are lower at per live births Within a population it may occur more often in poorer people The rate is higher in males than in females in Europe it is times more common in males br There was a moderate but significant rise in the prevalence of CP between the s and s This is thought to be due to a rise in low birth weight of infants and the increased survival rate of these infants The increased survival rate of infants with CP in the s and s may be indirectly due to the disability rights movement challenging perspectives around the worth of infants with a disability as well as the Baby Doe Law Between and rates of cerebral palsy remained the same br As of advances in the care of pregnant mothers and their babies did not result in a noticeable decrease in CP This is generally attributed to medical advances in areas related to the care of premature babies which results in a greater survival rate Only the introduction of quality medical care to locations with less than adequate medical care has shown any decreases The incidence of CP increases with premature or very low weight babies regardless of the quality of care As of there is a suggestion that both incidence and severity are slightly decreasing more research is needed to find out if this is significant and if so which interventions are effective It has been found that high income countries have lower rates of children born with cerebral palsy than low or middle income countries br Prevalence of cerebral palsy is best calculated around the school entry age of about six years the prevalence in the U S is estimated to be out of children br br br History br Cerebral palsy has affected humans since antiquity A decorated grave marker dating from around the th to th century BCE shows a figure with one small leg and using a crutch possibly due to cerebral palsy The oldest likely physical evidence of the condition comes from the mummy of Siptah an Egyptian Pharaoh who ruled from about to BCE and died at about years of age The presence of cerebral palsy has been suspected due to his deformed foot and hands br The medical literature of the ancient Greeks discusses paralysis and weakness of the arms and legs the modern word palsy comes from the Ancient Greek words or meaning paralysis or paresis respectively The works of the school of Hippocrates c BCE and the manuscript On the Sacred Disease in particular describe a group of problems that matches up very well with the modern understanding of cerebral palsy The Roman Emperor Claudius BCE CE is suspected of having CP as historical records describe him as having several physical problems in line with the condition Medical historians have begun to suspect and find depictions of CP in much later art Several paintings from the th century and later show individuals with problems consistent with it such as Jusepe de Ribera s painting The Clubfoot br The modern understanding of CP as resulting from problems within the brain began in the early decades of the s with a number of publications on brain abnormalities by Johann Christian Reil Claude Fran ois Lallemand and Philippe Pinel Later physicians used this research to connect problems in the brain with specific symptoms The English surgeon William John Little was the first person to study CP extensively In his doctoral thesis he stated that CP was a result of a problem around the time of birth He later identified a difficult delivery a preterm birth and perinatal asphyxia in particular as risk factors The spastic diplegia form of CP came to be known as Little s disease At around this time a German surgeon was also working on cerebral palsy and distinguished it from polio In the s British neurologist William Gowers built on Little s work by linking paralysis in newborns to difficult births He named the problem birth palsy and classified birth palsies into two types peripheral and cerebral br Working in the US in the s Canadian born physician William Osler reviewed dozens of CP cases to further classify the disorders by the site of the problems on the body and by the underlying cause Osler made further observations tying problems around the time of delivery with CP and concluded that problems causing bleeding inside the brain were likely the root cause Osler also suspected polioencephalitis as an infectious cause Through the s scientists commonly confused CP with polio br Before moving to psychiatry Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud made further refinements to the classification of the disorder He produced the system still being used today Freud s system divides the causes of the disorder into problems present at birth problems that develop during birth and problems after birth Freud also made a rough correlation between the location of the problem inside the brain and the location of the affected limbs on the body and documented the many kinds of movement disorders br In the early th century the attention of the medical community generally turned away from CP until orthopedic surgeon Winthrop Phelps became the first physician to treat the disorder He viewed CP from a musculoskeletal perspective instead of a neurological one Phelps developed surgical techniques for operating on the muscles to address issues such as spasticity and muscle rigidity Hungarian physical rehabilitation practitioner Andr s Pet developed a system to teach children with CP how to walk and perform other basic movements Pet s system became the foundation for conductive education widely used for children with CP today Through the remaining decades physical therapy for CP has evolved and has become a core component of the CP management program br In Robert Palisano et al introduced the Gross Motor Function Classification System GMFCS as an improvement over the previous rough assessment of limitation as either mild moderate or severe The GMFCS grades limitation based on observed proficiency in specific basic mobility skills such as sitting standing and walking and takes into account the level of dependency on aids such as wheelchairs or walkers The GMFCS was further revised and expanded in br br br Society and culture br br br Economic impact br It is difficult to directly compare the cost and cost effectiveness of interventions to prevent cerebral palsy or the cost of interventions to manage CP Access Economics has released a report on the economic impact of cerebral palsy in Australia The report found that in the financial cost of cerebral palsy CP in Australia was A billion or of GDP Of this br br A billion was productivity lost due to lower employment absenteeism and premature death of Australians with CP br A million was the DWL from transfers including welfare payments and taxation forgone br A million was other indirect costs such as direct program services aides and home modifications and the bringing forward of funeral costs br A million was the value of the informal care for people with CP br A million was direct health system expenditure br The value of lost well being disability and premature death was a further A billion br In per capita terms this amounts to a financial cost of A per person with CP per annum Including the value of lost well being the cost is over per person per annum br Individuals with CP bear of the financial costs and their families and friends bear a further The federal government bears around one third of the financial costs mainly through taxation revenues forgone and welfare payments State governments bear under of the costs while employers bear and the rest of society bears the remaining If the burden of disease lost well being is included individuals bear of the costs br The average lifetime cost for people with CP in the US is US per individual including lost income br In the United States many states allow Medicaid beneficiaries to use their Medicaid funds to hire their own PCAs instead of forcing them to use institutional or managed care br In India the government sponsored program called NIRAMAYA for the medical care of children with neurological and muscular deformities has proved to be an ameliorating economic measure for persons with such disabilities It has shown that persons with mental or physically debilitating congenital disabilities can lead better lives if they have financial independence br br br Use of the term br Cerebral means of or pertaining to the cerebrum or the brain and palsy means paralysis generally partial whereby a local body area is incapable of voluntary movement It has been proposed to change the name to cerebral palsy spectrum disorder to reflect the diversity of presentations of CP br Many people would rather be referred to as a person with a disability people first language instead of as handicapped Cerebral Palsy A Guide for Care at the University of Delaware offers the following guidelines br br Impairment is the correct term to use to define a deviation from normal such as not being able to make a muscle move or not being able to control an unwanted movement Disability is the term used to define a restriction in the ability to perform a normal activity of daily living which someone of the same age can perform For example a three year old child who is not able to walk has a disability because a normal three year old can walk independently A handicapped child or adult is one who because of the disability is unable to achieve the normal role in society commensurate with his age and socio cultural milieu As an example a sixteen year old who is unable to prepare his own meal or care for his own toilet or hygiene needs is handicapped On the other hand a sixteen year old who can walk only with the assistance of crutches but who attends a regular school and is fully independent in activities of daily living is disabled but not handicapped All disabled people are impaired and all handicapped people are disabled but a person can be impaired and not necessarily be disabled and a person can be disabled without being handicapped br The term spastic denotes the attribute of spasticity in types of spastic CP In a UK charity called The Spastics Society was formed The term spastics was used by the charity as a term for people with CP The word spastic has since been used extensively as a general insult to disabled people which some see as extremely offensive They are also frequently used to insult non disabled people when they seem overly uncoordinated anxious or unskilled in sports The charity changed its name to Scope in In the United States the word spaz has the same usage as an insult but is not generally associated with CP br br br Media br br Maverick documentary filmmaker Kazuo Hara criticises the mores and customs of Japanese society in an unsentimental portrait of adults with cerebral palsy in his film Goodbye CP Focusing on how people with cerebral palsy are generally ignored or disregarded in Japan Hara challenges his society s taboos about physical handicaps Using a deliberately harsh style with grainy black and white photography and out of sync sound Hara brings a stark realism to his subject br Spandan a film by Vegitha Reddy and Aman Tripathi delves into the dilemma of parents whose
