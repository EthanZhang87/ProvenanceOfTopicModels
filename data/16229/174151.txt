SATA Serial AT Attachment is a computer bus interface that connects host bus adapters to mass storage devices such as hard disk drives optical drives and solid state drives Serial ATA succeeded the earlier Parallel ATA PATA standard to become the predominant interface for storage devices br Serial ATA industry compatibility specifications originate from the Serial ATA International Organization SATA IO which are then released by the INCITS Technical Committee T AT Attachment INCITS T br br br History br br SATA was announced in in order to provide several advantages over the earlier PATA interface such as reduced cable size and cost seven conductors instead of or native hot swapping faster data transfer through higher signaling rates and more efficient transfer through an optional I O queuing protocol Revision of the specification was released in January br Serial ATA industry compatibility specifications originate from the Serial ATA International Organization SATA IO The SATA IO group collaboratively creates reviews ratifies and publishes the interoperability specifications the test cases and plugfests As with many other industry compatibility standards the SATA content ownership is transferred to other industry bodies primarily INCITS T and an INCITS T subcommittee SCSI a subgroup of T responsible for Serial Attached SCSI SAS The remainder of this article strives to use the SATA IO terminology and specifications br Before SATA s introduction in PATA was simply known as ATA The AT Attachment ATA name originated after the release of the IBM Personal Computer AT more commonly known as the IBM AT The IBM AT s controller interface became a de facto industry interface for the inclusion of hard disks AT was IBM s abbreviation for Advanced Technology thus many companies and organizations indicate SATA is an abbreviation of Serial Advanced Technology Attachment However the ATA specifications simply use the name AT Attachment to avoid possible trademark issues with IBM br SATA host adapters and devices communicate via a high speed serial cable over two pairs of conductors In contrast parallel ATA the redesignation for the legacy ATA specifications uses a bit wide data bus with many additional support and control signals all operating at a much lower frequency To ensure backward compatibility with legacy ATA software and applications SATA uses the same basic ATA and ATAPI command sets as legacy ATA devices br The world s first SATA hard disk drive is the Seagate Barracuda SATA V which was released in Jan br SATA has replaced parallel ATA in consumer desktop and laptop computers SATA s market share in the desktop PC market was in PATA has mostly been replaced by SATA for any use with PATA in declining use in industrial and embedded applications that use CompactFlash CF storage which was designed around the legacy PATA standard A standard CFast to replace CompactFlash is based on SATA br br br Features br br br Hot plug br The Serial ATA spec requires SATA devices be capable of hot plugging that is devices that meet the specification are capable of insertion or removal of a device into or from a backplane connector combined signal and power that has power on After insertion the device initializes and then operates normally Depending upon the operating system the host may also initialize resulting in a hot swap The powered host and device do not need to be in an idle state for safe insertion and removal although unwritten data may be lost when power is removed br Unlike PATA both SATA and eSATA support hot plugging by design However this feature requires proper support at the host device drive and operating system levels In general SATA devices fulfill the device side hot plugging requirements and most SATA host adapters support this function br For eSATA hot plugging is supported in AHCI mode only IDE mode does not support hot plugging br br br Advanced Host Controller Interface br Advanced Host Controller Interface AHCI is an open host controller interface published and used by Intel which has become a de facto standard It allows the use of advanced features of SATA such as hotplug and native command queuing NCQ If AHCI is not enabled by the motherboard and chipset SATA controllers typically operate in IDE emulation mode which does not allow access to device features not supported by the ATA also called IDE standard br Windows device drivers that are labeled as SATA are often running in IDE emulation mode unless they explicitly state that they are AHCI mode in RAID mode or a mode provided by a proprietary driver and command set that allowed access to SATA s advanced features before AHCI became popular Modern versions of Microsoft Windows Mac OS X FreeBSD Linux with version onward as well as Solaris and OpenSolaris include support for AHCI but earlier operating systems such as Windows XP do not Even in those instances a proprietary driver may have been created for a specific chipset such as Intel s br br br Revisions br SATA revisions are typically designated with a dash followed by Roman numerals e g SATA III to avoid confusion with the speed which is always displayed in Arabic numerals e g SATA Gbit s The speeds given are the raw interface rate in Gbit s including line code overhead and the usable data rate in MB s without overhead br br br SATA revision Gbit s MB s Serial ATA br Revision a was released on January First generation SATA interfaces now known as SATA Gbit s communicate at a rate of Gbit s and do not support Native Command Queuing NCQ Taking b b encoding overhead into account they have an actual uncoded transfer rate of Gbit s MB s The theoretical burst throughput of SATA Gbit s is similar to that of PATA but newer SATA devices offer enhancements such as NCQ which improve performance in a multitasking environment br During the initial period after SATA Gbit s finalization adapter and drive manufacturers used a bridge chip to convert existing PATA designs for use with the SATA interface Bridged drives have a SATA connector may include either or both kinds of power connectors and in general perform identically to their native SATA equivalents br As of April the fastest rpm SATA hard disk drives could transfer data at maximum not average rates of up to MB s which is beyond the capabilities of the older PATA specification and also exceeds the capabilities of SATA Gbit s br br br SATA revision Gbit s MB s Serial ATA br br SATA revision was released in April introducing Native Command Queuing NCQ It is backward compatible with SATA Gbit s br Second generation SATA interfaces run with a native transfer rate of Gbit s that when accounted for the b b encoding scheme equals to the maximum uncoded transfer rate of Gbit s MB s The theoretical burst throughput of the SATA revision which is also known as the SATA Gbit s doubles the throughput of SATA revision br All SATA data cables meeting the SATA spec are rated for Gbit s and handle modern mechanical drives without any loss of sustained and burst data transfer performance However high performance flash based drives can exceed the SATA Gbit s transfer rate this is addressed with the SATA Gbit s interoperability standard br br br SATA revision br Announced in August SATA revision consolidated the specification to a single document br br br SATA revision br Announced in February SATA revision introduced the following features br br Slimline connector br Micro connector initially for HDD br Mini Internal Multilane cable and connector br Mini External Multilane cable and connector br NCQ Priority br NCQ Unload br Enhancements to the BIST Activate FIS br Enhancements for robust reception of the Signature FIS br br br SATA revision Gbit s MB s Serial ATA br Serial ATA International Organization SATA IO presented the draft specification of SATA Gbit s physical layer in July and ratified its physical layer specification on August The full standard was released on May br Third generation SATA interfaces run with a native transfer rate of Gbit s taking b b encoding into account the maximum uncoded transfer rate is Gbit s MB s The theoretical burst throughput of SATA Gbit s is double that of SATA revision It is backward compatible with earlier SATA implementations br The SATA specification contains the following changes br br Gbit s for scalable performance br Continued compatibility with SAS including SAS Gbit s as per a SAS domain may support attachment to and control of unmodified SATA devices connected directly into the SAS domain using the Serial ATA Tunneled Protocol STP from the SATA Revision Gold specification br Isochronous Native Command Queuing NCQ streaming command to enable isochronous quality of service data transfers for streaming digital content applications br An NCQ management feature that helps optimize performance by enabling host processing and management of outstanding NCQ commands br Improved power management capabilities br A small low insertion force LIF connector for more compact inch storage devices br A mm optical disk drive profile for the slimline SATA connector in addition to the existing mm and mm profiles br Alignment with the INCITS ATA ACS standard br In general the enhancements are aimed at improving quality of service for video streaming and high priority interrupts In addition the standard continues to support distances up to one meter The newer speeds may require higher power consumption for supporting chips though improved process technologies and power management techniques may mitigate this The later specification can use existing SATA cables and connectors though it was reported in that some OEMs were expected to upgrade host connectors for the higher speeds br br br SATA revision br Released in July SATA revision introduced or changed the following features br br mSATA for solid state drives in mobile computing devices a PCI Express Mini Card like connector that is electrically SATA The connector was also used in some desktop computers such as certain HP business PCs br Zero power optical disk drive a SATA optical drive that draws no power when idle br Queued TRIM Command improves solid state drive performance br Required Link Power Management reduces overall system power demand of several SATA devices br Hardware Control Features enable host identification of device capabilities br Universal Storage Module USM a new standard for cableless plug in slot powered storage for consumer electronics devices br br br SATA revision br Released in August SATA revision introduced the following features br br The SATA Express specification defines an interface that combines both SATA and PCI Express buses making it possible for both types of storage devices to coexist By employing PCI Express a much higher theoretical throughput of MB s is possible br The SATA M standard is a small form factor implementation of the SATA Express interface with the addition of an internal USB port see the M NGFF section below for a more detailed summary br microSSD introduces a ball grid array electrical interface for miniaturized embedded SATA storage br USM Slim reduces thickness of Universal Storage Module USM from millimeters inches to millimeters inches br DevSleep enables lower power consumption for always on devices while they are in low power modes such as InstantGo which used to be known as Connected Standby br Hybrid Information provides higher performance for solid state hybrid drives br br br SATA revision br Released in February SATA revision introduced the following features br br Shingled magnetic recording SMR host control support device controlled SMR HDDs are the same as standard CMR HDDs with respect to SATA compatibility SMR provides a percent or greater increase in hard disk drive capacity by overlapping tracks on the media br Power Disable feature see PWDIS pin allows for remote power cycling of SATA drives and a Rebuild Assist function that speeds up the rebuild process to help ease maintenance in the data center br Transmitter Emphasis Specification increases interoperability and reliability between host and devices in electrically demanding environments br An activity indicator and staggered spin up can be controlled by the same pin adding flexibility and providing users with more choices br The new Power Disable feature similar to the SAS Power Disable feature uses Pin of the SATA power connector Some legacy power supplies that provide V power on Pin would force drives with Power Disable feature to get stuck in a hard reset condition preventing them from spinning up The problem can usually be eliminated by using a simple Molex to SATA power adaptor to supply power to these drives br br br SATA revision br Released in June SATA revision introduced the following features that enable monitoring of device conditions and execution of housekeeping tasks both with minimal impact on performance br br Durable Ordered Write Notification enables writing selected critical cache data to the media minimizing impact on normal operations br Device Temperature Monitoring allows for active monitoring of SATA device temperature and other conditions without impacting normal operation by utilizing the SFF standard for out of band OOB communications br Device Sleep Signal Timing provides additional definition to enhance compatibility between manufacturers implementations br br br SATA revision br Released in July SATA revision introduces features that enable increased performance benefits and promote greater integration of SATA devices and products with other industry I O standards br br Device Transmit Emphasis for Gen PHY aligns SATA with other characteristics of other I O measurement solutions to help SATA IO members with testing and integration br Defined Ordered NCQ Commands allows the host to specify the processing relationships among queued commands and sets the order in which commands are processed in the queue br Command Duration Limit Features reduces latency by allowing the host to define quality of service categories giving the host more granularity in controlling command properties The feature helps align SATA with the Fast Fail requirements established by the Open Compute Project OCP and specified in the INCITS T Technical Committee standard br SATA revision a was released in March br br br Cables connectors and ports br br Connectors and cables present the most visible differences between SATA and parallel ATA drives Unlike PATA the same connectors are used on inch SATA hard disks for desktop and server computers and inch disks for portable or small computers br Standard SATA connectors for both data and power have a conductor pitch of mm inches Low insertion force is required to mate a SATA connector A smaller mini SATA or mSATA connector is used by smaller devices such as inch SATA drives some DVD and Blu ray drives and mini SSDs br A special eSATA connector is specified for external devices and an optionally implemented provision for clips to hold internal connectors firmly in place SATA drives may be plugged into SAS controllers and communicate on the same physical cable as native SAS disks but SATA controllers cannot handle SAS disks br Female SATA ports on motherboards for example are for use with SATA data cables that have locks or clips to prevent accidental unplugging Some SATA cables have right or left angled connectors to ease connection to circuit boards br br br Data connector br br The SATA standard defines a data cable with seven conductors three grounds and four active data lines in two pairs and mm wide wafer connectors on each end SATA cables can have lengths up to meter ft and connect one motherboard socket to one hard drive PATA ribbon cables in comparison connect one motherboard socket to one or two hard drives carry either or wires and are limited to centimeters in in length by the PATA specification however cables up to centimeters in are readily available Thus SATA connectors and cables are easier to fit in closed spaces and reduce obstructions to air cooling Some cables even include a locking feature whereby a small usually metal spring holds the plug in the socket br SATA connectors may be straight right angled or left angled Angled connectors allow lower profile connections Right angled also called degree connectors lead the cable immediately away from the drive on the circuit board side Left angled also called degree connectors lead the cable across the drive towards its top br One of the problems associated with the transmission of data at high speed over electrical connections is described as noise which is due to electrical coupling between data circuits and other circuits As a result the data circuits can both affect other circuits and be affected by them Designers use a number of techniques to reduce the undesirable effects of such unintentional coupling One such technique used in SATA links is differential signaling This is an enhancement over PATA which uses single ended signaling The use of fully shielded dual coax conductors with multiple ground connections for each differential pair improves isolation between the channels and reduces the chances of lost data in difficult electrical environments br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Power connectors br br br Standard connector br br SATA specifies a different power connector than the four pin Molex connector used on Parallel ATA PATA devices and earlier small storage devices going back to ST hard disk drives and even to floppy disk drives that predated the IBM PC It is a wafer type connector like the SATA data connector but much wider fifteen pins versus seven to avoid confusion between the two Some early SATA drives included the four pin Molex power connector together with the new fifteen pin connector but most SATA drives now have only the latter br The new SATA power connector contains many more pins for several reasons br br V is supplied along with the traditional V and V supplies However very few drives actually use it br Pin in SATA revision has been redefined as PWDIS and is used to enter and exit the POWER DISABLE mode in line with SAS If Pin is driven HIGH V max power to the drive circuitry is cut Drives with this feature enabled do not power up in systems designed to SATA revision or earlier because Pin driven HIGH prevents the drive from powering up The workaround is to use a Molex adapter without V or to put insulating tape over the PWDIS pin br To reduce resistance and increase current capability each voltage is supplied by three pins in parallel though one pin in each group is intended for precharging see below Each pin should be able to carry A br Five parallel pins provide a low resistance ground connection br Two ground pins and one pin for each supplied voltage support hot plug precharging Ground pins and in a hot swap cable are the longest so they make contact first when the connectors are mated Drive power connector pins and are longer than the others so they make contact next The drive uses them to charge its internal bypass capacitors through current limiting resistances Finally the remaining power pins make contact bypassing the resistances and providing a low resistance source of each voltage This two step mating process avoids glitches to other loads and possible arcing or erosion of the SATA power connector contacts br Pin might be used often by chassis or backplane hardware independent from SATA host controller and its data connection for staggered spinup activity indication emergency head parking or other vendor defined functions in various combinations It is an open collector signal which may be pulled down by the connector or the drive br Host signaling If pulled down at the connector as it is on most cable style SATA power connectors the drive spins up as soon as power is applied If left floating the drive waits until it is spoken to This prevents many drives from spinning up simultaneously which might draw too much power br Drive signaling The pin is also pulled low by the drive to indicate drive activity This may be used to give feedback to the user through an LED Relevant definitions of pin operation have changed multiple times in published revisions of SATA standard so the observed behavior may be dependent on device version host version firmware and software configuration There is also a specification for transmission of drive temperature and other status values with activity signal pulses routinely used to make LED blink br Passive adapters are available that convert a four pin Molex connector to a SATA power connector providing the V and V lines available on the Molex connector but not V There are also four pin Molex to SATA power adapters that include electronics to additionally provide the V power supply However most drives do not require the V power line br br br Slimline connector br br SATA is the first revision that defined the slimline connector intended for smaller form factors such as notebook optical drives Pin of the slimline power connector denoting device presence is shorter than the others to allow hot swapping The slimline signal connector is identical and compatible with the standard version while the power connector is reduced to six pins so it supplies only V and not V or V br Low cost adapters exist to convert from standard SATA to slimline SATA br br br br br br br br br br br br Micro connector br br br br br br br br br br br The micro SATA connector sometimes called uSATA or SATA originated with SATA and is intended for inch hard disk drives There is also a micro data connector similar in appearance but slightly thinner than the standard data connector br br br Additional pins br Some SATA drives in particular mechanical ones come with an extra or more pin interface which isn t uniformly standardized but nevertheless serves similar purpose defined by each drive manufacturer As IDE drives used those extra pins for setting up Master and Slave drives on SATA drives those pins are generally used to select different Power modes for use in USB SATA bridges or enables additional features like Spread Spectrum Clocking SATA Speed Limit or Factory Mode for Diagnostics and Recovery by the use of a jumper br br br eSATA br br Standardized in eSATA e standing for external provides a variant of SATA meant for external connectivity It uses a more robust connector longer shielded cables and stricter but backward compatible electrical standards The protocol and logical signaling link transport layers and above are identical to internal SATA The differences are br br Minimum transmit amplitude increased Range is mV instead of mV br Minimum receive amplitude decreased Range is mV instead of mV br Maximum cable length increased to meters ft from meter ft br The eSATA cable and connector is similar to the SATA a cable and connector with these exceptions br The eSATA connector is mechanically different to prevent unshielded internal cables from being used externally The eSATA connector discards the L shaped key and changes the position and size of the guides br The eSATA insertion depth is deeper mm instead of mm The contact positions are also changed br The eSATA cable has an extra shield to reduce EMI to FCC and CE requirements Internal cables do not need the extra shield to satisfy EMI requirements because they are inside a shielded case br The eSATA connector uses metal springs for shield contact and mechanical retention br The eSATA connector has a design life of matings the ordinary SATA connector is only specified for br Aimed at the consumer market eSATA enters an external storage market served also by the USB and FireWire interfaces The SATA interface has certain advantages Most external hard disk drive cases with FireWire or USB interfaces use either PATA or SATA drives and bridges to translate between the drives interfaces and the enclosures external ports this bridging incurs some inefficiency Some single disks can transfer MB s during real use about four times the maximum transfer rate of USB or FireWire IEEE a and almost twice as fast as the maximum transfer rate of FireWire The S FireWire b specification reaches around MB s Gbit s and USB has a nominal speed of Gbit s Some low level drive features such as S M A R T may not operate through some USB or FireWire or USB FireWire bridges eSATA does not suffer from these issues provided that the controller manufacturer and its drivers presents eSATA drives as ATA devices rather than as SCSI devices as has been common with Silicon Image JMicron and Nvidia nForce drivers for Windows Vista In those cases SATA drives do not have low level features accessible br The eSATA version of SATA G operates at Gbit s the term SATA III is avoided by the SATA IO organization to prevent confusion with SATA II Gbit s which was colloquially referred to as SATA G bit s or SATA MB s since the Gbit s SATA I and Gbit s SATA II were referred to as both SATA G bit s or SATA MB s Therefore eSATA connections operate with negligible differences between them Once an interface can transfer data as fast as a drive can handle them increasing the interface speed does not improve data transfer br There are some disadvantages however to the eSATA interface br br Devices built before the eSATA interface became popular lack external SATA connectors br For small form factor devices such as external inch disks a PC hosted USB or FireWire link can usually supply sufficient power to operate the device However eSATA connectors cannot supply power and require a power supply for the external device The related eSATAp but mechanically incompatible sometimes called eSATA USB connector adds power to an external SATA connection so that an additional power supply is not needed br As of August few new computers have dedicated external SATA eSATA connectors with USB dominating and USB Type C often with the Thunderbolt alternate mode starting to replace the earlier USB connectors Still sometimes present are single ports supporting both USB and eSATA br Desktop computers without a built in eSATA interface can install an eSATA host bus adapter HBA if the motherboard supports SATA an externally available eSATA connector can be added Notebook computers with the now rare Cardbus or ExpressCard could add an eSATA HBA With passive adapters the maximum cable length is reduced to meter ft due to the absence of compliant eSATA signal levels br br br eSATAp br br eSATAp stands for powered eSATA It is also known as Power over eSATA Power eSATA eSATA USB Combo or eSATA USB Hybrid Port EUHP An eSATAp port combines the four pins of the USB or earlier port the seven pins of the eSATA port and optionally two V power pins Both SATA traffic and device power are integrated in a single cable as is the case with USB but not eSATA The V power is provided through two USB pins while the V power may optionally be provided Typically desktop but not notebook computers provide V power so can power devices requiring this voltage typically inch disk and CD DVD drives in addition to V devices such as inch drives br Both USB and eSATA devices can be used with an eSATAp port when plugged in with a USB or eSATA cable respectively An eSATA device cannot be powered via an eSATAp cable but a special cable can make both SATA or eSATA and power connectors available from an eSATAp port br An eSATAp connector can be built into a computer with internal SATA and USB by fitting a bracket with connections for internal SATA USB and power connectors and an externally accessible eSATAp port Though eSATAp connectors have been built into several devices manufacturers do not refer to an official standard br br br Pre standard implementations br Prior to the final eSATA Gbit s specification many add on cards and some motherboards advertised eSATA Gbit s support because they had Gbit s SATA controllers for internal only solutions Those implementations are non standard and eSATA Gbit s requirements were ratified in the July SATA specification Some products might not be fully eSATA Gbit s compliant br br br Mini SATA mSATA br br Mini SATA abbreviated as mSATA which is distinct from the micro connector was announced by the Serial ATA International Organization on September Applications include netbooks laptops and other devices that require a solid state drive in a small footprint br The physical dimensions of the mSATA connector are identical to those of the PCI Express Mini Card interface but the interfaces are electrically incompatible the data signals TX RX SATA PETn PETp PERn PERp PCI Express need a connection to the SATA host controller instead of the PCI Express host controller br The M specification has superseded both mSATA and mini PCIe br br br SFF connector br br Slim inch SATA devices mm inches in height use the twenty pin SFF edge connector to save space By combining the data signals and power lines into a slim connector that effectively enables direct connection to the device s printed circuit board PCB without additional space consuming connectors SFF allows further internal layout compaction for portable devices such as ultrabooks br Pins to are on the connector s bottom side while pins to are on the top side br br br SATA Express br br SATA Express initially standardized in the SATA specification is an interface that supports either SATA or PCI Express storage devices The host connector is backward compatible with the standard inch SATA data connector allowing up to two legacy SATA devices to connect At the same time the host connector provides up to two PCI Express lanes as a pure PCI Express connection to the storage device allowing bandwidths of up to GB s br Instead of the otherwise usual approach of doubling the native speed of the SATA interface PCI Express was selected for achieving data transfer speeds greater than Gbit s It was concluded that doubling the native SATA speed would take too much time too many changes would be required to the SATA standard and would result in a much greater power consumption when compared to the existing PCI Express bus br In addition to supporting legacy Advanced Host Controller Interface AHCI SATA Express also makes it possible for NVM Express NVMe to be used as the logical device interface for connected PCI Express storage devices br As M form factor described below achieved much larger popularity SATA Express is considered as a failed standard and dedicated ports quickly disappeared from motherboards br br br M NGFF br br M formerly known as the Next Generation Form Factor NGFF is a specification for computer expansion cards and associated connectors It replaces the mSATA standard which uses the PCI Express Mini Card physical layout Having a smaller and more flexible physical specification together with more advanced features the M is more suitable for solid state storage applications in general especially when used in small devices such as ultrabooks or tablets br The M standard is designed as a revision and improvement to the mSATA standard so that larger printed circuit boards PCBs can be manufactured While mSATA took advantage of the existing PCI Express Mini Card form factor and connector M has been designed to maximize usage of the card space while minimizing the footprint br Supported host controller interfaces and internally provided ports are a superset to those defined by the SATA Express interface Essentially the M standard is a small form factor implementation of the SATA Express interface with the addition of an internal USB port br br br U SFF br U formerly known as SFF Like M it carries a PCI Express electrical signal however U uses a PCIe link providing a higher bandwidth of Gbit s in each direction In order to provide maximum backward compatibility the U connector also supports SATA and multi path SAS br br br Topology br br SATA uses a point to point architecture The physical connection between a controller and a storage device is not shared among other controllers and storage devices SATA defines multipliers which allows a single SATA controller port to drive up to fifteen storage devices The multiplier performs the function of a hub the controller and each storage device is connected to the hub This is conceptually similar to SAS expanders br Modern PC systems have SATA controllers built into the motherboard typically featuring two to eight ports Additional ports can be installed through add in SATA host adapters available in variety of bus interfaces USB PCI PCIe br br br Backward and forward compatibility br br br SATA and PATA br br At the hardware interface level SATA and PATA Parallel AT Attachment devices are completely incompatible they cannot be interconnected without an adapter br At the application level SATA devices can be specified to look and act like PATA devices br Many motherboards offer a Legacy Mode option which makes SATA drives appear to the OS like PATA drives on a standard controller This Legacy Mode eases OS installation by not requiring that a specific driver be loaded during setup but sacrifices support for some vendor specific features of SATA Legacy Mode often if not always disables some of the boards PATA or SATA ports since the standard PATA controller interface supports only four drives Often which ports are disabled is configurable br The common heritage of the ATA command set has enabled the proliferation of low cost PATA to SATA bridge chips Bridge chips were widely used on PATA drives before the completion of native SATA drives as well in standalone converters When attached to a PATA drive a device side converter allows the PATA drive to function as a SATA drive Host side converters allow a motherboard PATA port to connect to a SATA drive br The market has produced powered enclosures for both PATA and SATA drives that interface to the PC through USB Firewire or eSATA with the restrictions noted above PCI cards with a SATA connector exist that allow SATA drives to connect to legacy systems without SATA connectors br br br SATA Gbit s and SATA Gbit s br The designers of SATA standard as an overall goal aimed for backward and forward compatibility with future revisions of the SATA standard br To prevent interoperability problems that could occur when next generation SATA drives are installed on motherboards with standard legacy SATA Gbit s host controllers many manufacturers have made it easy to switch those newer drives to the previous standard s mode br Examples of such provisions include br br Seagate Maxtor has added a user accessible jumper switch known as the force to enable the drive switch between forced Gbit s and Gbit s negotiated operation br Western Digital uses a jumper setting called OPT enabled to force Gbit s data transfer speed OPT is enabled by putting the jumper on pins and br Samsung drives can be forced to Gbit s mode using software that may be downloaded from the manufacturer s website Configuring some Samsung drives in this manner requires the temporary use of a SATA SATA Gbit s controller while programming the drive br The force switch or equivalent is also useful for attaching SATA Gbit s hard drives to SATA controllers on PCI cards since many of these controllers such as the Silicon Image chips run at Gbit s even though the PCI bus cannot reach Gbit s speeds This can cause data corruption in operating systems that do not specifically test for this condition and limit the disk transfer speed br br br SATA Gbit s and SATA Gbit s br br SATA Gbit s and SATA Gbit s are compatible with each other Most devices that are only SATA Gbit s can connect with devices that are SATA Gbit s and vice versa though SATA Gbit s devices connect with SATA Gbit s devices only at the slower Gbit s speed br br br SATA Gbit s and SATA Gbit s br br SATA Gbit s and SATA Gbit s are compatible with each other Most devices that are only SATA Gbit s can connect with devices that are SATA Gbit s and vice versa though SATA Gbit s devices only connect with SATA Gbit s devices at the slower Gbit s speed br br br Comparison to other interfaces br br br SATA and SCSI br Parallel SCSI uses a more complex bus than SATA usually resulting in higher manufacturing costs SCSI buses also allow connection of several drives on one shared channel whereas SATA allows one drive per channel unless using a port multiplier Serial Attached SCSI uses the same physical interconnects as SATA and most SAS HBAs also support and Gbit s SATA devices an HBA requires support for Serial ATA Tunneling Protocol br SATA Gbit s theoretically offers a maximum bandwidth of MB s per device which is only slightly lower than the rated speed for SCSI Ultra with a maximum of MB s total for all devices on a bus SCSI drives provide greater sustained throughput than multiple SATA drives connected via a simple i e command based port multiplier because of disconnect reconnect and aggregating performance In general SATA devices link compatibly to SAS enclosures and adapters whereas SCSI devices cannot be directly connected to a SATA bus br SCSI SAS and fibre channel FC drives are more expensive than SATA so they are used in servers and disk arrays where the better performance justifies the additional cost Inexpensive ATA and SATA drives evolved in the home computer market hence there is a view that they are less reliable As those two worlds overlapped the subject of reliability became somewhat controversial Note that in general the failure rate of a disk drive is related to the quality of its heads platters and supporting manufacturing processes not to its interface br Use of serial ATA in the business market increased from in to in br br br Comparison with other buses br br SCSI devices with SCA connectors are designed for hot swapping Many server and RAID systems provide hardware support for transparent hot swapping The designers of the SCSI standard prior to SCA connectors did not target hot swapping but in practice most RAID implementations
