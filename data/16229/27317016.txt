id: 27317016
A mirrorless camera sometimes referred to as a mirrorless interchangeable lens camera MILC or digital single lens mirrorless DSLM is a digital camera which in contrast to DSLRs does not use a mirror in order to ensure that the image presented to the photographer through the viewfinder is identical to that taken by the camera They have come to replace DSLRs which have historically dominated interchangeable lens cameras Other terms include electronic viewfinder interchangeable lens EVIL cameras and compact system cameras CSCs br Lacking a mirror system allows the camera to be smaller quieter and lighter br In cameras with mirrors light from the lens is directed to either the image sensor or the viewfinder This is done using a mechanical movable mirror which sits behind the lens By contrast in a mirrorless camera the lens always shines light onto the image sensor and what the camera sees is displayed on a screen for the photographer Some mirrorless cameras also simulate a traditional viewfinder using a small screen known as an electronic viewfinder br DSLRs can act like mirrorless cameras if they have a live view mode in which the mirror moves out of the way so the lens can always shine onto the image sensor br Many mirrorless cameras retain a mechanical shutter Like a DSLR a mirrorless camera accepts interchangeable lenses Mirrorless cameras necessarily have worse battery life because they need to power the screen and sensor at all times br br br Design br Mirrorless cameras are mechanically simpler than DSLR cameras and are smaller lighter and quieter due to the elimination of the moving mirror While nearly all mirrorless cameras have a mechanical shutter many also have an electronic shutter allowing completely silent operation br As the image from the lens is always projected onto the image sensor features can be available which are only possible in DSLRs when the mirror is locked up into live view mode This includes the ability to show a focus peaking display zebra patterning and face or eye tracking The electronic viewfinder can provide live depth of field preview can show a poorly illuminated subject how it would look with correct exposure in real time and makes it easier to view the results of an exposure in bright sunlight br With the latest phase detect autofocus available on some mirrorless cameras the autofocus speed and accuracy of some models has been shown to be as good as DSLRs But mirrorless cameras have shorter battery life than DSLRs due to prolonged use of LCD and or OLED viewfinder displays and often smaller buffers to save battery On sensor autofocus is free of the adjustment requirements of the indirect focusing system of the DSLR which relies on a separate autofocus sensor located below the reflex mirror and as of mirrorless cameras could shoot with phase detect autofocus at up to frames per second using up to focus points a number far exceeding what was available on any DSLR However on sensor phase detection autofocus except for Canon s Dual Pixel Autofocus repurposes pixel sites for autofocus acquisition so that image data is partially or entirely missing for the autofocus pixels which can cause banding artifacts in the final image br br br History br br The term mirrorless came into use in order to describe Micro Four Thirds cameras when they were announced in especially as the first Micro Four Thirds camera the Lumix G was designed to be as similar to a DSLR as possible There are other terms that were created too but mirrorless became the most popular br Until the mid s mirrorless cameras were dismissed by many photographers because of their laggy and low resolution screens when compared with the clarity and responsiveness of the optical viewfinders used on DSLRs especially under strong sunlight or when photographing the sky at night In addition mirrorless cameras were known for having worse autofocus performance compared to DSLRs and much worse battery life This negative perception of mirrorless cameras began to change around when the Sony was released It was the first professional full frame mirrorless camera and although not the first with depth aware autofocus included small additional sensors on the main sensor to detect depth in the scene for fast autofocus phase detect br In mirrorless system cameras constituted about five percent of total camera shipments In they accounted for percent of system camera sales outside of the Americas and percent within the United States As of mirrorless cameras have come to overtake DSLRs as the dominant kind of interchangeable lens camera with them gaining market share over DSLRs and nearly all camera manufactures have switched entirely and exclusively to making mirrorless cameras and lenses br The first digital rangefinder camera commercially marketed was the Epson R D released in followed by the Leica M They were some of the first digital lens interchangeable cameras without a reflex mirror but they are not mirrorless cameras because they did not use a digital display system for live preview Compact cameras with large sensors technically akin to the current mirrorless cameras were also marketed in this period Cameras like Sony Cyber shot DSC R and Sigma DP proved that live preview operation is possible and useful with APS C sized sensors br The first mirrorless camera commercially marketed was the Panasonic Lumix DMC G released in Japan in October It was also the first camera of Micro Four Thirds system developed exclusively for the mirrorless ILC system br The Ricoh GXR November had a radically different design The mirrorless camera featured interchangeable lens units a sealed unit of a lens and sensor instead of the lens only being interchangeable This design was different from other mirrorless cameras and received mixed reviews primarily due to its higher cost br Following the introduction of the Micro Four Thirds system several other cameras were released by Panasonic and Olympus with the Olympus PEN E P announced June being the first mirrorless camera in a compact size pocketable with a small lens The Samsung NX announced January was the first camera in this class not using the Micro Four Thirds system instead utilizing a new proprietary lens mount Samsung NX mount The Sony Alpha NEX and NEX announced May and released in July saw Sony enter the market with a new proprietary lens mount the Sony E mount though the camera included LA EA and LA EA adapters for the legacy Minolta A mount br In June Pentax announced the Q mirrorless interchangeable lens camera and the Q mount lens system The original Q series featured a smaller inch megapixel CMOS sensor The Q introduced in has a slightly larger inch CMOS sensor with the same megapixel count br In September Nikon announced their Nikon system which consists of the Nikon J and Nikon V cameras and lenses The V features an electronic viewfinder The series includes high speed mirrorless cameras which according to Nikon had the fastest autofocus and the fastest continuous shooting speed fps of any camera with interchangeable lenses including DSLRs br The Fujifilm X Pro announced in January was the first non rangefinder mirrorless with a built in optical viewfinder Its hybrid viewfinder overlaid electronic information including shifting frame lines to compensate for the parallax effect Its successor the X Pro had an updated version of this viewfinder br Beyond just consumer interest mirrorless lens systems created significant interest from camera manufacturers as a possible alternative to high end camera manufacturing Mirrorless cameras have fewer moving parts than DSLRs and are more electronic which is an advantage to electronic manufacturers such as Panasonic and Samsung while reducing the advantage that dedicated camera manufacturers have in precision mechanical engineering Sony s entry level full frame mirrorless II camera has a megapixel axis stabilised sensor but is more compact and less expensive than any full frame sensor DSLR br Canon was the last of the major manufacturer of DSLRs to announce their own mirrorless camera announcing the Canon EOS M in with APS C sensor and mm registration distance similar to the one used by NEX br In the longer term Olympus decided that mirrorless may replace DSLRs entirely in some categories Olympus America s DSLR product manager speculated that by Olympus DSLRs the Olympus E system might be mirrorless though still using the Four Thirds System not Micro Four Thirds br Panasonic UK s Lumix G product manager John Mitchell speaking to the Press at the Focus on Imaging show in Birmingham reported that Panasonic G camera market share was almost doubling each year and that the UK Panasonic G captured over of all interchangeable camera sales in the UK in and that the UK CSC sales made up of the interchangeable lens market in the UK and in Japan br In May the prices of interchangeable lens camera ranged from US to a little higher than entry level DSLRs and significantly more than high end compact cameras br Sony announced their sales statistics in September which showed that mirrorless lenses had of the interchangeable lens market in Japan in Europe and worldwide Since then Nikon and others entered the mirrorless market br Due to the downward trend of the world camera market mirrorless camera sales suffered but not as drastically and was compensated with increase by about percent in the Japanese mirrorless camera market However mirrorless cameras took longer to catch on in Europe and North America According to Japanese photo industry sources mirrorless made up only of interchangeable lens cameras shipped to Europe in the first nine months of and of those shipped to the U S in the same period An industry researcher found that mirrorless camera sales in the U S fell by about in the three weeks leading up to December which included the key Black Friday shopping week in the same period DSLR sales went up br sales statistics showed that overall camera sales have fallen to one third of those of due to compact cameras being substituted by camera capable mobile phones Within camera sales ILCs have seen their market share increasing with ILCs being of overall camera sales of which DSLRs were and mirrorless cameras were In the Americas in DSLR annual sales fell by per annum while mirrorless sales over the same month period have increased by In Japan mirrorless cameras outsold DSLRs during some parts of the year In mirrorless cameras accounted for percent of interchangeable lens camera sales outside the Americas although a lesser share of percent was in the U S br In late Olympus announced their OM D E M Mark II camera a successor to the earlier and successful Mark I The Mark II model retains a Micro Four Thirds image sensor of x mm and features a megapixel resolution lens representing a new generation of mirrorless cameras competitive with and in many respects superior to DSLR cameras br In early Sony announces the Alpha mirrorless camera offering autofocus points and frame per second shooting In October Sony announces the A RIII offering FPS shooting at megapixels br In early Sony announced the A III mirrorless camera bringing the autofocus points of the A at a much lower cost In August Nikon announced its new full frame mirrorless Z and Z cameras both using a new lens mount Canon announced its first full frame mirrorless model the EOS R and its own new lens mount the next month br At the NAB Show in April Blackmagic Design announced and demonstrated the Pocket Cinema Camera K at a price of USD br br br Sensor size br br A full frame camera is a digital camera with a digital sensor the same size as mm format mm mm film Cameras that have a smaller sensor than full frame such as APS C and Micro Four Thirds differ in having a crop factor Digital cameras with a larger sensor than full frame are called medium format after medium format film cameras that use the and film formats although their sensors are generally much smaller than the frame size of medium format film cameras br Sony was the first to introduce a full frame mirrorless camera the in It was followed by the Leica SL Typ in br Nikon and Canon each launched full frame mirrorless cameras in September Panasonic and Sigma under the L Mount Alliance announced that they will be using the Leica L Mount for their own full frame mirrorless cameras Panasonic announced its S R and S cameras and Sigma announced a then unnamed camera later called the fp all to be launched in along with lenses from Panasonic and Sigma br br br Systems comparison br br br See also br List of smallest mirrorless cameras br br br
