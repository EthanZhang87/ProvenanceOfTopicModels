A graphics card also called a video card display card graphics accelerator graphics adapter VGA card VGA video adapter display adapter or colloquially GPU is a computer expansion card that generates a feed of graphics output to a display device such as a monitor Graphics cards are sometimes called discrete or dedicated graphics cards to emphasize their distinction to an integrated graphics processor on the motherboard or the central processing unit CPU A graphics processing unit GPU that performs the necessary computations is the main component in a graphics card but the acronym GPU is sometimes also used to erroneously refer to the graphics card as a whole br Most graphics cards are not limited to simple display output The graphics processing unit can be used for additional processing which reduces the load from the central processing unit Additionally computing platforms such as OpenCL and CUDA allow using graphics cards for general purpose computing Applications of general purpose computing on graphics cards include AI training cryptocurrency mining and molecular simulation br Usually a graphics card comes in the form of a printed circuit board expansion board which is to be inserted into an expansion slot Others may have dedicated enclosures and they are connected to the computer via a docking station or a cable These are known as external GPUs eGPUs br Graphics cards are often preferred over integrated graphics for increased performance br br br History br br Graphics cards historically supported different computer display standards as they evolved For the IBM PC compatibles common early standards were MDA CGA Hercules EGA and VGA br In the late s the like of Radius produced graphics cards for the Apple Macintosh II with discrete D QuickDraw capabilities br dfx Interactive was one of the first companies to develop a consumer facing GPU with D acceleration with the Voodoo series and the first to develop a graphical chipset dedicated to D but without D support which therefore required the presence of a D card to work br NVIDIA RIVA was one of the first consumer facing GPU integrated D processing unit and D processing unit on a chip br The majority of modern graphics cards are built with either AMD sourced or Nvidia sourced graphics chips Most graphics cards offer various functions such as D rendering D graphics video decoding TV output and the ability to connect multiple monitors multi monitor Graphics cards also have sound card capabilities to output sound along with video output for connected TVs or monitors with integrated speakers br Within the industry graphics cards are sometimes called graphics add in boards abbreviated as AIBs with the word graphics usually omitted br br br Discrete vs integrated graphics br br As an alternative to the use of a graphics card video hardware can be integrated into the motherboard CPU or a system on chip as integrated graphics Motherboard based implementations are sometimes called on board video Some motherboards support using both integrated graphics and the graphics card simultaneously to feed separate displays The main advantages of integrated graphics are a low cost compactness simplicity and low energy consumption Integrated graphics often has less performance than a graphics card because the graphics processing unit inside integrated graphics needs to share system resources with the CPU On the other hand a graphics card has a separate random access memory RAM cooling system and dedicated power regulators A graphics card can offload work and reduce memory bus contention from the CPU and system RAM therefore the overall performance for a computer could improve in addition to increased performance in graphics processing Such improvements to performance can be seen in video gaming D animation and video editing br Both AMD and Intel have introduced CPUs and motherboard chipsets which support the integration of a GPU into the same die as the CPU AMD advertises CPUs with integrated graphics under the trademark Accelerated Processing Unit APU while Intel brands similar technology under Intel Graphics Technology br br br Power demand br As the processing power of graphics cards increased so did their demand for electrical power Current high performance graphics cards tend to consume large amounts of power For example the thermal design power TDP for the GeForce Titan RTX is watts When tested with video games the GeForce RTX Ti Founder s Edition averaged watts of power consumption While CPU and power supply manufacturers have recently aimed toward higher efficiency power demands of graphics cards continued to rise with the largest power consumption of any individual part in a computer Although power supplies have also increased their power output the bottleneck occurs in the PCI Express connection which is limited to supplying watts br Modern graphics cards with a power consumption of over watts usually include a combination of six pin W or eight pin W sockets that connect directly to the power supply Providing adequate cooling becomes a challenge in such computers Computers with multiple graphics cards may require power supplies over watts Heat extraction becomes a major design consideration for computers with two or more high end graphics cards br As of the Nvidia GeForce RTX series Ampere architecture a custom flashed RTX named Hall of Fame has been recorded to reach a peak power draw as high as watts A standard RTX can peak at up to watts The RTX can reach up to watts while a can reach a similar if not slightly lower peak power draw Ampere cards of the Founders Edition variant feature a dual axial flow through cooler design which includes fans above and below the card to dissipate as much heat as possible towards the rear of the computer case A similar design was used by the Sapphire Radeon RX Vega Pulse graphics card br br br Size br Graphics cards for desktop computers have different size profiles which allows graphics cards to be added to smaller sized computers Some graphics cards are not of the usual size and are named as low profile Graphics card profiles are based on height only with low profile cards taking up less than the height of a PCIe slot some can be as low as half height Length and thickness can vary greatly with high end cards usually occupying two or three expansion slots and with modern high end graphics cards such as the RTX exceeding mm in length A lower profile card is preferred when trying to fit multiple cards or if graphics cards run into clearance issues with other motherboard components like the DIMM or PCIE slots This can be fixed with a larger computer case such as mid tower or full tower Full towers are usually able to fit larger motherboards in sizes like ATX and micro ATX br br br Multicard scaling br Some graphics cards can be linked together to allow scaling graphics processing across multiple cards This is done using either the PCIe bus on the motherboard or more commonly a data bridge Usually the cards must be of the same model to be linked and most low end cards are not able to be linked in this way AMD and Nvidia both have proprietary scaling methods CrossFireX for AMD and SLI since the Turing generation superseded by NVLink for Nvidia Cards from different chip set manufacturers or architectures cannot be used together for multi card scaling If graphics cards have different sizes of memory the lowest value will be used with the higher values disregarded Currently scaling on consumer grade cards can be done using up to four cards The use of four cards requires a large motherboard with a proper configuration Nvidia s GeForce GTX graphics card can be configured in a four card configuration As stated above users will want to stick to cards with the same performances for optimal use Motherboards including ASUS Maximus Extreme and Gigabyte GA EX Extreme are certified to work with this configuration A large power supply is necessary to run the cards in SLI or CrossFireX Power demands must be known before a proper supply is installed For the four card configuration a watt supply is needed With any relatively powerful graphics card thermal management cannot be ignored Graphics cards require well vented chassis and good thermal solutions Air or water cooling are usually required though low end GPUs can use passive cooling Larger configurations use water solutions or immersion cooling to achieve proper performance without thermal throttling br SLI and Crossfire have become increasingly uncommon as most games do not fully utilize multiple GPUs due to the fact that most users cannot afford them Multiple GPUs are still used on supercomputers like in Summit on workstations to accelerate video and D rendering visual effects for simulations and for training artificial intelligence br br br D graphics APIs br A graphics driver usually supports one or multiple cards by the same vendor and has to be written for a specific operating system Additionally the operating system or an extra software package may provide certain programming APIs for applications to perform D rendering br br br Specific usage br Some GPUs are designed with specific usage in mind br br Gaming br GeForce GTX br GeForce RTX br Nvidia Titan br Radeon HD br Radeon RX br Intel Arc br Cloud gaming br Nvidia Grid br Radeon Sky br Workstation br Nvidia Quadro br AMD FirePro br Radeon Pro br Intel Arc Pro br Cloud Workstation br Nvidia Tesla br AMD FireStream br Artificial Intelligence Cloud br Nvidia Tesla br Radeon Instinct br Automated Driverless car br Nvidia Drive PX br br br Industry br As of the primary suppliers of the GPUs graphics chips or chipsets used in graphics cards are AMD and Nvidia In the third quarter of AMD had a market share while Nvidia had according to Jon Peddie Research In economics this industry structure is termed a duopoly AMD and Nvidia also build and sell graphics cards which are termed graphics add in boards AIBs in the industry See Comparison of Nvidia graphics processing units and Comparison of AMD graphics processing units In addition to marketing their own graphics cards AMD and Nvidia sell their GPUs to authorized AIB suppliers which AMD and Nvidia refer to as partners The fact that Nvidia and AMD compete directly with their customer partners complicates relationships in the industry AMD and Intel being direct competitors in the CPU industry is also noteworthy since AMD based graphics cards may be used in computers with Intel CPUs Intel s integrated graphics may weaken AMD in which the latter derives a significant portion of its revenue from its APUs As of the second quarter of there were AIB suppliers These AIB suppliers may market graphics cards under their own brands produce graphics cards for private label brands or produce graphics cards for computer manufacturers Some AIB suppliers such as MSI build both AMD based and Nvidia based graphics cards Others such as EVGA build only Nvidia based graphics cards while XFX now builds only AMD based graphics cards Several AIB suppliers are also motherboard suppliers Most of the largest AIB suppliers are based in Taiwan and they include ASUS MSI GIGABYTE and Palit Hong Kong based AIB manufacturers include Sapphire and Zotac Sapphire and Zotac also sell graphics cards exclusively for AMD and Nvidia GPUs respectively br br br Market br Graphics card shipments peaked at a total of million in By contrast they totaled million units in the third quarter of a fall from Q levels Shipments reached an annual total of million in The sales of graphics cards have trended downward due to improvements in integrated graphics technologies high end CPU integrated graphics can provide competitive performance with low end graphics cards At the same time graphics card sales have grown within the high end segment as manufacturers have shifted their focus to prioritize the gaming and enthusiast market br Beyond the gaming and multimedia segments graphics cards have been increasingly used for general purpose computing such as big data processing The growth of cryptocurrency has placed a severely high demand on high end graphics cards especially in large quantities due to their advantages in the process of cryptocurrency mining In January mid to high end graphics cards experienced a major surge in price with many retailers having stock shortages due to the significant demand among this market Graphics card companies released mining specific cards designed to run hours a day seven days a week and without video output ports The graphics card industry took a setback due to the chip shortage br br br Parts br br A modern graphics card consists of a printed circuit board on which the components are mounted These include br br br Graphics processing unit br br A graphics processing unit GPU also occasionally called visual processing unit VPU is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the building of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display Because of the large degree of programmable computational complexity for such a task a modern graphics card is also a computer unto itself br br br Heat sink br A heat sink is mounted on most modern graphics cards A heat sink spreads out the heat produced by the graphics processing unit evenly throughout the heat sink and unit itself The heat sink commonly has a fan mounted to cool the heat sink and the graphics processing unit Not all cards have heat sinks for example some cards are liquid cooled and instead have a water block additionally cards from the s and early s did not produce much heat and did not require heat sinks Most modern graphics cards need proper thermal solutions They can be water cooled or through heat sinks with additional connected heat pipes usually made of copper for the best thermal transfer br br br Video BIOS br The video BIOS or firmware contains a minimal program for the initial set up and control of the graphics card It may contain information on the memory and memory timing operating speeds and voltages of the graphics processor and other details which can sometimes be changed br Modern Video BIOSes do not support full functionalities of graphics cards they are only sufficient to identify and initialize the card to display one of a few frame buffer or text display modes It does not support YUV to RGB translation video scaling pixel copying compositing or any of the multitude of other D and D features of the graphics card which must be accessed by software drivers br br br Video memory br br The memory capacity of most modern graphics cards ranges from to GB But with up to GB as of the last s the applications for graphics use are becoming more powerful and widespread Since video memory needs to be accessed by the GPU and the display circuitry it often uses special high speed or multi port memory such as VRAM WRAM SGRAM etc Around the video memory was typically based on DDR technology During and after that year manufacturers moved towards DDR GDDR GDDR GDDR GDDR X and GDDR The effective memory clock rate in modern cards is generally between and GHz br Video memory may be used for storing other data as well as the screen image such as the Z buffer which manages the depth coordinates in D graphics as well as textures vertex buffers and compiled shader programs br br br RAMDAC br The RAMDAC or random access memory digital to analog converter converts digital signals to analog signals for use by a computer display that uses analog inputs such as cathode ray tube CRT displays The RAMDAC is a kind of RAM chip that regulates the functioning of the graphics card Depending on the number of bits used and the RAMDAC data transfer rate the converter will be able to support different computer display refresh rates With CRT displays it is best to work over Hz and never under Hz to minimize flicker This is not a problem with LCD displays as they have little to no flicker Due to the growing popularity of digital computer displays and the integration of the RAMDAC onto the GPU die it has mostly disappeared as a discrete component All current LCD plasma monitors and TVs and projectors with only digital connections work in the digital domain and do not require a RAMDAC for those connections There are displays that feature analog inputs VGA component SCART etc only These require a RAMDAC but they reconvert the analog signal back to digital before they can display it with the unavoidable loss of quality stemming from this digital to analog to digital conversion With the VGA standard being phased out in favor of digital formats RAMDACs have started to disappear from graphics cards br br br Output interfaces br br The most common connection systems between the graphics card and the computer display are br br br Video Graphics Array VGA DE br br Also known as D sub VGA is an analog based standard adopted in the late s designed for CRT displays also called VGA connector Today the VGA analog interface is used for high definition video resolutions including p and higher Some problems of this standard are electrical noise image distortion and sampling error in evaluating pixels While the VGA transmission bandwidth is high enough to support even higher resolution playback the picture quality can degrade depending on cable quality and length The extent of quality difference depends on the individual s eyesight and the display when using a DVI or HDMI connection especially on larger sized LCD LED monitors or TVs quality degradation if present is prominently visible Blu ray playback at p is possible via the VGA analog interface if Image Constraint Token ICT is not enabled on the Blu ray disc br br br Digital Visual Interface DVI br br Digital Visual Interface is a digital based standard designed for displays such as flat panel displays LCDs plasma screens wide high definition television displays and video projectors There were also some rare high end CRT monitors that use DVI It avoids image distortion and electrical noise corresponding each pixel from the computer to a display pixel using its native resolution It is worth noting that most manufacturers include a DVI I connector allowing via simple adapter standard RGB signal output to an old CRT or LCD monitor with VGA input br br br Video in video out VIVO for S Video composite video and component video br br These connectors are included to allow connection with televisions DVD players video recorders and video game consoles They often come in two pin mini DIN connector variations and the VIVO splitter cable generally comes with either connectors S Video in and out plus composite video in and out or connectors S Video in and out component YPBPR out and composite in and out br br br High Definition Multimedia Interface HDMI br br HDMI is a compact audio video interface for transferring uncompressed video data and compressed uncompressed digital audio data from an HDMI compliant device the source device to a compatible digital audio device computer monitor video projector or digital television HDMI is a digital replacement for existing analog video standards HDMI supports copy protection through HDCP br br br DisplayPort br br DisplayPort is a digital display interface developed by the Video Electronics Standards Association VESA The interface is primarily used to connect a video source to a display device such as a computer monitor though it can also be used to transmit audio USB and other forms of data br The VESA specification is royalty free VESA designed it to replace VGA DVI and LVDS Backward compatibility to VGA and DVI by using adapter dongles enables consumers to use DisplayPort fitted video sources without replacing existing display devices Although DisplayPort has a greater throughput of the same functionality as HDMI it is expected to complement the interface not replace it br br br USB C br br br Other types of connection systems br br br Motherboard interfaces br br
