title: Glass cockpit
id: 482371
A glass cockpit is an aircraft cockpit that features an array of electronic digital flight instrument displays typically large LCD screens rather than traditional analog dials and gauges While a traditional cockpit relies on numerous mechanical gauges nicknamed steam gauges to display information a glass cockpit uses several multi function displays and a primary flight display driven by flight management systems that can be adjusted to show flight information as needed This simplifies aircraft operation and navigation and allows pilots to focus only on the most pertinent information They are also popular with airline companies as they usually eliminate the need for a flight engineer saving costs In recent years the technology has also become widely available in small aircraft br br As aircraft displays have modernized the sensors that feed them have modernized as well Traditional gyroscopic flight instruments have been replaced by electronic attitude and heading reference systems AHRS and air data computers ADCs improving reliability and reducing cost and maintenance GPS receivers are usually integrated into glass cockpits br Early glass cockpits found in the McDonnell Douglas MD Boeing Classic ATR ATR and in the Airbus A and A used electronic flight instrument systems EFIS to display attitude and navigational information only with traditional mechanical gauges retained for airspeed altitude vertical speed and engine performance The Boeing and introduced an electronic engine indicating and crew alerting system EICAS for monitoring engine performance while retaining mechanical gauges for airspeed altitude and vertical speed br Later glass cockpits found in the Boeing NG Airbus A later Airbuses Ilyushin Il and Tupolev Tu have completely replaced the mechanical gauges and warning lights in previous generations of aircraft While glass cockpit equipped aircraft throughout the late th century still retained analog altimeters attitude and airspeed indicators as standby instruments in case the EFIS displays failed more modern aircraft have increasingly been using digital standby instruments as well such as the integrated standby instrument system br br br History br br Glass cockpits originated in military aircraft in the late s and early s an early example is the Mark II avionics of the F D first ordered in delivered from to which featured a multi function display br Prior to the s air transport operations were not considered sufficiently demanding to require advanced equipment like electronic flight displays Also computer technology was not at a level where sufficiently light and powerful electronics were available The increasing complexity of transport aircraft the advent of digital systems and the growing air traffic congestion around airports began to change that br The Boeing was one of the earliest commercial aircraft designed with a glass cockpit Most cockpit instruments were still analog but cathode ray tube CRT displays were to be used for the attitude indicator and horizontal situation indicator HSI However the was cancelled in after insurmountable technical difficulties and ultimately the end of project funding by the US government br The average transport aircraft in the mid s had more than one hundred cockpit instruments and controls and the primary flight instruments were already crowded with indicators crossbars and symbols and the growing number of cockpit elements were competing for cockpit space and pilot attention As a result NASA conducted research on displays that could process the raw aircraft system and flight data into an integrated easily understood picture of the flight situation culminating in a series of flights demonstrating a full glass cockpit system br The success of the NASA led glass cockpit work is reflected in the total acceptance of electronic flight displays The safety and efficiency of flights have been increased with improved pilot understanding of the aircraft s situation relative to its environment or situational awareness br By the end of the s liquid crystal display LCD panels were increasingly favored among aircraft manufacturers because of their efficiency reliability and legibility Earlier LCD panels suffered from poor legibility at some viewing angles and poor response times making them unsuitable for aviation Modern aircraft such as the Boeing Next Generation ER F ER and Airbus A family later versions A later versions A A later versions A and A are fitted with glass cockpits consisting of LCD units br br The glass cockpit has become standard equipment in airliners business jets and military aircraft It was fitted into NASA s Space Shuttle orbiters Atlantis Columbia Discovery and Endeavour and the Russian Soyuz TMA model spacecraft that were launched for the first time in By the end of the century glass cockpits began appearing in general aviation aircraft as well In Cirrus Design s SR and SR became the first light aircraft equipped with glass cockpits which they made standard on all Cirrus aircraft By even basic trainers like the Piper Cherokee and Cessna were shipping with glass cockpits as options which nearly all customers chose as well as many modern utility aircraft such as the Diamond DA The Lockheed Martin F Lightning II features a panoramic cockpit display touchscreen that replaces most of the switches and toggles found in an aircraft cockpit The civilian Cirrus Vision SF has the same which they call a Perspective Touch glass cockpit br br br Uses br br br Commercial aviation br br Unlike the previous era of glass cockpits where designers merely copied the look and feel of conventional electromechanical instruments onto cathode ray tubes the new displays represent a true departure They look and behave very similarly to other computers with windows and data that can be manipulated with point and click devices They also add terrain approach charts weather vertical displays and D navigation images br The improved concepts enable aircraft makers to customize cockpits to a greater degree than previously All of the manufacturers involved have chosen to do so in one way or another such as using a trackball thumb pad or joystick as a pilot input device in a computer style environment Many of the modifications offered by the aircraft manufacturers improve situational awareness and customize the human machine interface to increase safety br Modern glass cockpits might include synthetic vision systems SVS or enhanced flight vision systems EFVS Synthetic vision systems display a realistic D depiction of the outside world similar to a flight simulator based on a database of terrain and geophysical features in conjunction with the attitude and position information gathered from the aircraft navigational systems Enhanced flight vision systems add real time information from external sensors such as an infrared camera br All new airliners such as the Airbus A Boeing and private jets such as Bombardier Global Express and Learjet use glass cockpits br br br General aviation br br Many modern general aviation aircraft are available with glass cockpits Systems such as the Garmin G are now available on many new GA aircraft including the classic Cessna Many small aircraft can also be modified post production to replace analogue instruments br Glass cockpits are also popular as a retrofit for older private jets and turboprops such as Dassault Falcons Raytheon Hawkers Bombardier Challengers Cessna Citations Gulfstreams King Airs Learjets Astras and many others Aviation service companies work closely with equipment manufacturers to address the needs of the owners of these aircraft br br br Consumer research hobby recreational aviation br Today smartphones and tablets use mini applications or apps to remotely control complex devices by WiFi radio interface They demonstrate how the glass cockpit idea is being applied to consumer devices Applications include toy grade UAVs which use the display and touch screen of a tablet or smartphone to employ every aspect of the glass cockpit for instrument display and fly by wire for aircraft control br br br Spaceflight br br The glass cockpit idea made news in s trade magazines like Aviation Week Space Technology when NASA announced that it would be replacing most of the electro mechanical flight instruments in the space shuttles with glass cockpit components The articles mentioned how glass cockpit components had the added benefit of being a few hundred pounds lighter than the original flight instruments and support systems used in the Space Shuttles The Space Shuttle Atlantis was the first orbiter to be retrofitted with a glass cockpit in with the launch of STS Columbia was the second orbiter with a glass cockpit on STS in followed by Discovery in with STS and Endeavour in with STS br NASA s Orion spacecraft will use glass cockpits derived from Boeing Dreamliner br br br Safety br As aircraft operation depends on glass cockpit systems flight crews must be trained to deal with failures The Airbus A family has seen fifty incidents where several flight displays were lost br On January United Airlines Flight experienced a serious glass cockpit blackout losing half of the Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor ECAM displays as well as all radios transponders Traffic Collision Avoidance System TCAS and attitude indicators The pilots were able to land at Newark Airport without radio contact in good weather and daylight conditions br Airbus has offered an optional fix which the US National Transportation Safety Board NTSB has suggested to the US Federal Aviation Administration FAA as mandatory but the FAA has yet to make it a requirement A preliminary NTSB factsheet is available Due to the possibility of a blackout glass cockpit aircraft also have an integrated standby instrument system that includes at a minimum an artificial horizon altimeter and airspeed indicator It is electronically separate from the main instruments and can run for several hours on a backup battery br In the NTSB published a study done on general aviation light aircraft The study found that although aircraft equipped with glass cockpits had a lower overall accident rate they also had a larger chance of being involved in a fatal accident The NTSB Chairman said in response to the study br br Training is clearly one of the key components to reducing the accident rate of light planes equipped with glass cockpits and this study clearly demonstrates the life and death importance of appropriate training on these complex systems While the technological innovations and flight management tools that glass cockpit equipped airplanes bring to the general aviation community should reduce the number of fatal accidents we have not unfortunately seen that happen br br br See also br Cockpit display system br Primary flight display br Electronic flight instrument
