title: D-pad
id: 991818
A D pad short for directional pad is a flat typically thumb operated directional control D pads are found on nearly all modern gamepads handheld game consoles and audiovisual device remote controls Because they operate using four internal push buttons arrayed at angles the vast majority of D pads provide discrete rather than continuous directional options typically limited to up down left and right and sometimes offering intermediate diagonals by means of two button combinations br Although D pads offer less flexibility than analog sticks they offer high accuracy and can be manipulated with minimal movement by the thumb They require comparatively little maintenance and their minimal profile makes them ideal for portable devices br D pads have appeared on diverse forms of electronic equipment including calculators PDAs mobile phones and car stereos br br br History br A precursor to the D pad was the four directional buttons used in arcade video games such as Gremlin s Blockade and SNK s Vanguard A precursor to the standard D pad on a video game console was used by the Intellivision which was released by Mattel Electronics in The Intellivision s unique controller featured the first alternative to a joystick on a home console a rotating circular pad that allowed for directions of movement by pressing it with the thumb A precursor to the D pad also appeared on Entex s short lived Select A Game cartridge based handheld system it featured non connected raised left right up and down buttons aligned to the left of a row of action buttons Similar directional buttons were also used on the Atari Game Brain the unreleased precursor to the Atari and on some early dedicated game consoles such as the VideoMaster Star Chess game A controller similar to the D pad appeared in on a handheld game system Cosmic Hunter on Milton Bradley s Microvision it featured four directional buttons around a fifth button in the center all under a single rubber membrane br Nintendo s known cross design was developed in by Gunpei Yokoi for their Donkey Kong handheld game The design proved to be popular for subsequent Game Watch titles although the previously introduced non connected D pad style was still utilized on various later Game Watch titles including the Super Mario Bros handheld game This particular design was patented and later earned a Technology Engineering Emmy Award br Initially intended to be a compact controller for the Game Watch handheld games alongside the prior non connected style pad Nintendo realized that Yokoi s updated design would also be appropriate for regular consoles and Nintendo made the D pad the standard directional control for the hugely successful Famicom Nintendo Entertainment System first released under the name Control Pad All major video game consoles since have had a D pad of some shape on their controllers until the Nintendo Switch in which used the older four button design on its included Joy Con controller allowing each Joy Con to be used as an individual controller for multiplayer games the optional Switch Pro Controller and the handheld only Nintendo Switch Lite retain the usual D pad To avoid infringing on Nintendo s patent most controller manufacturers use a cross in a circle shape for the D pad br In the Japanese company Epoch created a handheld game system called the Epoch Game Pocket Computer It featured a D pad but it was not popular for its time and soon faded Following the release of the Sega Mega Drive in Sega coined the term D button to describe the pad using the term when describing the controllers for the Sega Genesis in instruction manuals and other literature Arcade games however have largely continued using joysticks br Modern consoles beginning with the Nintendo provide both a D pad and a compact thumb operated analog stick depending on the game one type of control may be more appropriate than the other In many cases with games that use a thumbstick the D pad is used as a set of extra buttons all four usually centered on a kind of task such as using items Even without an analog stick some software uses the D pad s directional capabilities to act as eight discrete buttons not related to direction or on screen movement at all Jam Sessions for the Nintendo DS for example uses the D pad to select music chords during play br br br On non gaming equipment br D pads appear on a number of menu driven devices as a simple navigational tool though superficially similar to those used for gaming devices they are not optimized for real time control and therefore can usually accept input from only one direction at a time Many though not all such designs include a trigger button in the center of the button arrangement usually labeled Enter OK or the like Some older devices do not have D pads as such but simple single axis up down or left right pads On some remotes the D pad can also be used to control a robot using a signal compatible receiver br On remote control devices the buttons on the D pad function in the same manner as other buttons and are generally used to navigate on screen menus Though initially not common the quick success of the DVD format led to wide availability of remote designs with D pads circa and most current menu driven consumer electronics devices include some sort of D pad on the remote and occasionally on the unit itself br In addition many small computing and communications devices particularly PDAs mobile phones and GPS receivers include D pads not only for menu navigation but as general input devices similar to a joystick or mouse Less sophisticated designs similar to those on remote controls appear on some calculators particularly scientific and graphing calculators which use the D pad for cursor control on multi line screens as well as input output recall menu navigation and occasionally direct screen access graphing calculators in particular allow the use of the D pad to determine values at specific points on a displayed graph On programmable units the D pad can also be mapped directly allowing it to be used as a gaming or pointer control br br br Consoles with
