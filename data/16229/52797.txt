A digital camera also called a digicam is a camera that captures photographs in digital memory Most cameras produced today are digital largely replacing those that capture images on photographic film or film stock Digital cameras are now widely incorporated into mobile devices like smartphones with the same or more capabilities and features of dedicated cameras High end high definition dedicated cameras are still commonly used by professionals and those who desire to take higher quality photographs br Digital and digital movie cameras share an optical system typically using a lens with a variable diaphragm to focus light onto an image pickup device The diaphragm and shutter admit a controlled amount of light to the image just as with film but the image pickup device is electronic rather than chemical However unlike film cameras digital cameras can display images on a screen immediately after being recorded and store and delete images from memory Many digital cameras can also record moving videos with sound Some digital cameras can crop and stitch pictures and perform other kinds of image editing br br br History br br The first semiconductor image sensor was the charge coupled device CCD invented by Willard S Boyle and George E Smith at Bell Labs in based on MOS capacitor technology The NMOS active pixel sensor was later invented by Tsutomu Nakamura s team at Olympus in which led to the development of the CMOS active pixel sensor CMOS sensor at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in br In the s Eugene F Lally of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory was thinking about how to use a mosaic photosensor to capture digital images His idea was to take pictures of the planets and stars while travelling through space to give information about the astronauts position As with Texas Instruments employee Willis Adcock s film less camera US patent in the technology had yet to catch up with the concept br In the Landsat satellite s multispectral scanner MSS started taking digital images of Earth The MSS designed by Virginia Norwood at Hughes Aircraft Company starting in captured and transmitted image data from green red and two infrared bands with bits per channel using a mechanical rocking mirror and an array of detectors Operating for six years it transmitted more than digital photographs of Earth while orbiting the planet about times per day br Also in Thomas McCord from MIT and James Westphal from Cal Tech together developed a digital camera for use with telescopes Their photometer digitizer system used an analog to digital converter and a digital frame memory to store x pixel images of planets and stars which were then recorded on digital magnetic tape CCD sensors were not yet commercially available and the camera used a silicon diode vidicon tube detector which was cooled using dry ice to reduce dark current allowing exposure times of up to one hour br The Cromemco Cyclops was an all digital camera introduced as a commercial product in Its design was published as a hobbyist construction project in the February issue of Popular Electronics magazine It used a metal oxide semiconductor MOS image sensor which was a modified MOS dynamic RAM DRAM memory chip br Steven Sasson an engineer at Eastman Kodak built a self contained electronic camera that used a monochrome Fairchild CCD image sensor in Around the same time Fujifilm began developing CCD technology in the s Early uses were mainly military and scientific followed by medical and news applications br The first filmless SLR single lens reflex camera was publicly demonstrated by Sony in August The Sony Mavica magnetic still video camera used a color striped format CCD sensor with K pixels along with analogue video signal processing and recording The Mavica electronic still camera recorded FM modulated analog video signals on a newly developed magnetic floppy disk dubbed the Mavipak The disk format was later standardized as the Still Video Floppy or SVF br The Canon RC introduced in May was the first SVF camera and the first electronic SLR camera sold in the US It employed an SLR viewfinder included a format color CCD sensor with K pixels and was sold along with a removable mm and mm zoom lens br Over the next few years many other companies began selling SVF cameras These analog electronic cameras included the Nikon QV C which had an SLR viewfinder and a format monochrome CCD sensor with K pixels and recorded analog black and white images on a Still Video Floppy br At Photokina Fujifilm introduced the FUJIX DS P the first fully digital camera which recorded digital images using a semiconductor memory card The camera s memory card had a capacity of MB of SRAM static random access memory and could hold up to ten photographs In Fujifilm released the FUJIX DS X the first fully digital camera to be commercially released In Toshiba s MB flash memory card was adopted for several digital cameras br The first commercial camera phone was the Kyocera Visual Phone VP released in Japan in May It was called a mobile videophone at the time and had a pixel front facing camera It stored up to JPEG digital images which could be sent over e mail or the phone could send up to two images per second over Japan s Personal Handy phone System PHS cellular network The Samsung SCH V released in South Korea in June was also one of the first phones with a built in camera It had a TFT liquid crystal display LCD and stored up to digital photos at pixel resolution However it could not send the resulting image over the telephone function but required a computer connection to access photos The first mass market camera phone was the J SH a Sharp J Phone model sold in Japan in November It could instantly transmit pictures via cell phone telecommunication By the mid s higher end cell phones had an integrated digital camera and by the early s almost all smartphones had an integrated digital camera br br br Image sensors br br The two major types of digital image sensors are CCD and CMOS A CCD sensor has one amplifier for all the pixels while each pixel in a CMOS active pixel sensor has its own amplifier Compared to CCDs CMOS sensors use less power Cameras with a small sensor use a back side illuminated CMOS BSI CMOS sensor The image processing capabilities of the camera determine the outcome of the final image quality much more than the sensor type br br br Sensor resolution br The resolution of a digital camera is often limited by the image sensor that turns light into discrete signals The brighter the image at a given point on the sensor the larger the value that is read for that pixel br Depending on the physical structure of the sensor a color filter array may be used which requires demosaicing to recreate a full color image The number of pixels in the sensor determines the camera s pixel count br In a typical sensor the pixel count is the product of the number of rows and the number of columns For example a by pixel sensor would have pixels or megapixel br br br Resolution options br Firmwares resolution selector allows the user to optionally lower the resolution to reduce the file size per picture and extend lossless digital zooming The bottom resolution option is typically pixels megapixels br A lower resolution extends the number of remaining photos in free space postponing the exhaustion of space storage which is of use where no further data storage device is available and for captures of lower significance where the benefit from less space storage consumption outweighs the disadvantage from reduced detail br br br Image sharpness br An image s sharpness is presented through the crisp detail defined lines and its depicted contrast Sharpness is a factor of multiple systems throughout the DSLR camera by its ISO resolution lens and the lens settings the environment of the image and its post processing Images have a possibility of being too sharp but they can never be too in focus br A digital camera resolution is determined by a digital sensor The digital sensor indicates a high level of sharpness can be produced through the amount of noise and grain that is tolerated through the lens of the camera Resolution within the field of digital still and digital movies is indicated through the camera s ability to determine detail based on the distance which is then measured by frame size pixel type number and organization although some DSLR cameras have resolutions limited it is almost impossible to not have the proper sharpness for an image The ISO choice when taking a photo affects the quality of the image as high ISO settings equate to an image that is less sharp due to the increased amount of noise allowed into the image along with too little noise can also produce an image that is not sharp br br br Methods of image capture br br Since the first digital backs were introduced there have been three main methods of capturing the image each based on the hardware configuration of the sensor and color filters br Single shot capture systems use either one sensor chip with a Bayer filter mosaic or three separate image sensors one each for the primary additive colors red green and blue which are exposed to the same image via a beam splitter see Three CCD camera br Multi shot exposes the sensor to the image in a sequence of three or more openings of the lens aperture There are several methods of application of the multi shot technique The most common was originally to use a single image sensor with three filters passed in front of the sensor in sequence to obtain the additive color information Another multiple shot method is called microscanning This method uses a single sensor chip with a Bayer filter and physically moves the sensor on the focus plane of the lens to construct a higher resolution image than the native resolution of the chip A third version combines these two methods without a Bayer filter on the chip br The third method is called scanning because the sensor moves across the focal plane much like the sensor of an image scanner The linear or tri linear sensors in scanning cameras utilize only a single line of photosensors or three lines for the three colors Scanning may be accomplished by moving the sensor for example when using color co site sampling or by rotating the whole camera A digital rotating line camera offers images consisting of a total resolution that is very high br The choice of method for a given capture is determined largely by the subject matter It is usually inappropriate to attempt to capture a subject that moves with anything but a single shot system However the higher color fidelity and larger file sizes and resolutions that are available with multi shot and scanning backs make them more attractive for commercial photographers who are working with stationary subjects and large format photographs br Improvements in single shot cameras and image file processing at the beginning of the st century made single shot cameras almost completely dominant even in high end commercial photography br br br Filter mosaics interpolation and aliasing br br Most current consumer digital cameras use a Bayer filter mosaic in combination with an optical anti aliasing filter to reduce the aliasing due to the reduced sampling of the different primary color images br A demosaicing algorithm is used to interpolate color information to create a full array of RGB image data br Cameras that use a beam splitter single shot CCD approach three filter multi shot approach color co site sampling or Foveon X sensor do not use anti aliasing filters nor demosaicing br br Firmware in the camera or a software in a raw converter program such as Adobe Camera Raw interprets the raw data from the sensor to obtain a full color image because the RGB color model requires three intensity values for each pixel one each for the red green and blue other color models when used also require three or more values per pixel br A single sensor element cannot simultaneously record these three intensities so a color filter array CFA must be used to selectively filter a particular color for each pixel br The Bayer filter pattern is a repeating x mosaic pattern of light filters with green ones at opposite corners and red and blue in the other two positions The high proportion of green takes advantage of the properties of the human visual system which determines brightness mostly from green and is far more sensitive to brightness than to hue or saturation Sometimes a color filter pattern is used often involving two different hues of green This provides potentially more accurate color but requires a slightly more complicated interpolation process br The color intensity values not captured for each pixel can be interpolated from the values of adjacent pixels which represent the color being calculated br br br Sensor size and angle of view br br Cameras with digital image sensors that are smaller than the typical mm film size have a smaller field or angle of view when used with a lens of the same focal length This is because the angle of view is a function of both focal length and the sensor or film size used br br The crop factor is relative to the mm film format If a smaller sensor is used as in most digicams the field of view is cropped by the sensor to smaller than the mm full frame format s field of view This narrowing of the field of view may be described as crop factor a factor by which a longer focal length lens would be needed to get the same field of view on a mm film camera Full frame digital SLRs utilize a sensor of the same size as a frame of mm film br Common values for field of view crop in DSLRs using active pixel sensors include x for some Canon APS H sensors x for Sony APS C sensors used by Nikon Pentax and Konica Minolta and for Fujifilm sensors APS C for most Canon sensors x for Sigma s Foveon sensors and x for Kodak and Panasonic inch sensors currently used by Olympus and Panasonic Crop factors for non SLR consumer compact and bridge cameras are larger frequently x or more br br br Sensor resolution br The resolution of a digital camera is often limited by the image sensor that turns light into discrete signals The brighter the image at a given point on the sensor the larger the value that is read for that pixel Depending on the physical structure of the sensor a color filter array may be used which requires demosaicing to recreate a full color image The number of pixels in the sensor determines the camera s pixel count In a typical sensor the pixel count is the product of the number of rows and the number of columns Pixels are square and is often equal to for example a by pixel sensor would have pixels or megapixel On full frame sensors i e mm mm some cameras propose images with million pixels that were captured by m photosites or a surface that is times larger br br br Types of digital cameras br Digital cameras come in a wide range of sizes prices and capabilities In addition to general purpose digital cameras specialized cameras including multispectral imaging equipment and astrographs are used for scientific military medical and other special purposes br br br Compacts br br Compact cameras are intended to be portable pocketable and are particularly suitable for casual snapshots Point and shoot cameras usually fall under this category br Many incorporate a retractable lens assembly that provides optical zoom In most models an auto actuating lens cover protects the lens from elements Most ruggedized or water resistant models do not retract and most with superzoom capability do not retract fully br Compact cameras are usually designed to be easy to use Almost all include an automatic mode or auto mode which automatically makes all camera settings for the user Some also have manual controls Compact digital cameras typically contain a small sensor that trades off picture quality for compactness and simplicity images can usually only be stored using lossy compression JPEG Most have a built in flash usually of low power sufficient for nearby subjects A few high end compact digital cameras have a hotshoe for connecting to an external flash Live preview is almost always used to frame the photo on an integrated LCD In addition to being able to take still photographs almost all compact cameras have the ability to record video br Compacts often have macro capability and zoom lenses but the zoom range up to x is generally enough for candid photography but less than is available on bridge cameras more than x or the interchangeable lenses of DSLR cameras available at a much higher cost Autofocus systems in compact digital cameras generally are based on a contrast detection methodology using the image data from the live preview feed of the main imager Some compact digital cameras use a hybrid autofocus system similar to what is commonly available on DSLRs br Typically compact digital cameras incorporate a nearly silent leaf shutter into the lens but play a simulated camera sound for skeuomorphic purposes br For low cost and small size these cameras typically use image sensor formats with a diagonal between and mm corresponding to a crop factor between and This gives them weaker low light performance greater depth of field generally closer focusing ability and smaller components than cameras using larger sensors Some cameras use a larger sensor including at the high end a pricey full frame sensor compact camera such as Sony Cyber shot DSC RX but have capability near that of a DSLR br A variety of additional features are available depending on the model of the camera Such features include GPS compass barometers and altimeters br Starting in some compact digital cameras can take D still photos These D compact stereo cameras can capture D panoramic photos with dual lens or even a single lens for playback on a D TV br In Sony released two add on camera models without display to be used with a smartphone or tablet controlled by a mobile application via WiFi br br br Rugged compacts br Rugged compact cameras typically include protection against submersion hot and cold conditions shock and pressure Terms used to describe such properties include waterproof freeze proof heatproof shockproof and crushproof respectively Nearly all major camera manufacturers have at least one product in this category Some are waterproof to a considerable depth up to feet m others only feet m but only a few will float Ruggeds often lack some of the features of ordinary compact camera but they have video capability and the majority can record sound Most have image stabilization and built in flash Touchscreen LCD and GPS do not work underwater br br br Action cameras br br GoPro and other brands offer action cameras that are rugged small and can be easily attached to helmets arms bicycles etc Most have a wide angle and fixed focus and can take still pictures and video typically with sound br br br degree cameras br br The degree camera can take picture or video degrees using two lenses back to back and shooting at the same time Some of the cameras are Ricoh Theta S Nikon Keymission and Samsung Gear Nico was launched in and claimed as the world s smallest degree camera with size x x mm x x in and price less than With virtual reality mode built in stitching Wifi and Bluetooth live streaming can be done Due to it also being water resistant the Nico can be used as action camera br There are tend that action cameras have capabilities to shoot degrees with at least K resolution br br br Bridge cameras br br Bridge cameras physically resemble DSLRs and are sometimes called DSLR shape or DSLR like They provide some similar features but like compacts they use a fixed lens and a small sensor Some compact cameras have also PSAM mode Most use live preview to frame the image Their usual autofocus is by the same contrast detect mechanism as compacts but many bridge cameras have a manual focus mode and some have a separate focus ring for greater control br The big physical size and small sensor allow superzoom and wide aperture Bridge cameras generally include an image stabilization system to enable longer handheld exposures sometimes better than DSLR for low light conditions br As of bridge cameras come in two principal classes in terms of sensor size firstly the more traditional sensor as measured by image sensor format which gives more flexibility in lens design and allows for handholdable zoom from to mm mm equivalent wide angle all the way up to over mm supertele and secondly a sensor that allows better image quality particularly in low light higher ISO but puts greater constraints on lens design resulting in zoom lenses that stop at mm constant aperture e g Sony RX or mm variable aperture e g Panasonic Lumix FZ equivalent corresponding to an optical zoom factor of roughly to br Some bridge cameras have a lens thread to attach accessories such as wide angle or telephoto converters as well as filters such as UV or Circular Polarizing filter and lens hoods The scene is composed by viewing the display or the electronic viewfinder EVF Most have a slightly longer shutter lag than a DSLR Many of these cameras can store images in a raw format in addition to supporting JPEG The majority have a built in flash but only a few have a hotshoe br In bright sun the quality difference between a good compact camera and a digital SLR is minimal but bridge cameras are more portable cost less and have a greater zoom ability Thus a bridge camera may better suit outdoor daytime activities except when seeking professional quality photos br br br Mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras br br In late a new type of camera emerged called a mirrorless interchangeable lens camera It is technically a DSLR camera that does not require a reflex mirror a key component of the former While a typical DSLR has a mirror that reflects light from the lens up to the optical viewfinder in a mirrorless camera there is no optical viewfinder The image sensor is exposed to light at all times giving the user a digital preview of the image either on the built in rear LCD screen or an electronic viewfinder EVF br These are simpler and more compact than DSLRs due to not having a lens reflex system MILCs or mirrorless cameras for short come with various sensor sizes depending on the brand and manufacturer these include a small inch sensor as is commonly used in bridge cameras such as the original Pentax Q more recent Pentax Q versions have a slightly larger inch sensor a inch sensor a Micro Four Thirds sensor an APS C sensor found in Sony NEX series and DSLR likes Fujifilm X series Pentax K and Canon EOS M and some such as the Sony use a full frame mm sensor with the Hasselblad X D being the first medium format mirrorless camera Some MILCs have a separate electronic viewfinder to compensate the lack of an optical one In other cameras the back display is used as the primary viewfinder in the same way as in compact cameras One disadvantage of mirrorless cameras compared to a typical DSLR is its battery life due to the energy consumption of the electronic viewfinder but this can be mitigated by a setting inside the camera in some models Many mirrorless cameras have a hotshoe br Olympus and Panasonic released many Micro Four Thirds cameras with interchangeable lenses that are fully compatible with each other without any adapter while others have proprietary mounts In Kodak released its first Micro Four Third system camera br As of March mirrorless cameras are fast becoming appealing to both amateurs and professionals alike due to their simplicity compatibility with some DSLR lenses and features that match most DSLRs today br br br Modular cameras br br While most digital cameras with interchangeable lenses feature a lens mount of some kind there are also a number of modular cameras where the shutter and sensor are incorporated into the lens module br The first such modular camera was the Minolta Dim ge V in followed by the Minolta Dim ge EX in and the Minolta MetaFlash D in In Ricoh released the Ricoh GXR modular camera br At CES Sakar International announced the Polaroid iM an MP camera with sensor with interchangeable sensor lens An adapter for Micro Four Thirds Nikon and K mount lenses was planned to ship with the camera br There are also a number of add on camera modules for smartphones they are called lens style cameras lens camera or smart lens They contain all the essential components of a digital camera inside a DSLR lens shaped module hence the name but lack any sort of viewfinder and most controls of a regular camera Instead they are connected wirelessly and or mounted to a smartphone to be used as its display output and operate the camera s various controls br Lens style cameras include br br Sony Cyber shot QX series Smart Lens or SmartShot cameras announced and released in mid with the Cyber shot DSC QX In January a firmware update was announced for the DSC QX and DSC QX In September Sony announced the Cyber shot DSC QX as well as the Alpha ILCE QX the former an ultrazoom with a built in x optical zoom lens the latter opting for an interchangeable Sony E mount instead of a built in lens br Kodak PixPro smart lens camera series announced in These include the X optical zoom SL X optical zoom SL and the X optical zoom SL all featuring MP sensors and p video recording except for the SL which caps at p br ViviCam IU smart lens camera from Sakar owned brand Vivitar announced in br Olympus Air A lens camera announced in and released in the lens camera is an open platform with an Android operating system and can detach into parts sensor module and lens just like the Sony QX and all compatible Micro Four Thirds lenses can then be attached to the built in lens mount of the camera s sensor module br br br Digital single lens reflex cameras DSLR br br Digital single lens reflex cameras DSLR is a camera with a digital sensor that utilizes a reflex mirror to split or direct light into the viewfinder to produce an image The reflex mirror finds the image by blocking light to the camera s sensor and then reflecting it into the camera s pentaprism which allows it to be seen through the viewfinder When the shutter release is fully pressed the reflex mirror pulls out horizontally below the pentaprism briefly darkening the viewfinder and then opening up the sensor for exposure which creates the photo The digital image is produced by the sensor which is an array of photoreceptors on a microchip capable of recording light values Many modern DSLRs offer the ability for live view or the framing of the subject emitted from the sensor onto a digital screen and many have a hotshoe br The sensor also known as a full frame sensor is much larger than the other types typically mm to mm on the diagonal crop factor or The larger sensor permits more light to be received by each pixel this combined with the relatively large lenses provides superior low light performance For the same field of view and the same aperture a larger sensor gives shallower focus DSLRs can equip interchangeable lenses for versatility by removing it from the lens mount of the camera typically a silver ring on the front side of DSLRs These lenses work in tandem with the mechanics of the DSLR to adjust aperture and focus Autofocus is accomplished using sensors in the mirror box and on most modern lenses can be activated from the lens itself which will trigger upon shutter release br br br Digital Still Cameras DSC br br Digital Still Camera DSC such as the Sony DSC cameras is a type of camera that does not use a reflex mirror DSCs are like point and shoot cameras and are the most common type of cameras due to their comfortable price and its quality br Here are a list of DSCs List of Sony Cyber shot cameras br br br Fixed mirror DSLT cameras br br Cameras with fixed semi transparent mirrors also known as DSLT cameras such as the Sony SLT cameras are single lens without a moving reflex mirror as in a conventional DSLR A semi transparent mirror transmits some of the light to the image sensor and reflects some of the light along the path to a pentaprism pentamirror which then goes to an optical view finder OVF as is done with a reflex mirror in DSLR cameras The total amount of light is not changed just some of the light travels one path and some of it travels the other The consequences are that DSLT cameras should shoot a half stop differently from DSLR One advantage of using a DSLT camera is the blind moments a DSLR user experiences while the reflecting mirror is moved to send the light to the sensor instead of the viewfinder do not exist for DSLT cameras Because there is no time at which light is not traveling along both paths DSLT cameras get the benefit of continuous auto focus tracking This is especially beneficial for burst mode shooting in low light conditions and also for tracking when taking video br br br Digital rangefinders br br A rangefinder is a device to measure subject distance with the intent to adjust the focus of a camera s objective lens accordingly open loop controller The rangefinder and lens focusing mechanism may or may not be coupled In common parlance the term rangefinder camera is interpreted very narrowly to denote manual focus cameras with a visually read out optical rangefinder based on parallax Most digital cameras achieve focus through analysis of the image captured by the objective lens and distance estimation if it is provided at all is only a byproduct of the focusing process closed loop controller br br br Line scan camera systems br br A line scan camera traditionally has a single row of pixel sensors instead of a matrix of them The lines are continuously fed to a computer that joins them to each other and makes an image This is most commonly done by connecting the camera output to a frame grabber which resides in a PCI slot of an industrial computer The frame grabber acts to buffer the image and sometimes provide some processing before delivering to the computer software for processing Industrial processes often require height and width measurements performed by digital line scan systems br Multiple rows of sensors may be used to make colored images or to increase sensitivity by TDI time delay and integration br Many industrial applications require a wide field of view Traditionally maintaining consistent light over large D areas is quite difficult With a line scan camera all that is necessary is to provide even illumination across the line currently being viewed by the camera This makes sharp pictures of objects that pass the camera at high speed br Such cameras are also commonly used to make photo finishes to determine the winner when multiple competitors cross the finishing line at nearly the same time They can also be used as industrial instruments for analyzing fast processes br Line scan cameras are also extensively used in imaging from satellites see push broom scanner In this case the row of sensors is perpendicular to the direction of satellite motion Line scan cameras are widely used in scanners In this case the camera moves horizontally br br br Superzoom cameras br br Digital superzoom cameras are digital cameras that can zoom in very far These superzoom cameras are suitable for people who have nearsightedness br The HX series is a series containing Sony s superzoom cameras like HX V HX V and the newest HX HX stands for HyperXoom br br br Light field camera br This type of digital camera captures information about the light field emanating from a scene that is the intensity of light in a scene and also the direction that the light rays are traveling in space This contrasts with a conventional digital camera which records only light intensity br br br Event camera br Instead of measuring the intensity of light over some predetermined time interval the exposure time event cameras detect when the intensity of light changes by some threshold for each pixel independently usually with microsecond precision br br br Integration into other devices br Many devices have a built in digital camera including for example smartphones mobile phones PDAs and laptop computers Built in cameras generally store the images in the JPEG file format br Mobile phones incorporating digital cameras were introduced in Japan in by J Phone In camera phones outsold stand alone digital cameras and in they outsold film and digital stand alone cameras Five billion camera phones were sold in five years and by more than half of the installed base of all mobile phones were camera phones Sales of separate cameras peaked in br br br Notable digital camera manufacturers br br There are many manufacturers that lead in the production of digital cameras commonly DSLRs Each brand embodies different mission statements that differ them from each other outside of the physical technology that they produce While the majority of manufacturers share modern features amongst their production of cameras some specialize in specific details either physically on camera or within the system and image quality br br br Market trends br br Sales of traditional digital cameras have declined due to the increasing use of smartphones for casual photography which also enable easier manipulation and sharing of photos through the use of apps and web based services Bridge cameras in contrast have held their ground with functionality that most smartphone cameras lack such as optical zoom and other advanced features DSLRs have also lost ground to Mirrorless interchangeable lens camera MILC s offering the same sensor size in a smaller camera A few expensive ones use a full frame sensor just like DSLR professional cameras br In response to the convenience and flexibility of smartphone cameras some manufacturers produced smart digital cameras that combine features of traditional cameras with those of a smartphone In Nikon and Samsung released the Coolpix S c and Galaxy Camera the first two digital cameras to run the Android operating system Since this software platform is used in many smartphones they can integrate with some of the same services such as e mail attachments social networks and photo sharing sites that smartphones do and use other Android compatible software br In an inversion some phone makers have introduced smartphones with cameras designed to resemble traditional digital cameras Nokia released the PureView and Lumia in and the two devices respectively run the Symbian and Windows Phone operating systems and both include a megapixel camera along with a camera grip attachment for the latter Similarly Samsung introduced the Galaxy S Zoom having a megapixel camera and x optical zoom combining traits from the Galaxy S Mini with the Galaxy Camera Panasonic Lumix DMC CM is an Android KitKat smartphone with MP sensor the largest sensor for a smartphone ever with Leica fixed lens equivalent of mm at F can take RAW image and K video has mm thickness Furthermore in Huawei P Pro is an android Oreo has triple Leica lenses in the back of the smartphone with MP RGB sensor as first lens MP monochrome sensor as second lens and MP RGB sensor with x optical zoom as third lens Combination of first lens and second lens will produce bokeh image with larger high dynamic range whereas combination of mega pixel first lens and optical zoom will produce maximum x digital zoom without loss of quality by reducing the image size to MP br Light field cameras were introduced in with one consumer product and several professional ones br After a big dip of sales in consumer digital camera sales declined again in by percent In compact digital cameras sold million per month In sales fell to about million per month DSLR and MILC sales also declined in by after almost ten years of double digit growth br Worldwide unit sales of digital cameras is continuously declining from million in to million in and tends to decrease more in the following years br Film camera sales hit their peak at about million units in while digital camera sales began in By the film camera market had died and digital camera sales hit their peak at million units in In cell phones with an integrated camera had been introduced and in the cell phone with an integrated camera had sold million units per year By cell phones with an integrated camera were selling hundreds of millions per year which were causing a decline in digital cameras In digital camera sales were million units or only less than a third of digital camera sales numbers at their peak and also slightly less than film camera sold number at their peak br br br Connectivity br br br Transferring photos br Many digital cameras can connect directly to a computer to transfer data br br Early cameras used the PC serial port USB is now the most widely used method most cameras are viewable as USB mass storage though some have a FireWire port Some cameras use USB PTP mode for connection instead of USB MSC some offer both modes br br Other cameras use wireless connections via Bluetooth or IEEE Wi Fi such as the Kodak EasyShare One Wi Fi integrated Memory cards SDHC SDXC can transmit stored images video and other files to computers or smartphones Mobile operating systems such as Android allow automatic upload and backup or sharing of images over Wi Fi to photo sharing and cloud services br br Cameras with integrated Wi Fi or specific Wi Fi adapters mostly allow camera control especially shutter release exposure control and more tethering from computer or smartphone apps additionally to the transfer of media data br Cameraphones and some high end stand alone digital cameras also use cellular networks to connect for sharing images The most common standard on cellular networks is the MMS Multimedia Messaging Service commonly called picture messaging The second method with smartphones is to send a picture as an email attachment Many old cameraphones however do not support email br A common alternative is the use of a card reader which may be capable of reading several types of storage media as well as high speed transfer of data to the computer Use of a card reader also avoids draining the camera battery during the download process An external card reader allows convenient direct access to the images on a collection of storage media But if only one storage card is in use moving it back and forth between the camera and the reader can be inconvenient Many computers have a card reader built in at least for SD cards br br br Printing photos br Many modern cameras support the PictBridge standard which allows them to send data directly to a PictBridge capable printer without the need for a computer PictBridge uses PTP to transfer images and control information br Wireless connectivity can also provide for printing photos without a cable connection br br An instant print camera is a digital camera with a built in printer This confers a similar functionality as an instant camera which uses instant film to quickly generate a physical photograph Such non digital cameras were popularized by Polaroid with the SX in br br br Displaying photos br Many digital cameras include a video output port Usually sVideo it sends a standard definition video signal to a television allowing the user to show one picture at a time Buttons or menus on the camera allow the user to select the photo advance from one to another or automatically send a slide show to the TV br HDMI has been adopted by many high end digital camera makers to show photos in their high resolution quality on an HDTV br In January Silicon Image announced a new technology for sending video from mobile devices to a television in digital form MHL sends pictures as a video stream up to p resolution and is compatible with HDMI br Some DVD recorders and television sets can read memory cards used in cameras alternatively several types of flash card readers have TV output capability br br br Weather sealing and waterproofing br Cameras can be equipped with a varying amount of environmental sealing to provide protection against splashing water moisture humidity and fog dust and sand or complete waterproofness to a certain depth and for a certain duration The latter is one of the approaches to allow underwater photography the other approach being the use of waterproof housings Many waterproof digital cameras are also shockproof and resistant to low temperatures br Some waterproof cameras can be fitted with a waterproof housing to increase the operational depth range The Olympus Tough range of compact cameras is an example br br br Modes br Many digital cameras have preset modes for different applications Within the constraints of correct exposure various parameters can be changed including exposure aperture focusing light metering white balance and equivalent sensitivity For example a portrait might use a wider aperture to render the background out of focus and would seek out and focus on a human face rather than other image content br Few cameras are equipped with a voice note audio only recording feature br br br Scene modes br Vendors implement a variety scene modes in cameras firmwares for various purposes such as a landscape mode which prevents focusing on rainy and or stained window glass such as a windshield and a sports mode which reduces motion blur of moving subjects by reducing exposure time with the help of increased light sensitivity Firmwares may be equipped with the ability to select a suitable scene mode automatically through artificial intelligence br br br Image data storage br br Many camera phones and most stand alone digital cameras store image data in flash memory cards or other removable media Most stand alone cameras use SD format while a few use CompactFlash CFexpress or other types In January a faster XQD card format was announced In early some high end cameras have two hot swappable memory slots Photographers can swap one of the memory card with camera on Each memory slot can accept either Compact Flash or SD Card All new Sony cameras also have two memory slots one for its Memory Stick and one for SD Card but not hot swapable br The approximate count of remaining photos until space exhaustion is calculated by the firmware throughout use and indicated in the viewfinder to prepare the user for an impending necessary hot swap of the memory card and or file offload br A few cameras used other removable storage such as Microdrives very small hard disk drives CD single MB and floppy disks e g Sony Mavica Other unusual formats include br br Onboard internal flash memory Cheap cameras and cameras secondary to

their cameras to work with Linux or other free software Still many cameras use the standard USB mass storage and or Media Transfer Protocol and are thus widely supported Other cameras are supported by the gPhoto project and many computers are equipped with a memory card reader br br br File formats br br The Joint Photography Experts Group standard JPEG is the most common file format for storing image data Other file types include Tagged Image File Format TIFF and various Raw image formats br Many cameras especially high end ones support a raw image format A raw image is the unprocessed set of pixel data directly from the camera s sensor often saved in a proprietary format Adobe Systems has released the DNG format a royalty free raw image format used by at least camera manufacturers br Raw files initially had to be processed in specialized image editing programs but over time many mainstream editing programs such as Google s Picasa have added support for raw images Rendering to standard images from raw sensor data allows more flexibility in making major adjustments without losing image quality or retaking the picture br Formats for movies are AVI DV MPEG MOV often containing motion JPEG WMV and ASF basically the same as WMV Recent formats include MP which is based on the QuickTime format and uses newer compression algorithms to allow longer recording times in the same space br Other formats that are used in cameras but not for pictures are the Design Rule for Camera Format DCF an ISO specification used in almost all camera since which defines an internal file structure and naming Also used is the Digital Print Order Format DPOF which dictates what order images are to be printed in and how many copies The DCF defines a logical file system with filenames and makes the usage of either FAT FAT FAT or exFAT mandatory for its physical layer in order to maximize platform interoperability br Most cameras include Exif data that provides metadata about the picture Exif data may include aperture exposure time focal length date and time taken Some are able to tag the location br br br Directory and file structure br br In order to guarantee interoperability DCF specifies the file system for image and sound files to be used on formatted DCF media like removable or non removable memory as FAT FAT FAT or exFAT Media with a capacity of more than GB must be formatted using FAT or exFAT br The filesystem in a digital camera contains a DCIM Digital Camera IMages directory which can contain multiple subdirectories with names such as ABCDE that consist of a unique directory number in the range and five alphanumeric characters which may be freely chosen and often refer to a camera maker These directories contain files with names such as ABCD JPG that consist of four alphanumeric characters often DSC DSCF IMG MOV or P followed by a number Handling of directories with possibly user created duplicate numbers may vary among camera firmwares br DCF adds support for DCF optional files recorded in an optional color space that is Adobe RGB rather than sRGB Such files must be indicated by a leading as in DSC instead of or DSC br br br Thumbnail files br To enable loading many images in miniature view quickly and efficiently and to retain meta data some vendors firmwares generate accompanying low resolution thumbnail files for videos and raw photos For example those of Canon cameras end with THM JPEG can already store a thumbnail image standalone br br br Batteries br br Digital cameras have become smaller over time resulting in an ongoing need to develop a battery small enough to fit in the camera and yet able to power it for a reasonable length of time br Digital cameras utilize either proprietary or standard consumer batteries As of March most cameras use proprietary lithium ion batteries while some use standard AA batteries or primarily use a proprietary Lithium ion rechargeable battery pack but have an optional AA battery holder available br br br Proprietary br The most common class of battery used in digital cameras is proprietary battery formats These are built to a manufacturer s custom specifications Almost all proprietary batteries are lithium ion In addition to being available from the OEM aftermarket replacement batteries are commonly available for most camera models br br br Standard consumer batteries br br Digital cameras that utilize off the shelf batteries are typically designed to be able to use both single use disposable and rechargeable batteries but not with both types in use at the same time The most common off the shelf battery size used is AA CR CR V batteries and AAA batteries are also used in some cameras The CR and CR V batteries are lithium based intended for a single use Rechargeable RCR V lithium ion batteries are also available as an alternative to non rechargeable CR V batteries br Some battery grips for DSLRs come with a separate holder to accommodate AA cells as an external power source br br br Conversion of film cameras to digital br br When digital cameras became common many photographers asked whether their film cameras could be converted to digital The answer was not immediately clear as it differed among models For the majority of mm film cameras the answer is no the reworking and cost would be too great especially as lenses have been evolving as well as cameras For most a conversion to digital to give enough space for the electronics and allow a liquid crystal display to preview would require removing the back of the camera and replacing it with a custom built digital unit br Many early professional SLR cameras such as the Kodak DCS series were developed from mm film cameras The technology of the time however meant that rather than being digital backs the bodies of these cameras were mounted on large bulky digital units often bigger than the camera portion itself These were factory built cameras however not aftermarket conversions br A notable exception is the Nikon E and Nikon E using additional optics to convert the mm format to a CCD sensor br A few mm cameras have had digital camera backs made by their manufacturer Leica being a notable example Medium format and large format cameras those using film stock greater than mm have a low unit production and typical digital backs for them cost over These cameras also tend to be highly modular with handgrips film backs winders and lenses available separately to fit various needs br The very large sensor these backs use leads to enormous image sizes For example Phase One s P MP image back creates a single TIFF image of size up to MB and even greater pixel counts are available Medium format digitals such as this are geared more towards studio and portrait photography than their smaller DSLR counterparts the ISO speed in particular tends to have a maximum of versus for some DSLR cameras Canon EOS D Mark IV and Nikon D S have ISO plus Hi ISO with the Canon EOS Dx s ISO of br br br Digital camera backs br br In the industrial and high end professional photography market some camera systems use modular removable image sensors For example some medium format SLR cameras such as the Mamiya D series allow installation of either a digital camera back or a traditional photographic film back br br Area array br CCD br CMOS br Linear array br CCD monochrome br strip CCD with color filters br Linear array cameras are also called scan backs br br Single shot br Multi shot three shot usually br Most earlier digital camera backs used linear array sensors moving vertically to digitize the image Many of them only capture grayscale images The relatively long exposure times in the range of seconds or even minutes generally limit scan backs to studio applications where all aspects of the photographic scene are under the photographer s control br Some other camera backs use CCD arrays similar to typical cameras These are called single shot backs br Since it is much easier to manufacture a high quality linear CCD array with only thousands of pixels than a CCD matrix with millions very high resolution linear CCD camera backs were available much earlier than their CCD matrix counterparts For example you could buy an albeit expensive camera back with over pixel horizontal resolution in the mid s However as of it is still difficult to buy a comparable CCD matrix camera of the same resolution Rotating line cameras with about color pixels in its sensor line are able as of to capture about lines during one full degree rotation thereby creating a single digital image of Megapixels br Most modern digital camera backs use CCD or CMOS matrix sensors The matrix sensor captures the entire image frame at once instead of incrementing scanning the frame area through the prolonged exposure For example Phase One produces a million pixel digital camera back with a x mm CCD in This CCD array is a little smaller than a frame of film and much larger than a mm frame x mm In comparison consumer digital cameras use arrays ranging from x mm full frame on high end consumer DSLRs to x mm on camera phones CMOS sensor br br
