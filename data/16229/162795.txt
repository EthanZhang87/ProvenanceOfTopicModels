Louis Charles Joseph Bl riot BLERR ee oh also US BLAY ree oh OH blair YOH French lwi ble jo July August was a French aviator inventor and engineer He developed the first practical headlamp for cars and established a profitable business manufacturing them using much of the money he made to finance his attempts to build a successful aircraft Bl riot was the first to use the combination of hand operated joystick and foot operated rudder control as used to the present day to operate the aircraft control surfaces Bl riot was also the first to make a working powered piloted monoplane In he became world famous for making the first airplane flight across the English Channel winning the prize of offered by the Daily Mail newspaper He was the founder of Bl riot A ronautique a successful aircraft manufacturing company br br br Early years br Born at No h rue de l Arbre Poires now rue Sadi Carnot in Cambrai Louis was the first of five children born to Cl mence and Charles Bl riot In aged Bl riot was sent as a boarder to the Institut Notre Dame in Cambrai where he frequently won class prizes including one for engineering drawing When he was he moved on to the lyc e at Amiens where he lived with an aunt After passing the exams for his baccalaureate in science and German he determined to try to enter the prestigious cole Centrale in Paris Entrance was by a demanding exam for which special tuition was necessary consequently Bl riot spent a year at the Coll ge Sainte Barbe in Paris He passed the exam placing th among the successful candidates and doing especially well in the tests of engineering drawing ability After three years of demanding study at the cole Centrale Bl riot graduated th of in his graduating class He then embarked on a term of compulsory military service and spent a year as a sub lieutenant in the th Artillery Regiment stationed in Tarbes in the Pyrenees br br He later got a job with Bagu s an electrical engineering company in Paris He left the company after developing the world s first practical headlamp for automobiles using a compact integral acetylene generator In Bl riot opened a showroom for headlamps at rue de Richlieu in Paris The business was successful and soon he was supplying his lamps to both Renault and Panhard Levassor two of the foremost automobile manufacturers of the day br In October Bl riot was lunching in his usual restaurant near his showroom when his eye was caught by a young woman dining with her parents That evening he told his mother I saw a young woman today I will marry her or I will marry no one A bribe to a waiter secured her identity she was Alice V d res the daughter of a retired army officer Bl riot set about courting her with the same determination that he later brought to his aviation experiments and on February the couple were married br br br Early aviation experiments br br Bl riot had become interested in aviation while at the Ecole Centrale but his serious experimentation was probably sparked by seeing Cl ment Ader s Avion III at the Exposition Universelle By then his headlamp business was doing well enough for Bl riot to be able to devote both time and money to experimentation His first experiments were with a series of ornithopters which were unsuccessful In April Bl riot met Gabriel Voisin who was then employed by Ernest Archdeacon to assist with his experimental gliders br Bl riot was a spectator at Voisin s first trials of the floatplane glider he had built on June Cine photography was among Bl riot s hobbies and the film footage of this flight was shot by him The success of these trials prompted him to commission a similar machine from Voisin the Bl riot II glider On July an attempt to fly this aircraft was made ending in a crash in which Voisin nearly drowned but this did not deter Bl riot Indeed he suggested that Voisin should stop working for Archdeacon and enter into partnership with him Voisin accepted the proposal and together with his brother Charles Voisin and Edouard Surcouf they established the Ateliers d Aviation Edouard Surcouf Bl riot et Voisin possibly the world s first aircraft manufacturing company Active between and the company built two unsuccessful powered aircraft the Bl riot III and the Bl riot IV which was largely a rebuild of its predecessor Both these aircraft were powered with the lightweight Antoinette engines being developed by L on Levavasseur Bl riot became a shareholder in the company and in May joined the board of directors br br The Bl riot IV was damaged in a taxiing accident at Bagatelle on November The disappointment of the failure of his aircraft was compounded by the success of Alberto Santos Dumont later that day when he managed to fly his bis a distance of m ft winning the A ro Club de France prize for the first flight of over metres This also took place at Bagatelle and was witnessed by Bl riot The partnership with Voisin was dissolved and Bl riot established his own business Recherches A ronautiques Louis Bl riot where he started creating his own aircraft experimenting with various configurations and eventually creating the world s first successful powered monoplane br The first of these the canard configuration Bl riot V was first tried on March when Bl riot limited his experiments to ground runs which resulted in damage to the undercarriage Two further ground trials also damaging the aircraft were undertaken followed by another attempt on April The flight was only of around m ft after which he cut his engine and landed slightly damaging the undercarriage More trials followed the last on April when travelling at a speed of around km h mph the aircraft left the ground Bl riot over responded when the nose began to rise and the machine hit the ground nose first and somersaulted The aircraft was largely destroyed but Bl riot was by great good fortune unhurt The engine of the aircraft was immediately behind his seat and he was very lucky not to have been crushed by it br This was followed by the Bl riot VI a tandem wing design first tested on July when the aircraft failed to lift off Bl riot then enlarged the wings slightly and on July a short successful flight of around metres ft was made reaching an altitude of around m ft This was Bl riot s first truly successful flight Further successful flights took place that month and by July he had managed a flight of m ft On August he managed to reach an altitude of m ft but one of the blades of the propeller worked loose resulting in a heavy landing which damaged the aircraft He then fitted a hp kW V Antoinette engine Tests on September showed a startling improvement in performance the aircraft quickly reached an altitude of m ft when the engine suddenly cut out and the aircraft went into a spiralling nosedive In desperation Bl riot climbed out of his seat and threw himself towards the tail The aircraft partially pulled out of the dive and came to earth in a more or less horizontal attitude His only injuries were some minor cuts on the face caused by fragments of glass from his broken goggles After this crash Bl riot abandoned the aircraft concentrating on his next machine br This the Bl riot VII was a monoplane with tail surfaces arranged in what has become apart from its use of differential elevators movement for lateral control the modern conventional layout This aircraft which first flew on November has been recognised as the first successful monoplane On December Bl riot managed two flights of over metres including a successful U turn This was the most impressive achievement to date of any of the French pioneer aviators causing Patrick Alexander to write to Major Baden Baden Powell president of the Royal Aeronautical Society I got back from Paris last night I think Bl riot with his new machine is leading the way Two more successful flights were made on December but the undercarriage collapsed after the second flight the aircraft overturned and was wrecked br Bl riot s next aircraft the Bl riot VIII was shown to the press in February Although it was the first to use of a successful combination of hand arm operated joystick and foot operated rudder control this was a failure in its first form After modifications it proved successful and on October he succeeded in making a cross country flight making a round trip from Toury to Arteny and back a total distance of km mi This was not the first cross country flight by a narrow margin since Henri Farman had flown from Bouy to Rheims the preceding day Four days later the aircraft was destroyed in a taxiing accident br br Three of his aircraft were displayed at the first Paris Aero Salon held at the end of December the Bl riot IX monoplane the Bl riot X a three seat pusher biplane and the Bl riot XI which went on to be his most successful model The first two of the designs which used Antoinette engines never flew possibly because at this time Bl riot severed his connection with the Antoinette company because the company had begun to design and construct aircraft as well as engines presenting Bl riot with a conflict of interests The Type XI was initially powered by a REP engine and was first flown with this engine on January but although the aircraft flew well after a very short time in the air the engine began to overheat leading Bl riot to get in touch with Alessandro Anzani who had developed a successful motorcycle engine and had subsequently entered the aero engine market Importantly Anzani was associated with Lucien Chauvi re who had designed a sophisticated laminated walnut propeller The combination of a reliable engine and an efficient propeller contributed greatly to the success of the Type XI br This was shortly followed by the Bl riot XII a high wing two seater monoplane first flown on May and for a while Bl riot concentrated on flying this machine flying it with a passenger on July and on July making the world s first flight with two passengers one of whom was Santos Dumont A few days later the crankshaft of the E N V engine broke and Bl riot resumed trials of the Type XI On June he made a flight lasting minutes and seconds his longest to date and the following day increased this personal record to over minutes At the end of July he took part in an aviation meet at Douai where he made a flight lasting over minutes in the Type XII on July the following day he flew the Type XI for minutes at another meet at Juvisy and on July he made a cross country flight of km mi from Etampes to Orl ans Bl riot s determination is shown by the fact that during the flight at Douai made on July part of the asbestos insulation worked loose from the exhaust pipe after minutes in the air After half an hour one of his shoes had been burnt through and he was in considerable pain but nevertheless continued his flight until engine failure ended the flight Bl riot suffered third degree burns and his injuries took over two months to heal br On June Bl riot and Voisin were jointly awarded the Prix Osiris awarded by the Institut de France every three years to the Frenchman who had made the greatest contribution to science Three days later on June he informed the Daily Mail of his intention to make an attempt to win the thousand pound prize offered by the paper for a successful crossing of the English Channel in a heavier than air aircraft br br br Channel crossing br br The Daily Mail prize was first announced in October with a prize of being offered for a flight made before the end of the year When passed with no serious attempt being made the offer was renewed for the year of with the prize money doubled to Like some of the other prizes offered it was widely seen as nothing more than a way to gain cheap publicity for the paper the Paris newspaper Le Matin commenting that there was no chance of the prize being won br The English Channel had been crossed many times by balloon beginning with Jean Pierre Blanchard and John Jeffries s crossing in br Bl riot who intended to fly across the Channel in his Type XI monoplane had three rivals for the prize the most serious being Hubert Latham a French national of English extraction flying an Antoinette IV monoplane He was favoured by both the United Kingdom and France to win The others were Charles de Lambert a Russian aristocrat with French ancestry and one of Wilbur Wright s pupils and Arthur Seymour an Englishman who reputedly owned a Voisin biplane De Lambert got as far as establishing a base at Wissant near Calais but Seymour did nothing beyond submitting his entry to the Daily Mail Lord Northcliffe who had befriended Wilbur Wright during his sensational public demonstrations in France had offered the prize hoping that Wilbur would win Wilbur wanted to make an attempt and cabled brother Orville in the United States Orville then recuperating from serious injuries sustained in a crash replied telling him not to make the Channel attempt until he could come to France and assist Also Wilbur had already amassed a fortune in prize money for altitude and duration flights and had secured sales contracts for the Wright Flyer with the French Italians British and Germans his tour in Europe was essentially complete by the summer of Both brothers saw the Channel reward of only a thousand pounds as insignificant considering the dangers of the flight br Latham arrived in Calais in early July and set up his base at Sangatte in the semi derelict buildings which had been constructed for a attempt to dig a tunnel under the Channel The event was the subject of great public interest it was reported that there were visitors at Calais and a similar crowd at Dover The Marconi Company set up a special radio link for the occasion with one station on Cap Blanc Nez near Sangatte and the other on the roof of the Lord Warden Hotel in Dover The crowds were in for a wait the weather was windy and Latham did not make an attempt until July but miles km from his destination his aircraft developed engine trouble and was forced to make the world s first landing of an aircraft on the sea Latham was rescued by the French destroyer Harpon and taken back to France where he was met by the news that Bl riot had entered the competition Bl riot accompanied by two mechanics and his friend Alfred Leblanc arrived in Calais on Wednesday July and set up their base at a farm near the beach at Les Baraques between Calais and Sangatte The following day a replacement aircraft for Latham was delivered from the Antoinette factory The wind was too strong for an attempted crossing on Friday and Saturday but on Saturday evening it began to drop raising hopes in both camps br Leblanc went to bed at around midnight but was too keyed up to sleep well at two o clock he was up and judging that the weather was ideal woke Bl riot who unusually was pessimistic and had to be persuaded to eat breakfast His spirits revived however and by half past three his wife Alice had boarded the destroyer Escopette which was to escort the flight br At am July watched by an excited crowd Bl riot made a short trial flight in his Type XI and then on a signal that the sun had risen the competition rules required a flight between sunrise and sunset he took off at to attempt the crossing Flying at approximately mph km h and an altitude of about ft m he set off across the Channel Not having a compass Bl riot took his course from the Escopette which was heading for Dover but he soon overtook the ship The visibility deteriorated and he later said for more than minutes I was alone isolated lost in the midst of the immense sea and I did not see anything on the horizon or a single ship The grey line of the English coast however came into sight on his left the wind had increased and had blown him to the east of his intended course Altering course he followed the line of the coast about a mile offshore until he spotted Charles Fontaine the correspondent from Le Matin waving a large Tricolour as a signal Unlike Latham Bl riot had not visited Dover to find a suitable spot to land and the choice had been made by Fontaine who had selected a patch of gently sloping land called Northfall Meadow close to Dover Castle on top of the cliffs Once over land Bl riot circled twice to lose height and cut his engine at an altitude of about m ft making a heavy pancake landing due to the gusty wind conditions the undercarriage was damaged and one blade of the propeller was shattered but Bl riot was unhurt The flight had taken minutes and seconds br News of his departure had been sent by radio to Dover but it was generally expected that he would attempt to land on the beach to the west of the town The Daily Mail correspondent realising that Bl riot had landed near the castle set off at speed in a motor car and took Bl riot to the harbour where he was reunited with his wife The couple surrounded by a cheering crowd and photographers were then taken to the Lord Warden Hotel at the foot of the Admiralty Pier Bl riot had become a celebrity br The Bl riot Memorial the outline of the aircraft laid out in granite setts in the turf funded by oil manufacturer Alexander Duckham marks his landing spot above the cliffs near Dover Castle N E br The aircraft which was used in the crossing is now preserved in the Mus e des Arts et M tiers in Paris br br br Later life br Bl riot s success brought about an immediate transformation of the status of Recherches A ronautiques Louis Bl riot By the time of the Channel flight he had spent at least francs on his aviation experiments To put this figure into context one of Bl riot s skilled mechanics was paid francs a month Now this investment began to pay off orders for copies of the Type XI quickly came and by the end of the year orders for over aircraft had been received each selling for francs br At the end of August Bl riot was one of the flyers at the Grande Semaine d Aviation held at Reims where he was narrowly beaten by Glenn Curtiss in the first Gordon Bennett Trophy Bl riot did however succeed in winning the prize for the fastest lap of the circuit establishing a new world speed record for aircraft br Bl riot followed his flights at Reims with appearances at other aviation meetings in Brescia Budapest Bucharest in making the first airplane flights in both Hungary and Romania Up to this time he had had great good luck in walking away from accidents that had destroyed the aircraft but his luck deserted him in December at an aviation meeting in Istanbul Flying in gusty conditions to placate an impatient and restive crowd he crashed on top of a house breaking several ribs and suffering internal injuries he was hospitalized for three weeks br Between and the outbreak of World War I in Bl riot produced about aircraft most of them variations of the Type XI model Bl riot monoplanes and Voisin type biplanes with the latter s Farman derivatives dominated the pre war aviation market There were concerns about the safety of monoplanes in general both in France and the UK The French government grounded all monoplanes in the French Army from February after accidents to four Bl riots but lifted it after trials in May supported Bl riot s analysis of the problem and led to a strengthening of the landing wires The brief but influential ban on the use of monoplanes by the Military Wing though not the Naval Wing in the UK was triggered by accidents to other manufacturer s aircraft Bl riots were not involved br Along with five other European aircraft builders from Bl riot was involved in a five year legal struggle with the Wright Brothers over the latter s wing warping patents The Wrights claim was dismissed in the French and the German courts br From or earlier Bl riot s aviation activities were handled by Bl riot A ronautique based at Suresnes which continued to design and produce aircraft up to the nationalisation of most of the French aircraft industry in when it was absorbed into SNCASO br In a consortium led by Bl riot bought the Soci t pour les Appareils Deperdussin aircraft manufacturer and he became the president of the company in He renamed it the Soci t Pour L Aviation et ses D riv s SPAD this company produced World War I fighter aircraft such as the SPAD S XIII br br Before World War I Bl riot had opened British flying schools at Brooklands in Surrey and at Hendon Aerodrome Realising that a British company would have more chance to sell his models to the British government in he set up the Bl riot Manufacturing Aircraft Company Ltd The hoped for orders did not follow as the Bl riot design was seen as outdated Following an unresolved conflict over control of the company it was wound up on July Even before the closure of this company Bl riot was planning a new venture in the UK Initially named Bl riot and SPAD Ltd and based in Addlestone it became the Air Navigation and Engineering Company ANEC in May ANEC survived in a difficult aviation climate until late producing Bl riot Whippet cars the Bl riot cc motorcycle as well as several light aircraft br In Bl riot long retired from flying was present to welcome Charles Lindbergh when he landed at Le Bourget field completing his transatlantic flight The two men separated in age by years had each made history by crossing significant bodies of water and shared a photo opportunity in Paris br In Bl riot visited Newark Airport in New Jersey and predicted commercial overseas flights by br br br Death br br Bl riot remained active in the aviation business until his death on August in Paris due to a heart attack After a funeral with full military honours at Les Invalides he was buried in the Cimeti re des Gonards in Versailles br br br Legacy br In Bl riot himself instituted the Bl riot Trophy a one time award which would be awarded to the first aircrew to sustain an average speed of over kilometers per hour miles per hour over one half of an hour an extremely ambitious and prophetic target in an era when the fastest aircraft were just breaking the mph mark The award was finally presented slightly more than three decades later by Alice V d res Bl riot widow of Louis Bl riot at Paris France May to the crew of the United States Air Force Convair B A jet bomber AF serial number Firefly crewed by Aircraft Commander Major Elmer E Murphy Navigator Major Eugene Moses and Defensive Systems Officer First Lieutenant David F Dickerson who on May sustained an average speed of kmph mph over minutes and seconds covering a ground track of kilometers miles This same crew and aircraft went on to set a number of other speed records before being lost in an accident shortly after takeoff from Paris not long after setting yet another speed record winning the Harmon Trophy for a record setting flight between New York City and Paris France This flight was miles in hours minutes seconds for an average of mph The Bl riot Trophy winning crew took over the aircraft for the return flight but were all killed when the pilot lost control shortly after takeoff from the Paris Air Show during some attempted impromptu aerobatics br The Bl riot Trophy is a statuette in the classical style sculpted of polished white and black marble stone depicting a nude male figure of black marble emerging from stylized white marble clouds resembling female forms It is now on permanent display at the McDermott Library of the United States Air Force Academy Colorado Springs Colorado USA br In the F d ration A ronautique Internationale established the Louis Bl riot medal in his honor The medal may be awarded up to three times a year to record setters in speed altitude and distance categories in light aircraft and is still being awarded br In Bl riot was inducted into the International Air Space Hall of Fame br On July the centenary of the original Channel crossing Frenchman Edmond Salis took off from Bl riot Beach in a replica of Bleriot s aircraft He landed successfully in Kent at the Duke of York s Royal Military School br br br In popular culture br From to KLM operated a Boeing
