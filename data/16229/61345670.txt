A sound chip is an integrated circuit chip designed to produce audio signals through digital analog or mixed mode electronics Sound chips are typically fabricated on metal oxide semiconductor MOS mixed signal chips that process audio signals analog and digital signals for both analog and digital data They normally contain audio components such as oscillators envelope controllers samplers filters amplifiers and envelope generators br br br History br A number of sound synthesis methods for electronically producing sound were devised during the late th century These include programmable sound generators PSG wavetable synthesis and frequency modulation synthesis FM synthesis Such sound chips were widely used in arcade game system boards video game consoles home computers and digital synthesizers br Since the late s pulse code modulation PCM sampling has been the standard for many sound chips as used in the Intel High Definition Audio IHDA standard of The PCM sampling method is used in many mobile phones and sound cards for personal computers This widespread use is part of the digital sound revolution that started in the s br br br Types br There are multiple types of sound chips which are divided based on their use br br Programmable sound generators br Synthesis br Wavetable synthesis br Frequency modulation synthesis br Sampling br Pulse code modulation sampling br br br List of sound chips br br Sound chips come in different forms and use a variety of techniques to generate audio signals A list of all of the different sound chips produced by a certain company or manufacturer can be found in the List of sound chips article br br br Applications br Sound chips are commonly used in various digital electronic devices particularly personal computers including sound cards and motherboards video game systems including arcade system boards and video game consoles electronic musical instruments including synthesizers digital synthesizers and electronic keyboards and digital telecommunications including digital telephony digital television mobile phones and smartphones br br br See also br Digital audio br List of sound card standards br List of sound chips br br br External links br Sound generators of the s home computers includes a list of chips pictures links to datasheets etc
