A computer mouse plural mice also mouses is a hand held pointing device that detects two dimensional motion relative to a surface This motion is typically translated into the motion of the pointer called a cursor on a display which allows a smooth control of the graphical user interface of a computer br The first public demonstration of a mouse controlling a computer system was done by Doug Engelbart in as part of the Mother of All Demos Mice originally used two separate wheels to directly track movement across a surface one in the x dimension and one in the Y Later the standard design shifted to use a ball rolling on a surface to detect motion in turn connected to internal rollers Most modern mice use optical movement detection with no moving parts Though originally all mice were connected to a computer by a cable many modern mice are cordless relying on short range radio communication with the connected system br In addition to moving a cursor computer mice have one or more buttons to allow operations such as the selection of a menu item on a display Mice often also feature other elements such as touch surfaces and scroll wheels which enable additional control and dimensional input br br br Etymology br br The earliest known written use of the term mouse or mice in reference to a computer pointing device is in Bill English s July publication Computer Aided Display Control This likely originated from its resemblance to the shape and size of a mouse with the cord resembling its tail The popularity of wireless mice without cords makes the resemblance less obvious br According to Roger Bates a hardware designer under English the term also came about because the cursor on the screen was for an unknown reason referred to as CAT and was seen by the team as if it would be chasing the new desktop device br The plural for the small rodent is always mice in modern usage The plural for a computer mouse is either mice or mouses according to most dictionaries with mice being more common The first recorded plural usage is mice the online Oxford Dictionaries cites a use and earlier uses include J C R Licklider s The Computer as a Communication Device of br br br History br br br Stationary trackballs br The trackball a related pointing device was invented in by Ralph Benjamin as part of a post World War II era fire control radar plotting system called the Comprehensive Display System CDS Benjamin was then working for the British Royal Navy Scientific Service Benjamin s project used analog computers to calculate the future position of target aircraft based on several initial input points provided by a user with a joystick Benjamin felt that a more elegant input device was needed and invented what they called a roller ball for this purpose br The device was patented in but only a prototype using a metal ball rolling on two rubber coated wheels was ever built and the device was kept as a military secret br Another early trackball was built by Kenyon Taylor a British electrical engineer working in collaboration with Tom Cranston and Fred Longstaff Taylor was part of the original Ferranti Canada working on the Royal Canadian Navy s DATAR Digital Automated Tracking and Resolving system in br DATAR was similar in concept to Benjamin s display The trackball used four disks to pick up motion two each for the X and Y directions Several rollers provided mechanical support When the ball was rolled the pickup discs spun and contacts on their outer rim made periodic contact with wires producing pulses of output with each movement of the ball By counting the pulses the physical movement of the ball could be determined A digital computer calculated the tracks and sent the resulting data to other ships in a task force using pulse code modulation radio signals This trackball used a standard Canadian five pin bowling ball It was not patented since it was a secret military project br br br Engelbart s first mouse br br Douglas Engelbart of the Stanford Research Institute now SRI International has been credited in published books by Thierry Bardini Paul Ceruzzi Howard Rheingold and several others as the inventor of the computer mouse Engelbart was also recognized as such in various obituary titles after his death in July br By Engelbart had already established a research lab at SRI the Augmentation Research Center ARC to pursue his objective of developing both hardware and software computer technology to augment human intelligence That November while attending a conference on computer graphics in Reno Nevada Engelbart began to ponder how to adapt the underlying principles of the planimeter to inputting X and Y coordinate data On November he first recorded his thoughts in his personal notebook about something he initially called a bug which is a point form could have a drop point and orthogonal wheels He wrote that the bug would be easier and more natural to use and unlike a stylus it would stay still when let go which meant it would be much better for coordination with the keyboard br br In Bill English joined ARC where he helped Engelbart build the first mouse prototype They christened the device the mouse as early models had a cord attached to the rear part of the device which looked like a tail and in turn resembled the common mouse According to Roger Bates a hardware designer in English another reason for choosing this name was because the cursor on the screen was also referred to as CAT at this time br As noted above this mouse was first mentioned in print in a July report on which English was the lead author On December Engelbart publicly demonstrated the mouse at what would come to be known as The Mother of All Demos Engelbart never received any royalties for it as his employer SRI held the patent which expired before the mouse became widely used in personal computers In any event the invention of the mouse was just a small part of Engelbart s much larger project of augmenting human intellect br br Several other experimental pointing devices developed for Engelbart s oN Line System NLS exploited different body movements for example head mounted devices attached to the chin or nose but ultimately the mouse won out because of its speed and convenience The first mouse a bulky device pictured used two potentiometers perpendicular to each other and connected to wheels the rotation of each wheel translated into motion along one axis At the time of the Mother of All Demos Engelbart s group had been using their second generation button mouse for about a year br br br First rolling ball mouse br br On October three years after Engelbart s prototype but more than two months before his public demo a mouse device named Rollkugelsteuerung German for Trackball control was shown in a sales brochure by the German company AEG Telefunken as an optional input device for the SIG vector graphics terminal part of the system around their process computer TR and the TR main frame Based on an even earlier trackball device the mouse device had been developed by the company in in what had been a parallel and independent discovery As the name suggests and unlike Engelbart s mouse the Telefunken model already had a ball diameter mm weight g and two mechanical bit rotational position transducers with Gray code like states allowing easy movement in any direction The bits remained stable for at least two successive states to relax debouncing requirements This arrangement was chosen so that the data could also be transmitted to the TR front end process computer and over longer distance telex lines with c baud Weighing grams oz the device with a total height of about cm in came in a c cm in diameter hemispherical injection molded thermoplastic casing featuring one central push button br br As noted above the device was based on an earlier trackball like device also named Rollkugel that was embedded into radar flight control desks This trackball had been originally developed by a team led by Rainer Mallebrein at Telefunken Konstanz for the German Bundesanstalt f r Flugsicherung Federal Air Traffic Control It was part of the corresponding workstation system SAP and the terminal SIG which had been designed and developed since Development for the TR main frame began in This led to the development of the TR process computer system with its SIG terminal Inspired by a discussion with a university customer Mallebrein came up with the idea of reversing the existing Rollkugel trackball into a moveable mouse like device in so that customers did not have to be bothered with mounting holes for the earlier trackball device The device was finished in early and together with light pens and trackballs it was commercially offered as an optional input device for their system starting later that year Not all customers opted to buy the device which added costs of DM per piece to the already up to million DM deal for the main frame of which only a total of systems were sold or leased They were installed at more than German universities including RWTH Aachen Technical University Berlin University of Stuttgart and Konstanz Several Rollkugel mice installed at the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre in Munich in are well preserved in a museum two others survived in a museum at Stuttgart University two in Hamburg the one from Aachen at the Computer History Museum in the US and yet another sample was recently donated to the Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum HNF in Paderborn Anecdotal reports claim that Telefunken s attempt to patent the device was rejected by the German Patent Office due to lack of inventiveness For the air traffic control system the Mallebrein team had already developed a precursor to touch screens in form of an ultrasonic curtain based pointing device in front of the display In they developed a device named Touchinput Einrichtung touch input device based on a conductively coated glass screen br br br First mice on personal computers and workstations br br The Xerox Alto was one of the first computers designed for individual use in and is regarded as the first modern computer to use a mouse Alan Kay designed the by mouse cursor icon with its left edge vertical and right edge degrees so it displays well on the bitmap Inspired by PARC s Alto the Lilith a computer which had been developed by a team around Niklaus Wirth at ETH Z rich between and provided a mouse as well The third marketed version of an integrated mouse shipped as a part of a computer and intended for personal computer navigation came with the Xerox Star in br By the Xerox was probably the best known computer with a mouse The Sun also came with a mouse and the forthcoming Apple Lisa was rumored to use one but the peripheral remained obscure Jack Hawley of The Mouse House reported that one buyer for a large organization believed at first that his company sold lab mice Hawley who manufactured mice for Xerox stated that Practically I have the market all to myself right now a Hawley mouse cost In Logitech introduced the P Mouse at the Comdex trade show in Las Vegas its first hardware mouse That same year Microsoft made the decision to make the MS DOS program Microsoft Word mouse compatible and developed the first PC compatible mouse The Microsoft Mouse shipped in thus beginning the Microsoft Hardware division of the company However the mouse remained relatively obscure until the appearance of the Macintosh K which included an updated version of the single button Lisa Mouse in and of the Amiga and the Atari ST in br br br Operation br br A mouse typically controls the motion of a pointer in two dimensions in a graphical user interface GUI The mouse turns movements of the hand backward and forward left and right into equivalent electronic signals that in turn are used to move the pointer br The relative movements of the mouse on the surface are applied to the position of the pointer on the screen which signals the point where actions of the user take place so hand movements are replicated by the pointer Clicking or pointing stopping movement while the cursor is within the bounds of an area can select files programs or actions from a list of names or in graphical interfaces through small images called icons and other elements For example a text file might be represented by a picture of a paper notebook and clicking while the cursor points at this icon might cause a text editing program to open the file in a window br Different ways of operating the mouse cause specific things to happen in the GUI br br Point stop the motion of the pointer while it is inside the boundaries of what the user wants to interact with This act of pointing is what the pointer and pointing device are named after In web design lingo pointing is referred to as hovering This usage spread to web programming and Android programming and is now found in many contexts br Click pressing and releasing a button br left Single click clicking the main button br left Double click clicking the button two times in quick succession counts as a different gesture than two separate single clicks br left Triple click clicking the button three times in quick succession counts as a different gesture than three separate single clicks Triple clicks are far less common in traditional navigation br Right click clicking the secondary button In modern applications this frequently opens a context menu br Middle click clicking the tertiary button In most cases this is also the scroll wheel br Clicking the fourth button br Clicking the fifth button br The USB standard defines up to distinct buttons for mice and other such devices although in practice buttons above are rarely implemented br Drag pressing and holding a button and moving the mouse before releasing the button This is frequently used to move or copy files or other objects via drag and drop other uses include selecting text and drawing in graphics applications br Mouse button chording or chord clicking br Clicking with more than one button simultaneously br Clicking while simultaneously typing a letter on the keyboard br Clicking and rolling the mouse wheel simultaneously br Clicking while holding down a modifier key br Moving the pointer a long distance When a practical limit of mouse movement is reached one lifts up the mouse brings it to the opposite edge of the working area while it is held above the surface and then lowers it back onto the working surface This is often not necessary because acceleration software detects fast movement and moves the pointer significantly faster in proportion than for slow mouse motion br Multi touch this method is similar to a multi touch touchpad on a laptop with support for tap input for multiple fingers the most famous example being the Apple Magic Mouse br br br Gestures br br The Concept of Gestural Interfaces Gestural interfaces have become an integral part of modern computing allowing users to interact with their devices in a more intuitive and natural way In addition to traditional pointing and clicking actions users can now employ gestural inputs to issue commands or perform specific actions These stylized motions of the mouse cursor known as gestures have the potential to enhance user experience and streamline workflow br Mouse Gestures in Action To illustrate the concept of gestural interfaces let s consider a drawing program as an example In this scenario a user can employ a gesture to delete a shape on the canvas By rapidly moving the mouse cursor in an x motion over the shape the user can trigger the command to delete the selected shape This gesture based interaction enables users to perform actions quickly and efficiently without relying solely on traditional input methods br Challenges and Benefits of Gestural Interfaces While gestural interfaces offer a more immersive and interactive user experience they also present challenges One of the primary difficulties lies in the requirement of finer motor control from users Gestures demand precise movements which can be more challenging for individuals with limited dexterity or those who are new to this mode of interaction br However despite these challenges gestural interfaces have gained popularity due to their ability to simplify complex tasks and improve efficiency Several gestural conventions have become widely adopted making them more accessible to users One such convention is the drag and drop gesture which has become pervasive across various applications and platforms br The Drag and Drop Gesture The drag and drop gesture is a fundamental gestural convention that enables users to manipulate objects on the screen seamlessly It involves a series of actions performed by the user br Pressing the mouse button while the cursor hovers over an interface object br Moving the cursor to a different location while holding the button down br Releasing the mouse button to complete the action br This gesture allows users to transfer or rearrange objects effortlessly For instance a user can drag and drop a picture representing a file onto an image of a trash can indicating the intention to delete the file This intuitive and visual approach to interaction has become synonymous with organizing digital content and simplifying file management tasks br Standard Semantic Gestures In addition to the drag and drop gesture several other semantic gestures have emerged as standard conventions within the gestural interface paradigm These gestures serve specific purposes and contribute to a more intuitive user experience Some of the notable semantic gestures include br Crossing based goal This gesture involves crossing a specific boundary or threshold on the screen to trigger an action or complete a task For example swiping across the screen to unlock a device or confirm a selection br Menu traversal Menu traversal gestures facilitate navigation through hierarchical menus or options Users can perform gestures such as swiping or scrolling to explore different menu levels or activate specific commands br Pointing Pointing gestures involve positioning the mouse cursor over an object or element to interact with it This fundamental gesture enables users to select click or access contextual menus br Mouseover pointing or hovering Mouseover gestures occur when the cursor is positioned over an object without clicking This action often triggers a visual change or displays additional information about the object providing users with real time feedback br These standard semantic gestures along with the drag and drop convention form the building blocks of gestural interfaces allowing users to interact with digital content using intuitive and natural movements br br br Specific uses br br At the end of th century digitizer mice puck with magnifying glass was used with AutoCAD for the digitizations of blueprints br Other uses of the mouse s input occur commonly in special application domains In interactive three dimensional graphics the mouse s motion often translates directly into changes in the virtual objects or camera s orientation For example in the first person shooter genre of games see below players usually employ the mouse to control the direction in which the virtual player s head faces moving the mouse up will cause the player to look up revealing the view above the player s head A related function makes an image of an object rotate so that all sides can be examined D design and animation software often modally chord many different combinations to allow objects and cameras to be rotated and moved through space with the few axes of movement mice can detect br When mice have more than one button the software may assign different functions to each button Often the primary leftmost in a right handed configuration button on the mouse will select items and the secondary rightmost in a right handed button will bring up a menu of alternative actions applicable to that item For example on platforms with more than one button the Mozilla web browser will follow a link in response to a primary button click will bring up a contextual menu of alternative actions for that link in response to a secondary button click and will often open the link in a new tab or window in response to a click with the tertiary middle mouse button br br br Types br br br Mechanical mice br br The German company Telefunken published on their early ball mouse on October Telefunken s mouse was sold as optional equipment for their computer systems Bill English builder of Engelbart s original mouse created a ball mouse in while working for Xerox PARC br The ball mouse replaced the external wheels with a single ball that could rotate in any direction It came as part of the hardware package of the Xerox Alto computer Perpendicular chopper wheels housed inside the mouse s body chopped beams of light on the way to light sensors thus detecting in their turn the motion of the ball This variant of the mouse resembled an inverted trackball and became the predominant form used with personal computers throughout the s and s The Xerox PARC group also settled on the modern technique of using both hands to type on a full size keyboard and grabbing the mouse when required br br The ball mouse has two freely rotating rollers These are located degrees apart One roller detects the forward backward motion of the mouse and the other the left right motion Opposite the two rollers is a third one white in the photo at degrees that is spring loaded to push the ball against the other two rollers Each roller is on the same shaft as an encoder wheel that has slotted edges the slots interrupt infrared light beams to generate electrical pulses that represent wheel movement Each wheel s disc has a pair of light beams located so that a given beam becomes interrupted or again starts to pass light freely when the other beam of the pair is about halfway between changes br Simple logic circuits interpret the relative timing to indicate which direction the wheel is rotating This incremental rotary encoder scheme is sometimes called quadrature encoding of the wheel rotation as the two optical sensors produce signals that are in approximately quadrature phase The mouse sends these signals to the computer system via the mouse cable directly as logic signals in very old mice such as the Xerox mice and via a data formatting IC in modern mice The driver software in the system converts the signals into motion of the mouse cursor along X and Y axes on the computer screen br br The ball is mostly steel with a precision spherical rubber surface The weight of the ball given an appropriate working surface under the mouse provides a reliable grip so the mouse s movement is transmitted accurately Ball mice and wheel mice were manufactured for Xerox by Jack Hawley doing business as The Mouse House in Berkeley California starting in Based on another invention by Jack Hawley proprietor of the Mouse House Honeywell produced another type of mechanical mouse Instead of a ball it had two wheels rotating at off axes Key Tronic later produced a similar product br Modern computer mice took form at the cole Polytechnique F d rale de Lausanne EPFL under the inspiration of Professor Jean Daniel Nicoud and at the hands of engineer and watchmaker Andr Guignard This new design incorporated a single hard rubber mouseball and three buttons and remained a common design until the mainstream adoption of the scroll wheel mouse during the s In Ren Sommer added a microprocessor to Nicoud s and Guignard s design Through this innovation Sommer is credited with inventing a significant component of the mouse which made it more intelligent though optical mice from Mouse Systems had incorporated microprocessors by br Another type of mechanical mouse the analog mouse now generally regarded as obsolete uses potentiometers rather than encoder wheels and is typically designed to be plug compatible with an analog joystick The Color Mouse originally marketed by RadioShack for their Color Computer but also usable on MS DOS machines equipped with analog joystick ports provided the software accepted joystick input was the best known example br br br Optical and laser mice br br Early optical mice relied entirely on one or more light emitting diodes LEDs and an imaging array of photodiodes to detect movement relative to the underlying surface eschewing the internal moving parts a mechanical mouse uses in addition to its optics A laser mouse is an optical mouse that uses coherent laser light br The earliest optical mice detected movement on pre printed mousepad surfaces whereas the modern LED optical mouse works on most opaque diffuse surfaces it is usually unable to detect movement on specular surfaces like polished stone Laser diodes provide good resolution and precision improving performance on opaque specular surfaces Later more surface independent optical mice use an optoelectronic sensor essentially a tiny low resolution video camera to take successive images of the surface on which the mouse operates Battery powered wireless optical mice flash the LED intermittently to save power and only glow steadily when movement is detected br br br Inertial and gyroscopic mice br Often called air mice since they do not require a surface to operate inertial mice use a tuning fork or other accelerometer US Patent to detect rotary movement for every axis supported The most common models manufactured by Logitech and Gyration work using degrees of rotational freedom and are insensitive to spatial translation The user requires only small wrist rotations to move the cursor reducing user fatigue or gorilla arm br Usually cordless they often have a switch to deactivate the movement circuitry between use allowing the user freedom of movement without affecting the cursor position A patent for an inertial mouse claims that such mice consume less power than optically based mice and offer increased sensitivity reduced weight and increased ease of use In combination with a wireless keyboard an inertial mouse can offer alternative ergonomic arrangements which do not require a flat work surface potentially alleviating some types of repetitive motion injuries related to workstation posture br br br D mice br A D mouse is a computer input device for viewport interaction with at least three degrees of freedom DoF e g in D computer graphics software for manipulating virtual objects navigating in the viewport defining camera paths posing and desktop motion capture D mice can also be used as spatial controllers for video game interaction e g SpaceOrb To perform such different tasks the used transfer function and the device stiffness are essential for efficient interaction br br br Transfer function br The virtual motion is connected to the D mouse control handle via a transfer function Position control means that the virtual position and orientation is proportional to the mouse handle s deflection whereas velocity control means that translation and rotation velocity of the controlled object is proportional to the handle deflection A further essential property of a transfer function is its interaction metaphor br br Object in hand metaphor An exterocentrical metaphor whereby the scene moves in correspondence with the input device If the handle of the input device is twisted clockwise the scene rotates clockwise If the handle is moved left the scene shifts left and so on br Camera in hand metaphor An egocentrical metaphor whereby the user s view is controlled by direct movement of a virtual camera If the handle is twisted clockwise the scene rotates counter clockwise If the handle is moved left the scene shifts right and so on br Ware and Osborne performed an experiment investigating these metaphors whereby it was shown that there is no single best metaphor For manipulation tasks the object in hand metaphor was superior whereas for navigation tasks the camera in hand metaphor was superior br br br Device stiffness br Zhai used and the following three categories for device stiffness br br Isotonic Input An input device with zero stiffness that is there is no self centering effect br Elastic Input A device with some stiffness that is the forces on the handle are proportional to the deflections br Isometric Input An elastic input device with infinite stiffness that is the device handle does not allow any deflection but records force and torque br br br Isotonic D mice br Logitech D Mouse was the first ultrasonic mouse and is an example of an isotonic D mouse having six degrees of freedom DoF Isotonic devices have also been developed with less than DoF e g the Inspector at Technical University of Denmark DoF input br Other examples of isotonic D mice are motion controllers i e is a type of game controller that typically uses accelerometers to track motion Motion tracking systems are also used for motion capture e g in the film industry although that these tracking systems are not D mice in a strict sense because motion capture only means recording D motion and not D interaction br br br Isometric D mice br Early D mice for velocity control were almost ideally isometric e g SpaceBall and a device developed at Deutsches Zentrum f r Luft und Raumfahrt DLR cf US patent US A br br br Elastic D mice br At DLR an elastic DoF sensor was developed that was used in Logitech s SpaceMouse and in the products of DConnexion SpaceBall FLX has a maximum deflection of approximately mm in at a maximum force of approximately N that is a stiffness of approximately N cm lbf in SpaceMouse has a maximum deflection of mm in at a maximum force of N lbf that is a stiffness of approximately N cm lbf in Taking this development further the softly elastic Sundinlabs SpaceCat was developed SpaceCat has a maximum translational deflection of approximately mm in and maximum rotational deflection of approximately at a maximum force less than N that is a stiffness of approximately N cm lbf in With SpaceCat Sundin and Fjeld reviewed five comparative experiments performed with different device stiffness and transfer functions and performed a further study comparing DoF softly elastic position control with DoF stiffly elastic velocity control in a positioning task They concluded that for positioning tasks position control is to be preferred over velocity control They could further conjecture the following two types of preferred D mouse usage br br Positioning manipulation and docking using isotonic or softly elastic position control and an object in hand metaphor br Navigation using softly or stiffly elastic rate control and a camera in hand metaphor br DConnexion s D mice have been commercially successful over decades They are used in combination with the conventional mouse for CAD The Space Mouse is used to orient the target object or change the viewpoint with the non dominant hand whereas the dominant hand operates the computer mouse for conventional CAD GUI operation This is a kind of space multiplexed input where the DoF input device acts as a graspable user interface that is always connected to the view port br br br Force feedback br With force feedback the device stiffness can dynamically be adapted to the task just performed by the user e g performing positioning tasks with less stiffness than navigation tasks br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Tactile mice br In Logitech introduced a tactile mouse known as the iFeel Mouse developed by Immersion Corporation that contained a small actuator to enable the mouse to generate simulated physical sensations Such a mouse can augment user interfaces with haptic feedback such as giving feedback when crossing a window boundary To surf the internet by touch enabled mouse was first developed in and first implemented commercially by the Wingman Force Feedback Mouse It requires the user to be able to feel depth or hardness this ability was realized with the first electrorheological tactile mice but never marketed br br br Pucks br Tablet digitizers are sometimes used with accessories called pucks devices which rely on absolute positioning but can be configured for sufficiently mouse like relative tracking that they are sometimes marketed as mice br br br Ergonomic mice br br As the name suggests this type of mouse is intended to provide optimum comfort and avoid injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome arthritis and other repetitive strain injuries It is designed to fit natural hand position and movements to reduce discomfort br When holding a typical mouse the ulna and radius bones on the arm are crossed Some designs attempt to place the palm more vertically so the bones take more natural parallel position br Increasing mouse height and angling the mouse topcase can improve wrist posture without negatively affecting performance Some limit wrist movement encouraging arm movement instead that may be less precise but more optimal from the health point of view A mouse may be angled from the thumb downward to the opposite side this is known to reduce wrist pronation However such optimizations make the mouse right or left hand specific making more problematic to change the tired hand Time has criticized manufacturers for offering few or no left handed ergonomic mice Oftentimes I felt like I was dealing with someone who d never actually met a left handed person before br br Another solution is a pointing bar device The so called roller bar mouse is positioned snugly in front of the keyboard thus allowing bi manual accessibility br br br Gaming mice br br These mice are specifically designed for use in computer games They typically employ a wider array of controls and buttons and have designs that differ radically from traditional mice They may also have decorative monochrome or programmable RGB LED lighting The additional buttons can often be used for changing the sensitivity of the mouse or they can be assigned programmed to macros i e for opening a program or for use instead of a key combination It is also common for game mice especially those designed for use in real time strategy games such as StarCraft or in multiplayer online battle arena games such as League of Legends to have a relatively high sensitivity measured in dots per inch DPI which can be as high as DPI and CPI are the same values that refer to the mouse s sensitivity DPI is a misnomer used in the gaming world and many manufacturers use it to refer to CPI counts per inch Some advanced mice from gaming manufacturers also allow users to adjust the weight of the mouse by adding or subtracting weights to allow for easier control Ergonomic quality is also an important factor in gaming mouse as extended gameplay times may render further use of the mouse to be uncomfortable Some mice have been designed to have adjustable features such as removable and or elongated palm rests horizontally adjustable thumb rests and pinky rests Some mice may include several different rests with their products to ensure comfort for a wider range of target consumers Gaming mice are held by gamers in three styles of grip br br Palm Grip the hand rests on the mouse with extended fingers br Claw Grip palm rests on the mouse bent fingers br Finger Tip Grip bent fingers palm does not touch the mouse br br br Connectivity and communication protocols br br To transmit their input typical cabled mice use a thin electrical cord terminating in a standard connector such as RS C PS ADB or USB Cordless mice instead transmit data via infrared radiation see IrDA or radio including Bluetooth although many such cordless interfaces are themselves connected through the aforementioned wired serial buses br While the electrical interface and the format of the data transmitted by commonly available mice is currently standardized on USB in the past it varied between different manufacturers A bus mouse used a dedicated interface card for connection to an IBM PC or compatible computer br Mouse use in DOS applications became more common after the introduction of the Microsoft Mouse largely because Microsoft provided an open standard for communication between applications and mouse driver software Thus any application written to use the Microsoft standard could use a mouse with a driver that implements the same API even if the mouse hardware itself was incompatible with Microsoft s This driver provides the state of the buttons and the distance the mouse has moved in units that its documentation calls mickeys br br br Early mice br br In the s the Xerox Alto mouse and in the s the Xerox optical mouse used a quadrature encoded X and Y interface This two bit encoding per dimension had the property that only one bit of the two would change at a time like a Gray code or Johnson counter so that the transitions would not be misinterpreted when asynchronously sampled br The earliest mass market mice such as on the original Macintosh Amiga and Atari ST mice used a D subminiature pin connector to send the quadrature encoded X and Y axis signals directly plus one pin per mouse button The mouse was a simple optomechanical device and the decoding circuitry was all in the main computer br The DE connectors were designed to be electrically compatible with the joysticks popular on numerous bit systems such as the Commodore and the Atari Although the ports could be used for both purposes the signals must be interpreted differently As a result plugging a mouse into a joystick port causes the joystick to continuously move in some direction even if the mouse stays still whereas plugging a joystick into a mouse port causes the mouse to only be able to move a single pixel in each direction br br br Serial interface and protocol br br Because the IBM PC did not have a quadrature decoder built in early PC mice used the RS C serial port to communicate encoded mouse movements as well as provide power to the mouse s circuits The Mouse Systems Corporation MSC version used a five byte protocol and supported three buttons The Microsoft version used a three byte protocol and supported two buttons Due to the incompatibility between the two protocols some manufacturers sold serial mice with a mode switch PC for MSC mode MS for Microsoft mode br br br Apple Desktop Bus br br In Apple first implemented the Apple Desktop Bus allowing the daisy chaining of up to devices including mice and other devices on the same bus with no configuration whatsoever Featuring only a single data pin the bus used a purely polled approach to device communications and survived as the standard on mainstream models including a number of non Apple workstations until when Apple s iMac line of computers joined the industry wide switch to using USB Beginning with the Bronze Keyboard PowerBook G in May Apple dropped the external ADB port in favor of USB but retained an internal ADB connection in the PowerBook G for communication with its built in keyboard and trackpad until early br br br PS interface and protocol br br With the arrival of the IBM PS personal computer series in IBM introduced the eponymous PS port for mice and keyboards which other manufacturers rapidly adopted The most visible change was the use of a round pin mini DIN in lieu of the former pin MIDI style full sized DIN connector In default mode called stream mode a PS mouse communicates motion and the state of each button by means of byte packets For any motion button press or button release event a PS mouse sends over a bi directional serial port a sequence of three bytes with the following format br br Here XS and YS represent the sign bits of the movement vectors XV and YV indicate an overflow in the respective vector component and LB MB and RB indicate the status of the left middle and right mouse buttons pressed PS mice also understand several commands for reset and self test switching between different operating modes and changing the resolution of the reported motion vectors br A Microsoft IntelliMouse relies on an extension of the PS protocol the ImPS or IMPS protocol the abbreviation combines the concepts of IntelliMouse and PS It initially operates in standard PS format for backward compatibility After the host sends a special command sequence it switches to an extended format in which a fourth byte carries information about wheel movements The IntelliMouse Explorer works analogously with the difference that its byte packets also allow for two additional buttons for a total of five br Mouse vendors also use other extended formats often without providing public documentation The Typhoon mouse uses byte packets which can appear as a sequence of two standard byte packets such that an ordinary PS driver can handle them For D or degree of freedom input vendors have made many extensions both to the hardware and to software In the late s Logitech created ultrasound based tracking which gave D input to a few millimeters accuracy which worked well as an input device but failed as a profitable product In Motion U introduced its OptiBurst system using IR tracking for use as a Maya graphics software plugin br br br USB br Almost all wired mice today use USB and the USB human interface device class for communication br br br Cordless or wireless br Cordless or wireless mice transmit data via radio Some mice connect to the computer through Bluetooth or Wi Fi while others use a receiver that plugs into the computer for example through a USB port br Many mice that use a USB receiver have a storage compartment for it inside the mouse Some nano receivers are designed to be small enough to remain plugged into a laptop during transport while still being large enough to easily remove br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Operating system support br MS DOS and Windows support connecting a mouse such as a Microsoft Mouse via multiple interfaces BallPoint Bus InPort Serial port or PS br Windows added built in support for USB Human Interface Device class USB HID with native vertical scrolling support Windows and Windows Me expanded this built in support to button mice br Windows XP Service Pack introduced a Bluetooth stack allowing Bluetooth mice to be used without any USB receivers Windows Vista added native support for horizontal scrolling and standardized wheel movement granularity for finer scrolling br Windows introduced BLE Bluetooth Low Energy mouse HID support br br br Multiple mouse systems br Some systems allow two or more mice to be used at once as input devices Late s era home computers such as the Amiga used this to allow computer games with two players interacting on the same computer Lemmings and The Settlers for example The same idea is sometimes used in collaborative software e g to simulate a whiteboard that multiple users can draw on without passing a single mouse around br Microsoft Windows since Windows has supported multiple simultaneous pointing devices Because Windows only provides a single screen cursor using more than one device at the same time requires cooperation of users or applications designed for multiple input devices br Multiple mice are often used in multi user gaming in addition to specially designed devices that provide several input interfaces br Windows also has full support for multiple input mouse configurations for multi user environments br Starting with Windows XP Microsoft introduced an SDK for developing applications that allow multiple input devices to be used at the same time with independent cursors and independent input points However it no longer appears to be available br The introduction of Windows Vista and Microsoft Surface now known as Microsoft PixelSense introduced a new set of input APIs that were adopted into Windows allowing for points cursors all controlled by independent users The new input points provide traditional mouse input however they were designed with other input technologies like touch and image in mind They inherently offer D coordinates along with pressure size tilt angle mask and even an image bitmap to see and recognize the input point object on the screen br As of Linux distributions and other operating systems that use X Org such as OpenSolaris and FreeBSD support cursors input points through Multi Pointer X However currently no window managers support Multi Pointer X leaving it relegated to custom software usage br There have also been propositions of having a single operator use two mice simultaneously as a more sophisticated means of controlling various graphics and multimedia applications br br br Buttons br br Mouse buttons are microswitches which can be pressed to select or interact with an element of a graphical user interface producing a distinctive clicking sound br Since around the late s the three button scrollmouse has become the de facto standard Users most commonly employ the second button to invoke a contextual menu in the computer s software user interface which contains options specifically tailored to the interface element over which the mouse cursor currently sits By default the primary mouse button sits located on the left hand side of the mouse for the benefit of right handed users left handed users can usually reverse this configuration via software br br br Scrolling br br Nearly all mice now have an integrated input primarily intended for scrolling on top usually a single axis digital wheel or rocker switch which can also be depressed to act as a third button Though less common many mice instead have two axis inputs such as a tiltable wheel trackball or touchpad Those with a trackball may be designed to stay stationary using the trackball instead of moving the mouse br br br Speed br Mickeys per second is a unit of measurement for the speed and movement direction of a computer mouse where direction is often expressed as horizontal versus vertical mickey count However speed can also refer to the ratio between how many pixels the cursor moves on the screen and how far the mouse moves on the mouse pad which may be expressed as pixels per mickey pixels per inch or pixels per centimeter br The computer industry often measures mouse sensitivity in terms of counts per inch CPI commonly expressed as dots per inch DPI the number of steps the mouse will report when it moves one inch In early mice this specification was called pulses per inch ppi The mickey originally referred to one of these counts or one resolvable step of motion If the default mouse tracking condition involves moving the cursor by one screen pixel or dot on screen per reported step then the CPI does equate to DPI dots of cursor motion per inch of mouse motion The CPI or DPI as reported by manufacturers depends on how they make the mouse the higher the CPI the faster the cursor moves with mouse movement However software can adjust the mouse sensitivity making the cursor move faster or slower than its CPI As of software can change the speed of the cursor dynamically taking into account the mouse s absolute speed and the movement from the last stop point In most software an example being the Windows platforms this setting is named speed referring to cursor precision However some operating systems name this setting acceleration the typical Apple OS designation This term is incorrect Mouse acceleration in most mouse software refers to the change in speed of the cursor over time while the mouse movement is constant br For simple software when the mouse starts to move the software will count the number of counts or mickeys received from the mouse and will move the cursor across the screen by that number of pixels or multiplied by a rate factor typically less than The cursor will move slowly on the screen with good precision When the movement of the mouse passes the value set for some threshold the software will start to move the cursor faster with a greater rate factor Usually the user can set the value of the second rate factor by changing the acceleration setting br Operating systems sometimes apply acceleration referred to as ballistics to the motion reported by the mouse For example versions of Windows prior to Windows XP doubled reported values above a configurable threshold and then optionally doubled them again above a second configurable threshold These doublings applied separately in the X and Y directions resulting in very nonlinear response br br br Mousepads br br Engelbart s original mouse did not require a mousepad the mouse had two large wheels which could roll on virtually any surface However most subsequent mechanical mice starting with the steel roller ball mouse have required a mousepad for optimal performance br The mousepad the most common mouse accessory appears most commonly in conjunction with mechanical mice because to roll smoothly the ball requires more friction than common desk surfaces usually provide So called hard mousepads for gamers or optical laser mice also exist br Most optical and laser mice do not require a pad the notable exception being early optical mice which relied on a grid on the pad to detect movement e g Mouse Systems Whether to use a hard or soft mousepad with an optical mouse is largely a matter of personal preference One exception occurs when the desk surface creates problems for the optical or laser tracking for example a transparent or reflective surface such as glass br Some mice also come with small pads attached to the bottom surface also called mouse feet or mouse skates that help the user slide the mouse smoothly across surfaces br br br In the marketplace br br Around Xerox included mice with its Xerox Star based on the mouse used in the s on the Alto computer at Xerox PARC Sun Microsystems Symbolics Lisp Machines Inc and Tektronix also shipped workstations with mice starting in about Later inspired by the Star Apple Computer released the Apple Lisa which also used a mouse However none of these products achieved large scale success Only with the release of the Apple Macintosh in did the mouse see widespread use br The Macintosh design commercially successful and technically influential led many other vendors to begin producing mice or including them with their other computer products by Atari ST Amiga Windows GEOS for the Commodore and the Apple IIGS br The widespread adoption of graphical user interfaces in the software of the s and s made mice all but indispensable for controlling computers In November Logitech built their billionth mouse br br br Use in games br br The device often functions as an interface for PC based computer games and sometimes for video game consoles The Classic Mac OS Desk Accessory Puzzle in was the first game designed specifically for a mouse br br br First person shooters br br FPSs naturally lend themselves to separate and simultaneous control of the player s movement and aim and on computers this has traditionally been achieved with a combination of keyboard and mouse Players use the X axis of the mouse for looking or turning left and right and the Y axis for looking up and down the keyboard is used for movement and supplemental inputs br Many shooting genre players prefer a mouse over a gamepad analog stick because the wide range of motion offered by a mouse allows for faster and more varied control Although an analog stick allows the player more granular control it is poor for certain movements as the player s input is relayed based on a vector of both the stick s direction and magnitude Thus a small but fast movement known as flick shotting using a gamepad requires the player to quickly move the stick from its rest position to the edge and back again in quick succession a difficult maneuver In addition the stick also has a finite magnitude if the player is currently using the stick to move at a non zero velocity their ability to increase the rate of movement of the camera is further limited based on the position their displaced stick was already at before executing the maneuver The effect of this is that a mouse is well suited not only to small precise movements but also to large quick movements and immediate responsive movements all of which are important in shooter gaming This advantage also extends in varying degrees to similar game styles such as third person shooters br Some incorrectly ported games or game engines have acceleration and interpolation curves which unintentionally produce excessive irregular or even negative acceleration when used with a mouse instead of their native platform s non mouse default input device Depending on how deeply hardcoded this misbehavior is internal user patches or external rd party software may be able to fix it Individual game engines will also have their own sensitivities This often restricts one from taking a game s existing sensitivity transferring it to another and acquiring the same rotational measurements A sensitivity converter is the preferred tool that FPS gamers use to translate correctly the rotational movements between different mice and between different games Calculating the conversion values manually is also possible but it is more time consuming and requires performing complex mathematical calculations while using a sensitivity converter is a lot faster and easier for gamers br Due to their similarity to the WIMP desktop metaphor interface for which mice were originally designed and to their own tabletop game origins computer strategy games are most commonly played with mice In particular real time strategy and MOBA games usually require the use of a mouse br The left button usually controls primary fire If the game supports multiple fire modes the right button often provides secondary fire from the selected weapon Games with only a single fire mode will generally map secondary fire to aim down the weapon sights In some games the right button may also invoke accessories for a particular weapon such as allowing access to the scope of a sniper rifle or allowing the mounting of a bayonet or silencer br Players can use a scroll wheel for changing weapons or for controlling scope zoom magnification in older games On most first person shooter games programming may also assign more functions to additional buttons on mice with more than three controls A keyboard usually controls movement for example WASD for moving forward left backward and right respectively and other functions such as changing posture Since the mouse serves for aiming a mouse that tracks movement accurately and with less lag latency will give a player an advantage over players with less accurate or slower mice In some cases the right mouse button may be used to move the player forward either in lieu of or in conjunction with the typical WASD configuration br Many games provide players with the option of mapping their own choice of a key or button to a certain control An early technique of players circle strafing saw a player continuously strafing while aiming and shooting at an opponent by walking in circle around the opponent with the opponent at the center of the circle Players could achieve this by holding down a key for strafing while continuously aiming the mouse toward the opponent br Games using mice for input are so popular that many manufacturers make mice specifically for gaming Such mice may feature adjustable weights high resolution optical or laser components additional buttons ergonomic shape and other features such as adjustable CPI Mouse Bungees are typically used with gaming mice because it eliminates the annoyance of the cable br Many games such as first or third person shooters have a setting named invert mouse or similar not to be confused with button inversion sometimes performed by left handed users which allows the user to look downward by moving the mouse forward and upward by moving the mouse backward the opposite of non inverted movement This control system resembles that of aircraft control sticks where pulling back causes pitch up and pushing forward causes pitch down computer joysticks also typically emulate this control configuration br After id Software s commercial hit of Doom which did not support vertical aiming competitor Bungie s Marathon became the first first person shooter to support using the mouse to aim up and down Games using the Build engine had an option to invert the Y axis The invert feature actually made the mouse behave in a manner that users now regard as non inverted by default moving mouse forward resulted in looking down Soon after id Software released Quake which introduced the invert feature as users now know it br br br Home consoles br br In the VTech Socrates educational video game console featured a wireless mouse with an attached mouse pad as an optional controller used for some games In the early s the Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game system featured a mouse in addition to its controllers A mouse was also released for the Nintendo although it was only released in Japan The game Mario Paint in particular used the mouse s capabilities as did its Japanese only successor Mario Artist on the N for its DD disk drive peripheral in Sega released official mice for their Genesis Mega Drive Saturn and Dreamcast consoles NEC sold official mice for its PC Engine and PC FX consoles Sony released an official mouse product for the PlayStation console included one along with the Linux for PlayStation kit as well as allowing owners to use virtually any USB mouse with the PS PS and PS Nintendo s Wii also had this feature implemented in a later software update and this support was retained on its successor the Wii U Microsoft s Xbox line of game consoles which used operaring systems based on modified versions of Windows NT also had universal wide mouse support using USB br br br See also br br br Notes br br br br br br Further reading br Roch Axel at Wikidata Fire Control and Human Computer Interaction
