A Machmeter is an aircraft pitot static system flight instrument that br shows the ratio of the true airspeed to the speed of sound br a dimensionless quantity called Mach number This is shown on a Machmeter as a decimal fraction br An aircraft flying at the speed of sound is flying br at a Mach number of one expressed as Mach br br br Use br As an aircraft in transonic flight approaches the speed of sound br it first reaches its critical mach number where air flowing br over low pressure areas of its surface locally reaches the br speed of sound forming shock waves The indicated airspeed br for this condition changes with ambient temperature br which in turn changes with altitude br Therefore indicated airspeed is not entirely adequate to br warn the pilot of the impending problems Mach number is br more useful and most high speed aircraft are limited to a maximum operating Mach number also known as MMO br For example if the MMO is Mach then at m ft where the speed of sound under standard conditions is kilometres per hour kn the true airspeed at MMO is kilometres per hour kn The speed of sound increases with air temperature so at Mach at m ft where the air is much warmer than at m ft the true airspeed at MMO would be km h kn br br br Operation br Modern electronic Machmeters use information from an air data computer system which makes calculations using inputs from a pitot static system Some older mechanical Machmeters use an altitude aneroid and an airspeed capsule which together convert pitot static pressure into Mach number The Machmeter suffers from instrument and position errors br br br Calibration br In subsonic flow the Mach meter can be calibrated according to br br br br br br M br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br q br br c br br br p br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br o br r br br br M br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br p br br t br br br p br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle M sqrt left left frac q c p right frac right or M sqrt left left frac p t p right frac right br br br where br br br br br br M br br br br displaystyle M br br is Mach number br qc is impact pressure dynamic pressure br br br br br br p br br br displaystyle p br br is static pressure br and assuming the ratio of specific heats is br When a shock wave forms across the pitot tube the required formula is derived from the Rayleigh Supersonic Pitot equation and is solved iteratively br br br br br br M br br br br br br br br br p br br t br br br p br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br M br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle M sqrt frac p t p left frac M right frac br br br where br br br br br br br p br br t br br br br br displaystyle p t br br is now total pressure measured behind the normal shock br Note that the inputs required are total pressure and static pressure Air temperature input is not required br br br See also br ICAO recommendations on use of the International System of Units br Airspeed indicator br Mach number br Pitot static system br br br br Instrument Flying Handbook U S Government Printing Office Washington D C U S Federal Aviation Administration pp FAA H br Instrument Flying Handbook U S Government Printing Office Washington D C U S Federal Aviation Administration pp FAA H A Archived from the original on br This article incorporates public domain material from Instrument Flying Handbook United States Government
