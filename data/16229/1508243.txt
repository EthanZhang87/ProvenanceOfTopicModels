A push button also spelled pushbutton or simply button is a simple switch mechanism to control some aspect of a machine or a process Buttons are typically made out of hard material usually plastic or metal The surface is usually flat or shaped to accommodate the human finger or hand so as to be easily depressed or pushed Buttons are most often biased switches although many un biased buttons due to their physical nature still require a spring to return to their un pushed state br Terms for the pushing of a button include pressing depressing mashing slapping hitting and punching br br br Uses br br The push button has been utilized in calculators push button telephones kitchen appliances and various other mechanical and electronic devices home and commercial br In industrial and commercial applications push buttons can be connected together by a mechanical linkage so that the act of pushing one button causes the other button to be released In this way a stop button can force a start button to be released This method of linkage is used in simple manual operations in which the machine or process has no electrical circuits for control br Red pushbuttons can also have large heads called mushroom heads for easy operation and to facilitate the stopping of a machine These pushbuttons are called emergency stop buttons and for increased safety are mandated by the electrical code in many jurisdictions This large mushroom shape can also be found in buttons for use with operators who need to wear gloves for their work and could not actuate a regular flush mounted push button br br As an aid for operators and users in industrial or commercial applications a pilot light is commonly added to draw the attention of the user and to provide feedback if the button is pushed Typically this light is included into the center of the pushbutton and a lens replaces the pushbutton hard center disk The source of the energy to illuminate the light is not directly tied to the contacts on the back of the pushbutton but to the action the pushbutton controls In this way a start button when pushed will cause the process or machine operation to be started and a secondary contact designed into the operation or process will close to turn on the pilot light and signify the action of pushing the button caused the resultant process or action to start br To avoid an operator from pushing the wrong button in error pushbuttons are often color coded to associate them with their function Commonly used colors are red for stopping the machine or process and green for starting the machine or process br In popular culture the phrase the button sometimes capitalized refers to a usually fictional button that a military or government leader could press to launch nuclear weapons br br br Scram and scramble switches br Akin to fire alarm switches some big red buttons when deployed with suitable visual and audible warnings such as flashing lights and sirens for extreme exigent emergencies are known as scram switches from the slang term scram get out of here Generally such buttons are connected to large scale functions beyond a regular fire alarm such as automated shutdown procedures complete facility power cut fire suppression like halon release etc br A variant of this is the scramble switch which triggers an alarm to activate emergent personnel to proactively attend to and go to such disasters An air raid siren at an air base initiates such action where the fighter pilots are alerted and scrambled to their planes to defend the base br br br History br Push buttons were invented sometime in the late th century certainly no later than The name came from the French word bouton something that sticks out rather than from the kind of buttons used on clothing The initial public reaction was curiosity mixed with fear some of which was due to widespread fear of electricity which was a relatively new technology at the time br br br See also br br br br br br Further reading br Rachel Plotnick Power Button A History of Pleasure Panic and the Politics of Pushing MIT Press ISBN reviewed in David Trotter Making doorbells ring London Review of Books November br br br External links br br Spring Return Button by S ndor Kabai The Wolfram Demonstrations Project
