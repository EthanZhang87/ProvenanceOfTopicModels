title: Flight instruments
id: 79537
Flight instruments are the instruments in the cockpit of an aircraft that provide the pilot with data about the flight situation of that aircraft such as altitude airspeed vertical speed heading and much more other crucial information in flight They improve safety by allowing the pilot to fly the aircraft in level flight and make turns without a reference outside the aircraft such as the horizon Visual flight rules VFR require an airspeed indicator an altimeter and a compass or other suitable magnetic direction indicator Instrument flight rules IFR additionally require a gyroscopic pitch bank artificial horizon direction directional gyro and rate of turn indicator plus a slip skid indicator adjustable altimeter and a clock Flight into instrument meteorological conditions IMC require radio navigation instruments for precise takeoffs and landings br The term is sometimes used loosely as a synonym for cockpit instruments as a whole in which context it can include engine instruments navigational and communication equipment Many modern aircraft have electronic flight instrument systems br Most regulated aircraft have these flight instruments as dictated by the US Code of Federal Regulations Title Part They are grouped according to pitot static system compass systems and gyroscopic instruments br br br Pitot static systems br Instruments which are pitot static systems use air pressure differences to determine speed and altitude br br br Altimeter br br The altimeter shows the aircraft s altitude above sea level by measuring the difference between the pressure in a stack of aneroid capsules inside the altimeter and the atmospheric pressure obtained through the static system The most common unit for altimeter calibration worldwide is hectopascals hPa except for North America and Japan where inches of mercury inHg are used The altimeter is adjustable for local barometric pressure which must be set correctly to obtain accurate altitude readings usually in either feet or meters As the aircraft ascends the capsules expand and the static pressure drops causing the altimeter to indicate a higher altitude The opposite effect occurs when descending With the advancement in aviation and increased altitude ceiling the altimeter dial had to be altered for use both at higher and lower altitudes Hence when the needles were indicating lower altitudes i e the first degree operation of the pointers was delineated by the appearance of a small window with oblique lines warning the pilot that he or she is nearer to the ground This modification was introduced in the early sixties after the recurrence of air accidents caused by the confusion in the pilot s mind At higher altitudes the window will disappear br br br Airspeed indicator br br The airspeed indicator shows the aircraft s speed relative to the surrounding air Knots is the currently most used unit but kilometers per hour is sometimes used instead The airspeed indicator works by measuring the ram air pressure in the aircraft s pitot tube relative to the ambient static pressure The indicated airspeed IAS must be corrected for nonstandard pressure and temperature in order to obtain the true airspeed TAS The instrument is color coded to indicate important airspeeds such as the stall speed never exceed airspeed or safe flap operation speeds to br br br Vertical speed indicator br br The VSI also sometimes called a variometer or rate of climb indicator senses changing air pressure and displays that information to the pilot as a rate of climb or descent in feet per minute meters per second or knots to br br br Compass systems br br br Magnetic compass br br The compass shows the aircraft s heading relative to magnetic north Errors include Variation or the difference between magnetic and true direction and Deviation caused by the electrical wiring in the aircraft which requires a Compass Correction Card Additionally the compass is subject to Dip Errors While reliable in steady level flight it can give confusing indications when turning climbing descending or accelerating due to the inclination of the Earth s magnetic field For this reason the heading indicator is also used for aircraft operation but periodically calibrated against the compass to br br br Gyroscopic systems br br br Attitude Indicator br br The attitude indicator also known as an artificial horizon shows the aircraft s relation to the horizon From this the pilot can tell whether the wings are level roll and if the aircraft nose is pointing above or below the horizon pitch to Attitude is always presented to users in the unit degrees The attitude indicator is a primary instrument for instrument flight and is also useful in conditions of poor visibility Pilots are trained to use other instruments in combination should this instrument or its power fail br br br Heading indicator br br The heading indicator also known as the directional gyro or DG displays the aircraft s heading in compass points and with respect to magnetic north when set with a compass Bearing friction causes drift errors from precession which must be periodically corrected by calibrating the instrument to the magnetic compass to In many advanced aircraft including almost all jet aircraft the heading indicator is replaced by a horizontal situation indicator HSI which provides the same heading information but also assists with navigation br br br Turn indicator br br These include the Turn and Slip Indicator and the Turn Coordinator which indicate rotation about the longitudinal axis They include an inclinometer to indicate if the aircraft is in Coordinated flight or in a Slip or Skid Additional marks indicate a Standard rate turn to The turn rate is most commonly expressed in either degrees per second deg s or minutes per turn min tr br br br Flight director systems br br br These include the Horizontal Situation Indicator HSI and Attitude Director Indicator ADI The HSI combines the magnetic compass with navigation signals and a Glide slope The navigation information comes from a VOR Localizer or GNSS The ADI is an Attitude Indicator with computer driven steering bars a task reliever during instrument flight to br br br Navigational systems br br br Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range VOR br br The VOR indicator instrument includes a Course deviation indicator CDI Omnibearing Selector OBS TO FROM indicator and Flags The CDI shows an aircraft s lateral position in relation to a selected radial track It is used for orientation tracking to or from a station and course interception to On the instrument the vertical needle indicates the lateral position of the selected track A horizontal needle allows the pilot to follow a glide slope when the instrument is used with an ILS br br br Nondirectional Radio Beacon NDB br br The Automatic direction finder ADF indicator instrument can be a fixed card movable card or a Radio magnetic indicator RMI An RMI is remotely coupled to a gyrocompass so that it automatically rotates the azimuth card to represent aircraft heading to While simple ADF displays may have only one needle a typical RMI has two coupled to different ADF receivers allowing for position fixing using one instrument br br br Layout br br Most aircraft are equipped with a standard set of flight instruments which give the pilot information about the aircraft s attitude airspeed and altitude br br br T arrangement br Most US aircraft built since the s have flight instruments arranged in a standardized pattern called the T arrangement The attitude indicator is in the top center airspeed to the left altimeter to the right and heading indicator under the attitude indicator The other two turn coordinator and vertical speed are usually found under the airspeed and altimeter but are given more latitude in placement The magnetic compass will be above the instrument panel often on the windscreen centerpost In newer aircraft with glass cockpit instruments the layout of the displays conform to the basic T arrangement br br br Early history br In Jimmy Doolittle became the first pilot to take off fly and land an airplane using instruments alone without a view outside the cockpit In the British Royal Air Force RAF chose a set of six essential flight instruments which would remain the standard panel used for flying in instrument meteorological conditions IMC for the next years They were br br altimeter feet br airspeed indicator knots br turn and bank indicator turn direction and coordination br vertical speed indicator feet per minute br artificial horizon attitude indication br directional gyro heading indicator degrees br This panel arrangement was incorporated into all RAF aircraft built to official specification from such as the Miles Master Hawker Hurricane Supermarine Spitfire and engined Avro Lancaster and Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers but not the earlier light single engined Tiger Moth trainer and minimized the type conversion difficulties associated with blind flying since a pilot trained on one aircraft could quickly become accustomed to any other if the instruments were identical br This basic six set also known as a six pack was also adopted by commercial aviation After the Second World War the arrangement was changed to top row airspeed artificial horizon altimeter bottom row turn and bank indicator heading indicator vertical speed br br br Further development br br In glass cockpits the flight instruments are shown on monitors Primary flight display is given a central place on the panel superseding the artificial horizon often with a horizontal situation indicator next to it or integrated with the PFD The indicated airspeed altimeter and vertical speed indicator are displayed as moving tapes with the indicated airspeed to the left of the horizon and the altimeter and the vertical speed to the right in the same layout as in most older style clock cockpits br
