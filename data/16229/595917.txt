Hang On Critically praised for its innovative graphics gameplay and motion cabinet Space Harrier is often ranked among Suzuki s best works It has made several crossover appearances in other Sega

of their Sega Ages series in br br br Gameplay br br Space Harrier is a fast paced rail shooter game played in a third person perspective behind the protagonist set in a surreal world composed of brightly colored landscapes adorned with checkerboard style grounds and stationary objects such as trees or stone pillars At the start of gameplay players are greeted with a voice sample speaking Welcome to the Fantasy Zone Get ready in addition to You re doing great with the successful completion of a stage The title player character simply named Harrier navigates a continuous series of eighteen distinct stages while utilizing an underarm jet propelled laser cannon that enables Harrier to simultaneously fly and shoot The objective is simply to destroy all enemies who range from prehistoric animals and Chinese dragons to flying robots airborne geometric objects and alien pods all while remaining in constant motion in order to dodge projectiles and immovable ground obstacles br Fifteen of the game s eighteen stages contain a boss at the end that must be killed in order to progress to the next level the final stage is a rush of seven past bosses encountered up to that point that appear individually and are identified by name at the bottom of the screen The two other levels are bonus stages that contain no enemies and where Harrier mounts an invincible catlike dragon named Uriah whom the player maneuvers to smash through landscape obstacles and collect bonus points After all lives are lost players have the option of continuing gameplay with the insertion of an extra coin As Space Harrier has no storyline after the completion of all stages only The End is displayed before the game returns to the title screen and attract mode regardless of how many of the player s extra lives remain br br br Development br br The game was first conceived by a Sega designer named Ida who wrote a page document proposing the idea of a three dimensional shooter that contained the word Harrier in the title The game would feature a player controlled fighter jet that shot missiles into realistic foregrounds a concept that was soon rejected due to the extensive work required to project the aircraft realistically from varying angles as it moved around the screen coupled with arcade machines memory limitations Sega developer Yu Suzuki therefore simplified the title character to a human which required less memory and realism to depict onscreen He then rewrote the entire original proposal changing the style of the game to a science fiction setting while keeping only the Harrier name His inspirations for the game s new design were the film The Neverending Story the anime series Space Cobra and the work of artist Roger Dean Certain enemies were modelled on characters from the anime series Gundam Suzuki included a nod to the original designer in the finished product with an enemy character called Ida a large moai like floating stone head because the designer had a really big head Three different arcade cabinets were produced an upright cabinet a sit down version with a fixed seat and its best known incarnation a deluxe cockpit style rolling cabinet that was mounted on a motorised base and moved depending on the direction in which players pushed the joystick Sega was hesitant to have the cabinets built due to high construction costs Suzuki who had proposed the cabinet designs offered his salary as compensation if the game failed but it would instead become a major hit in arcades br Suzuki had little involvement with the game after its initial release the Master System port was developed by Mutsuhiro Fujii and Yuji Naka and they added a final boss and an ending sequence which were included in subsequent ports The game was too successful for Sega to abandon the series and other Sega staff such as Naoto Ohshima character designer for Sonic the Hedgehog Kotaro Hayashida planner of Alex Kidd in Miracle World and Toshihiro Nagoshi director of Super Monkey Ball have had involvement in various sequels In a interview Suzuki said that he would have liked to create a new Space Harrier by himself and was pleased to see it ported to the Nintendo DS br br br Hardware br br Space Harrier was one of the first arcade releases to use bit graphics and scaled sprite Super Scaler technology that allowed pseudo D sprite scaling at high frame rates with the ability to display colors on screen Running on the Sega Space Harrier arcade system board previously used in Suzuki s arcade debut Hang On pseudo D sprite tile scaling is used for the stage backgrounds while the character graphics are sprite based Suzuki explained in that his designs were always D from the beginning All the calculations in the system were D even from Hang On I calculated the position scale and zoom rate in D and converted it backwards to D So I was always thinking in D br The game s soundtrack is by Hiroshi Kawaguchi who composed drafts on a Yamaha DX synthesizer and wrote out the final versions as sheet music as he had no access to a real music sequencer at the time A Zilog Z CPU powering both a Yamaha YM synthesis chip and Sega s PCM unit that was used for audio and digitized voice samples Space Harrier utilized an analog flight stick as its controller that allowed onscreen movement in all directions while the velocity of the character s flight is unchangeable The degree of push and acceleration varies depending on how far the stick is moved in a certain direction Two separate fire buttons are mounted on the joystick a trigger and on the control panel either one can be pressed repeatedly in order to shoot at enemies br The deluxe arcade cabinet is a cockpit style motion simulator cabinet that pitches and rolls during play for which it is referred to as a taikan body sensation arcade game in Japan It is often mistakenly referred to as a hydraulic cabinet as a pair of motorized linear actuators in the base tilted the cabinet in two axes br br br Ports br Space Harrier has been ported to numerous home computer systems and gaming consoles with most early translations unable to reproduce the original s advanced visual or audio capabilities while the controls were switched from analog to digital The first port was released in for the Master System Mark III in Japan developed by Sega AM R D The first two megabit cartridge produced for the console the game was given a plot in which Harrier saves the Land of the Dragons rather than the Fantasy Zone from destruction with a new ending sequence in contrast to the arcade version s simple The End message All eighteen stages were present but the backdrops therein were omitted leaving just a monochromatic horizon and the checkerboard floors An exclusive final boss was included in a powerful twin bodied fire dragon named Haya Oh who was named after then Sega president Hayao Nakayama The Game Gear port is based on its Master System counterpart but with redesigned enemies and only twelve stages while Rutubo Games produced a near duplicate of the arcade version in for the X add on for the Sega Genesis Both games featured box art by Marc Ericksen br Other releases were developed for non Sega gaming systems such as the TurboGrafx and the Famicom while Europe and North America saw bit home computer ports by Elite Systems for the ZX Spectrum Amstrad CPC and Commodore in and later in for the bit Amiga and Atari ST The Commodore received two conversions one originating in the UK and the other from the USA br M in collaboration with Sega CS ported Space Harrier to the handheld Nintendo DS console in complete with stereoscopic D and widescreen graphics a process that took eighteen months Sega CS producer Yosuke Okunari described the game s D conversion process as almost impossible When you take a character sprite that was originally in D and bring it into a D viewpoint you have to build the graphic from scratch During development M president Naoki Horii sought opinions from staff members regarding the gameplay of the arcade original They d say it was hard to tell whether objects were right in front of their character or not Once we had the game in D the same people came back and said OK now I get it I can play it now The port included a feature that allowed players to use the DS s gyroscope to simulate the experience of the original motorised cabinet by way of a tilting screen compounded by the optional activation of the sounds of button clicks and the cabinet s movement Horii recalled in a interview that he was intrigued by the possibility of crafting Space Harrier and past Sega arcade games for the DS using stereoscopic technology Both SEGA and M wanted to see what would happen if we added a little bit of spice to these titles in the form of modern gaming technology Would it enhance the entertainment factor I think the reception that the releases have had from critics highlights that these games are as relevant today as ever and that means we ve succeeded br br br Reception br br br Arcade br The game was commercially successful upon its initial arcade release Sega unveiled

its blinding speed and classic tunes In Retro Gamer editor Darran Jones described the game as difficult but a thing of beauty that even today possesses a striking elegance that urges you to return to it for just one more go That same year IGN s Levi Buchanan opined Even today Space Harrier is a sight to behold a hellzapoppin explosion of light color and imagination Eric Twice of Snackbar Games noted in It s easy to just see it as just a game in which you press the button and things die but Suzuki is a very conscious designer He has a very specific vision behind each of his games and nothing in them is ever left to chance In a Eurogamer retrospective on the series Rich Stanton observed The speed at which Space Harrier moves has rarely been matched It s not an easy thing to design a game around Many other games have fast parts or certain mechanics tied to speed and it s interesting to note how many take control away at this point Every time I play Space Harrier the speed blows me away one more time It is a monster br Eric Francisco of Inverse described the game s visuals in Imagine an acid trip through an s anime a Robert Jordan novel and early Silicon Valley binge coding sessions GamesRadar ranked the arcade original s bonus stage among the best bonus levels of all time in likening it to players piloting The Neverending Story s dragon character Falkor Kotaku named the Space
