id: 80785
A flight simulator is a device that artificially re creates aircraft flight and the environment in which it flies for pilot training design or other purposes It includes replicating the equations that govern how aircraft fly how they react to applications of flight controls the effects of other aircraft systems and how the aircraft reacts to external factors such as air density turbulence wind shear cloud precipitation etc Flight simulation is used for a variety of reasons including flight training mainly of pilots the design and development of the aircraft itself and research into aircraft characteristics and control handling qualities br The term flight simulator may carry slightly different meaning in general language and technical documents In past regulations it referred specifically to devices which can closely mimic the behavior of aircraft throughout various procedures and flight conditions In more recent definitions this has been named full flight simulator The more generic term flight simulation training device FSTD is used to refer to different kinds of flight training devices and that corresponds more closely to meaning of the phrase flight simulator in general English br br br History of flight simulation br In on the initiative of the French commanders Clolus and Laffont and Lieutenant Clavenad the first ground training aircraft for military aircraft were built The Tonneau Antoinette Antoinette barrel created by the Antoinette company seems to be the precursor of flight simulators br br br World War I br An area of training was for air gunnery handled by the pilot or a specialist air gunner Firing at a moving target requires aiming ahead of the target which involves the so called lead angle to allow for the time the bullets require to reach the vicinity of the target This is sometimes also called deflection shooting and requires skill and practice During World War I some ground based simulators were developed to teach this skill to new pilots br br br The s and s br br The best known early flight simulation device was the Link Trainer produced by Edwin Link in Binghamton New York United States which he started building in He later patented his design which was first available for sale in The Link Trainer was a basic metal frame flight simulator usually painted in its well known blue color Some of these early war era flight simulators still exist but it is becoming increasingly difficult to find working examples br The Link family firm in Binghamton manufactured player pianos and organs and Ed Link was therefore familiar with such components as leather bellows and reed switches He was also a pilot but dissatisfied with the amount of real flight training that was available he decided to build a ground based device to provide such training without the restrictions of weather and the availability of aircraft and flight instructors His design had a pneumatic motion platform driven by inflatable bellows which provided pitch and roll cues A vacuum motor similar to those used in player pianos rotated the platform providing yaw cues A generic replica cockpit with working instruments was mounted on the motion platform When the cockpit was covered pilots could practice flying by instruments in a safe environment The motion platform gave the pilot cues as to real angular motion in pitch nose up and down roll wing up or down and yaw nose left and right br Initially aviation flight schools showed little interest in the Link Trainer Link also demonstrated his trainer to the U S Army Air Force USAAF but with no result However the situation changed in when the Army Air Force was given a government contract to fly the postal mail This included having to fly in bad weather as well as good for which the USAAF had not previously carried out much training During the first weeks of the mail service nearly a dozen Army pilots were killed The Army Air Force hierarchy remembered Ed Link and his trainer Link flew in to meet them at Newark Field in New Jersey and they were impressed by his ability to arrive on a day with poor visibility due to practice on his training device The result was that the USAAF purchased six Link Trainers and this can be said to mark the start of the world flight simulation industry br br br World War II br br The principal pilot trainer used during World War II was the Link Trainer Some were produced to train new pilots from allied nations many in the US and Canada because many pilots were trained in those countries before returning to Europe or the Pacific to fly combat missions Almost all US Army Air Force pilots were trained in a Link Trainer br A different type of World War II trainer was used for navigating at night by the stars The Celestial Navigation Trainer of was m ft high and capable of accommodating the navigation team of a bomber crew It enabled sextants to be used for taking star shots from a projected display of the night sky br br br to the s br In United Airlines bought four flight simulators at a cost of million from Curtiss Wright that were similar to the earlier models with the addition of visuals sound and movement This was the first of today s modern flight simulators for commercial aircraft br A simulator for helicopters existed as the Jacobs Jaycopter as means of Cutting helicopter training cost The simulator was later sold as a funfair ride in the New York World s Fair br br br Today br br The simulator manufacturers are consolidating and integrate vertically as training offers double digit growth CAE forecast new airline pilots from to a day and first officers evolving to captains br The largest manufacturer is Canadian CAE Inc with a market share and billion annual revenues manufacturing training devices for years but moved into training in with multiple acquisitions Now CAE makes more from training than from producing the simulators br Crawley based L CTS entered the market in by acquiring Thales Training Simulation s manufacturing plant near Gatwick Airport where it assembles up to devices a year then UK CTC training school in Aerosim in Sanford Florida in and Portuguese academy G Air in October br With a market share equipment still accounts for more than half of L CTS turnover but that could soon be reversed as it educates commercial pilots each year of the entering the profession annually and aims for in a fragmented market br The third largest is TRU Simulation Training created in when parent Textron Aviation merged its simulators with Mechtronix OPINICUS and ProFlight focusing on simulators and developing the first full flight simulators for the MAX and the X br The fourth is FlightSafety International focused on general business and regional aircraft br Airbus and Boeing have invested in their own training centres aiming for higher margins than aircraft manufacturing like MRO competing with their suppliers CAE and L br In June there were commercial airline simulators in service up by over a year FFSs and FTDs br CAE supplied of this installed base L CTS and FlightSafety International while CAE s training centres are the largest operator with a share br North America has of the world s training devices Asia Pacific and Europe br Boeing types represent of all simulated aircraft followed by Airbus with then Embraer at Bombardier at and ATR at br br br Applications br br br Pilot training br br Most flight simulators are used primarily for flight training The simplest simulators are used to practice basic cockpit procedures such as processing emergency checklists and for cockpit familiarization They are also used for instrument flight training for which the outside view is less important Certain aircraft systems may or may not be simulated and the aerodynamic model is usually extremely generic if present at all Depending on the level of certification instruments that would have moving indicators in a real aircraft may be implemented with a display With more advanced displays cockpit representation and motion systems flight simulators can be used to credit different amount of flight hours towards a pilot license br Specific classes of simulators are also used for training other than obtaining initial license such as instrument rating revalidation or most commonly obtaining type rating for specific kind of aircraft br br br Other uses br During the aircraft design process flight simulators can be used instead of performing some flight tests Such engineering flight simulators can provide a fast way to find errors reducing both the risks and the cost of development Additionally this allows use of extra measurement equipment that might be too large or otherwise impractical to include during onboard a real aircraft Throughout different phases of the design process different engineering simulators with various level of complexity are used br Flight simulators may include training tasks for crew other than pilots Examples include gunners on a military aircraft or hoist operators Separate simulators have also been used for tasks related to flight like evacuating the aircraft in case of a crash in water With high complexity of many systems composing contemporary aircraft aircraft maintenance simulators are increasingly popular br br br Qualification and approval br br br Procedure br Before September when a manufacturer wished to have an ATD model approved a document that contains the specifications for the model line and that proves compliance with the appropriate regulations is submitted to the FAA Once this document called a Qualification Approval Guide QAG has been approved all future devices conforming to the QAG are automatically approved and individual evaluation is neither required nor available br The actual procedure accepted by all CAAs Civil Aviation Authorities around the world is to propose days prior qualification date days for CAAC a MQTG document Master Qualification Test Guide which is proper to a unique simulator device and will live along the device itself containing objective and functional and subjective tests to demonstrate the representativeness of the simulator compare to the airplane The results will be compared to Flight Test Data provided by aircraft OEMs or from test campaign ordered by simulator OEMs or also can be compared by POM Proof Of Match data provided by aircraft OEMs development simulators Some of the QTGs will be rerun during the year to prove during continuous qualification that the simulator is still

Level D Characteristic vibrations that can be felt in the cockpit realistic noise levels br br br Technology br br br Simulator structure br br Flight simulators are an example of a human in the loop system in which interaction with a human user is constantly happening From perspective of the device the inputs are primary flight controls instrument panel buttons and switches and the instructor s station if present Based on these the internal state is updated and equations of motion solved for the new time step The new state of the simulated aircraft is shown to the user through visual auditory motion and touch channels br To simulate cooperative tasks the simulator can be suited for multiple users as is the case with multi crew cooperation simulators Alternatively more simulators can be connected what is known as parallel simulation or distributed simulation As military aircraft often need to cooperate with other craft or military personnel wargames are a common use for distributed simulation Because of that numerous standards for distributed simulation including aircraft have been developed with military organisations Some examples include SIMNET DIS and HLA br br br Simulation models br br The central element of simulation model are the equations of motion for the aircraft As the aircraft moves through atmosphere it can exhibit both translational and rotational degrees of freedom To achieve perception of fluent movement these equations are solved or times per second The forces for motion are calculated from aerodynamical models which in turn depend on state of control surfaces driven by specific systems with their avionics etc As is the case with modelling depending on the required level of realism there are different levels of detail with some sub models omitted in simpler simulators br If a human user is part of the simulator which might not be the case for some engineering simulators there is a need to perform the simulation in real time Low refresh rates not only reduce realism of simulation but they have also been linked with increase in simulator sickness The regulations place a limit on maximum latency between pilot input and aircraft reaction Because of that tradeoffs are made to reach the required level of realism with a lower computational cost Flight simulators typically don t include full computational fluid dynamics models for forces or weather but use databases of prepared results from calculations and data acquired in real flights As an example instead of simulating flow over the wings lift coefficient may be defined in terms of motion parameters like angle of attack br While different models need to exchange data most often they can be separated into a modular architecture for better organisation and ease of development Typically gear model for ground handling would be separate input to the main equations of motion Each engine and avionics instrument is also a self contained system with well defined inputs and outputs br br br Instruments br br All classes of FSTD require some form of replicating the cockpit As they are the primary means of interaction between the pilot and the aircraft special importance is assigned to cockpit controls To achieve good transfer of skills there are very specific requirements in the flight simulator regulations that determine how closely they must match the real aircraft These requirements in case of full flight simulators are so detailed that it may be cost effective to use the real part certified to fly rather than manufacture a dedicated replica Lower classes of simulators may use springs to mimic forces felt when moving the controls When there is a need to better replicate the control forces or dynamic response many simulators are equipped with actively driven force feedback systems Vibration actuators may also be included either due to helicopter simulation requirements or for aircraft equipped with a stick shaker br Another form of tactile input from the pilot are instruments located on the panels in the cockpit As they are used to interact with various aircraft systems just that may be sufficient for some forms of procedure training Displaying them on a screen is sufficient for the most basic BITD simulators and amateur flight simulation however most classes of certified simulators need all buttons switches and other inputs to be operated in the same way as in the aircraft cockpit The necessity for a physical copy of a cockpit contributes to the cost of simulator construction and ties the hardware to a specific aircraft type Because of these reasons there is ongoing research on interactions in virtual reality however lack of tactile feedback negatively affects users performance when using this technology br br br Visual system br br Outside view from the aircraft is an important cue for flying the aircraft and is the primary means of navigation for visual flight rules operation One of the primary characteristics of a visual system is the field of view Depending on the simulator type it may be sufficient to provide only a view forward using a flat display However some types of craft e g fighter aircraft require a very large field of view preferably almost full sphere due to the manoeuvres that are performed during air combat Similarly since helicopters can perform hover flight in any direction some classes of helicopter flight simulators require even degrees of horizontal field of view br There are many parameters in visual system design For a narrow field of view a single display may be sufficient however typically multiple projectors are required This arrangement needs additional calibration both in terms of distortion from not projecting on a flat surface as well as brightness in regions with overlapping projections There are also different shapes of screens used including cylindrical spherical or ellipsoidal The image can be projected on the viewing side of the projection screen or alternatively back projection onto a translucent screen Because the screen is much closer than objects outside aircraft for simulators with multiple pilots there are special collimated displays that eliminate the parallax effect between the pilots point of view br br An alternative to large scale displays are virtual reality simulators using a head mounted display This approach allows for a complete field of view and makes the simulator size considerably smaller There are examples of use in research as well as certified FSTD br Contribution to modern Computer Graphics Visual simulation science applied from the visual systems developed in flight simulators were also an important precursor to three dimensional computer graphics and Computer Generated Imagery CGI systems today Namely because the object of flight simulation is to reproduce on the ground the behavior of an aircraft in flight Much of this reproduction had to do with believable visual synthesis that mimicked reality Combined with the need to pair virtual synthesis with military level training requirements graphics technologies applied in flight simulation were often years ahead of what would have been available in commercial products When CGI was first used to train pilots early systems proved effective for certain simple training missions but needed further development for sophisticated training tasks as terrain following and other tactical maneuvers Early CGI systems could depict only objects consisting of planar polygons Advances in algorithms and electronics in flight simulator visual systems and CGI in the s and s influenced many technologies still used in modern graphics Over time CGI systems were able to superimpose texture over the surfaces and transition from one level of image detail to the next one in a smooth manner Real time computer graphics visualization of virtual worlds makes some aspects of flight simulator visual systems very similar to game engines sharing some techniques like different levels of details or libraries like OpenGL Many computer graphics visionaries began their careers at Evans Sutherland and Link Flight Simulation Division of Singer Company two leading companies in flight simulation before today s modern computing era For example the Singer Link Digital Image Generator DIG created in was considered one of the worlds first CGI system br br br Motion system br br Initially the motion systems used separate axes of movement similar to a gimbal After the invention of Stewart platform simultaneous operation of all actuators became the preferred choice with some FFS regulations specifically requiring synergistic degrees of freedom motion In contrast to real aircraft the simulated motion system has a limited range in which it is able to move That especially affects the ability to simulate sustained accelerations and requires a separate model to approximate the cues to the human vestibular system within the given constraints br Motion system is a major contributor to overall simulator cost but assessments of skill transfer based on training on a simulator and leading to handling an actual aircraft are difficult to make particularly where motion cues are concerned Large samples of pilot opinion are required and many subjective opinions tend to be aired particularly by pilots not used to making objective assessments and responding to a structured test schedule For many years it was believed that DOF motion based simulation gave the pilot closer fidelity to flight control operations and aircraft responses to control inputs and external forces and gave a better training outcome for students than non motion based simulation This is described as handling fidelity which can be assessed by test flight standards such as the numerical Cooper Harper rating scale for handling qualities Recent scientific studies have shown that the use of technology such as vibration or dynamic seats within flight simulators can be equally effective in the delivery of training as large and expensive DOF FFS devices br br br Modern high end flight simulators br br br Vertical Motion Simulator VMS at NASA Ames br The largest flight simulator in the world is the Vertical Motion Simulator VMS at NASA Ames Research Center south of San Francisco This has a very large throw motion system with feet ft of vertical movement heave The heave system supports a horizontal beam on which are mounted ft rails allowing lateral movement of a simulator cab of feet A conventional degree of freedom hexapod platform is mounted on the ft beam and an interchangeable cabin is mounted on the platform This design permits quick switching of different aircraft cabins Simulations have ranged from blimps commercial and military aircraft to the Space Shuttle In the case of the Space Shuttle the large Vertical Motion Simulator was used to investigate a longitudinal pilot induced oscillation PIO that occurred on an early Shuttle flight just before landing After identification of the problem on the VMS it was used to try different longitudinal control algorithms and recommend the best for use
