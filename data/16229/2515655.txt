DisplayPort DP is a proprietary digital display interface developed by a consortium of PC and chip manufacturers and standardized by the Video Electronics Standards Association VESA It is primarily used to connect a video source to a display device such as a computer monitor It can also carry audio USB and other forms of data br DisplayPort was designed to replace VGA FPD Link and Digital Visual Interface DVI It is backward compatible with other interfaces such as DVI and High Definition Multimedia Interface HDMI through the use of either active or passive adapters br It is the first display interface to rely on packetized data transmission a form of digital communication found in technologies such as Ethernet USB and PCI Express It permits the use of internal and external display connections Unlike legacy standards that transmit a clock signal with each output its protocol is based on small data packets known as micro packets which can embed the clock signal in the data stream allowing higher resolution using fewer pins The use of data packets also makes it extensible meaning more features can be added over time without significant changes to the physical interface br DisplayPort is able to transmit audio and video simultaneously although each can be transmitted without the other The video signal path can range from six to sixteen bits per color channel and the audio path can have up to eight channels of bit kHz uncompressed PCM audio A bidirectional half duplex auxiliary channel carries device management and device control data for the Main Link such as VESA EDID MCCS and DPMS standards The interface is also capable of carrying bidirectional USB signals br The interface uses a differential signal that is not compatible with DVI or HDMI However dual mode DisplayPort ports are designed to transmit a single link DVI or HDMI protocol TMDS across the interface through the use of an external passive adapter enabling compatibility mode and converting the signal from to volts For analog VGA YPbPr and dual link DVI a powered active adapter is required for compatibility and does not rely on dual mode Active VGA adapters are powered directly by the DisplayPort connector while active dual link DVI adapters typically rely on an external power source such as USB br br br Versions br br br to br The first version was approved by VESA on May Version was ratified on April and version a on January br DisplayPort a allow a maximum bandwidth of Gbit s Gbit s data rate over a standard lane main link DisplayPort cables up to meters in length are required to support the full Gbit s bandwidth DisplayPort allows devices to implement alternative link layers such as fiber optic allowing a much longer reach between source and display without signal degradation although alternative implementations are not standardized It also includes HDCP in addition to DisplayPort Content Protection DPCP The DisplayPort a standard can be downloaded for free from the VESA website br br br br DisplayPort version was introduced on January The most significant improvement of this version is the doubling of the data rate to Gbit s in High Bit Rate HBR mode which allows increased resolutions higher refresh rates and greater color depth such as at Hz bpc RGB Other improvements include multiple independent video streams daisy chain connection with multiple monitors called Multi Stream Transport MST facilities for stereoscopic D increased AUX channel bandwidth from Mbit s to Mbit s more color spaces including xvYCC scRGB and Adobe RGB and Global Time Code GTC for sub s audio video synchronisation Also Apple Inc s Mini DisplayPort connector which is much smaller and designed for laptop computers and other small devices is compatible with the new standard br br br a br DisplayPort version a was released in January and may optionally include VESA s Adaptive Sync AMD s FreeSync uses the DisplayPort Adaptive Sync feature for operation FreeSync was first demonstrated at CES on a Toshiba Satellite laptop by making use of the Panel Self Refresh PSR feature from the Embedded DisplayPort standard and after a proposal from AMD VESA later adapted the Panel Self Refresh feature for use in standalone displays and added it as an optional feature of the main DisplayPort standard under the name Adaptive Sync in version a As it is an optional feature support for Adaptive Sync is not required for a display to be DisplayPort a compliant br br br br DisplayPort version was approved on September This standard increases overall transmission bandwidth to Gbit s with the new HBR mode featuring Gbit s per lane up from Gbit s with HBR in version for a total data throughput of Gbit s after factoring in b b encoding overhead This bandwidth is enough for a K UHD display at Hz with bit px RGB color a K display at Hz with bit px RGB color or an K UHD display at Hz with bit px RGB color Using Multi Stream Transport MST a DisplayPort port can drive two K UHD displays at Hz or up to four WQXGA displays at Hz with bit px RGB color The new standard includes mandatory Dual mode for DVI and HDMI adapters implementing the HDMI standard and HDCP content protection The Thunderbolt connection standard was originally to include DisplayPort capability but the final release ended up with only version for Intel Series Thunderbolt Controllers Later Intel Series Thunderbolt Controllers would come to support DisplayPort capability including HDR The VESA s Adaptive Sync feature in DisplayPort version remains an optional part of the specification br br br br DisplayPort version was published March No new transmission modes are defined so HBR Gbit s as introduced in version still remains as the highest available mode DisplayPort adds support for Display Stream Compression DSC Forward Error Correction HDR metadata defined in CTA including static and dynamic metadata and the Rec color space for HDMI interoperability and extends the maximum number of inline audio channels to br br br a br DisplayPort version a was published in April VESA made no official press release for this version It updated DisplayPort s Display Stream Compression implementation from DSC to a br br br br On June VESA formally released the DisplayPort standard VESA stated that version is the first major update to the DisplayPort standard since March and provides up to a improvement in data rate from to Gbit s compared to the previous version of DisplayPort a as well as new capabilities to address the future performance requirements of traditional displays These include beyond K resolutions higher refresh rates and high dynamic range HDR support at higher resolutions improved support for multiple display configurations as well as improved user experience with augmented virtual reality AR VR displays including support for K and beyond VR resolutions br According to a roadmap published by VESA in September a new version of DisplayPort was intended to be launched in early It would have improved the link rate from to Gbit s a increase This would have increased the total bandwidth from Gbit s to Gbit s However no new version was released in likely delayed to make further improvements after the HDMI Forum announced in January that their next standard HDMI would offer up to Gbit s of bandwidth According to a press release on January VESA is also currently engaged with its members in the development of the next DisplayPort standard generation with plans to increase the data rate enabled by DisplayPort by two fold and beyond VESA plans to publish this update within the next months At CES VESA announced that the new version would support K Hz without compression and was expected to be released in the first half of br br br DP configuration examples br With the increased bandwidth enabled by DisplayPort VESA offers a high degree of versatility and configurations for higher display resolutions and refresh rates In addition to the above mentioned K resolution at Hz with HDR support UHBR through USB C as DisplayPort Alt Mode enables a variety of high performance configurations br br Single display resolutions br One K

bpc bit px SDR RGB Y CBCR color uncompressed br One K display Hz and bpc bit px HDR RGB Y CBCR color uncompressed br br br br VESA announced version of the DisplayPort standard on October This version incorporates the new DP and DP cable certifications which test DisplayPort cables for proper operation at the UHBR Gbit s and UHBR Gbit s speeds introduced in version Additionally it revises some of the electrical requirements for DisplayPort devices in order to improve integration with USB In VESA s words br br DisplayPort has tightened its alignment with the USB Type C specification as well as the USB PHY specification to facilitate a common PHY servicing both DisplayPort and USB In addition DisplayPort has added a new DisplayPort bandwidth management feature to enable DisplayPort tunnelling to coexist with other I O data traffic more efficiently over the USB link br br br a br VESA announced version a of the DisplayPort standard on January This version replaces the DP cable certification with the new DP certification which tests DisplayPort cables for proper operation at the UHBR Gbit s speed introduced in version br br br Specifications br br br Main specifications br br br Main link br The DisplayPort main link is used for transmission of video and audio The main link consists of a number of unidirectional serial data channels which operate concurrently called lanes A standard DisplayPort connection has lanes though some applications of DisplayPort implement more such as the Thunderbolt interface which implements up to lanes of DisplayPort br In a standard DisplayPort connection each lane has a dedicated set of twisted pair wires and transmits data across it using differential signaling This is a self clocking system so no dedicated clock signal channel is necessary Unlike DVI and HDMI which vary their transmission speed to the exact rate required for the specific video format DisplayPort only operates at a few specific speeds any excess bits in the transmission are filled with stuffing symbols br In DisplayPort versions a the data is encoded using ANSI b b encoding prior to transmission With this scheme only out of every transmitted bits represent data the extra bits are used for DC balancing ensuring a roughly equal number of s and s As a result the rate at which data can be transmitted is only of the physical bitrate The transmission speeds are also sometimes expressed in terms of the Link Symbol Rate which is the rate at which these b b encoded symbols are transmitted i e the rate at which groups of bits are transmitted of which represent data The following transmission modes are defined in version a br br RBR Reduced Bit Rate Gbit s bandwidth per lane MHz link symbol rate br HBR High Bit Rate Gbit s bandwidth per lane MHz link symbol rate br HBR High Bit Rate Gbit s bandwidth per lane MHz link symbol rate introduced in DP br HBR High Bit Rate Gbit s bandwidth per lane MHz link symbol rate introduced in DP br DisplayPort uses b b encoding each group of transmitted bits represents bits of data This scheme has an efficiency of In addition a small amount of overhead is added for the link layer control packet and other miscellaneous operations resulting in an overall efficiency of The following transmission modes are added in DP br br UHBR Ultra High Bit Rate Gbit s bandwidth per lane br UHBR Ultra High Bit Rate Gbit s bandwidth per lane br UHBR Ultra High Bit Rate Gbit s bandwidth per lane br The total bandwidth of the main link in a standard lane connection is the aggregate of all lanes br br RBR Gbit s Gbit s bandwidth data rate of Gbit s or MB s with b b encoding br HBR Gbit s Gbit s bandwidth data rate of Gbit s or GB s br HBR Gbit s Gbit s bandwidth data rate of Gbit s or GB s br HBR Gbit s Gbit s bandwidth data rate of Gbit s or GB s br UHBR Gbit s Gbit s bandwidth data rate of Gbit s or GB s with b b encoding and FEC br UHBR Gbit s Gbit s bandwidth data rate of Gbit s or GB s br UHBR Gbit s Gbit s bandwidth data rate of Gbit s or GB s br The transmission mode used by the DisplayPort main link is negotiated by the source and sink device when a connection is made through a process called Link Training This process determines the maximum possible speed of the connection If the quality of the DisplayPort cable is insufficient to reliably handle HBR speeds for example the DisplayPort devices will detect this and switch down to a lower mode to maintain a stable connection The link can be re negotiated at any time if a loss of synchronization is detected br Audio data is transmitted across the main link during the video blanking intervals short pauses between each line and frame of video data br br br Auxiliary channel br The DisplayPort AUX channel is a half duplex bidirectional data channel used for miscellaneous additional data beyond video and audio such as EDID I C or CEC commands This bidirectional data channel is required since the video lane signals are unidirectional from source to display AUX signals are transmitted across a dedicated set of twisted pair wires DisplayPort specified Manchester encoding with a MBd signal rate Mbit s data rate Version of the DisplayPort standard introduced a second transmission mode called FAUX Fast AUX which operated at MBd with b b encoding Mbit s data rate but it was deprecated in version br br br Cables and connectors br br br Cables br br br Compatibility and feature support br All DisplayPort cables are compatible with all DisplayPort devices regardless of the version of each device or the cable certification level br All features of DisplayPort will function across any DisplayPort cable DisplayPort does not have multiple cable designs all DP cables have the same basic layout and wiring and will support any feature including audio daisy chaining G Sync FreeSync HDR and DSC br DisplayPort cables differ in their transmission speed support DisplayPort specifies seven different transmission modes RBR HBR HBR HBR UHBR UHBR and UHBR which support progressively higher bandwidths Not all DisplayPort cables are capable of all seven transmission modes VESA offers certifications for various levels of bandwidth These certifications are optional and not all DisplayPort cables are certified by VESA br Cables with limited transmission speed are still compatible with all DisplayPort devices but may place limits on the maximum resolution or refresh rate available br DisplayPort cables are not classified by version Although cables are commonly labeled with version numbers with HBR cables advertised as DisplayPort cables for example this notation is not permitted by VESA The use of version numbers with cables can falsely imply that a DisplayPort display requires a DisplayPort cable or that features introduced in version such as HDR or DSC will not function with older DP cables DisplayPort cables are classified only by their bandwidth certification level RBR HBR HBR HBR etc if they have been certified at all br br br Cable bandwidth and certifications br Not all DisplayPort cables are capable of functioning at the highest levels of bandwidth Cables may be submitted to VESA for an optional certification at various bandwidth levels VESA offers five levels of cable certification Standard DP K DP DP and DP These certify DisplayPort cables for proper operation at the following speeds br br In April VESA published an article stating that the DisplayPort cable certification did not have distinct tiers for HBR and HBR bandwidth and that any certified standard DisplayPort cable including those certified under DisplayPort would be able to handle the Gbit s bandwidth of HBR that was introduced with the DisplayPort standard The DisplayPort standard defines only a single specification for High Bit Rate cable assemblies which is used for both HBR and HBR speeds although the DP cable certification process is governed by the DisplayPort PHY Compliance Test Standard CTS and not the DisplayPort standard itself br The DP K certification was announced by VESA in January and certifies cables for proper operation at HBR speeds Gbit s per lane Gbit s total br In June with the release of version of the DisplayPort Standard VESA announced that the DP K certification was also sufficient for the new UHBR transmission mode No new certifications were announced for the UHBR and UHBR modes VESA is encouraging displays to use tethered cables for these speeds rather than releasing standalone cables onto the market br It should also be noted that the use of Display Stream Compression DSC introduced in DisplayPort greatly reduces the bandwidth requirements for the cable Formats which would normally be beyond the limits of DisplayPort such as K at Hz bpc RGB Y CBCR Gbit s data rate when uncompressed can only be implemented by using DSC This would reduce the physical bandwidth requirements by placing it well within the capabilities of an HBR rated cable br This exemplifies why DisplayPort cables are not classified by version although DSC was introduced in version this does not mean it needs a so called DP cable an HBR rated cable to function HBR cables are only required for applications which exceed HBR level bandwidth not simply any application involving DisplayPort If DSC is used to reduce the bandwidth requirements to HBR levels then an HBR rated cable will be sufficient br In version VESA introduced the DP and DP cable certification tiers which validate cables for UHBR and UHBR speeds respectively DisplayPort a introduced DP cable certification for UHBR speed br br br Cable length br The DisplayPort standard does not specify any maximum length for cables though the DisplayPort standard does set a minimum requirement that all cables up to meters in length must support HBR speeds Gbit s and all cables of any length must support RBR speeds Gbit s Cables longer than meters may or may not support HBR HBR speeds and cables of any length may or may not support HBR speeds or above br br br Connectors and pin configuration br br DisplayPort cables and ports may have either a full size connector or a mini connector These connectors differ only in physical shape the capabilities of DisplayPort are the same regardless of which connector is used Using a Mini DisplayPort connector does not affect performance or feature support of the connection br br br Full size DisplayPort connector br The standard DisplayPort connector now referred to as a full size connector to distinguish it from the mini connector was the sole connector type introduced in DisplayPort It is a pin single orientation connector with a friction lock and an optional mechanical latch The standard DisplayPort receptacle has dimensions of mm width mm height mm depth p br The standard DisplayPort connector pin allocation is as follows br br pins for the main link the main link consists of four shielded twisted pairs Each pair requires pins one for each of the two wires and a third for the shield p pins br additional ground pins pins and br pins for the auxiliary channel the auxiliary channel uses another pin shielded twisted pair pins br pin for HPD hot plug detection pin br pins for power V power and return line pins and br br br Mini DisplayPort connector br br The Mini DisplayPort connector was developed by Apple for use in their computer products It was first announced in October for use in the new MacBooks and Cinema Display In VESA adopted it as an official standard and in the specification was merged into the main DisplayPort standard with the release of DisplayPort Apple freely licenses the specification to VESA br The Mini DisplayPort mDP connector is a pin single orientation connector with a friction lock Unlike the full size connector it does not have an option for a mechanical latch The mDP receptacle has dimensions of mm width mm height mm depth pp The mDP pin assignments are the same as the full size DisplayPort connector br br br DP PWR pin br Pin on the DisplayPort connector called DP PWR provides V DC power at up to mA minimum power delivery of W This power is available from all DisplayPort receptacles on both source and display devices DP PWR is intended to provide power for adapters amplified cables and similar devices so that a separate power cable is not necessary br Standard DisplayPort cable connections do not use the DP PWR pin Connecting the DP PWR pins of two devices directly together through a cable can create a short circuit which can potentially damage devices since the DP PWR pins on two devices are unlikely to have exactly the same voltage especially with a tolerance For this reason the DisplayPort and later standards specify that passive DisplayPort to DisplayPort cables must leave pin unconnected br However in VESA announced that after investigating reports of malfunctioning DisplayPort devices it had discovered that a large number of non certified vendors were manufacturing their DisplayPort cables with the DP PWR pin connected br br Recently VESA has experienced quite a few complaints regarding troublesome DisplayPort operation that ended up being caused by improperly made DisplayPort cables These bad DisplayPort cables are generally limited to non DisplayPort certified cables or off brand cables To further investigate this trend in the DisplayPort cable market VESA purchased a number of non certified off brand cables and found that an alarmingly high number of these were configured improperly and would likely not support all system configurations None of these cables would have passed the DisplayPort certification test moreover some of these cables could potentially damage a PC laptop or monitor br br The stipulation that the DP PWR wire be omitted from standard DisplayPort cables was not present in the DisplayPort standard However DisplayPort products and cables did not begin to appear on the market until long after version had been replaced by version The DisplayPort standard was never implemented in commercial products br br br Resolution and refresh frequency limits br The tables below describe the refresh frequencies that can be achieved with each transmission mode In general maximum refresh frequency is determined by the transmission mode RBR HBR HBR HBR UHBR UHBR or UHBR These transmission modes were introduced to the DisplayPort standard as follows br br RBR and HBR were defined in the initial release of the DisplayPort standard version br HBR was introduced in version br HBR was introduced in version br UHBR UHBR and UHBR were introduced in version br However transmission mode support is not necessarily dictated by a device s claimed DisplayPort version number For example older versions of the DisplayPort Marketing Guidelines allowed a device to be labeled as DisplayPort if it supported the MST feature even if it didn t support the HBR transmission mode Newer versions of the guidelines have removed this clause and currently as of the June revision there are no guidelines on the usage of DisplayPort version numbers in products DisplayPort version numbers are therefore not a reliable indication of what transmission speeds a device can support br In addition individual devices may have their own arbitrary limitations beyond transmission speed For example NVIDIA Kepler GK GPUs such as the GeForce GTX and support DisplayPort with the HBR transmission mode but are limited to Mpx s only of the maximum possible with HBR Consequently certain devices may have limitations that differ from those listed in the following tables br To support a particular format the source and display devices must both support the required transmission mode and the DisplayPort cable must also be capable of handling the required bandwidth of that transmission mode See Cables and connectors br br br Refresh frequency limits for common resolutions br The maximum limits for the RBR and HBR modes are calculated using standard data rate calculations For UHBR modes the limits are based on the data efficiency calculations provided by the DisplayPort standard All calculations assume uncompressed RGB video with CVT RB v timing Maximum limits may differ if compression i e DSC or Y CBCR or chroma subsampling are used br Display manufacturers may also use non standard blanking intervals rather than CVT RB v to achieve even higher frequencies when bandwidth is a constraint The refresh frequencies in the below table do not represent the absolute maximum limit of each interface but rather an estimate based on a modern standardized timing formula The minimum blanking intervals and therefore the exact maximum frequency that can be achieved will depend on the display and how many secondary data packets it requires and therefore will differ from model to model br br br Refresh frequency limits for standard video br Color depth of bpc bit px or million colors is assumed for all formats in these tables This is the standard color depth used on most computer displays Note that some operating systems refer to this as bit color depth this is the same as bit color depth The extra bits are for alpha channel information which is only present in software At the transmission stage this information has already been incorporated into the primary color channels so the actual video data transmitted across the cable only contains bits per pixel br br br Refresh frequency limits for HDR video br Color depth of bpc bit px or billion colors is assumed for all formats in these tables This color depth is a requirement for various common HDR standards such as HDR It requires more bandwidth than standard bpc video br HDR extensions were defined in version of the DisplayPort standard Some displays support these HDR extensions but may only implement HBR transmission mode if the extra bandwidth of HBR is unnecessary for example on K Hz HDR displays Since there is no definition of what constitutes a DisplayPort device some manufacturers may choose to label these as DP devices despite their support for DP HDR extensions As a result DisplayPort version numbers should not be used as an indicator of HDR support br br br Features br br br DisplayPort Dual Mode DP br br DisplayPort Dual Mode DP also called Dual Mode DisplayPort is a standard which allows DisplayPort sources to use simple passive adapters to connect to HDMI or DVI displays Dual mode is an optional feature so not all DisplayPort sources necessarily support DVI HDMI passive adapters though in practice nearly all devices do Officially the DP logo should be used to indicate a DP port that supports dual mode but most modern devices do not use the logo br Devices which implement dual mode will detect that a DVI or HDMI adapter is attached and send DVI HDMI TMDS signals instead of DisplayPort signals The original DisplayPort Dual Mode standard version used in DisplayPort devices only supported TMDS clock speeds of up to MHz Gbit s bandwidth This is equivalent to HDMI and is sufficient for up to at Hz br In VESA released the Dual Mode standard which added support for up to a MHz TMDS clock Gbit s bandwidth and is used in newer DisplayPort devices This is slightly less than the MHz maximum of HDMI and is sufficient for up to at Hz at Hz or at Hz Older adapters which were only capable of the MHz speed were retroactively termed Type adapters with the new MHz adapters being called Type br br br Dual mode limitations br br Limited adapter speed Although the pinout and digital signal values transmitted by the DP port are identical to a native DVI HDMI TMDS source the transmission lines on a DisplayPort source are AC coupled a series capacitor isolates the line from passing DC voltages while DVI and HDMI TMDS are DC coupled As a result dual mode adapters must contain a level shifting circuit which couples the signal lines to a DC source The presence of this circuit places a limit on how quickly the adapter can operate and therefore newer adapters are required for each higher speed added to the standard br Unidirectional Although the dual mode standard specifies a method for DisplayPort sources to output DVI HDMI signals using simple passive adapters there is no counterpart standard to give DisplayPort displays the ability to receive DVI HDMI input signals through passive adapters As a result DisplayPort displays can only receive native DisplayPort signals any DVI or HDMI input signals must be converted to the DisplayPort format with an active conversion device DVI and HDMI sources cannot be connected to DisplayPort displays using passive adapters br Single link DVI only Since DisplayPort dual mode operates by using the pins of the DisplayPort connector to send DVI HDMI signals the pin DisplayPort connector can only produce a single link DVI signal which uses pins A dual link DVI signal uses pins and is therefore impossible to transmit natively from a DisplayPort connector through a passive adapter Dual link DVI signals can only be produced by converting from native DisplayPort output signals with an active conversion device br Unavailable on USB C The DisplayPort Alternate Mode specification for sending DisplayPort signals over a USB C cable does not include support for the dual mode protocol As a result DP to DVI and DP to HDMI passive adapters do not function when chained from a USB C to DP adapter br br br Multi Stream Transport MST br Multi Stream Transport is a feature first introduced in the DisplayPort standard It allows multiple independent displays to be driven from a single DP port on the source devices by multiplexing several video streams into a single stream and sending it to a branch device which demultiplexes the signal into the original streams Branch devices are commonly found in the form of an MST hub which plugs into a single DP input port and provides multiple outputs but it can also be implemented on a display internally to provide a DP output port for daisy chaining effectively embedding a port MST hub inside the display Fig Theoretically up to displays can be supported but the combined data rate requirements of all the displays cannot exceed the limits of a single DP port Gbit s for a DP port or Gbit s for a DP port In addition the maximum number of links between the source and any device i e the maximum length of a daisy chain is and the maximum number of physical output ports on each branch device such as a hub is With the release of MST standard single display operation has been retroactively named SST mode Single Stream Transport br Daisy chaining is a feature that must be specifically supported by each intermediary display not all DisplayPort devices support it Daisy chaining requires a dedicated DisplayPort output port on the display Standard DisplayPort input ports found on most displays cannot be used as a daisy chain output Only the last display in the daisy chain does not need to support the feature specifically or have a DP output port DisplayPort displays can also be connected to MST hubs and can be part of a DisplayPort daisy chain if it is the last display in the chain br The host system s software also needs to support MST for hubs or daisy chains to work While Microsoft Windows environments have full support for it Apple operating systems currently do not support MST hubs or DisplayPort daisy chaining as of macOS Catalina br DisplayPort to DVI and DisplayPort to HDMI adapters cables may or may not function from an MST output port support for this depends on the specific device br MST is supported by USB Type C DisplayPort Alternate Mode so standard DisplayPort daisy chains and MST hubs do function from Type C sources with a simple Type C to DisplayPort adapter br br br High dynamic range HDR br br Support for HDR video was introduced in DisplayPort It implements the CTA standard for transport of static HDR metadata in EDID br br br Content protection br DisplayPort includes optional DPCP DisplayPort Content Protection from Philips which uses bit AES encryption It also features full authentication and session key establishment Each encryption session is independent and it has an independent revocation system This portion of the standard is licensed separately It also adds the ability to verify the proximity of the receiver and transmitter a technique intended to ensure users are not bypassing the content protection system to send data out to distant unauthorized users br DisplayPort added optional implementation of industry standard bit HDCP High bandwidth Digital Content Protection revision which requires separate licensing from the Digital Content Protection LLC br DisplayPort added support for HDCP which is also used by HDMI br br br Cost br VESA the creators of the DisplayPort standard state that the standard is royalty free to implement However in March MPEG LA issued a press release stating that a royalty rate of per unit applies to DisplayPort products manufactured or sold in countries that are covered by one or more of the patents in the MPEG LA license pool which includes patents from Hitachi Maxell Philips Lattice Semiconductor Rambus and Sony In response VESA updated their DisplayPort FAQ page with the following statement br br MPEG LA is making claims that DisplayPort implementation requires a license and a royalty payment It is important to note that these are only CLAIMS Whether these CLAIMS are relevant will likely be decided in a US court br br As of August VESA s official FAQ no longer contains a statement mentioning the MPEG LA royalty fees br While VESA does not charge any per device royalty fees VESA requires membership for access to said standards The minimum cost is presently or depending on Annual Corporate Sales Revenue annually br br br Advantages over DVI VGA and FPD Link br br In December several computer vendors and display makers including Intel AMD Dell Lenovo Samsung and LG announced they would begin phasing out FPD Link VGA and DVI I over the next few years replacing them with DisplayPort and HDMI br DisplayPort has several advantages over VGA DVI and FPD Link br br Standard available to all VESA members with an extensible standard to help broad adoption br Fewer lanes with embedded self clock

CEC etc br Self latching connector br br br Comparison with HDMI br Although DisplayPort has much of the same functionality as HDMI it is a complementary connection used in different scenarios A dual mode DisplayPort port can emit an HDMI signal via a passive adapter br br As of HDMI Licensing LLC charged an annual fee of US to each high volume manufacturer and a per unit royalty rate of US to US DisplayPort is royalty free but implementers thereof are not prevented from charging royalty or otherwise for that implementation br DisplayPort has more bandwidth at Gbit s Gbit s with overhead removed as opposed to HDMI s Gbit s Gbit s with overhead removed br DisplayPort raises that to Gbit s Gbit s with overhead removed and HDMI raises that up to Gbit s Gbit s with overhead removed adding an additional TMDS link in place of clock lane DisplayPort also has the ability to share this bandwidth with multiple streams of audio and video to separate devices br DisplayPort has historically had higher bandwidth than the HDMI standard available at the same time The only exception is from HDMI having higher transmission bandwidth Gbit s than DisplayPort Gbit s DisplayPort retook transmission bandwidth superiority Gbit s br DisplayPort in native mode lacks some HDMI features such as Consumer Electronics Control CEC commands The CEC bus allows linking multiple sources with a single display and controlling any of these devices from any remote DisplayPort added the possibility of transmitting CEC commands over the AUX channel From its very first version HDMI features CEC to support connecting multiple sources to a single display as is typical for a TV screen The other way round Multi Stream Transport allows connecting multiple displays to a single computer source This reflects the facts that HDMI originated from consumer electronics companies whereas DisplayPort is owned by VESA which started as an organization for computer standards br HDMI uses unique Vendor Specific Block structure which allows for features such as additional color spaces However these features can be defined by CEA EDID extensions br Both HDMI and DisplayPort have published specification for transmitting their signal over the USB C connector For more details see USB C Alternate Mode partner specifications br br br Market share br Figures from IDC show that of commercial desktops and of commercial notebooks released in featured DisplayPort The main factor behind this was the phase out of VGA and that both Intel and AMD planned to stop building products with FPD Link by Nearly of LCD monitors sold in August in the US UK Germany Japan and China were equipped with HDMI DisplayPort technology up on the year according to Digitimes Research IHS Markit an analytics firm forecast that DisplayPort would surpass HDMI in br br br Companion standards br br br Mini DisplayPort br br Mini DisplayPort mDP is a standard announced by Apple in the fourth quarter of Shortly after announcing Mini DisplayPort Apple announced that it would license the connector technology with no fee The following year in early VESA announced that Mini DisplayPort would be included in the upcoming DisplayPort specification br On February Apple and Intel announced Thunderbolt a successor to Mini DisplayPort which adds support for PCI Express data connections while maintaining backwards compatibility with Mini DisplayPort based peripherals br br br Micro DisplayPort br Micro DisplayPort would have targeted systems that need ultra compact connectors such as phones tablets and ultra portable notebook computers This standard would have been physically smaller than the currently available Mini DisplayPort connectors The standard was expected to be released by Q br br br DDM br Direct Drive Monitor DDM standard was approved in December It allows for controller less monitors where the display panel is directly driven by the DisplayPort signal although the available resolutions and color depth are limited to two lane operation br br br Display Stream Compression br br Display Stream Compression DSC is a VESA developed video compression algorithm designed to enable increased display resolutions and frame rates over existing physical interfaces and make devices smaller and lighter with longer battery life br br br eDP br Embedded DisplayPort eDP is a display panel interface standard for portable and embedded devices It defines the signaling interface between graphics cards and integrated displays The various revisions of eDP are based on existing DisplayPort standards However version numbers between the two standards are not interchangeable For instance eDP version is based on DisplayPort while eDP version a is based on DisplayPort Embedded DisplayPort has displaced LVDS as the predominant panel interface in modern laptops and modern smartphones br eDP was adopted in December It included advanced power saving features such as seamless refresh rate switching br Version was approved in October followed by version a in November br Version was approved in May and includes DisplayPort HBR data rates Hz sequential color monitors and a new display panel control protocol that works through the AUX channel br Version was published in February it includes a new optional Panel Self Refresh PSR feature developed to save system power and further extend battery life in portable PC systems PSR mode allows the GPU to enter a power saving state in between frame updates by including framebuffer memory in the display panel controller br Version was released in February it reduces power consumption through partial frame updates in PSR mode regional backlight control lower interface voltages and additional link rates the auxiliary channel supports multi touch panel data to accommodate different form factors Version a was published in February the underlying DisplayPort version was updated to in order to support HBR data rates Display Stream Compression Segmented Panel Displays and partial updates for Panel Self Refresh Version b was published in October its protocol refinements and clarifications are intended to enable adoption of eDP b in devices by mid Version was published in October adds new features and protocols including enhanced support for Adaptive Sync that provide additional power savings and improved gaming and media playback performance br br br iDP br Internal DisplayPort iDP is a standard that defines an internal link between a digital TV system on a chip controller and the display panel s timing controller Version was approved in April It aims to replace currently used internal FPD Link lanes with a DisplayPort connection iDP features a unique physical interface and protocols which are not directly compatible with DisplayPort and are not applicable to external connection however they enable very high resolution and refresh rates while providing simplicity and extensibility iDP features a non variable GHz clock and is nominally rated at Gbit s per lane with up to sixteen lanes in a bank resulting in a six fold decrease in wiring requirements over FPD Link for a p signal other data rates are also possible iDP was built with simplicity in mind so doesn t have an AUX channel content protection or multiple streams it does however have frame sequential and line interleaved stereo D br br br PDMI br Portable Digital Media Interface PDMI is an interconnection between docking stations display devices and portable media players which includes lane DisplayPort v a connection It has been ratified in February as ANSI CEA A br br br wDP br Wireless DisplayPort wDP enables the bandwidth and feature set of DisplayPort for cable free applications operating in the GHz radio band It was announced in November by WiGig Alliance and VESA as a cooperative effort br br br SlimPort br br SlimPort a brand of Analogix products complies with Mobility DisplayPort also known as MyDP which is an industry standard for a mobile audio video Interface providing connectivity from mobile devices to external displays and HDTVs SlimPort implements the transmission of video up to K UltraHD and up to eight channels of audio over the micro USB connector to an external converter accessory or display device SlimPort products support seamless connectivity to DisplayPort HDMI and VGA displays The MyDP standard was released in June and the first product to use SlimPort was Google s Nexus smartphone Some LG smartphones in LG G series also adopted SlimPort br SlimPort is an alternative to Mobile High Definition Link MHL br br br DisplayID br br DisplayID is designed to replace the E EDID standard DisplayID features variable length structures which encompass all existing EDID extensions as well as new extensions for D displays and embedded displays br The latest version announced on September adds enhanced support for tiled display topologies it allows better identification of multiple video streams and reports bezel size and locations As of December many current K displays use a tiled topology but lack a standard way to report to the video source which tile is left and which is right These early K displays for manufacturing reasons typically use two panels laminated together and are currently generally treated as multiple monitor setups DisplayID also allows K display discovery and has applications in stereo D where multiple video streams are used br br br DockPort br br DockPort formerly known as Lightning Bolt is an extension to DisplayPort to include USB data as well as power for charging portable devices from attached external displays Originally developed by AMD and Texas Instruments it has been announced as a VESA specification in br br br USB C br br On September VESA published the DisplayPort Alternate Mode on USB Type C Connector Standard a specification on how to send DisplayPort signals over the newly released USB C connector One two or all four of the differential pairs that USB uses for the SuperSpeed bus can be configured dynamically to be used for DisplayPort lanes In the first two cases the connector still can carry a full SuperSpeed signal in the latter case at least a non SuperSpeed signal is available The DisplayPort AUX channel is also supported over the two sideband signals over the same connection furthermore USB Power Delivery according to the newly expanded USB PD specification is possible at the same time This makes the Type C connector a strict superset of the use cases envisioned for DockPort SlimPort and Mini and Micro DisplayPort br br br VirtualLink br br VirtualLink is a proposal that allows the power video and data required to drive virtual reality headsets to be delivered over a single USB C cable br br br Products br br Since DisplayPort s introduction in it has gained popularity within the computer industry and is featured on many graphics cards displays and notebook computers Dell was the first company to introduce a consumer product with a DisplayPort connector the Dell UltraSharp WFP which was released in January Soon after AMD and Nvidia released products to support the technology AMD included support in the Radeon HD series of graphics cards and Nvidia first introduced support in the GeForce series starting with the GeForce GT br br Later in Apple introduced several products featuring a Mini DisplayPort The new connector proprietary at the time eventually became part of the DisplayPort standard however Apple reserves the right to void the license should the licensee commence an action for patent infringement against Apple In AMD followed suit with their Radeon HD series of graphics cards which featured the Mini DisplayPort on the Eyefinity versions in the series br Nvidia launched a graphics card with Mini DisplayPort outputs on November called the NVS which was intended for digital signage br br Nvidia revealed the GeForce GTX the world s first graphics card with DisplayPort support on May AMD followed with the Radeon RX to support DisplayPort on June The Radeon RX series will support DisplayPort HBR and HDR dropping the DVI connector s in the reference board design br In February VESA and Qualcomm announced that DisplayPort Alt Mode video transport will be integrated into the Snapdragon mobile chipset which powers smartphones VR AR head mounted displays IP cameras tablets and mobile PCs br br br Support for DisplayPort Alternate Mode over USB C br br Currently DisplayPort is the most widely implemented alternate mode and is used to provide video output on devices that do not have standard size DisplayPort or HDMI ports such as smartphones tablets and laptops A USB C multiport adapter converts the device s native video stream to DisplayPort HDMI VGA allowing it to be displayed on an external display such as a television set or computer monitor br Examples of devices that support DisplayPort Alternate Mode over USB C include MacBook Chromebook Pixel Surface Book Samsung Galaxy Tab S iPad Pro rd generation iPhone Pro HTC U Ultra U U Huawei Mate LG V V V V OnePlus and newer ROG Phone Samsung Galaxy S and newer Nintendo Switch Sony Xperia etc br br br Participating companies br The following companies have participated in preparing the drafts of DisplayPort eDP iDP DDM or DSC standards br br The following
