The Henschel Hs was a World War II German radio guided glide bomb It is the first operational anti shipping missile first used unsuccessfully on August and then with increasing success over the next year ultimately damaging or sinking at least ships Allied efforts to jam the radio control link were increasingly successful despite German efforts to counter them The weapon remained in use through when it was also used as an air to ground weapon to attack bridges to prevent the Allied breakout after D Day but proved almost useless in this role br br br Development br br The Hs project was started in based on the Gustav Schwartz Propellerwerke pure glide bomb that was designed in The Schwartz design did not have a terminal guidance system instead it used an autopilot to maintain a straight course It was intended to be launched from a bomber at sufficient distance to keep the aircraft out of range of anti aircraft fire A Henschel team under Dr Herbert Wagner developed it the following year by adding a Walter HWK rocket engine underneath providing kgf lbf kN thrust for ten seconds This allowed the bomb to be used from a lower altitude and at an increased range Some examples used the BMW of kgf lbf kN thrust br The first flight attempts took place between May and September with unpowered drops from Heinkel He medium bombers used as carrier aircraft the first Walter rocket motor powered tests had been conducted by the end of br The weapon consisted of a modified standard kilogram Sprengbombe Cylindrisch class SC general purpose bomb with an added Kopfring on the nose for maritime use to help ensure a relatively perpendicular axis of impact with a thin metal shell and a high explosive charge inside equipped with a rocket engine beneath the bomb a pair of aileron fitted wings and the receiving FuG component of the Kehl Stra burg MCLOS guidance and control system shared with the contemporary Fritz X gravity propulsion pioneering PGM armor piercing bomb The elevator was operated with an electrically powered jackscrew as the only proportional control while the ailerons were operated with solenoids Remote flight control was provided through the Kehl Stra burg link with the Hs s control setup having no movable rudder on the ventral tailfin The monopropellant booster rocket provided for only a short burst of speed making range dependent on the launch altitude br The Hs was intended to destroy unarmoured ships unlike the unpowered armour piercing Fritz X which used the same Kehl Stra burg system Five coloured flares were attached to the rear of the weapon to make it visible at a distance to the operator During night operations flashing lights instead of flares were used br After the missile was launched the bomber flew parallel to the target so as to be able to maintain a slant line of sight br br br Electronic countermeasures br The Allies put considerable effort into developing devices which jammed the radio link between Kehl transmitter and Stra burg receiver Jammers aboard U S Navy destroyer escorts were ineffective at first as the frequencies selected for jamming were incorrect On balance the probability that a Hs launched and seen as responding to operator guidance would actually strike a target or achieve a damage inflicting near miss was about the same at the Battle of Anzio as it was during Operation Avalanche br As attacks were taking place at Anzio the United Kingdom began to deploy its Type transmitter which employed a different approach to interfering with the FuG radio link by jamming the Stra burg receiver s intermediate frequency section which operated at a MHz frequency and appears to have been quite successful especially because the operator did not have to attempt to find which of the eighteen selected Kehl Stra burg command frequencies were in use and then manually tune the jamming transmitter to one of them The Type defeated the receiver no matter which radio frequency had been selected br Following several intelligence coups including a capture of an intact Hs at Anzio and recovery of important components of the Kehl transmitter from a crashed Heinkel He on Corsica the Allies were able to develop far more effective countermeasures in time for the invasion of Normandy and Operation Dragoon These included AIL s Type MAS jammer which employed sophisticated signals to defeat the Kehl transmission and to take over command of the Hs steering it into the sea via a sequence of right turn commands In contrast to the experience at Anzio the jammers seemed to have had a major impact on operations after April with significant degradation observed in the probability that a Hs missile could achieve a hit or damaging near miss br To improve control of the weapon and reduce vulnerability of the launching aircraft wire guided Hs B and television guided Hs D variants were planned neither was operational before the war ended There was also a tailless delta winged Hs F In addition there was a Hs H air to air model Over were built from onwards The closest Allied weapon system in function and purpose to the Hs series was the US Navy s Bat unpowered autonomously radar guided unit br br br Later developments br The Hs also served as the basis for a number of developments none completed These included the Hs designed specifically to penetrate the water and strike a ship below the waterline with a long conical shaped forebody and a pair of the Hs A s standard Walter HWK booster engines at the wing roots the Hs with longer fuselage larger warhead and Hs wings the Hs with Hs afterparts Hs warhead and Hs Kehl Stra urg MCLOS control systems br br br Operational history br br On August an Hs was used in the first successful attack by a guided missile striking the sloop HMS Bideford however as the warhead did not detonate the damage was minimal On August the sinking of the British sloop HMS Egret by a squadron of Dornier Do carrying Hs s led to anti U boat patrols in the Bay of Biscay being temporarily suspended On November an Hs sank the troop transport HMT Rohna killing over personnel br Other ships sunk or damaged by the Hs include br br

Spartan sunk off Anzio during Operation Shingle January br USS Tillman slightly damaged November while escorting Mediterranean convoy KMF A although more likely a torpedo was the cause br Although designed for use against ships it was also used in Normandy in early August to attack bridges over the S e and S lune rivers One bridge was slightly damaged for the loss of six of the attacking aircraft The attack on August at Pontaubault performed by Do of III KG was the first usage of a standoff missile against a land target On April Hs A bombs were used once more against bridges on the Oder by Do bombers of KG br The Hs was carried on Heinkel He Heinkel He Focke Wulf Fw and Dornier Do planes However only the He of I and II Gruppen KG certain variants of the Fw of III KG and the Do of II KG and III KG used the Hs operationally in combat br br br Variants br br Hs A the first production version br Hs A main production version br Hs A steel construction rather than aluminium br Hs A v A with shortened wings br Hs B wire guided to prevent jamming although jamming would eventually make the Hs ineffective it was never put into production br Hs C production version designated Hs A had the detachable warhead of the Hs br Hs D was television guided with a large Yagi antenna transmitting back to the launch aircraft Seventy were built and tested but it was never used operationally br Hs E an experimental model to test spoiler controls as a replacement to ailerons never put into series production This modification was put into the final version of the Hs A but by then the Luftwaffe had no aircraft available for anti shipping operations and it was never deployed br Hs F a tailless delta wing variant never got further than the design phase br Hs H an experimental variant designed to be launched from one aircraft and controlled from another Abandoned because allied air superiority had reached the point where it was felt that the second aircraft would be unable to remain in the vicinity of the ship for long enough Used the Schmidding solid fuel rocket motor It was also considered as an anti aircraft missile br Hs U the short wingspan variant fitted with a solid
