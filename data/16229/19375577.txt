Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS also known as motor neurone disease MND or Lou Gehrig s disease in the United States is a rare terminal neurodegenerative disorder that results in the progressive loss of both upper and lower motor neurons that normally control voluntary muscle contraction ALS is the most common form of the motor neuron diseases ALS often presents in its early stages with gradual muscle stiffness twitches weakness and wasting Motor neuron loss typically continues until the abilities to eat speak move and lastly breathe are all lost While only of people with ALS also fully develop frontotemporal dementia an estimated face at least some minor difficulties with thinking and behavior Depending on which of the aforementioned symptoms develops first ALS is classified as limb onset begins with weakness in the arms or legs or bulbar onset begins with difficulty in speaking or swallowing br Most cases of ALS about have no known cause and are known as sporadic ALS However both genetic and environmental factors are believed to be involved The remaining of cases have a genetic cause often linked to a history of the disease in the family and these are known as familial ALS hereditary About half of these genetic cases are due to disease causing variants in one of four specific genes The diagnosis is based on a person s signs and symptoms with testing conducted to rule out other potential causes br There is no known cure for ALS The goal of treatment is to slow the disease progression and improve symptoms Treatments that slow ALS include riluzole extends life by two to three months and sodium phenylbutyrate ursodoxicoltaurine extends life by around seven months Non invasive ventilation may result in both improved quality and length of life Mechanical ventilation can prolong survival but does not stop disease progression A feeding tube may help maintain weight and nutrition Death is usually caused by respiratory failure The disease can affect people of any age but usually starts around the age of The average survival from onset to death is two to four years though this can vary and about of those affected survive longer than ten years br Descriptions of the disease date back to at least by Charles Bell In the connection between the symptoms and the underlying neurological problems was first described by French neurologist Jean Martin Charcot who in began using the term amyotrophic lateral sclerosis br br br Classification br ALS is a motor neuron disease which is a group of neurological disorders that selectively affect motor neurons the cells that control voluntary muscles of the body Other motor neuron diseases include primary lateral sclerosis PLS progressive muscular atrophy PMA progressive bulbar palsy pseudobulbar palsy and monomelic amyotrophy MMA br As a disease ALS itself can be classified in a few different ways by which part of the motor neurons are affected by the parts of the body first affected whether it is genetic and the age at which it started Each individual diagnosed with the condition will sit at a unique place at the intersection of these complex and overlapping subtypes which presents a challenge to diagnosis understanding and prognosis br br br Subtypes of motor neuron disease br br ALS can be classified by the types of motor neurons that are affected To successfully control any voluntary muscle in the body a signal must be sent from the motor cortex in the brain down the upper motor neuron as it travels down the spinal cord There it connects via a synapse to the lower motor neuron which connects to the muscle itself Damage to either the upper or lower motor neuron as it makes its way from the brain to muscle causes different types of symptoms Damage to the upper motor neuron typically causes spasticity including stiffness and increased tendon reflexes and or clonus while damage to the lower motor neuron typically causes weakness muscle atrophy and fasciculations br Classical or classic ALS involves degeneration to both the upper motor neurons in the brain and the lower motor neurons in the spinal cord Primary lateral sclerosis PLS involves degeneration of only the upper motor neurons and progressive muscular atrophy PMA involves only the lower motor neurons There is debate over whether PLS and PMA are separate diseases or simply variants of ALS br br Classical ALS accounts for about of all cases of ALS and can be subdivided into where symptoms first appear as these are usually focussed to one region of the body at initial presentation before later spread Limb onset ALS also known as spinal onset and bulbar onset ALS Limb onset ALS begins with weakness in the hands arms feet and or legs and accounts for about two thirds of all classical ALS cases Bulbar onset ALS begins with weakness in the muscles of speech chewing and swallowing and accounts for about of classical ALS cases A rarer type of classical ALS affecting around of patients is respiratory onset in which the initial symptoms are difficulty breathing dyspnea upon exertion at rest or while lying flat orthopnea br Primary lateral sclerosis PLS is a subtype of the overall ALS category which accounts for about of all cases and only affects the upper motor neurons in the arms legs and bulbar region However more than of people with apparent PLS go on to later develop lower motor neuron signs within four years of symptom onset meaning that a definitive diagnosis of PLS cannot be made until several years have passed PLS has a better prognosis than classical ALS as it progresses slower results in less functional decline does not affect the ability to breathe and causes less severe weight loss than classical ALS br Progressive muscular atrophy PMA is another subtype that accounts for about of the overall ALS category and affects lower motor neurons in the arms legs and bulbar region While PMA is associated with longer survival on average than classical ALS it is still progressive over time eventually leading to respiratory failure and death As with PLS developing into classical ALS PMA can also develop into classical ALS over time if the lower motor neuron involvement progresses to include upper motor neurons in which case the diagnosis might be changed to classic ALS br br br Rare isolated variants of ALS br Isolated variants of ALS have symptoms that are limited to a single region for at least a year they progress more slowly than classical ALS and are associated with longer survival These regional variants of ALS can only be considered as a diagnosis should the initial symptoms fail to spread to other spinal cord regions for an extended period of time at least months Flail arm syndrome is characterized by lower motor neuron damage affecting the arm muscles typically starting with the upper arms symmetrically and progressing downwards to the hands Flail leg syndrome is characterized by lower motor neuron damage leading to asymmetrical weakness and wasting in the legs starting around the feet Isolated bulbar palsy is characterized by upper or lower motor neuron damage in the bulbar region in the absence of limb symptoms for at least months leading to gradual onset of difficulty with speech dysarthria and swallowing dysphagia br br br Age of onset br ALS can also be classified based on the age of onset While the peak age of onset is to for sporadic ALS and to for genetic ALS about of all cases of ALS begin before age young onset ALS and about of all cases begin before age juvenile ALS People who develop young onset ALS are more likely to be male less likely to have bulbar onset of symptoms and more likely to have a slower progression of the disease Juvenile ALS is more likely to be genetic in origin than adult onset ALS the most common genes associated with juvenile ALS are FUS ALS and SETX Although most people with juvenile ALS live longer than those with adult onset ALS some of them have specific mutations in FUS and SOD that are associated with a poor prognosis Late onset after age is generally associated with a more rapid functional decline and shorter survival br br br Signs and symptoms br The disorder causes muscle weakness atrophy and muscle spasms throughout the body due to the degeneration of the upper motor and lower motor neurons Sensory nerves and the autonomic nervous system are generally unaffected meaning the majority of people with ALS maintain hearing sight touch smell and taste br br br Initial symptoms br The start of ALS may be so subtle that the symptoms are overlooked The earliest symptoms of ALS are muscle weakness or muscle atrophy typically on one side of the body Other presenting symptoms include trouble swallowing or breathing cramping or stiffness of affected muscles muscle weakness affecting an arm or a leg or slurred and nasal speech The parts of the body affected by early symptoms of ALS depend on which motor neurons in the body are damaged first br In limb onset ALS the first symptoms are in the arms or the legs If the legs are affected first people may experience awkwardness tripping or stumbling when walking or running this is often marked by walking with a dropped foot that drags gently on the ground If the arms are affected first they may experience difficulty with tasks requiring manual dexterity such as buttoning a shirt writing or turning a key in a lock br In bulbar onset ALS the first symptoms are difficulty speaking or swallowing Speech may become slurred nasal in character or quieter There may be difficulty with swallowing and loss of tongue mobility A smaller proportion of people experience respiratory onset ALS where the intercostal muscles that support breathing are affected first br Over time people experience increasing difficulty moving swallowing dysphagia and speaking or forming words dysarthria Symptoms of upper motor neuron involvement include tight and stiff muscles spasticity and exaggerated reflexes hyperreflexia including an overactive gag reflex While the disease does not cause pain directly pain is a symptom experienced by most people with ALS caused by reduced mobility Symptoms of lower motor neuron degeneration include muscle weakness and atrophy muscle cramps and fleeting twitches of muscles that can be seen under the skin fasciculations br br br Progression br Although the initial site of symptoms and subsequent rate of disability progression vary from person to person the initially affected body region is usually the most affected over time and symptoms usually spread to a neighbouring body region For example symptoms starting in one arm usually spread next to either the opposite arm or to the leg on the same side Bulbar onset patients most typically get their next symptoms in their arms rather than legs arm onset patients typically spreads to the legs before the bulbar region and leg onset patients typically spread to the arms rather than the bulbar region Over time regardless of where symptoms began most people eventually lose the ability to walk or use their hands and arms independently Less consistently they may lose the ability to speak and to swallow food It is the eventual development of weakness of the respiratory muscles with the loss of ability to cough and to breathe without support that is ultimately life shortening in ALS br The rate of progression can be measured using the ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised ALSFRS R a item instrument survey administered as a clinical interview or self reported questionnaire that produces a score between normal function and severe disability The ALSFRS R is the most frequently used outcome measure in clinical trials and is used by doctors to track disease progression Though the degree of variability is high and a small percentage of people have a much slower progression on average people with ALS lose about ALSFRS R point per month Brief periods of stabilization plateaus and even small reversals in ALSFRS R score are not uncommon due to the fact the tool is subjective can be affected by medication and different forms of compensation for changes in function However it is rare for these improvements to be large i e greater than ALSFRS R points or sustained i e greater than months A survey based study among clinicians showed that they rated a change in the slope of the ALSFRS R as being clinically meaningful which is the most common threshold used to determine whether a new treatment is working in clinical trials br br br Late stage disease management br Difficulties with chewing and swallowing make eating very difficult dysphagia and increase the risk of choking or of aspirating food into the lungs In later stages of the disorder aspiration pneumonia can develop and maintaining a healthy weight can become a significant problem that may require the insertion of a feeding tube As the diaphragm and intercostal muscles of the rib cage that support breathing weaken measures of lung function such as vital capacity and inspiratory pressure diminish In respiratory onset ALS this may occur before significant limb weakness is apparent Individuals affected by the disorder may ultimately lose the ability to initiate and control all voluntary movement known as locked in syndrome Bladder and bowel function are usually spared meaning urinary and fecal incontinence are uncommon although trouble getting to a toilet can lead to difficulties The extraocular muscles responsible for eye movement are usually spared meaning the use of eye tracking technology to support augmentative communication is often feasible albeit slow and needs may change over time Despite these challenges many people in an advanced state of disease report satisfactory wellbeing and quality of life br br br Prognosis staging and survival br Although respiratory support using non invasive ventilation can ease problems with breathing and prolong survival it does not affect the progression rate of ALS Most people with ALS die between two and four years after the diagnosis Around of people with ALS die within months of their symptoms beginning about live between five and ten years and about survive for years or longer br The most common cause of death among people with ALS is respiratory failure often accelerated by pneumonia Most ALS patients die at home after a period of worsening difficulty breathing a decline in their nutritional status or a rapid worsening of symptoms Sudden death or acute respiratory distress are uncommon Access to palliative care is recommended from an early stage to explore options ensure psychosocial support for the patient and caregivers and to discuss advance healthcare directives br As with cancer staging ALS has staging systems numbered between and that are used for research purposes in clinical trials Two very similar staging systems emerged around a similar time the King s staging system and Milano Torino MiToS functional staging br br Providing individual patients with a precise prognosis is not currently possible though research is underway to provide statistical models on the basis of prognostic factors including age at onset progression rate site of onset and presence of frontotemporal dementia Those with a bulbar onset have a worse prognosis than limb onset ALS a population based study found that bulbar onset ALS patients had a median survival of years and a year survival rate of while limb onset ALS patients had a median survival of years and a year survival rate of Those with respiratory onset ALS had a shorter median survival of years and survival at years While astrophysicist Stephen Hawking lived for more years following his diagnosis his was an unusual case br br br Cognitive emotional and behavioral symptoms br Cognitive impairment or behavioral dysfunction is present in of individuals with ALS and can appear more frequently in later stages of the disease Language dysfunction executive dysfunction and troubles with social cognition and verbal memory are the most commonly reported cognitive symptoms in ALS Cognitive impairment is found more frequently in patients with C orf gene repeat expansions bulbar onset bulbar symptoms family history of ALS and or a predominantly upper motor neuron phenotype br Emotional lability is a symptom in which patients cry smile yawn or laugh either in the absence of emotional stimuli or when they are feeling the opposite emotion to that being expressed it is experienced by about half of ALS patients and is more common in those with bulbar onset ALS While relatively benign relative to other symptoms it can cause increased stigma and social isolation as people around the patient struggle to react appropriately to what can be frequent and inappropriate outbursts in public br In addition to mild changes in cognition that may only emerge during neuropsychological testing around of individuals have signs of frontotemporal dementia FTD Repeating phrases or gestures apathy and loss of inhibition are the most frequently reported behavioral features of ALS ALS and FTD are now considered to be part of a common disease spectrum ALS FTD because of genetic clinical and pathological similarities Genetically repeat expansions in the C orf gene account for about of genetic ALS and of genetic FTD br Cognitive and behavioral issues are associated with poorer prognosis as they may reduce adherence to medical advice and deficits in empathy and social cognition which may increase caregiver burden br br br Cause br It is not known what causes sporadic ALS hence it is described as an idiopathic disease Though its exact cause is unknown genetic and environmental factors are thought to be of roughly equal importance The genetic factors are better understood than the environmental factors no specific environmental factor has been definitively shown to cause ALS A multi step liability threshold model for ALS proposes that cellular damage accumulates over time due to genetic factors present at birth and exposure to environmental risks throughout life ALS can strike at any age but its likelihood increases with age Most people who develop ALS are between the ages of and with an average age of at the time of diagnosis ALS is more common in men than women but this difference in sex distribution is no longer present in patients with onset after age br br br Genetics and genetic testing br br While they appear identical clinically and pathologically ALS can be classified as being either familial or sporadic depending on whether there is a known family history of the disease and or whether an ALS associated genetic mutation has been identified via genetic testing Familial ALS is thought to account for of cases overall and can include monogenic oligogenic and polygenic modes of inheritance br There is considerable variation among clinicians on how to approach genetic testing in ALS and only about half discuss the possibility of genetic inheritance with their patients particularly if there is no discernible family history of the disease In the past genetic counseling and testing was only offered to those with obviously familial ALS But it is increasingly recognized that cases of sporadic ALS may also be due to disease causing de novo mutations in SOD or C orf an incomplete family history or incomplete penetrance meaning that a patient s ancestors carried the gene but did not express the disease in their lifetimes The lack of positive family history may be caused by lack of historical records having a smaller family older generations dying earlier of causes other than ALS genetic non paternity and uncertainty over whether certain neuropsychiatric conditions e g frontotemporal dementia other forms of dementia suicide psychosis schizophrenia should be considered significant when determining a family history There have been calls in the research community to routinely counsel and test all diagnosed ALS patients for familial ALS particularly as there is now a licensed gene therapy tofersen specifically targeted to carriers of SOD ALS A shortage of genetic counselors and limited clinical capacity to see such at risk individuals makes this challenging in practice as does the unequal access to genetic testing around the world br More than genes have been associated with ALS of which four account for nearly half of familial cases and around of sporadic cases C orf of familial cases sporadic SOD of familial cases sporadic FUS of familial cases sporadic and TARDBP of familial cases sporadic with the remaining genes mostly accounting for fewer than of either familial or sporadic cases ALS genes identified to date explain the cause of about of familial ALS and about of sporadic ALS Overall first degree relatives of an individual with ALS have a risk of developing ALS themselves br br br Environmental and other factors br The multi step hypothesis suggests the disease is caused by some interaction between an individual s genetic risk factors and their cumulative lifetime of exposures to environmental factors termed their exposome The most consistent lifetime exposures associated with developing ALS other than genetic mutations include heavy metals e g lead and mercury chemicals e g pesticides and solvents electric shock physical injury including head injury and smoking in men more than women Overall these effects are small with each exposure in isolation only increasing the likelihood of a very rare condition by a small amount For instance an individual s lifetime risk of developing ALS might go from in without an exposure to between in and in if they were exposed to heavy metals A range of other exposures have weaker evidence supporting them and include participation in professional sports having a lower body mass index lower educational attainment manual occupations military service exposure to Beta N methylamino L alanin BMAA and viral infections br Although some personality traits such as openness agreeableness and conscientiousness appear remarkably common among patients with ALS it remains open whether personality can increase susceptibility to ALS directly Instead genetic factors giving rise to personality might simultaneously predispose people to developing ALS or br the above personality traits might underlie lifestyle choices which are in turn risk factors for ALS br br br Pathophysiology br br br Neuropathology br Upon examination at autopsy features of the disease that can be seen with the naked eye include skeletal muscle atrophy motor cortex atrophy sclerosis of the corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts thinning of the hypoglossal nerves which control the tongue and thinning of the anterior roots of the spinal cord br The defining feature of ALS is the death of both upper motor neurons located in the motor cortex of the brain and lower motor neurons located in the brainstem and spinal cord In ALS with frontotemporal dementia neurons throughout the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain die as well The pathological hallmark of ALS is the presence of inclusion bodies abnormal aggregations of protein known as Bunina bodies in the cytoplasm of motor neurons In about of people with ALS the main component of the inclusion bodies is TDP protein however in those with SOD or FUS mutations the main component of the inclusion bodies is SOD protein or FUS protein respectively Prion like propagation of misfolded proteins from cell to cell may explain why ALS starts in one area and spreads to others The glymphatic system may also be involved in the pathogenesis of ALS br br br Biochemistry br br It is still not fully understood why neurons die in ALS but this neurodegeneration is thought to involve many different cellular and molecular processes The genes known to be involved in ALS can be grouped into three general categories based on their normal function protein degradation the cytoskeleton and RNA processing Mutant SOD protein forms intracellular aggregations that inhibit protein degradation Cytoplasmic aggregations of wild type normal SOD protein are common in sporadic ALS It is thought that misfolded mutant SOD can cause misfolding and aggregation of wild type SOD in neighboring neurons in a prion like manner Other protein degradation genes that can cause ALS when mutated include VCP OPTN TBK and SQSTM Three genes implicated in ALS that are important for maintaining the cytoskeleton and for axonal transport include DCTN PFN and TUBA A br There are a number of ALS genes that encode for RNA binding proteins The first to be discovered was TDP protein a nuclear protein that aggregates in the cytoplasm of motor neurons in almost all cases of ALS however mutations in TARDBP the gene that codes for TDP are a rare cause of ALS FUS codes for FUS another RNA binding protein with a similar function to TDP which can cause ALS when mutated It is thought that mutations in TARDBP and FUS increase the binding affinity of the low complexity domain causing their respective proteins to aggregate in the cytoplasm Once these mutant RNA binding proteins are misfolded and aggregated they may be able to misfold normal proteins both within and between cells in a prion like manner This also leads to decreased levels of RNA binding protein in the nucleus which may mean that their target RNA transcripts do not undergo normal processing Other RNA metabolism genes associated with ALS include ANG SETX and MATR br C orf is the most commonly mutated gene in ALS and causes motor neuron death through a number of mechanisms The pathogenic mutation is a hexanucleotide repeat expansion a series of six nucleotides repeated over and over people with up to repeats are considered normal while people with hundreds or thousands of repeats can have familial ALS frontotemporal dementia or sometimes sporadic ALS The three mechanisms of disease associated with these C orf repeats are deposition of RNA transcripts in the nucleus translation of the RNA into toxic dipeptide repeat proteins in the cytoplasm and decreased levels of the normal C orf protein Mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction leading to dysfunctional motor neuron axonal homeostasis reduced axonal length and fast axonal transport of mitochondrial cargo has been shown to occur in C orf ALS using human induced pluripotent stem cell iPSC technologies coupled with CRISPR Cas gene editing and human post mortem spinal cord tissue examination br Excitotoxicity or nerve cell death caused by high levels of intracellular calcium due to excessive stimulation by the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is a mechanism thought to be common to all forms of ALS Motor neurons are more sensitive to excitotoxicity than other types of neurons because they have a lower calcium buffering capacity and a type of glutamate receptor the AMPA receptor that is more permeable to calcium In ALS there are decreased levels of excitatory amino acid transporter EAAT which is the main transporter that removes glutamate from the synapse this leads to increased synaptic glutamate levels and excitotoxicity Riluzole a drug that modestly prolongs survival in ALS inhibits glutamate release from pre synaptic neurons however it is unclear if this mechanism is responsible for its therapeutic effect br br br Diagnosis br br No single test can provide a definite diagnosis of ALS Instead the diagnosis of ALS is primarily made based on a physician s clinical assessment after ruling out other diseases Physicians often obtain the person s full medical history and conduct neurologic examinations at regular intervals to assess whether signs and symptoms such as muscle weakness muscle atrophy hyperreflexia Babinski s sign and spasticity are worsening A number of biomarkers are being studied for the condition but as of are not in general medical use br br br Differential diagnosis br Because symptoms of ALS can be similar to those of a wide variety of other more treatable diseases or disorders appropriate tests must be conducted to exclude the possibility of other conditions One of these tests is electromyography EMG a special recording technique that detects electrical activity in muscles Certain EMG findings can support the diagnosis of ALS Another common test measures nerve conduction velocity NCV Specific abnormalities in the NCV results may suggest for example that the person has a form of peripheral neuropathy damage to peripheral nerves or myopathy muscle disease rather than ALS While a magnetic resonance imaging MRI is often normal in people with early stage ALS it can reveal evidence of other problems that may be causing the symptoms such as a spinal cord tumor multiple sclerosis a herniated disc in the neck syringomyelia or cervical spondylosis br Based on the person s symptoms and findings from the examination and from these tests the physician may order tests on blood and urine samples to eliminate the possibility of other diseases as well as routine laboratory tests In some cases for example if a physician suspects the person may have a myopathy rather than ALS a muscle biopsy may be performed br A number of infectious diseases can sometimes cause ALS like symptoms including human immunodeficiency virus HIV human T lymphotropic virus HTLV Lyme disease and syphilis Neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis post polio syndrome multifocal motor neuropathy CIDP spinal muscular atrophy and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy can also mimic certain aspects of the disease and should be considered br ALS must be differentiated from the ALS mimic syndromes which are unrelated disorders that may have a similar presentation and clinical features to ALS or its variants Because the prognosis of ALS and closely related subtypes of motor neuron disease are generally poor neurologists may carry out investigations to evaluate and exclude other diagnostic possibilities Disorders of the neuromuscular junction such as myasthenia gravis MG and Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome may also mimic ALS although this rarely presents diagnostic difficulty over time Benign fasciculation syndrome and cramp fasciculation syndrome may also occasionally mimic some of the early symptoms of ALS Nonetheless the absence of other neurological features that develop inexorably with ALS means that over time the distinction will not present any difficulty to the experienced neurologist where doubt remains EMG may be helpful br br br Management br There is no cure for ALS Management focuses on treating symptoms and providing supportive care with the goal of improving quality of life and prolonging survival This care is best provided by multidisciplinary teams of healthcare professionals attending a multidisciplinary ALS clinic is associated with longer survival fewer hospitalizations and improved quality of life br Non invasive ventilation NIV is the main treatment for respiratory failure in ALS In people with normal bulbar function it prolongs survival by about seven months and improves quality of life One study found that NIV is ineffective for people with poor bulbar function while another suggested that it may provide a modest survival benefit Many people with ALS have difficulty tolerating NIV Invasive ventilation is an option for people with advanced ALS when NIV is not enough to manage their symptoms While invasive ventilation prolongs survival disease progression and functional decline continue It may decrease the quality of life of people with ALS or their caregivers Invasive ventilation is more commonly used in Japan than in North America or Europe br br Physical therapy can promote functional independence through aerobic range of motion and stretching exercises Occupational therapy can assist with activities of daily living through adaptive equipment Speech therapy can assist people with ALS who have difficulty speaking Preventing weight loss and malnutrition in people with ALS improves both survival and quality of life Initially difficulty swallowing dysphagia can be managed by dietary changes and swallowing techniques A feeding tube should be considered if someone with ALS loses or more of their body weight or if they cannot safely swallow food and water The feeding tube is usually inserted by percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy PEG There is weak evidence that PEG tubes improve survival PEG insertion is usually performed with the intent of improving quality of life br Palliative care should begin shortly after someone is diagnosed with ALS Discussion of end of life issues gives people with ALS time to reflect on their preferences for end of life care and can help avoid unwanted interventions or procedures Hospice care can improve symptom management at the end of life and increases the likelihood of a peaceful death In the final days of life opioids can be used to treat pain and dyspnea while benzodiazepines can be used to treat anxiety br br br Medications br br br Disease slowing treatments br br Riluzole has been found to modestly prolong survival by about months It may have a greater survival benefit for those with bulbar onset ALS It may work by decreasing release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate from pre synaptic neurons The most common side effects are nausea and a lack of energy asthenia People with ALS should begin treatment with riluzole as soon as possible following their diagnosis Riluzole is available as a tablet liquid or dissolvable oral film br Edaravone has been shown to modestly slow the decline in function in a small group of people with early stage ALS It may work by protecting motor neurons from oxidative stress The most common side effects are bruising and gait disturbance Edaravone is available as an intravenous infusion or as an oral suspension br AMX Relyvrio is a combination of sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol which was initially shown to prolong the survival of patients by an average of six months Relyvrio was withdrawn by the manufacturer in April following the completion of the Phase PHOENIX trial which did not show substantial benefit to ALS patients br Tofersen Qalsody is an antisense oligonucleotide that was approved for medical use in the United States in April for the treatment of SOD associated ALS In a study of patients with SOD associated ALS there was a non significant trend towards a slowing of progression as well as a significant reduction in neurofilament light chain a putative ALS biomarker thought to indicate neuronal damage A follow up study and open label extension suggested that earlier treatment initiation had a beneficial effect on slowing disease progression Tofersen is available as an intrathecal injection into the lumbar cistern at the base of the spine br br br Symptomatic treatments br Other medications may be used to help reduce fatigue ease muscle cramps control spasticity and reduce excess saliva and phlegm Gabapentin pregabalin and tricyclic antidepressants e g amitriptyline can be used for neuropathic pain while nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs NSAIDs acetaminophen and opioids can be used for nociceptive pain br Depression can be treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs or tricyclic antidepressants while benzodiazepines can be used for anxiety There are no medications to treat cognitive impairment frontotemporal dementia FTD however SSRIs and antipsychotics can help treat some of the symptoms of FTD Baclofen and tizanidine are the most commonly used oral drugs for treating spasticity an intrathecal baclofen pump can be used for severe spasticity Atropine scopolamine amitriptyline or glycopyrrolate may be prescribed when people with ALS begin having trouble swallowing their saliva sialorrhea br A review concluded that mexiletine is safe and effective for treating cramps in ALS based on a randomized controlled trial from br br br Breathing support br br br Non invasive ventilation br br Non invasive ventilation NIV is the primary treatment for respiratory failure in ALS and was the first treatment shown to improve both survival and quality of life NIV uses a face or nasal mask connected to a ventilator that provides intermittent positive pressure to support breathing Continuous positive pressure is not recommended for people with ALS because it makes breathing more difficult Initially NIV is used only at night because the first sign of respiratory failure is decreased gas exchange hypoventilation during sleep symptoms associated with this nocturnal hypoventilation include interrupted sleep anxiety morning headaches and daytime fatigue As the disease progresses people with ALS develop shortness of breath when lying down during physical activity or talking and eventually at rest Other symptoms include poor concentration poor memory confusion respiratory tract infections and a weak cough Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in ALS br It is important to monitor the respiratory function of people with ALS every three months because beginning NIV soon after the start of respiratory symptoms is associated with increased survival This involves asking the person with ALS if they have any respiratory symptoms and measuring their respiratory function The most commonly used measurement is upright forced vital capacity FVC but it is a poor detector of early respiratory failure and is not a good choice for those with bulbar symptoms as they have difficulty maintaining a tight seal around the mouthpiece Measuring FVC while the person is lying on their back supine FVC is a more accurate measure of diaphragm weakness than upright FVC Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure SNIP is a rapid convenient test of diaphragm strength that is not affected by bulbar muscle weakness If someone with ALS has signs and symptoms of respiratory failure they should undergo daytime blood gas analysis to look for hypoxemia low oxygen in the blood and hypercapnia too much carbon dioxide in the blood If their daytime blood gas analysis is normal they should then have nocturnal pulse oximetry to look for hypoxemia during sleep br Non invasive ventilation prolongs survival longer than riluzole A randomized controlled trial found that NIV prolongs survival by about days and improves the quality of life however it also found that some people with ALS benefit more from this intervention than others For those with normal or only moderately impaired bulbar function NIV prolongs survival by about seven months and significantly improves the quality of life For those with poor bulbar function NIV neither prolongs survival nor improves the quality of life though it does improve some sleep related symptoms Despite the clear benefits of NIV about of all people with ALS are unable to tolerate it especially those with cognitive impairment or bulbar dysfunction Results from a large cohort study suggest that NIV may prolong survival in those with bulbar weakness so NIV should be offered to all people with ALS even if it is likely that they will have difficulty tolerating it br br br Invasive ventilation br Invasive ventilation bypasses the nose and mouth the upper airways by making a cut in the trachea tracheostomy and inserting a tube connected to a ventilator It is an option for people with advanced ALS whose respiratory symptoms are poorly managed despite continuous NIV use While invasive ventilation prolongs survival especially for those younger than it does not treat the underlying neurodegenerative process The person with ALS will continue to lose motor function making communication increasingly difficult and sometimes leading to locked in syndrome in which they are completely paralyzed except for their eye muscles About half of the people with ALS who choose to undergo invasive ventilation report a decrease in their quality of life but most still consider it to be satisfactory However invasive ventilation imposes a heavy burden on caregivers and may decrease their quality of life Attitudes toward invasive ventilation vary from country to country about of people with ALS in Japan choose invasive ventilation versus less than in North America and Europe br br br Therapy br br Physical therapy plays a large role in rehabilitation for individuals with ALS Specifically physical occupational and speech therapists can set goals and promote benefits for individuals with ALS by delaying loss of strength maintaining endurance limiting pain improving speech and swallowing preventing complications and promoting functional independence br Occupational therapy and special equipment such as assistive technology can also enhance people s independence and safety throughout the course of ALS Gentle low impact aerobic exercise such as performing activities of daily living walking swimming and stationary bicycling can strengthen unaffected muscles improve cardiovascular health and help people fight fatigue and depression Range of motion and stretching exercises can help prevent painful spasticity and shortening contracture of muscles Physical and occupational therapists can recommend exercises that provide these benefits without overworking muscles because muscle exhaustion can lead to a worsening of symptoms associated with ALS rather than providing help to people with ALS They can suggest devices such as ramps braces walkers bathroom equipment shower chairs toilet risers etc and wheelchairs that help people remain mobile Occupational therapists can provide or recommend equipment and adaptations to enable ALS people to retain as much safety and independence in activities of daily living as possible Since respiratory insufficiency is the primary cause of mortality physical therapists can help improve respiratory outcomes in people with ALS by implementing pulmonary physical therapy This includes inspiratory muscle training lung volume recruitment training and manual assisted cough therapy aimed at increasing respiratory muscle strength as well as increasing survival rates br People with ALS who have difficulty speaking or swallowing may benefit from working with a speech language pathologist These health professionals can teach people adaptive strategies such as techniques to help them speak louder and more clearly As ALS progresses speech language pathologists can recommend the use of augmentative and alternative communication such as voice amplifiers speech generating devices or voice output communication devices or low tech communication techniques such as head mounted laser pointers alphabet boards or yes no signals br br br Nutrition br br Preventing weight loss and malnutrition in people with ALS improves both survival and quality of life Weight loss in ALS is often caused by muscle wasting and increased resting energy expenditure Weight loss may also be secondary to reduced food intake since dysphagia develops in about of people with ALS at some point over the course of their disease Therefore regular periodic assessment of the weight and swallowing ability in people with ALS is very important Dysphagia is often initially managed via dietary changes and modified swallowing techniques People with ALS are often instructed to avoid dry or chewy foods in their diet and instead have meals that are soft moist and easy to swallow Switching to thick liquids like fruit nectar or smoothies or adding thickeners to thin fluids like water and coffee may also help people facing difficulty swallowing liquids There is tentative evidence that high calorie diets may prevent further weight loss and improve survival but more research is still needed br A feeding tube should be considered if someone with ALS loses or more of their body weight or if they cannot safely swallow food and water This can take the form of a gastrostomy tube in which a tube is placed through the wall of the abdomen into the stomach or less commonly a nasogastric tube in which a tube is placed through the nose and down the esophagus into the stomach A gastrostomy tube is more appropriate for long term use than a nasogastric tube which is uncomfortable and can cause esophageal ulcers The feeding tube is usually inserted by a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy procedure PEG While there is weak evidence that PEG tubes improve survival in people with ALS no randomized controlled trials RCTs have yet been conducted to indicate whether enteral tube feeding has benefits compared to continuation of feeding by mouth Nevertheless PEG tubes are still offered with the intent of improving the person s quality of life by sustaining nutrition hydration status and medication intake br br br End of life care br Palliative care which relieves symptoms and improves the quality of life without treating the underlying disease should begin shortly after someone is diagnosed with ALS Early discussion of end of life issues gives people with ALS time to reflect on their preferences for end of life care and can help avoid unwanted interventions or procedures Once they have been fully informed about all aspects of various life prolonging measures they can fill out advance directives indicating their attitude toward noninvasive ventilation invasive ventilation and feeding tubes Late in the disease course difficulty speaking due to muscle weakness dysarthria and cognitive dysfunction may impair their ability to communicate their wishes regarding care Continued failure to solicit the preferences of the person with ALS may lead to unplanned and potentially unwanted emergency interventions such as invasive ventilation If people with ALS or their family members are reluctant to discuss end of life issues it may be useful to use the introduction of gastrostomy or noninvasive ventilation as an opportunity to bring up the subject br Hospice care or palliative care at the end of life is especially important in ALS because it helps to optimize the management of symptoms and increases the likelihood of a peaceful death It is unclear exactly when the end of life phase begins in ALS but it is associated with significant difficulty moving communicating and in some cases thinking Although many people with ALS fear choking to death suffocating they can be reassured that this occurs rarely less than of the time Most patients die at home and in the final days of life opioids can be used to treat pain and dyspnea while benzodiazepines can be used to treat anxiety br br br Epidemiology br ALS is the most common motor neuron disease in adults and the third most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer s disease and Parkinson s disease Worldwide the number of people who develop ALS yearly is estimated to be people per per year while the number of people who have ALS at any given time is estimated to be about people per In Europe the number of new cases a year is about people per while the number affected is people per The lifetime risk of developing ALS is for European men and for European women Men have a higher risk mainly because spinal onset ALS is more common in men than women The number of those with ALS in the United States in was people per and was higher in whites males and people over years old The number of new cases is about people per per year in east Asia and about people per per year in south Asia About of ALS epidemiology studies have been conducted in Europe and the United States mostly in people of northern European descent There is not enough information to determine the rates of ALS in much of the world including Africa parts of Asia India Russia and South America There are several geographic clusters in the Western Pacific where the prevalence of ALS was reported to be times higher than the rest of the world including Guam the Kii Peninsula of Japan and Western New Guinea The incidence in these areas has decreased since the s the cause remains unknown br br People of all races and ethnic backgrounds may be affected by ALS but it is more common in whites than in Africans Asians or Hispanics In the United States in the prevalence of ALS in whites was people per while the prevalence in blacks was people per The Midwest had the highest prevalence of the four US Census regions with people per followed by the Northeast the South and the West The Midwest and Northeast likely had a higher prevalence of ALS because they have a higher proportion of whites than the South and West Ethnically mixed populations may be at a lower risk of developing ALS a study in Cuba found that people of mixed ancestry were less likely to die from ALS than whites or blacks There are also differences in the genetics of ALS between different ethnic groups the most common ALS gene in Europe is C orf followed by SOD TARDBP and FUS while the most common ALS gene in Asia is SOD followed by FUS C orf and TARDBP br ALS can affect people at any age but the peak incidence is between and years and decreases dramatically after years The reason for the decreased incidence in the elderly is unclear One thought is that people who survive into their s may not be genetically susceptible to developing ALS alternatively ALS in the elderly might go undiagnosed because of comorbidities other diseases they have difficulty seeing a neurologist or dying quickly from an aggressive form of ALS In the United States in the lowest prevalence was in the age group while the highest prevalence was in the age group Sporadic ALS usually starts around the ages of to years while genetic ALS starts earlier usually around to years The number of ALS cases worldwide is projected to increase from in to in an increase of This will largely be due to the aging of the world s population especially in developing countries br br br History br br Descriptions of the disease date back to at least by Charles Bell In Fran ois Amilcar Aran was the first to describe a disorder he named progressive muscular atrophy a form of ALS in which only the lower motor neurons are affected In the connection between the symptoms and the underlying neurological problems were first described by Jean Martin Charcot who initially introduced the term amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in his paper Flail arm syndrome a regional variant of ALS was first described by Alfred Vulpian in Flail leg syndrome another regional variant of ALS was first described by Pierre Marie and his student Patrikios in br br br Diagnostic criteria br In the s electrodiagnostic testing EMG and nerve conduction velocity NCV testing began to be used to evaluate clinically suspected ALS In Edward H Lambert published the first EMG NCS diagnostic criteria for ALS consisting of four findings he considered to strongly support the diagnosis Since then a number of diagnostic criteria have been developed which are mostly in use for research purposes for inclusion exclusion criteria and to stratify patients for analysis in trials Research diagnostic criteria for ALS include the El Escorial in revised in In the Awaji criteria proposed using EMG and NCV tests to help diagnose ALS earlier and most recently the Gold Coast criteria in br br br Name br br Amyotrophic comes from Greek a means no myo from m s refers to muscle and troph means nourishment Therefore amyotrophy means muscle malnourishment or the wasting of muscle tissue Lateral identifies the locations in the spinal cord of the affected motor neurons Sclerosis means scarring or hardening and refers to the death of the motor neurons in the spinal cord br ALS is sometimes referred to as Charcot s disease not to be confused with Charcot Marie Tooth disease or Charcot joint disease because Jean Martin Charcot was the first to connect the clinical symptoms with the pathology seen at autopsy The British neurologist Russell Brain coined the term motor neurone disease in to reflect his belief that ALS progressive bulbar palsy and progressive muscular atrophy were all different forms of the same disease In some countries especially the United States ALS is called Lou Gehrig s disease after the American baseball player Lou Gehrig who was diagnosed with ALS in br In the United States and continental Europe the term ALS as well as Lou Gehrig s disease in the US refers to all forms of the disease including classical ALS progressive bulbar palsy progressive muscular atrophy and primary lateral sclerosis In the United Kingdom and Australia the term motor neurone disease refers to all forms of the disease while ALS only refers to classical ALS meaning the form with both upper and lower motor neuron involvement br br br Society and culture br br br In addition to the baseball player Lou Gehrig and the theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking who notably lived longer than any other known person with the condition a number of other notable individuals have or have had ALS People with ALS have been featured in high profile works such as the memoir Tuesdays with Morrie and the critically acclaimed motion picture The Theory of Everything br In August the Ice Bucket Challenge to raise money for ALS research went viral online Participants filmed themselves filling a bucket full of ice water and pouring it onto themselves they then nominated other individuals to do the same Many participants donated to ALS research
