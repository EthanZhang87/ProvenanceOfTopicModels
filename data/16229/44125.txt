id: 44125
A gyroscope from Ancient Greek g ros round and skop to look is a device used for measuring or maintaining orientation and angular velocity It is a spinning wheel or disc in which the axis of rotation spin axis is free to assume any orientation by itself When rotating the orientation of this axis is unaffected by tilting or rotation of the mounting according to the conservation of angular momentum br Gyroscopes based on other operating principles also exist such as the microchip packaged MEMS gyroscopes found in electronic devices sometimes called gyrometers solid state ring lasers fibre optic gyroscopes and the extremely sensitive quantum gyroscope br Applications of gyroscopes include inertial navigation systems such as in the Hubble Space Telescope or inside the steel hull of a submerged submarine Due to their precision gyroscopes are also used in gyrotheodolites to maintain direction in tunnel mining Gyroscopes can be used to construct gyrocompasses which complement or replace magnetic compasses in ships aircraft and spacecraft vehicles in general to assist in stability bicycles motorcycles and ships or be used as part of an inertial guidance system br MEMS gyroscopes are popular in some consumer electronics such as smartphones br br br Description and diagram br br A gyroscope is an instrument consisting of a wheel mounted into two or three gimbals providing pivoted supports for allowing the wheel to rotate about a single axis A set of three gimbals one mounted on the other with orthogonal pivot axes may be used to allow a wheel mounted on the innermost gimbal to have an orientation remaining independent of the orientation in space of its support br In the case of a gyroscope with two gimbals the outer gimbal which is the gyroscope frame is mounted so as to pivot about an axis in its own plane determined by the support This outer gimbal possesses one degree of rotational freedom and its axis possesses none The second gimbal inner gimbal is mounted in the gyroscope frame outer gimbal so as to pivot about an axis in its own plane that is always perpendicular to the pivotal axis of the gyroscope frame outer gimbal This inner gimbal has two degrees of rotational freedom br The axle of the spinning wheel the rotor defines the spin axis The rotor is constrained to spin about an axis which is always perpendicular to the axis of the inner gimbal So the rotor possesses three degrees of rotational freedom and its axis possesses two br The rotor responds to a force applied to the input axis by a reaction force to the output axis br A gyroscope flywheel will roll or resist about the output axis depending upon whether the output gimbals are of a free or fixed configuration An example of some free output gimbal devices is the attitude control gyroscopes used to sense or measure the pitch roll and yaw attitude angles in a spacecraft or aircraft br br The centre of gravity of the rotor can be in a fixed position The rotor simultaneously spins about one axis and is capable of oscillating about the two other axes and it is free to turn in any direction about the fixed point except for its inherent resistance caused by rotor spin Some gyroscopes have mechanical equivalents substituted for one or more of the elements For example the spinning rotor may be suspended in a fluid instead of being mounted in gimbals A control moment gyroscope CMG is an example of a fixed output gimbal device that is used on spacecraft to hold or maintain a desired attitude angle or pointing direction using the gyroscopic resistance force br In some special cases the outer gimbal or its equivalent may be omitted so that the rotor has only two degrees of freedom In other cases the centre of gravity of the rotor may be offset from the axis of oscillation and thus the centre of gravity of the rotor and the centre of suspension of the rotor may not coincide br br br History br br br Early similar devices br Essentially a gyroscope is a top combined with a pair of gimbals Tops were invented in many different civilizations including classical Greece Rome and China Most of these were not utilized as instruments br The first known apparatus similar to a gyroscope the Whirling Speculum or Serson s Speculum was invented by John Serson in It was used as a level to locate the horizon in foggy or misty conditions br The first instrument used more like an actual gyroscope was made by Johann Bohnenberger of Germany who first wrote about it in At first he called it the Machine Bohnenberger s machine was based on a rotating massive sphere In American Walter R Johnson developed a similar device that was based on a rotating disc The French mathematician Pierre Simon Laplace working at the cole Polytechnique in Paris recommended the machine for use as a teaching aid and thus it came to the attention of L on Foucault br br br Foucault s gyroscope br br In Foucault used it in an experiment demonstrating the rotation of the Earth br It was Foucault who gave the device its modern name in an experiment to see Greek skopeein to see the Earth s rotation Greek gyros circle or rotation which was visible in the to minutes before friction slowed the spinning rotor br br br Commercialization br In the s the advent of electric motors made it possible for a gyroscope to spin indefinitely this led to the first prototype heading indicators and a rather more complicated device the gyrocompass The first functional gyrocompass was patented in by German inventor Hermann Ansch tz Kaempfe American Elmer Sperry followed with his own design later that year and other nations soon realized the military importance of the invention in an age in which naval prowess was the most significant measure of military power and created their own gyroscope industries The Sperry Gyroscope Company quickly expanded to provide aircraft and naval stabilizers as well and other gyroscope developers followed suit br Circa the L T Hurst Mfg Co of Indianapolis started producing the Hurst gyroscope a toy gyroscope with a pull string and pedestal Manufacture was at some point switched to Chandler Mfg Co still branded Hurst The product later gets renamed to a Chandler gyroscope presumably because Chandler Mfg Co took over rights to the gyroscope Chandler continued to produce the toy until the company was purchased by TEDCO Inc in The gyroscope is still produced by TEDCO today br In the first several decades of the th century other inventors attempted unsuccessfully to use gyroscopes as the basis for early black box navigational systems by creating a stable platform from which accurate acceleration measurements could be performed in order to bypass the need for star sightings to calculate position Similar principles were later employed in the development of inertial navigation systems for ballistic missiles br During World War II the gyroscope became the prime component for aircraft and anti aircraft gun sights After the war the race to miniaturize gyroscopes for guided missiles and weapons navigation systems resulted in the development and manufacturing of so called midget gyroscopes that weighed less than ounces g and had a diameter of approximately inch cm Some of these miniaturized gyroscopes could reach a speed of revolutions per minute in less than seconds br Gyroscopes continue to be an engineering challenge For example the axle bearings have to be extremely accurate A small amount of friction is deliberately introduced to the bearings since otherwise an accuracy of better than br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle br br of an inch nm would be required br Three axis MEMS based gyroscopes are also being used in portable electronic devices such as tablets smartphones and smartwatches This adds to the axis acceleration sensing ability available on previous generations of devices Together these sensors provide component motion sensing accelerometers for X Y and Z movement and gyroscopes for measuring the extent and rate of rotation in space roll pitch and yaw Some devices additionally incorporate a magnetometer to provide absolute angular measurements relative to the Earth s magnetic field Newer MEMS based inertial measurement units incorporate up to all nine axes of sensing in a single integrated circuit package providing inexpensive and widely available motion sensing br br br Gyroscopic principles br All spinning objects have gyroscopic properties The main properties that an object can experience in any gyroscopic motion are rigidity in space and precession br br br Rigidity in space br br Rigidity in space describes the principle that a gyroscope remains in the fixed position on the plane in which it is spinning unaffected by the Earth s rotation For example a bike wheel Early forms of gyroscope not then known by the name were used to demonstrate the principle br br br Precession br br A simple case of precession also known as steady precession can be

counterintuitive dynamic results such as a spinning top not falling over Precession is used in aerospace applications for sensing changes of attitude and direction br br br Contemporary uses br br br Steadicam br br A Steadicam rig was employed during the filming of the film Return of the Jedi in conjunction with two gyroscopes for extra stabilization to film the background plates for the speeder bike chase Steadicam inventor Garrett Brown operated the shot walking through a redwood forest running the camera at one frame per second When projected at frames per second it gave the impression of flying through the air at perilous speeds br br br Heading indicator br br The heading indicator or directional gyro has an axis of rotation that is set horizontally pointing north Unlike a magnetic compass it does not seek north When being used in an airplane for example it will slowly drift away from north and will need to be reoriented periodically using a magnetic compass as a reference br br br Gyrocompass br br Unlike a directional gyro or heading indicator a gyrocompass seeks north It detects the rotation of the Earth about its axis and seeks the true north rather than the magnetic north Gyrocompasses usually have built in damping to prevent overshoot when re calibrating from sudden movement br br br Accelerometer br br By determining an object s acceleration and integrating over time the velocity of the object can be calculated Integrating again position can be determined The simplest accelerometer is a weight that is free to move horizontally which is attached to a spring and a device to measure the tension in the spring This can be improved by introducing a counteracting force to push the weight back and to measure the force needed to prevent the weight from moving A more complicated design consists of a gyroscope with a weight on one of the axes The device will react to the force generated by the weight when it is accelerated by integrating that force to produce a velocity br br br Variations br br br Gyrostat br A gyrostat consists of a massive flywheel concealed in a solid casing Its behaviour on a table or with various modes of suspension or support serves to illustrate the curious reversal of the ordinary laws of static equilibrium due to the gyrostatic behaviour of the interior invisible flywheel when rotated rapidly The first gyrostat was designed by Lord Kelvin to illustrate the more complicated state of motion of a spinning body when free to wander about on a horizontal plane like a top spun on the pavement or a bicycle on the road Kelvin also made use of gyrostats to develop mechanical theories of the elasticity of matter and of the ether In modern continuum mechanics there is a variety of these models based on ideas of Lord Kelvin They represent a specific type of Cosserat theories suggested for the first time by Eug ne Cosserat and Fran ois Cosserat which can be used for description of artificially made smart materials as well as of other complex media One of them so called Kelvin s medium has the same equations as magnetic insulators near the state of magnetic saturation in the approximation of quasimagnetostatics br In modern times the gyrostat concept is used in the design of attitude control systems for orbiting spacecraft and satellites For instance the Mir space station had three pairs of internally mounted flywheels known as gyrodynes or control moment gyros br In physics there are several systems whose dynamical equations resemble the equations of motion of a gyrostat Examples include a solid body with a cavity filled with an inviscid incompressible homogeneous liquid the static equilibrium configuration of a stressed elastic rod in elastica theory the polarization dynamics of a light pulse propagating through a nonlinear medium the Lorenz system in chaos theory and the motion of an ion in a Penning trap mass spectrometer br br br MEMS gyroscope br br A microelectromechanical systems MEMS gyroscope is a miniaturized gyroscope found in electronic devices It takes the idea of the Foucault pendulum and uses a vibrating element This kind of gyroscope was first used in military applications but has since been adopted for increasing commercial use br br br HRG br The hemispherical resonator gyroscope HRG also called a wine glass gyroscope or mushroom gyro makes use of a thin solid state hemispherical shell anchored by a thick stem This shell is driven to a flexural resonance by electrostatic forces generated by electrodes which are deposited directly onto separate fused quartz structures that surround the shell Gyroscopic effect is obtained from the inertial property of the flexural standing waves br br br VSG or CVG br A vibrating structure gyroscope VSG also called a Coriolis vibratory gyroscope CVG uses a resonator made of different metallic alloys It takes a position between the low accuracy low cost MEMS gyroscope and the higher accuracy and higher cost fiber optic gyroscope Accuracy parameters are increased by using low intrinsic damping materials resonator vacuumization and digital electronics to reduce temperature dependent drift and instability of control signals br High quality wine glass resonators are used for precise sensors like HRG br br br DTG br A dynamically tuned gyroscope DTG is a rotor suspended by a universal joint with flexure pivots The flexure spring stiffness is independent of spin rate However the dynamic inertia from the gyroscopic reaction effect from the gimbal provides negative spring stiffness proportional to the square of the spin speed Howe and Savet Lawrence Therefore at a particular speed called the tuning speed the two moments cancel each other freeing the rotor from torque a necessary condition for an ideal gyroscope br br br Ring laser gyroscope br br A ring laser gyroscope relies on the Sagnac effect to measure rotation by measuring the shifting interference pattern of a beam split into two separate beams which travel around the ring in opposite directions br When the Boeing entered service in it was equipped with the first suitable ring laser gyroscope This gyroscope took many years to develop and the experimental models went through many changes before it was deemed ready for production by the engineers and managers of Honeywell and Boeing It was an outcome of the competition with mechanical gyroscopes which kept improving The reason Honeywell of all companies chose to develop the laser gyro was that they were the only one that didn t have a successful line of mechanical gyroscopes so they wouldn t be competing against themselves The first problem they had to solve was that with laser gyros rotations below a certain minimum could not be detected at all due to a problem called lock in whereby the two beams act like coupled oscillators and pull each other s frequencies toward convergence and therefore zero output The solution was to shake the gyro rapidly so that it never settled into lock in Paradoxically too regular of a dithering motion produced an accumulation of short periods of lock in when the device was at rest at the extremities of its shaking motion This was cured by applying a random white noise to the vibration The material of the block was also changed from quartz to a new glass ceramic Cer Vit made by Owens Corning because of helium leaks br br br Fiber optic gyroscope br br A fiber optic gyroscope also uses the interference of light to detect mechanical rotation The two halves of the split beam travel in opposite directions in a coil of fiber optic cable as long as km Like the ring laser gyroscope it makes use of the Sagnac effect br br br London moment br A London moment gyroscope relies on the quantum mechanical phenomenon whereby a spinning superconductor generates a magnetic field whose axis lines up exactly with the spin axis of the gyroscopic rotor A magnetometer determines the orientation of the generated field which is interpolated to determine the axis of rotation Gyroscopes of this type can be extremely accurate and stable For example those used in the Gravity Probe B experiment measured changes in gyroscope spin axis orientation to better than milliarcseconds degrees or about radians over a one year period This is equivalent to an angular separation the width of a human hair viewed from kilometers mi away br The GP B gyro consists of a nearly perfect spherical rotating mass made of fused quartz which provides a dielectric support for a thin layer of niobium superconducting material To eliminate friction found in conventional bearings the rotor assembly is centered by the electric field from six electrodes After the initial spin up by a jet of helium which brings the rotor to RPM the polished gyroscope housing is evacuated to an ultra high vacuum to further reduce drag on the rotor Provided the suspension electronics remain powered the extreme rotational symmetry lack of friction and low drag will allow the angular momentum of the rotor to keep it spinning for about years br A sensitive DC SQUID that can discriminate changes as small as one quantum or about Wb is used to monitor the gyroscope A precession or tilt in the orientation of the rotor causes the London moment magnetic field to shift relative to the housing The moving field passes through a superconducting pickup loop fixed to the housing inducing a small electric current The current produces a voltage across a shunt resistance which is resolved to spherical coordinates by a microprocessor The system is designed to minimize Lorentz torque on the rotor br br br Other examples br br br Helicopters br br The main rotor of a helicopter acts like a gyroscope Its motion is influenced by the principle of gyroscopic precession which is the concept that a force applied to a spinning object will have a maximum reaction approximately degrees later The reaction may differ from degrees when other stronger forces are in play To change direction helicopters must adjust the pitch angle and the angle of attack br br br Gyro X br Gyro X prototype vehicle created by Alex Tremulis and Thomas Summers in The car utilized gyroscopic precession to drive on two wheels An assembly consisting of a flywheel mounted in a gimbal housing under the hood of the vehicle acted as a large gyroscope The flywheel was rotated by hydraulic pumps creating a gyroscopic effect on the vehicle A precessional ram was responsible for rotating the gyroscope to change the direction of the precessional force to counteract any forces causing the vehicle imbalance The one of a kind prototype is now at the Lane Motor Museum in Nashville Tennessee br br br Consumer electronics br br In addition to being used in compasses aircraft computer pointing devices etc gyroscopes have been introduced into consumer electronics br Since the gyroscope allows the calculation of orientation and rotation designers have incorporated them into modern technology The integration of the gyroscope has allowed for more accurate recognition of movement within a D space than the previous lone accelerometer within a number of smartphones Gyroscopes in consumer electronics are frequently combined with accelerometers for more robust direction and motion sensing Examples of such applications include smartphones such as the Samsung Galaxy Note HTC Titan Nexus iPhone s Nokia PureView and Sony Xperia game console peripherals such as the PlayStation controller and the Wii Remote and virtual reality headsets such as the Oculus Rift br Nintendo has integrated a gyroscope into the Wii console s Wii Remote controller by an additional piece of hardware called Wii MotionPlus It is also included in the DS Wii U GamePad and Nintendo Switch Joy Con and Pro controllers which detect movement when turning and shaking br Cruise ships use gyroscopes to level motion sensitive devices such as self leveling pool tables br An electric powered flywheel gyroscope inserted in a bicycle wheel is sold as an alternative to training wheels Some features of Android phones like PhotoSphere or Camera
