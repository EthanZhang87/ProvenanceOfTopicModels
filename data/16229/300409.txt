id: 300409
Haptic technology also kinaesthetic communication or D touch is technology that can create an experience of touch by applying forces vibrations or motions to the user These technologies can be used to create virtual objects in a computer simulation to control virtual objects and to enhance remote control of machines and devices telerobotics Haptic devices may incorporate tactile sensors that measure forces exerted by the user on the interface The word haptic from the Greek haptikos means tactile pertaining to the sense of touch Simple haptic devices are common in the form of game controllers joysticks and steering wheels br Haptic technology facilitates investigation of how the human sense of touch works by allowing the creation of controlled haptic virtual objects Most researchers distinguish three sensory systems related to sense of touch in humans cutaneous kinaesthetic and haptic All perceptions mediated by cutaneous and kinaesthetic sensibility are referred to as tactual perception The sense of touch may be classified as passive and active and the term haptic is often associated with active touch to communicate or recognize objects br br br History br One of the earliest applications of haptic technology was in large aircraft that use servomechanism systems to operate control surfaces In lighter aircraft without servo systems as the aircraft approached a stall the aerodynamic buffeting vibrations was felt in the pilot s controls This was a useful warning of a dangerous flight condition Servo systems tend to be one way meaning external forces applied aerodynamically to the control surfaces are not perceived at the controls resulting in the lack of this important sensory cue To address this the missing normal forces are simulated with springs and weights The angle of attack is measured and as the critical stall point approaches a stick shaker is engaged which simulates the response of a simpler control system Alternatively the servo force may be measured and the signal directed to a servo system on the control also known as force feedback Force feedback has been implemented experimentally in some excavators and is useful when excavating mixed material such as large rocks embedded in silt or clay It allows the operator to feel and work around unseen obstacles br In the s Paul Bach y Rita developed a vision substitution system using a x array of metal rods that could be raised and lowered producing tactile dots analogous to the pixels of a screen People sitting in a chair equipped with this device could identify pictures from the pattern of dots poked into their backs br The first US patent for a tactile telephone was granted to Thomas D Shannon in An early tactile man machine communication system was constructed by A Michael Noll at Bell Telephone Laboratories Inc in the early s and a patent was issued for his invention in br br In the Aura Interactor vest was developed The vest is a wearable force feedback device that monitors an audio signal and uses electromagnetic actuator technology to convert bass sound waves into vibrations that can represent such actions as a punch or kick The vest plugs into the audio output of a stereo TV or VCR and the audio signal is reproduced through a speaker embedded in the vest br br In Thomas Massie developed the PHANToM Personal HAptic iNTerface Mechanism system It used thimble like receptacles at the end of computerized arms into which a person s fingers could be inserted allowing them to feel an object on a computer screen br In Norwegian Geir Jensen described a wristwatch haptic device with a skin tap mechanism termed Tap in The wristwatch would connect to a mobile phone via Bluetooth and tapping frequency patterns would enable the wearer to respond to callers with selected short messages br In the Apple Watch was launched It uses skin tap sensing to deliver notifications and alerts from the mobile phone of the watch wearer br br br Types of mechanical touch sensing br Human sensing of mechanical loading in the skin is managed by Mechanoreceptors There are a number of types of mechanoreceptors but those present in the finger pad are typically placed into two categories Fast acting FA and slow acting SA SA mechanoreceptors are sensitive to relatively large stresses and at low frequencies while FA mechanoreceptors are sensitive to smaller stresses at higher frequencies The result of this is that generally SA sensors can detect textures with amplitudes greater than micrometers and FA sensors can detect textures with amplitudes less than micrometers down to about micrometer though some research suggests that FA can only detect textures smaller than the fingerprint wavelength FA mechanoreceptors achieve this high resolution of sensing by sensing vibrations produced by friction and an interaction of the fingerprint texture moving over fine surface texture br br br Implementation br Haptic feedback often shortened to just haptics is controlled vibrations at set frequencies and intervals to provide a sensation representative of an in game action this includes bumps knocks and tap of one s hand or fingers br The majority of electronics offering haptic feedback use vibrations and most use a type of eccentric rotating mass ERM actuator consisting of an unbalanced weight attached to a motor shaft As the shaft rotates the spinning of this irregular mass causes the actuator and the attached device to shake Piezoelectric actuators are also employed to produce vibrations and offer even more precise motion than LRAs with less noise and in a smaller platform but require higher voltages than do ERMs and LRAs br br br Controller rumble br br One of the most common forms of haptic feedback in video games is controller rumble In Sega s motorbike game Moto Cross also known as Fonz was the first game to use haptic feedback causing the handlebars to vibrate during a collision with another vehicle br br br Force feedback br Force feedback devices use motors to manipulate the movement of an item held by the user A common use is in automobile driving video games and simulators which turn the steering wheel to simulate forces experienced when cornering a real vehicle Direct drive wheels introduced in are based on servomotors and are the most high end for strength and fidelity type of force feedback racing wheels br In Novint released the Falcon the first consumer D touch device with high resolution three dimensional force feedback This allowed the haptic simulation of objects textures recoil momentum and the physical presence of objects in games br br br Air vortex rings br Air vortex rings are donut shaped air pockets made up of concentrated gusts of air Focused air vortices can have the force to blow out a candle or disturb papers from a few yards away Both Microsoft Research AirWave and Disney Research AIREAL have used air vortices to deliver non contact haptic feedback br br br Ultrasound br Focused ultrasound beams can be used to create a localized sense of pressure on a finger without touching any physical object The focal point that creates the sensation of pressure is generated by individually controlling the phase and intensity of each transducer in an array of ultrasound transducers These beams can also be used to deliver sensations of vibration and to give users the ability to feel virtual D objects The first commercially available ultrasound device was the Stratos Explore by Ultrahaptics that consisted of transducer array board and a Leap motion controller for hand tracking br Another form of tactile feed back results from active touch when a human scans runs their finger over a surface to gain information about a surfaces texture A significant amount of information about a surfaces texture on the micro meter scale can be gathered through this action as vibrations resulting from friction and texture activate mechanoreceptors in the human skin Towards this goal plates can be made to vibrate at an ultrasonic frequency which reduces the friction between the plate and skin br br br Electrical stimulation br Electrical muscle stimulation EMS and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation TENS can be used to create haptic sensations in the skin or muscles Most notable examples include haptic suits Tesla suit Owo haptic vest and wearable armbands Valkyrie EIR In addition to improving immersion e g by simulating bullet hits these technologies are sought to create sensations similar to weight and resistance and can promote muscle training br br br Applications br br br Control br br br Telepresence br Haptic feedback is essential to perform complex tasks via telepresence The Shadow Hand an advanced robotic hand has a total of touch sensors embedded in every joint and finger pad that relay information to the operator This allows tasks such as typing to be performed from a distance An early prototype can be seen in NASA s collection of humanoid robots or robonauts br br br Teleoperation br Teleoperators are remote controlled robotic tools When the operator is given feedback on the forces involved this is called haptic teleoperation The first electrically actuated teleoperators were built in the s at the Argonne National Laboratory by Raymond Goertz to remotely handle radioactive substances Since then the use of force feedback has become more widespread in other kinds of teleoperators such as remote controlled underwater exploration devices br Devices such as medical simulators and flight simulators ideally provide the force feedback that would be felt in real life Simulated forces are generated using haptic operator controls allowing data representing touch sensations to be saved or played back br br br Medicine and dentistry br Haptic interfaces for medical simulation are being developed for training in minimally invasive procedures such as laparoscopy and interventional radiology and for training dental students A Virtual Haptic Back VHB was successfully integrated in the curriculum at the Ohio University College of Osteopathic Medicine Haptic technology has enabled the development of telepresence surgery allowing expert surgeons to operate on patients from a distance As the surgeon makes an incision they feel tactile and resistance feedback as if working directly on the patient br br br Automotive br With the introduction of large touchscreen control panels in vehicle dashboards haptic feedback technology is used to provide confirmation of touch commands without needing the driver to take their eyes off the road Additional contact surfaces for example the steering wheel or seat can also provide haptic information to the driver for example a warning vibration pattern when close to other vehicles br br br Aviation br Force feedback can be used to increase adherence to a safe flight envelope and thus reduce the risk of pilots entering dangerous states of flights outside

a multitouch input device providing vibratory feedback when a user makes contact with the unit Specifically the patent provides for one actuator to induce a feedback vibration while at least one other actuator uses its vibrations to localize the haptic experience by preventing the first set of vibrations from propagating to other areas of the device The patent gives the example of a virtual keyboard however it is also noted that the invention can be applied to any multitouch interface Apple s iPhones and MacBooks featuring the Taptic Engine accomplish their vibrations with a linear resonant actuator LRA which moves a mass in a reciprocal manner by means of a magnetic voice coil similar to how AC electrical signals are translated into motion in the cone of a loudspeaker LRAs are capable of quicker response times than ERMs and thus can transmit more accurate haptic imagery br br br Virtual reality br Haptics are gaining widespread acceptance as a key part of virtual reality
