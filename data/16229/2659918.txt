A power MOSFET is a specific type of metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor MOSFET designed to handle significant power levels Compared to the other power semiconductor devices such as an insulated gate bipolar transistor IGBT or a thyristor its main advantages are high switching speed and good efficiency at low voltages It shares with the IGBT an isolated gate that makes it easy to drive They can be subject to low gain sometimes to a degree that the gate voltage needs to be higher than the voltage under control br The design of power MOSFETs was made possible by the evolution of MOSFET and CMOS technology used for manufacturing integrated circuits since the s The power MOSFET shares its operating principle with its low power counterpart the lateral MOSFET The power MOSFET which is commonly used in power electronics was adapted from the standard MOSFET and commercially introduced in the s br The power MOSFET is the most common power semiconductor device in the world due to its low gate drive power fast switching speed easy advanced paralleling capability wide bandwidth ruggedness easy drive simple biasing ease of application and ease of repair In particular it is the most widely used low voltage less than V switch It can be found in a wide range of applications such as most power supplies DC to DC converters low voltage motor controllers and many other applications br br br History br br The MOSFET was invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in It was a breakthrough in power electronics Generations of MOSFETs enabled power designers to achieve performance and density levels not possible with bipolar transistors br In Hitachi introduced the first vertical power MOSFET which would later be known as the VMOS V groove MOSFET The same year the DMOS double diffused MOSFET with self aligned gate was first reported by Y Tarui Y Hayashi and Toshihiro Sekigawa of the Electrotechnical Laboratory ETL In Jun ichi Nishizawa at Tohoku University invented a power MOSFET for audio which was soon manufactured by Yamaha Corporation for their high fidelity audio amplifiers JVC Pioneer Corporation Sony and Toshiba also began manufacturing amplifiers with power MOSFETs in Siliconix commercially introduced a VMOS in br The VMOS and DMOS developed into what has become known as VDMOS vertical DMOS John Moll s research team at HP Labs fabricated DMOS prototypes in and demonstrated advantages over the VMOS including lower on resistance and higher breakdown voltage The same year Hitachi introduced the LDMOS lateral DMOS a planar type of DMOS Hitachi was the only LDMOS manufacturer between and during which time LDMOS was used in audio power amplifiers from manufacturers such as HH Electronics V series and Ashly Audio and were used for music and public address systems With the introduction of the G digital mobile network in the LDMOS became the most widely used RF power amplifier in mobile networks such as G G and G br Alex Lidow co invented the HexFET a hexagonal type of Power MOSFET at Stanford University in along with Tom Herman The HexFET was commercialized by International Rectifier in The insulated gate bipolar transistor IGBT which combines elements of both the power MOSFET and the bipolar junction transistor BJT was developed by Jayant Baliga at General Electric between and br The superjunction MOSFET is a type of power MOSFET that uses P columns that penetrate the N epitaxial layer The idea of stacking P and N layers was first proposed by Shozo Shirota and Shigeo Kaneda at Osaka University in David J Coe at Philips invented the superjunction MOSFET with alternating p type and n type layers by filing a US patent in which was awarded in br br br Applications br br The power MOSFET is the most widely used power semiconductor device in the world As of the power MOSFET accounts for of the power transistor market ahead of the insulated gate bipolar transistor RF power amplifier and bipolar junction transistor As of over billion power MOSFETs are shipped annually These include the trench power MOSFET which sold over billion units up until February and STMicroelectronics MDmesh superjunction MOSFET which has sold billion units as of br Power MOSFETs are commonly used for a wide range of consumer electronics br RF DMOS also known as RF power MOSFET is a type of DMOS power transistor designed for radio frequency RF applications It is used in various radio and RF applications br Power MOSFETs are widely used in transportation technology which include a wide range of vehicles br In the automotive industry power MOSFETs are widely used in automotive electronics br Power MOSFETs including DMOS LDMOS and VMOS are commonly used for a wide range of other applications br br br Basic structure br br Several structures had been explored in the s when the first commercial power MOSFETs were introduced However most of them have been abandoned at least until recently in favour of the Vertical Diffused MOS VDMOS structure also called Double Diffused MOS or simply DMOS and the LDMOS laterally diffused MOS structure br The cross section of a VDMOS see figure shows the verticality of the device it can be seen that the source electrode is placed over the drain resulting in a current mainly vertical when the transistor is in the on state The diffusion in VDMOS refers to the manufacturing process the P wells see figure are obtained by a diffusion process actually a double diffusion process to get the P and N regions hence the name double diffused br Power MOSFETs have a different structure from the lateral MOSFET as with most power devices their structure is vertical and not planar In a planar structure the current and breakdown voltage ratings are both functions of the channel dimensions respectively width and length of the channel resulting in inefficient use of the silicon real estate With a vertical structure the voltage rating of the transistor is a function of the doping and thickness of the N epitaxial layer see cross section while the current rating is a function of the channel width This makes it possible for the transistor to sustain both high blocking voltage and high current within a compact piece of silicon br LDMOS are power MOSFETs with a lateral structure They are mainly used in high end audio power amplifiers and RF power amplifiers in wireless cellular networks such as G G and G Their advantage is a better behaviour in the saturated region corresponding to the linear region of a bipolar junction transistor than the vertical MOSFETs Vertical MOSFETs are designed for switching applications so they are only used in On or Off states br br br On state resistance br br When the power MOSFET is in the on state see MOSFET for a discussion on operation modes it exhibits a resistive behaviour between the drain and source terminals It can be seen in figure that this resistance called RDSon for drain to source resistance in on state is the sum of many elementary contributions br br RS is the source resistance It represents all resistances between the source terminal of the package to the channel of the MOSFET resistance of the wire bonds of the source metallisation and of the N wells br Rch This is the channel resistance It is inversely proportional to the channel width and for a given die size to the channel density The channel resistance is one of the main contributors to the RDSon of low voltage MOSFETs and intensive work has been carried out to reduce their cell size in order to increase the channel density br Ra is the access resistance It represents the resistance of the epitaxial zone directly under the gate electrode where the direction of the current changes from horizontal in the channel to vertical to the drain contact br RJFET is the detrimental effect of the cell size reduction mentioned above the P implantations see figure form the gates of a parasitic JFET transistor that tend to reduce the width of the current flow br Rn is the resistance of the epitaxial layer As the role of this layer is to sustain the blocking voltage Rn is directly related to the voltage rating of the device A high voltage MOSFET requires a thick low doped layer i e highly resistive whereas a low voltage transistor only requires a thin layer with a higher doping level i e less resistive As a result Rn is the main factor responsible for the resistance of high voltage MOSFETs br RD is the equivalent of RS for the drain It represents the resistance of the transistor substrate the cross section in figure is not at scale the bottom N layer is actually the thickest and of the package connections br br br Breakdown voltage on state resistance trade off br br When in the OFF state the power MOSFET is equivalent to a PIN diode constituted by the P diffusion the N epitaxial layer and the N substrate When this highly non symmetrical structure is reverse biased the space charge region extends principally on the light doped side i e over the N layer This means that this layer has to withstand most of the MOSFET s OFF state drain to source voltage br However when the MOSFET is in the ON state this N layer has no function Furthermore as it is a lightly doped region its intrinsic resistivity is non negligible and adds to the MOSFET s ON state Drain to Source Resistance RDSon this is the Rn resistance in figure br Two main parameters govern both the breakdown voltage and the RDSon of the transistor the doping level and the thickness of the N epitaxial layer The thicker the layer and the lower its doping level the higher the breakdown voltage On the contrary the thinner the layer and the higher the doping level the lower the RDSon and therefore the lower the conduction losses of the MOSFET Therefore it can be seen that there is a trade off in the design of a MOSFET between its voltage rating and its ON state resistance This is demonstrated by the plot in figure br br br Body diode br It can be seen in figure that the source metallization connects both the N and P implantations although the operating principle of the MOSFET only requires the source to be connected to the N zone However if it were this would result in a floating P zone between the N doped source and drain which is equivalent to a NPN transistor with a non connected base Under certain conditions under high drain current when the on state drain to source voltage is in the order of some volts this parasitic NPN transistor would be triggered making the MOSFET uncontrollable The connection of the P implantation to the source metallization shorts the base of the parasitic transistor to its emitter the source of the MOSFET and thus prevents spurious latching This solution however creates a diode between the drain cathode and the source anode of the MOSFET making it able to block current in only one direction br Body diodes may be utilized as freewheeling diodes for inductive loads in configurations such as H bridge or half bridge While these diodes usually have rather high forward voltage drop they can handle large currents and are sufficient in many applications reducing part count and thus device cost and board space To increase efficiency synchronous rectification is often used to minimize the amount of time that the body diode conducts current br br br Switching operation br br Because of their unipolar nature the power MOSFET can switch at very high speed Indeed there is no need to remove minority carriers as with bipolar devices The only intrinsic limitation in commutation speed is due to the internal capacitances of the MOSFET see figure These capacitances must be charged or discharged when the transistor switches This can be a relatively slow process because the current that flows through the gate capacitances is limited by the external driver circuit This circuit will actually dictate the commutation speed of the transistor assuming the power circuit has sufficiently low inductance br br br Capacitances br In the MOSFET datasheets the capacitances are often named Ciss input capacitance drain and source terminal shorted Coss output capacitance gate and source shorted and Crss reverse transfer capacitance source connected to ground The relationship between these capacitances and those described below is br br Where CGS CGD and CDS are respectively the gate to source gate to drain and drain to source capacitances see below Manufacturers prefer to quote Ciss Coss and Crss because they can be directly measured on the transistor However as CGS CGD and CDS are closer to the physical meaning they will be used in the remaining of this article br br br Gate to source capacitance br The CGS capacitance is constituted by the parallel connection of CoxN CoxP and Coxm see figure As the N and P regions are highly doped the two former capacitances can be considered as constant Coxm is the capacitance between the polysilicon gate and the metal source electrode so it is also constant Therefore it is common practice to consider CGS as a constant capacitance i e its value does not depend on the transistor state br br br Gate to drain capacitance br The CGD capacitance can be seen as the connection in series of two elementary capacitances The first one is the oxide capacitance CoxD constituted by the gate electrode the silicon dioxide and the top of the N epitaxial layer It has a constant value The second capacitance CGDj is caused by the extension of the space charge zone when the MOSFET is in off state Therefore it is dependent upon the drain to gate voltage From this the value of CGD is br br The width of the space charge region is given by br br where br br br br br br br S br i br br br br br displaystyle epsilon Si br br is the permittivity of the Silicon q is the electron charge and N is the doping level The value of CGDj can be approximated using the expression of the plane capacitor br br Where AGD is the surface area of the gate drain overlap Therefore it comes br br It can be seen that CGDj and thus CGD is a capacitance whose value is dependent upon the gate to drain voltage As this voltage increases the capacitance decreases When the MOSFET is in on state CGDj is shunted so the gate to drain capacitance remains equal to CoxD a constant value br br br Drain to source capacitance br As the source metallization overlaps the P wells see figure the drain and source terminals are separated by a P N junction Therefore CDS is the junction capacitance This is a non linear capacitance and its value can be calculated using the same equation as for CGDj br br br Other dynamic elements br br br Packaging inductances br To operate the MOSFET must be connected to the external circuit most of the time using wire bonding although alternative techniques are investigated These connections exhibit a parasitic inductance which is in no way specific to the MOSFET technology but has important effects because of the high commutation speeds Parasitic inductances tend to maintain their current constant and generate overvoltage during the transistor turn off resulting in increasing commutation losses br A parasitic inductance can be associated with each terminal of the MOSFET They have different effects br br the gate inductance has little influence assuming it is lower than some hundreds of nanohenries because the current gradients on the gate are relatively slow In some cases however the gate inductance and the input capacitance of the transistor can constitute an oscillator This must be avoided as it results in very high commutation losses up to the destruction of the device On a typical design parasitic inductances are kept low enough to prevent this phenomenon br the drain inductance tends to reduce the drain voltage when the MOSFET turns on so it reduces turn on losses However as it creates an overvoltage during turn off it increases turn off losses br the source parasitic inductance has the same behaviour as the drain inductance plus a feedback effect that makes commutation last longer thus increasing commutation losses br at the beginning of a fast turn on due to the source inductance the voltage at the source on the die will be able to jump up as well as the gate voltage the internal VGS voltage will remain low for a longer time therefore delaying turn on br at the beginning of a fast turn off as current through the source inductance decreases sharply the resulting voltage across it goes negative with respect to the lead outside the package raising the internal VGS voltage keeping the MOSFET on and therefore delaying turn off br br br Limits of operation br br br Gate oxide breakdown br The gate oxide is very thin nm or less so it can only sustain a limited voltage In the datasheets manufacturers often state a maximum gate to source voltage around V and exceeding this limit can result in destruction of the component Furthermore a high gate to source voltage reduces significantly the lifetime of the MOSFET with little to no advantage on RDSon reduction br To deal with this issue a gate driver circuit is often used br br br Maximum drain to source voltage br Power MOSFETs have a maximum specified drain to source voltage when turned off beyond which breakdown may occur Exceeding the breakdown voltage causes the device to conduct potentially damaging it and other circuit elements due to excessive power dissipation br br br Maximum drain current br The drain current must generally stay below a certain specified value maximum continuous drain current It can reach higher values for very short durations of time maximum pulsed drain current sometimes specified for various pulse durations The drain current is limited by heating due to resistive losses in internal components such as bond wires and other phenomena such as electromigration in the metal layer br br br Maximum temperature br The junction temperature TJ of the MOSFET must stay under a specified maximum value for the device to function reliably determined by MOSFET die layout and packaging materials The packaging often limits the maximum junction temperature due to the molding compound and where used epoxy characteristics br The maximum operating ambient temperature is determined by the power dissipation and thermal resistance The junction to case thermal resistance is intrinsic to the device and package the case to ambient thermal resistance is largely dependent on the board mounting layout heatsinking area and air fluid flow br The type of power dissipation whether continuous or pulsed affects the maximum operating temperature due to thermal mass characteristics in general the lower the frequency of pulses for a given power dissipation the higher maximum operating ambient temperature due to allowing a longer interval for the device to cool down Models such as a Foster network can be used to analyze temperature dynamics from power transients br br br Safe operating area br The safe operating area defines the combined ranges of drain current and drain to source voltage the power MOSFET is able to handle without damage It is represented graphically as an area in the plane defined by these two parameters Both drain current and drain to source voltage must stay below their respective maximum values but their product must also stay below the maximum power dissipation the device is able to handle Thus the device cannot be operated at its maximum current and maximum voltage simultaneously br br br Latch up br The equivalent circuit for a power MOSFET consists of one MOSFET in parallel with a parasitic BJT If the BJT turns ON it cannot be turned off since the gate has no control over it This phenomenon is known as latch up which can lead to device destruction The BJT can be turned on due to a voltage drop across the p type body region To avoid latch up the body and the source are typically short circuited within the device package br br br Technology br br br Layout br br br Cellular structure br As described above the current handling capability of a power MOSFET is determined by its gate channel width The gate channel width is the third Z axis dimension of the cross sections pictured br To minimize cost and size it is valuable to keep the transistor s die area size as small as possible Therefore optimizations have been developed to increase the width of the channel surface area i e increase the channel density They mainly consist of creating cellular structures repeated over the whole area of the MOSFET die Several shapes have been proposed for these cells the most famous being the hexagonal shape used in International Rectifier s HEXFET devices br Another way to increase the channel density is to reduce the size of the elementary structure This allows for more cells in a given surface area and therefore more channel width However as the cell size shrinks it becomes more difficult to ensure proper contact of every cell To overcome this a strip structure is often used see figure It is less efficient than a cellular structure of equivalent resolution in terms of channel density but can cope with smaller pitch Another advantage of the planar stripe structure is that it is less susceptible to failure during avalanche breakdown events in which the parasitic bipolar transistor turns on from sufficient forward bias In the cellular structure if the source terminal of any one cell is poorly contacted then it becomes much more likely that the parasitic bipolar transistor latches on during an avalanche breakdown event Because of this MOSFETs utilizing a planar stripe structure can only fail during avalanche breakdown due to extreme thermal stress br br br Structures br br br P substrate power MOSFET br A P substrate MOSFET often called PMOS is a MOSFET with opposite doping types N instead of P and P instead of N in the cross section in figure This MOSFET is made using a P type substrate with a P epitaxy As the channel sits in a N region this transistor is turned on by a negative gate to source voltage This makes it desirable in a buck converter where one of the terminals of the switch is connected to the high side of the input voltage with a N MOSFET this configuration requires to apply to

higher than a N MOSFET with the same dimensions br br br VMOS br The VMOS structure has a V groove at the gate region and was used for the first commercial devices br br br UMOS br In this power MOSFET structure also called trench MOS the gate electrode is buried in a trench etched in the silicon This results in a vertical channel The main interest of the structure is the absence of the JFET effect The name of the structure comes from the U shape of the trench br br br Super junction deep trench technology br Especially for voltages beyond V some manufacturers including Infineon Technologies with its CoolMOS products have begun to use a charge compensation principle With this technology the resistance of the epitaxial layer which is the biggest contributor more than to the device resistance of high voltage MOSFETs can be reduced by a factor of greater than br Seeking to improve the manufacturing efficiency and reliability of super junction MOSFETs Renesas Electronics developed a super junction structure with a deep trench process technique This technology entails etching trenches in the low impurity N type material to form P type regions This process overcomes problems inherent to the multi level epitaxial growth approach and results in extremely low on resistance and reduced internal capacitance br Due to the increased p n junction area a super junction
