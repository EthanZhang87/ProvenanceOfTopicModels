Gun Fight known as Western Gun in Japan and Europe is a multidirectional shooter arcade video game designed by Tomohiro Nishikado and released by Taito in Japan and Europe and by Midway in North America Based around two Old West cowboys armed with revolvers and squaring off in a duel it was the first video game to depict human to human combat The Midway version was also the first video game to use a microprocessor instead of TTL The game s concept was adapted from Sega s arcade electro mechanical game Gun Fight br The game was a global commercial success In Japan Western Gun was among the top ten highest grossing arcade video games of In the United States Gun Fight sold arcade cabinets and was the third highest grossing arcade game of second highest grossing arcade game of and fifth highest arcade game of br It was ported to the Bally Astrocade video game console as a built in game in and later the Atari bit computers br br br Gameplay br Western Gun is a single screen shooter where two players compete in an Old West gun fight It was the first video game to depict human to human combat When shot the characters fall to the ground and the words GOT ME appear above the body The game has two joysticks per player an eight way joystick for moving the computerized cowboy and the other for changing the shooting direction Unlike later dual stick games Western Gun has the movement joystick on the right br Obstacles between the characters block shots such as a cactus and in later levels stagecoaches The guns have limited ammunition with each player given six bullets A round ends if both players run out of ammo Gunshots can ricochet off the top and bottom edges of the playfield allowing for indirect hits br Taito s original Western Gun allows the two players to move around anywhere on the screen Midway s version Gun Fight restricts each player to their respective portions of the screen and also increased the size of the characters br br br Development br Both Western Gun and Gun Fight have artwork of Wild West cowboys on the cabinet with matching in game graphics featuring cacti rocks and human characters and a covered wagon in Gun Fight These cartoon like humans were in contrast to earlier games which used miniature shapes to represent abstract blocks or spaceships br The original game Western Gun was created by Tomohiro Nishikado for Taito The game s concept was adapted from a Sega arcade electro mechanical game also called Gun Fight which was released in In that game two players control cowboy figurines on opposing sides of a playfield full of obstacles with each player attempting to shoot the opponent s cowboy The cowboy figurines were adapted into character sprites with both players able to maneuver across a landscape while shooting each other It was the second game by Nishikado to use human character sprites after a sports video game he designed for Taito Basketball which was released as TV Basketball by Midway in North America br Taito licensed Western Gun to Midway for release in North America one of the first such licenses after the scrolling racing game Speed Race also designed by Nishikado and the sports game Basketball The title Western Gun while making perfect sense for Japanese audiences in that it conveyed the setting and theme as simply as possible sounded odd to American audiences so it was renamed Gun Fight for its American localization br Taito s version was based on discrete logic When Dave Nutting adapted the game for Midway he decided to base it on the Intel which made Gun Fight the first video game to use a microprocessor Nutting s company Dave Nutting Associates had already used microprocessor technology in prototypes of arcade pinball machines and the first arcade pinball machine to include a microprocessor The Spirit of by Mirco Games used this technology under license br br Midway s version which had a black and white raster monitor with a transparent yellow screen overlay used bitmapped framebuffer technology to display the game text and graphics including its animated human like characters To make the animation fast and smooth the game included a special barrel shifter circuit built from multiple discrete chips The microprocessor used this to shift each pattern of picture bits byte by byte to the proper horizontal bit offset reading back each shifted byte and then writing it into the framebuffer The like other microprocessors of its era had shift instructions that could only shift by a single bit position With the shifter circuit the microprocessor could quickly shift a picture byte by several bit positions giving it more time for other work A similar shifter circuit was used in later Midway and Taito games whose hardware was based on Gun Fight such as Sea Wolf and Space Invaders In some later Space Invaders derivatives such as Taito s Space Invaders Part II of this circuit is a Fujitsu MB a single chip implementation of the barrel shifter br Midway s version increased the size of the character sprites while at the same time restricting each character s movement to their respective portions of the screen Nishikado believed that his original version was more fun than Midway s version but he was impressed with the Midway machine s improved graphics and smoother animation This led him to design microprocessors into his subsequent games including the shoot em up Space Invaders br br br Reception br In Japan Western Gun was among the top ten highest grossing arcade video games of br In the United States following its November release there Gun
