Kempston Micro Electronics was an electronics company based in Kempston Bedfordshire England specialising in computer joysticks and related home computer peripherals during the s br The Kempston Interface a peripheral which allowed a joystick using the de facto Atari joystick port standard to be connected to the ZX Spectrum was one of the most widely used add ons to the machine br br br Interface br br The Kempston Interface is a joystick interface used on the ZX Spectrum series of computers that allows controllers complying with the de facto Atari joystick port standard using the DE connector to be used with the machine br The interface itself would be attached to the computer s rear expansion port with a single joystick port on the front or top of the system br Apart from implementing existing joystick interfacing modes they produced their own standard which delivered the joystick state on the Z bus at port read in BASIC using IN This meant that the joystick did not produce key presses like the other standards such as Cursor and the method was soon borrowed by other interface manufacturers and became quite popular br It was one of the most widely supported standards on the machine coming out as the clear winner against other standards such as Protek and AGF s cursor based solution and the Fuller standard during the days of the K Spectrum br When Amstrad released the ZX Spectrum the computer featured a built in joystick interface that was software compatible with Sinclair s ZX Interface standard However the bundled SJS joystick was electrically incompatible with the Atari standard The Interface standard simulated keypresses on the numerical keys to and to being left right down up fire for the left and right joysticks respectively and hence were ideal for games with no official joystick support but in which the keys could be redefined br Inserting or removing the joystick interface when the computer was turned on was inadvisable as it would almost certainly damage the computer hardware br br br Mouse br x axis at port br y axis at port br two buttons at port br br br Joysticks br br The Formula is based on the Quickshot and released June br The Score Board has a base similar in size to a K Spectrum with two fire buttons Released June br The Competition Pro has a square base two large red buttons for left or right handed use and a black pommel stick It uses the Atari standard DE connector and was primarily designed to work with the ZX Spectrum Kempston joystick interface it also works with the compatible ports of other home computers such as the Amstrad CPC Commodore VIC and later Amiga and Atari ST An Atari model uses the existing CX controller for the keypad functionality br br br
