title: Direct-drive sim racing wheel
id: 68632404
A direct drive simulator steering wheel sometimes abbreviated DD is a simulator steering wheel with a direct drive mechanism between the drive and output i e without gearing as opposed to simulator steering wheels with reduction gearing via gears or belts and is used similarly as with other simulator steering wheels for providing torque feedback often called force feedback so that the driver through movement in the steering wheel gets an interface for sensing what is happening to the car in the simulator It is an example of human computer interaction in driving simulators racing simulators and racing video games and is an example of haptic technology br Direct drive steering wheels typically differ from geared or belted sim racing wheels by being stronger having more torque and being able to more accurately reproduce details from the simulator They are typically constructed using a phase brushless AC servomotor on more expensive models or sometimes a hybrid stepper servomotor or only a stepper motor on very affordable models br br br History br br Direct drive mechanisms for use in industrial arms began to be possible in the s with the use of rare earth magnets of which today the most commonly used are neodymium magnets br Before the s servo motors were not powerful enough did not have enough torque to be used directly and therefore reduction gears or mechanical belts were added to the motor to leverage and multiply its power Higher power motors were not feasible due to the expensive rare earth materials needed to build them This problem was surpassed in the s with the development of less expensive high power magnets br In direct drive sim steering wheels were introduced in large scale to the consumer mass market as a more advanced alternative to gear and belt driven steering wheels The first commercially broadly available direct drive wheel base was released in by the UK based Leo Bodnar Electronics after having been retailing to racing teams and professional centers since It was followed in by the US based SimXperience AccuForce V and by the first do it yourself open source hardware OpenSimwheel or OSW kits for users with good technical knowledge br In a preliminary comparison of gear driven and direct drive wheels in the Hz frequency range for a study on hard real time multibody simulation and high fidelity steering wheel force feedback concluded that direct drive wheels are preferable br Simucube was one of the manufacturers who previously provided Open Sim Wheel kits and is a brand name owned by the Finnish manufacturer Granite Devices which also supplies driver electronics for controlling servomotors and stepper motors both for sim racing and industrial use Granite Devices started as a hobby project by the Finn Kontkanen Tero when he was building a CNC milling machine and realised that there was many alternating current servomotors of high quality on the market but that driver electronics for controlling such motors was expensive or hard to come by He investigated the operation of AC servos and realized that it was possible to make usable control electronics with a handful of the latest electronic components and some real time algorithms The development of the controller then took around a year The electronics are based on an IONI motherboard and STM F and a proprietary firmware called MMos An open source version of this software has been planned for release but has not yet been released as of br br br Performance metrics br Issues quality and performance indicators of direct drive wheels and of sim racing wheels in general include detail and fidelity of force feedback smooth torque transmission nearly zero backlash rotary encoder resolution clipping dynamic range torque ripple cogging torque drivers and digital signal processing with control electronics signal filtering backdrive friction low inertia damping fast response precise positioning electromagnetic interference and latency br br br Construction br br br Motors br br The Leo Bodnar OSW kits Sim pli city and VRS systems are based on industrial servo motors typically MiGE Lenze or Kollmorgen motors while SimXperience s AccuForce Frex Simucube which initially used a MiGE motor Fanatec and Simagic use custom made motors The types of motors used vary between high end phase brushless servomotors and lower budget hybrid stepper servo motors br br br Control electronics br Other than the motor other parts of a complete direct drive wheelbase include a rotary encoder the position sensor a controller board that translate the FFB data from the game into steering wheel forces and a motor driver board servo drive which fits into a slot of the controller board and that controls the position velocity and torque output of the motor Examples of encoders are the Biss C and the SinCos encoders an example of a controller board is the Simucube board and some examples of motor driver boards are the IONI and the Argon ones br br br Torque br The torque says something about how powerful the engine is and can be specified in two ways br br Continuous torque the greatest load of which the motor still can perform continuous movement at a continuous speed and thus performing continuous work br Stall torque the load which will cause the motor to stop so that it can no longer move and thus produces a holding torque but not performing any work br The latter always gives a higher number in newton meters and is therefore the number that usually is communicated the most by manufacturers to consumers but is actually a less useful specification since the steering wheel in theory does not perform any work when rotation has stopped One must therefore be aware of the type of torque specification given when comparing two motors The relationship between the continuous torque and stall torque can vary between motors and can say something about the motor characteristics responsiveness versus strength br For comparison usually around Nm is experienced in a street car and on steering wheels with very high torque e g Nm it may therefore be appropriate to adjust the torque down in the software However the stronger motors will often have a faster slew rate the time an amplifier takes to respond to a signal which gives better steering response and more realism br br br Steering wheel mount br Similar to many real world racing cars sim racing steering wheels usually come with a bolt circle of mm which means the wheel is mounted to the base via evenly spaced out screws along a mm circle on the steering wheel Other bolt circles are sometimes used br Some steering wheels attach to the base via quick release as is commonly seen on many real world racing cars and these come in many varieties Proprietary quick releases e g Fanatec QR or Simucube SQR the latter which has a wedge shaped dovetail or standardized quick releases such as the D spec used by many manufacturers including SimXperience Simagic Moza IMMSource D spec couplers are built to the same pattern as the NRG quick coupler approved for use in real world racing cars per SFI Spec Formerly another common aftermarket quick release has been the Q R type not to be confused with the Fanatec QR Some quick releases have often proprietary integrated contact pins for transferring power and data to buttons and displays on the wheel but these usually do not work across manufacturers Others instead use wireless transmission via Bluetooth and inductive magnetic power transfer via the quick release If using a steering wheel and base from two different manufacturers it is usually possible to connect the steering wheel electronics to the base via a separate USB cable for example connecting between USB C Micro Mini or Type B interfaces on the base and wheel br br br Base mount br On bases with a high torque the most robust mounting is usually achieved using an industry standard front mounted flange mount and this is often preferred among sim racers as such base mounts usually are less inclined to bend during heavy steering movements This typically gives a shorter lever and therefore more sturdy mounting due to less torque on the mounting interface A de facto industry standard among sim wheels which again stems from a widely used mechanical industry standard is a front mount with a bolt circle measuring mm diameter and metric M screws which means that four screws are evenly placed along a circle measuring mm in diameter This roughly corresponds to a square of mm mm which is often quoted as a square pattern with mm long sides br There are also a number of other proprietary patterns for mounting the base to a sim racing cockpit or table Some of these instead have mounting on the sides or underside of the base br br br List of direct drive bases br Sorted chronologically by time of introduction br br Legend br br br See also br Sim racing wheel Comparison of racing wheels for a comparison of
