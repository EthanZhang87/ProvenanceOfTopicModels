title: Electronic game
id: 1689753
An electronic game is a game that uses electronics to create an interactive system with which a player can play Video games are the most common form today and for this reason the two terms are often used interchangeably There are other common forms of electronic game including handheld electronic games standalone systems e g pinball slot machines or electro mechanical arcade games and exclusively non visual products e g audio games br br br Teletype games br br The earliest form of computer game to achieve any degree of mainstream use was the text based Teletype game Teletype games lack video display screens and instead present the game to the player by printing a series of characters on paper which the player reads as it emerges from the platen Practically this means that each action taken will require a line of paper and thus a hard copy record of the game remains after it has been played This naturally tends to reduce the size of the gaming universe or alternatively to require a great amount of paper As computer screens became standard during the rise of the third generation computer text based command line driven language parsing Teletype games transitioned into visual interactive fiction allowing for greater depth of gameplay and reduced paper requirements This transition was accompanied by a simultaneous shift from the mainframe environment to the personal computer Several of these subsequently were ported to systems with video displays eliminating the need for a teletype printer br Examples of text based Teletype games include br br The Oregon Trail br Trek br Dungeon br Super Star Trek br Colossal Cave Adventure br Zork br br br Electronic handhelds br br The earliest form of dedicated console handheld electronic games are characterized by their size and portability Used to play interactive games handheld electronic games are often miniaturized versions of video games The controls display and speakers are all part of a single unit and rather than a general purpose screen made up of a grid of small pixels they usually have custom displays designed to play one game This simplicity means they can be made as small as a digital watch which they sometimes are The visual output of these games can range from a few small light bulbs or LED lights to calculator like alphanumerical screens later these were mostly displaced by liquid crystal and Vacuum fluorescent display screens with detailed images and in the case of VFD games color Handhelds were at their most popular from the late s into the early s They are both the predecessors to and inexpensive alternatives to the handheld game console br Examples of handheld electronic games include br br Mattel Auto Race br Simon br Merlin br Game Watch br MB Omni br Bandai LCD Solarpower br Entex Adventure Vision br Lights Out br br br Pinball machines and similar devices br br Since the introduction of electromechanics to the pinball machine in s Contact pinball has become increasingly dependent on electronics as a means to keep score on the backglass and to provide quick impulses on the playfield as with bumpers and flippers for exciting gameplay Unlike games with electronic visual displays pinball has retained a physical display that is viewed on a table through glass Similar forms of game such as pachinko have also become increasingly dependent on electronics in modern times br Examples of pinball games include br br The Addams Family br Indiana Jones The Pinball Adventure br Star Trek The Next Generation br List of pinball machines br br br Redemption games and merchandisers br br Redemption games such as Skee Ball have been around since the days of the carnival game well earlier than the development of the electronic game however with modern advances many of these games have been re worked to employ electronic scoring and other game mechanics The use of electronic scoring mechanisms has allowed carnival or arcade attendants to take a more passive role simply exchanging prizes for electronically dispensed coupons and occasionally emptying out the coin boxes or banknote acceptors of the more popular games br Merchandisers such as the Claw Crane are more recent electronic games in which the player must accomplish a seemingly simple task e g remotely controlling a mechanical arm with sufficient ability to earn a reward br Examples of redemption games include br br Whac A Mole br Skee Ball modern electric versions br Examples of merchandisers include br br Claw crane br br br Slot machines br br The slot machine is a casino gambling machine with three or more reels which spin when a button is pushed Though slot machines were originally operated mechanically by a lever on the side of the machine the one arm instead of an electronic button on the front panel as used on today s models many modern machines still have a legacy lever in addition to the button on the front Slot machines include a currency detector that validates the coin or money inserted to play The machine pays off based on patterns of symbols visible on the front of the machine when it stops Modern computer technology has resulted in many variations on the slot machine concept br br br Audio games br br An audio game is a game played on an electronic device such as but not limited to a personal computer It is similar to a video game save that the only feedback device is audible rather than visual Audio games originally started out as blind accessible games but recent interest in audio games has come from sound artists game accessibility researchers mobile game developers and mainstream video gamers Most audio games run on a computer platform although there are a few audio games for handhelds and video game consoles Audio games feature the same variety of genres as video games such as adventure games racing games etc br Examples of audio games include br br Real Sound Kaze no Regret br Chillingham br BBBeat br br br Tabletop games br A tabletop audio game is an audio game that is designed to be played on a table rather than a handheld game br Examples of tabletop audio games include br br Brain Shift br Who Wants to be a Millionaire br Electronic Battleship Milton Bradley br Electronic battleship is a portable game with the objective of marking all enemy ships When an enemy ship is marked an electronic battleship makes an explosion sound br Milton Bradley created the Electronic battleship game in and was later acquired by Hasbro in br Modern day electronic battleship features an interactive missile launching platform and advanced mode that features custom special attack pegs br Tabletop non audio games include br br Electronic Chess Boards DGT br DGT is a line of electronic chess boards that are commonly used in FIDE chess tournaments and national tournaments such as USCF Electronic Chess boards can be used to broadcast games live br br br Video games br br A video game is a game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device The word video in video game traditionally referred to a raster display device However with the popular use of the term video game it now implies any type of display device br Term digital game has been offered by some in academia as an alternative term br br br Arcade games br br Electronic video arcade games make extensive use of solid state electronics and integrated circuits In the past coin operated arcade video games generally used custom per game hardware often with multiple CPUs highly specialized sound and graphics chips and or boards and the latest in computer graphics display technology Recent arcade game hardware is often based on modified video game console hardware or high end pc components Arcade games may feature specialized ambiance or control accessories including fully enclosed dynamic cabinets with force feedback controls dedicated lightguns rear projection displays reproductions of car or plane cockpits and even motorcycle or horse shaped controllers or even highly dedicated controllers such as dancing mats and fishing rods These accessories are usually what set modern arcade games apart from PC or console games and they provide an experience that some gamers consider more immersing and realistic br Examples of arcade games include br br Galaxy Game br Pong br Space Invaders br Galaxian br Pac Man br Battlezone br Donkey Kong br Street Fighter II br Mortal Kombat br Fatal Fury br Killer Instinct br King of Fighters br Time Crisis br Dance Dance Revolution br DrumMania br House of the Dead br br br Computer games br br A personal computer video game also known as a computer game or simply PC game is a video game played on a personal computer This is opposed to video game consoles or arcade machines which are not considered personal computers Computer games became a form of video games and since the earliest days of the medium visual displays such as the cathode ray tube have been used to relay game information br br br Console games br br A console game is a form of interactive multimedia used for entertainment The game consists of manipulable images and usually sounds generated by a video game console and displayed on a television or similar audio video system The game itself is usually controlled and manipulated using a handheld device connected to the console called a controller The controller generally contains a number of buttons and directional controls such as analog joysticks each of which has been assigned a purpose for interacting with and controlling the images on the screen The display speakers console and controls of a console can also be incorporated into one small object known as a handheld game console br Console games are most frequently differentiated between by their compatibility with consoles belonging in the following categories br br Traditional console also called home console A multi game system that uses the screen of a television to produce graphics br Handheld game console A multi game system the screen and controls of which are compacted into a single handheld device br Dedicated console A typically single game system of either the Plug and play variety or the LCD game br br br Hybrid or combined games br Game hybridization refers to the integration of an interactive electronic component into a game A hybrid or combined game is any tabletop game where an electronic device and or application is an element crucial to the gameplay These games are a catalyst for creating new game mechanics Important consequences of this technology are the possible substitution of the gamemaster or person who leads a game for an application or device which can be more fair with less room for bias cheating or favouritism and can be intelligently randomised the possibility of using artificial intelligence and machine learning in games greater randomisation of events possibility of conducting fast and advanced mathematical calculations making some complex games easier or available to a wider group of consumers and enhanced player immersion with the aid of various stimuli like sound or animation br One may categorize hybrid games as follows br br Purpose built devices Where the game uses a device that has certain functions like an electronic dice or spinner to play out the game An example would be Monopoly Electronic Banking by Hasbro where all players have an electronic card which carries virtual Monopoly currency and use a machine to increase and deduct their earnings br Beacon technology games are mobile digital games that employ BLE Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons to track and control players movements and actions An example Artifact Technologies created a mobile digital board game called BattleKasters where players physically walk around to cast spells or unlock cards br Augmented Reality board games that interact with a mobile device and immerse the player in the virtual environment through animation sound and or vibrations Example Roar by Trefl which utilises sound as part of the gameplay br br br Other br Electronics have been adapted for use in a wide range of applications Board games such as Dark Tower for instance rely heavily upon electronics Non traditional electronic games such as Rubik s Revolution or electronic toys which blur the boundaries between games and toys such as the Electronic Magic Ball Date Ball or the Electronic Ouija Board are often considered electronic games as well br br br Electro mechanical games br br These were types of arcade games similar to arcade video games but relying on electro mechanical components to produce sounds or images rather than a cathode ray tube screen These were popular during the s and s but video games eventually overtook them in popularity during the golden age of video arcade games that began in br A popular early example was Sega s Periscope in It was an early submarine simulator and light gun shooter which used lights and plastic waves to simulate sinking ships from a submarine Sega later produced gun games which resemble first person shooter video games but were in fact electro mechanical games that used rear image projection in a manner similar to the ancient zoetrope to produce moving animations on a screen An early example of this was the light gun game Duck Hunt which Sega released in it featured animated moving targets on a screen printed out the player s score on a ticket and had sound effects that were volume controllable br br br Non human games br With the development of technology geared toward electronic entertainment of animals typically pets video games for pets have also been created Since the majority of animals lack opposable thumbs the fine motor skills required for use in most gaming is unavailable to these animals Furthermore the visual perception of many animals is influenced by a different visible spectrum than humans Techniques that de emphasize manual control and visual components have been developed to circumvent these problems beginning with the development of television for pets From this point developers have branched out into the realm of electronic games with such products as Mice Arena for mice Chicken Petman and Cyberpounce for cats br br br
