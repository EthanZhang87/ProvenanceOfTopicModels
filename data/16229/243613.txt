A network interface controller NIC also known as a network interface card network adapter LAN adapter and physical network interface is a computer hardware component that connects a computer to a computer network br Early network interface controllers were commonly implemented on expansion cards that plugged into a computer bus The low cost and ubiquity of the Ethernet standard means that most newer computers have a network interface built into the motherboard or is contained into a USB connected dongle br Modern network interface controllers offer advanced features such as interrupt and DMA interfaces to the host processors support for multiple receive and transmit queues partitioning into multiple logical interfaces and on controller network traffic processing such as the TCP offload engine br br br Purpose br The network controller implements the electronic circuitry required to communicate using a specific physical layer and data link layer standard such as Ethernet or Wi Fi This provides a base for a full network protocol stack allowing communication among computers on the same local area network LAN and large scale network communications through routable protocols such as Internet Protocol IP br The NIC allows computers to communicate over a computer network either by using cables or wirelessly The NIC is both a physical layer and data link layer device as it provides physical access to a networking medium and for IEEE and similar networks provides a low level addressing system through the use of MAC addresses that are uniquely assigned to network interfaces br br br Implementation br br Network controllers were originally implemented as expansion cards that plugged into a computer bus The low cost and ubiquity of the Ethernet standard means that most new computers have a network interface controller built into the motherboard Newer server motherboards may have multiple network interfaces built in The Ethernet capabilities are either integrated into the motherboard chipset or implemented via a low cost dedicated Ethernet chip A separate network card is typically no longer required unless additional independent network connections are needed or some non Ethernet type of network is used A general trend in computer hardware is towards integrating the various components of systems on a chip and this is also applied to network interface cards br An Ethernet network controller typically has an P C socket where the network cable is connected Older NICs also supplied BNC or AUI connections Ethernet network controllers typically support Mbit s Ethernet Mbit s Ethernet and Mbit s Ethernet varieties Such controllers are designated as meaning that they can support data rates of or Mbit s Gigabit Ethernet NICs are also available and as of November are beginning to be available on computer motherboards br br Modular designs like SFP and SFP are highly popular especially for fiber optic communication These define a standard receptacle for media dependent transceivers so users can easily adapt the network interface to their needs br LEDs adjacent to or integrated into the network connector inform the user of whether the network is connected and when data activity occurs br The NIC may include ROM to store its factory assigned MAC address br The NIC may use one or more of the following techniques to indicate the availability of packets to transfer br br Polling is where the CPU examines the status of the peripheral under program control br Interrupt driven I O is where the peripheral alerts the CPU that it is ready to transfer data br NICs may use one or more of the following techniques to transfer packet data br br Programmed input output where the CPU moves the data to or from the NIC to memory br Direct memory access DMA where a device other than the CPU assumes control of the system bus to move data to or from the NIC to memory This removes load from the CPU but requires more logic on the card In addition a packet buffer on the NIC may not be required and latency can be reduced br br br Performance and advanced functionality br br Multiqueue NICs provide multiple transmit and receive queues allowing packets received by the NIC to be assigned to one of its receive queues The NIC may distribute incoming traffic between the receive queues using a hash function Each receive queue is assigned to a separate interrupt by routing each of those interrupts to different CPUs or CPU cores processing of the interrupt requests triggered by the network traffic received by a single NIC can be distributed improving performance br The hardware based distribution of the interrupts described above is referred to as receive side scaling RSS Purely software implementations also exist such as the receive packet steering RPS receive flow steering RFS and Intel Flow Director Further performance improvements can be achieved by routing the interrupt requests to the CPUs or cores executing the applications that are the ultimate destinations for network packets that generated the interrupts This technique improves locality of reference and results in higher overall performance reduced latency and better hardware utilization because of the higher utilization of CPU caches and fewer required context switches br With multi queue NICs additional performance improvements can be achieved by distributing outgoing traffic among different transmit queues By assigning different transmit queues to different CPUs or CPU cores internal operating system contentions can be avoided This approach is usually referred to as transmit packet steering XPS br Some products feature NIC partitioning NPAR also known as port partitioning that uses SR IOV virtualization to divide a single Gigabit Ethernet NIC into multiple discrete virtual NICs with dedicated bandwidth which are presented to the firmware and operating system as separate PCI device functions br Some NICs provide a TCP offload engine to offload processing of the entire TCP IP stack to the network controller It is primarily used with high speed network interfaces such as Gigabit Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet for which the processing overhead of the network stack becomes significant br br Some NICs offer integrated field programmable gate arrays FPGAs for user programmable processing of network traffic before it reaches the host computer allowing for significantly reduced latencies in time sensitive workloads Moreover some NICs offer complete low latency TCP IP stacks running on integrated FPGAs in combination with userspace libraries that intercept networking operations usually performed by the operating system kernel Solarflare s open source OpenOnload network stack that runs on Linux is an example This kind of functionality is usually referred to as user level networking br br br See also br Converged network adapter CNA br Host adapter br Intel Data Direct I O DDIO br Loopback
