title: Computer port (hardware)
id: 4971262
A computer port is a hardware piece on a computer where an electrical connector can be plugged to link the device to external devices such as another computer a peripheral device or network equipment br Electronically the several conductors where the port and cable contacts connect provide a method to transfer data signals between devices br Bent pins are easier to replace on a cable than on a connector attached to a computer so it was common to use female connectors for the fixed side of an interface br Computer ports in common use cover a wide variety of shapes such as round PS etc rectangular FireWire etc square Telephone plug trapezoidal D Sub the old printer port was a DB etc There is some standardization to physical properties and function For instance most computers have a keyboard port currently a Universal Serial Bus USB like outlet referred to as USB Port into which the keyboard is connected br Physically identical connectors may be used for widely different standards especially on older personal computer systems or systems not generally designed according to the current Microsoft Windows compatibility guides For example a pin D subminiature connector on the original IBM PC could have been used for monochrome video color analog video in two incompatible standards a joystick interface or a MIDI musical instrument digital control interface The original IBM PC also had two identical pin DIN connectors one used for the keyboard the second for a cassette recorder interface the two were not interchangeable The smaller mini DIN connector has been variously used for the keyboard and two different kinds of mouse older Macintosh family computers used the mini DIN for a serial port or for a keyboard connector with different standards than the IBM descended systems br br br Electrical signal transfer br Electronically hardware ports can almost always be divided into two groups based on the signal transfer br br Analog ports br Digital ports br Parallel ports send multiple bits at the same time over several sets of wires br Serial ports send and receive one bit at a time via a single wire pair Ground and br After ports are connected they typically require handshaking where transfer type transfer rate and other necessary information is shared before data is sent br Hot swappable ports can be connected while equipment is running Almost all ports on personal computers are hot swappable br Plug and play ports are designed so that the connected devices automatically start handshaking as soon as the hot swapping is done USB ports and FireWire ports are plug and play br Auto detect or auto detection ports are usually plug and play but they offer another type of convenience An auto detect port may automatically determine what kind of device has been attached but it also determines what purpose the port itself should have For example some sound cards allow plugging in several different types of audio speakers then a dialogue box pops up on the computer screen asking whether the speaker is left right front or rear for surround sound installations The user s response determines the purpose of the port which is physically a tip ring sleeve mini jack Some auto detect ports can even switch between input and output based on context br As of manufacturers have nearly standardized colors associated with ports on personal computers although there are no guarantees The following is a short list br br Orange purple or grey Keyboard PS br Green Mouse PS br Blue or magenta Parallel printer DB br Amber Serial DB or DB br Pastel pink Microphone stereo TRS minijack br Pastel green Speaker stereo TRS minijack br FireWire ports used with video equipment among other devices can be either pin or pin The two extra conductors in the pin connection carry electrical power This is why a self powered device such as a camcorder often connects with a cable that is pins on the camera side and pins on the computer side the two power conductors simply being ignored This is also why laptop computers usually have only pin FireWire ports as they cannot provide enough power to meet requirements for devices needing the power provided by pin connections br Optical light fiber microwave and other technologies i e quantum have different kinds of connections as metal wires are not effective for signal transfers with these technologies Optical connections are usually a polished glass or plastic interface possibly with an oil that lessens refraction between the two interface surfaces Microwaves are conducted through a pipe which can be seen on a large scale by examining microwave towers with funnels on them leading to pipes br Hardware port trunking HPT is a technology that allows multiple hardware ports to be combined into a single group effectively creating a single connection with a higher Bandwidth sometimes referred to as a double barrel approach This technology also provides a higher degree of fault tolerance because a failure on one port may just mean a slow down rather than a dropout By contrast in software port trunking SPT two agents websites channels etc are bonded into one with the same effectiveness i e ISDN B K plus B K equals data throughput of K br br br Types of ports br br br Digital Visual Interface br br Digital Visual Interface br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br
