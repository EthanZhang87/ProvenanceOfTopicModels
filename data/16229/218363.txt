The United States Patent and Trademark Office USPTO is an agency in the U S Department of Commerce that serves as the national patent office and trademark registration authority for the United States The USPTO s headquarters are in Alexandria Virginia after a move from the Crystal City area of neighboring Arlington Virginia br The USPTO is unique among federal agencies because it operates solely on fees collected by its users and not on taxpayer dollars Its operating structure is like a business in that it receives requests for services applications for patents and trademark registrations and charges fees projected to cover the cost of performing the services it provide s br The Office is headed by the Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office currently held by Kathi Vidal as of April Andrei Iancu was the former director of the USPTO until he left office on January br The USPTO cooperates with the European Patent Office EPO and the Japan Patent Office JPO as one of the Trilateral Patent Offices The USPTO is also a Receiving Office an International Searching Authority and an International Preliminary Examination Authority for international patent applications filed in accordance with the Patent Cooperation Treaty br br br Mission br The legal basis for the United States patent system is the Copyright Clause in Section of Article I of the U S Constitution which gives Congress the power to grant patents and copyrights on a national basis Trademark law on the other hand is considered to be authorized by the Commerce Clause br br The Congress shall have Power To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries br The USPTO maintains a permanent interdisciplinary historical record of all U S patent applications in order to fulfill objectives outlined in the United States Constitution The PTO s mission is to promote industrial and technological progress in the United States and strengthen the national economy by br br Administering the laws relating to patents and trademarks br Advising the Secretary of Commerce the President of the United States and the administration on patent trademark and copyright protection and br Providing advice on the trade related aspects of intellectual property br br br Structure br br The USPTO is headquartered at the Alexandria Campus consisting of buildings in a city like development surrounded by ground floor retail and high rise residential buildings between the Metro stations of King Street station the main search building is two blocks due south of the King Street station and Eisenhower Avenue station where the actual Alexandria Campus is located between Duke Street on the North to Eisenhower Avenue on the South and between John Carlyle Street on the East to Elizabeth Lane on the West in Alexandria Virginia An additional building in Arlington Virginia was opened in br br The USPTO was expected by to open its first ever satellite offices in Detroit Dallas Denver and Silicon Valley to reduce backlog and reflect regional industrial strengths The first satellite office opened in Detroit on July In due to the budget sequestration the satellite office for Silicon Valley which is home to one of the nation s top patent producing cities was put on hold However renovation and infrastructure updates continued after the sequestration and the Silicon Valley location opened in the San Jose City Hall in br As of September the end of the U S government s fiscal year the PTO had employees nearly all of whom are based at its five building headquarters complex in Alexandria Of those were patent examiners almost all of whom were assigned to examine utility patents only were assigned to examine design patents and were trademark examining attorneys the rest are support staff While the agency has noticeably grown in recent years the rate of growth was far slower in fiscal than in the recent past this is borne out by data from fiscal to the present As of the end of FY the USPTO was composed of federal employees including patent examiners trademark examiners and other staff br br Patent examiners make up the bulk of the employees at USPTO They hold degrees in various scientific disciplines but do not necessarily hold law degrees Unlike patent examiners trademark examiners must be licensed attorneys br All examiners work under a strict count based production system For every application counts are earned by composing filing and mailing a first Office action on the merits and upon disposal of an application br In the Commissioner for Patents oversaw three main bodies headed by the former Deputy Commissioner for Patent Operations Peggy Focarino the Deputy Commissioner for Patent Examination Policy which was held by Andrew Hirshfeld up until and finally the Commissioner for Patent Resources and Planning which was vacant at that time The Patent Operations of the office is divided into nine different technology centers that deal with various arts br Prior to decisions of patent examiners could be appealed to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences an administrative law body of the USPTO Decisions of the BPAI could further be appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or a civil suit could be brought against the Commissioner of Patents in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia The United States Supreme Court may ultimately decide on a patent case Under the America Invents Act the BPAI was converted to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board or PTAB br Similarly decisions of trademark examiners may be appealed to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board with subsequent appeals directed to the Federal Circuit or a civil action may also be brought br In recent years the USPTO has seen increasing delays between when a patent application is filed and when it issues To address its workload challenges the USPTO has undertaken an aggressive program of hiring and recruitment The USPTO hired new patent examiners in Fiscal Year year ending September new examiners in fiscal and in fiscal year The USPTO expected to continue hiring patent examiners at a rate of approximately per year through however due to a slowdown in new application filings since the onset of the late s economic crisis and projections of substantial declines in maintenance fees in coming years the agency imposed a hiring freeze in early March br In USPTO instituted a new training program for patent examiners called the Patent Training Academy It is an eight month program designed to teach new patent examiners the fundamentals of patent law practice and examination procedure in a college style environment Because of the impending USPTO budget crisis previously alluded to it had been rumored that the academy would be closed by the end of Focarino then Acting Commissioner for Patents denied in a May interview that the academy was being shut down but stated that it would be cut back because the hiring goal for new examiners in fiscal was reduced to Ultimately new patent examiners were hired in fiscal year br In the USPTO partnered with the Girl Scouts of the USA to create an Intellectual Property Patch merit badge which is awarded to Girl Scouts at four different levels br br br Management br In October President Joe Biden nominated attorney Kathi Vidal to serve as the USPTO director She was sworn in on April On December Kathi Vidal announced that Vaishali Udupa an intellectual property attorney engineer and currently a top executive from Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE will join the person Department of Commerce agency as the new Commissioner for Patents effective January br br br Fee diversion br For many years Congress has diverted about of the fees that the USPTO collected into the general treasury of the United States In effect this took money collected from the patent system to use for the general budget This fee diversion has been generally opposed by patent practitioners e g patent attorneys and patent agents inventors the USPTO as well as former federal judge Paul R Michel These stakeholders would rather use the funds to improve the patent office and patent system such as by implementing the USPTO s st Century Strategic Plan The last six annual budgets of the George W Bush administration did not propose to divert any USPTO fees and the first budget of the Barack Obama administration continued this practice as well as the second budget of the Trump administration however stakeholders continue to press for a permanent end to fee diversion br The discussion of which party can appropriate the fees is more than a financial question Patent fees represent a policy lever that influences both the number of applications submitted to the office as well as their quality br br br Patents br br On July the first U S patent was issued to Samuel Hopkins for an improvement in the making of Pot ash and Pearl ash by a new Apparatus and Process This patent was signed by then President George Washington br The X Patents the first approximately issued between and were destroyed by a fire fewer than of those have been recovered and re issued with numbers that include an X The X generally appears at the end of the numbers hand written on full page patent images however in patent collections and for search purposes the X is considered to be the patent type analogous to the D of design patents and appears at the beginning of the number The X distinguishes the patents from those issued after the fire which began again with patent number br Each year the PTO issues over patents to companies and individuals worldwide As of December the PTO had granted patents and received applications br On June the millionth U S patent was issued to Joseph Marron for invention of a Coherent LADAR System Using Intra Pixel Quadrature Detection to improve laser detection and ranging LADAR The patent was the first to receive the newly redesigned patent cover It was signed by then President Donald Trump during a special ceremony at the Oval Office br In February the USPTO issued a new guideline relating to obtaining a patent as per earlier recommendation by Biden s administration The guideline states that to obtain a patent a real person not AI must have made a significant contribution to the invention and that only a human being can be named as an inventor on a patent br Patents issued under revised numbering scheme of the Patent Act of br br br Trademarks br The USPTO examines applications for trademark registration which can be filed under five different filing bases use in commerce intent to use foreign application foreign registration or international registration If approved the trademarks are registered on either the Principal Register or the Supplemental Register depending upon whether the mark meets the appropriate distinctiveness criteria This federal system governs goods and services distributed via interstate commerce and operates alongside state level trademark registration systems br Trademark applications have grown substantially in recent years jumping from new applications in to new applications in to new applications in Recent growth has been driven partially by growing numbers of trademark applications originating in China trademark applications from China have grown more than fold since and in one in every nine trademark applications reviewed by the U S Trademark Office originated in China br Since the Trademark Office has hosted a National Trademark Expo every two years billing it as a free family friendly event designed to educate the public about trademarks and their importance in the global marketplace The Expo features celebrity speakers such as Anson Williams of the television show Happy Days and basketball player Kareem Abdul Jabbar and has numerous trademark holding companies as exhibitors Before the National Trademark Expo the Trademark Office designed and launched a kid friendly trademark mascot known as T Markey who appears as an anthropomorphized registered trademark symbol T Markey is featured prominently on the Kids section of the USPTO website alongside fellow IP mascots Ms Pat Pending with her robot cat GeaRS and Mark Trademan br In trademark applications marked the sharpest declines and inclines in American history During the spring COVID lockdowns led to reduced filings which then increased in July to exceed the previous year August was subsequently the highest month of trademark filings in the history of the U S Patent and Trademark Office br br br Representation br The USPTO only allows certain qualified persons to practice before the USPTO Practice includes filing of patent and trademark applications on behalf of individuals and companies prosecuting the patent and trademark applications and participating in administrative appeals and other proceedings before the PTO examiners examining attorneys and boards The USPTO sets its own standards for who may practice Any person who practices patent law before the USPTO must become a registered patent attorney or agent A patent agent is a person who has passed the USPTO registration examination the patent bar but has not passed any state bar exam to become a licensed attorney a patent attorney is a person who has passed both a state bar and the patent bar and is in good standing as an attorney A patent agent can only act in a representative capacity in patent matters presented to the USPTO and may not represent a patent holder or applicant in a court of law To be eligible for taking the patent bar exam a candidate must possess a degree in engineering or physical science or the equivalent of such a degree Any person who practices trademark law before the USPTO must be an active member in good standing of the highest court of any state br The United States allows any citizen from any country to sit for the patent bar if he she has the requisite technical background Only Canada has a reciprocity agreement with the United States that confers upon a patent agent similar rights br An unrepresented inventor may file a patent application and prosecute it on his or her own behalf pro se If it appears to a patent examiner that an inventor filing a pro se application is not familiar with the proper procedures of the Patent Office the examiner may suggest that the filing party obtain representation by a registered patent attorney or patent agent The patent examiner cannot recommend a specific attorney or agent but the Patent Office does post a list of those who are registered br While the inventor of a relatively simple to describe invention may well be able to produce an adequate specification and detailed drawings there remains language complexity in what is claimed either in the particular claim language of a utility application or in the manner in which drawings are presented in a design application There is also skill required when searching for prior art that is used to support the application and to prevent applying for a patent for something that may be unpatentable A patent examiner will make special efforts to help pro se inventors understand the process but the failure to adequately understand or respond to an Office action from the USPTO can endanger the inventor s rights and may lead to abandonment of the application br br br Electronic filing system br The USPTO accepts patent applications filed in electronic form Inventors or their patent agents attorneys can file applications as Adobe PDF documents Filing fees can be paid by credit card or by a USPTO deposit account br br br Patent search tools br br The USPTO web site provides free electronic copies of issued patents and patent applications as multiple page TIFF graphic documents The site also provides Boolean search and analysis tools br The USPTO s free distribution service only distributes the patent documents as a set of TIFF files Numerous free and commercial services provide patent documents in other formats such as Adobe PDF and CPC br br br Criticisms br The USPTO has been criticized for granting patents for impossible or absurd already known or arguably obvious inventions Economists have documented that although the USPTO makes mistakes when granting patents these mistakes might be less prominent than some might believe br br br Controversial patents br U S patent Method of exercising a cat covers having a cat chase the beam from a laser pointer The patent has been criticized as being obvious br U S patent Sealed crustless sandwich issued in covers the design of a sandwich with crimped edges However all claims of the patent were subsequently canceled by the PTO upon reexamination br U S patent Hyper light speed antenna an antenna that sends signals faster than the speed of light According to the description in the patent The present invention takes a transmission of energy and instead of sending it through normal time and space it pokes a small hole into another dimension thus sending the energy through a place which allows transmission of energy to exceed the speed of light br U S patent Method of swinging on a swing issued April was granted to a seven year old boy whose father a patent attorney wanted to demonstrate how the patent system worked to his son who was five years old at the time of the application The PTO initially rejected it due to prior art but eventually issued the patent However all claims of the patent were subsequently canceled by the PTO upon reexamination br U S patent Space vehicle propelled by the pressure of inflationary vacuum state describes an anti gravity device In November the USPTO was criticized by physicists for granting it The journal Nature first highlighted this patent issued for a device that presumably amounts to a perpetual motion machine defying the laws of physics The device comprises a particular electrically superconducting shield and electromagnetic generating device The examiner allowed the claims because the design of the shield and device was novel and not obvious In situations such as this where a substantial question of patentability is raised after a patent is issued the Commissioner of the Patent Office can order a reexamination of the patent br br br Controversial trademarks br U S Trademark Cloud Computing for Dell covering custom manufacture of computer hardware for use in data centers and mega scale computing environments for others was allowed by a trademark attorney on July Cloud computing is a generic term that could define technology infrastructure for years to come which had been in general use at the time of the application The application was rejected on August as descriptive and generic br U S Trademark Netbook for Psion covering laptop computers was registered on November Although the company discontinued the netBook line in November and allowed the trademark to become genericized through use by journalists and vendors products marketed as netbooks include the Dell Inspiron Mini Series Asus eeePC HP Mini MSI Wind Netbook and others USPTO subsequently rejected a number of trademarks citing a likelihood of confusion under section d including G NETBOOK U S Trademark rejected October MSI s WIND NETBOOK U S Trademark and Coby Electronics COBY NETBOOK U S Trademark rejected January Psion also delivered a batch of cease and desist letters on December relating to the genericized trademark br br br Slow patent examination and backlog br br The USPTO has been criticized for taking an inordinate amount of time in examining patent applications This is particularly true in the fast growing area of business method patents As of patent examiners in the business method area were still examining patent applications filed in br The delay was attributed by spokesmen for the Patent Office to a combination of a sudden increase in business method patent filings after the State Street Bank decision the unfamiliarity of patent examiners with the business and financial arts e g banking insurance stock trading etc and the issuance of a number of controversial patents e g U S patent Amazon one click patent in the business method area br Effective August the USPTO introduced an accelerated patent examination procedure in an effort to allow inventors a speedy evaluation of an application with a final disposition within twelve months The procedure requires additional information to be submitted with the application and also includes an interview with the examiner The first accelerated patent was granted on March with a six month issuance time br As of the end of there were patent applications pending at the Patent Office At the end of the number of applications pending was Therefore over those eleven years there was a increase in the number of pending applications br December data showed that there was unexamined patent applications in the backlog During the four years since more than a reduction was achieved First action pendency was reported as months br br br Fraud by remote working employees br In the USPTO initiated an internal investigation into allegations of fraud by employees taking advantage of its remote work policies Investigators discovered that some patent examiners had lied about the hours they had worked but high level officials prevented access to computer records thus limiting the number of employees who could be punished br br br See also br br Confederate Patent Office br Criticism of the United States government Criticism of agencies br
