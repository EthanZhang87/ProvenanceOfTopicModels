switch and a dedicated port for the D glasses The Master System II a cheaper model was released in in North America Australasia and Europe br The original Master System models use both cartridges and a credit card sized format known as Sega Cards Accessories include a light gun and D glasses that work with specially designed games The later Master System II redesign removed the card slot turning it into a strictly cartridge only system and is incompatible with the D glasses br The Master System was released in competition with the Nintendo Entertainment System NES Its library is smaller and with fewer well reviewed games than the NES due in part to Nintendo licensing policies requiring platform exclusivity Though the Master System had newer improved hardware it failed to overturn Nintendo s significant market share advantage in Japan and North America However it attained significantly greater success in other markets including Europe Brazil South Korea and Australia br The Master System is estimated to have sold between and million units worldwide In addition Tectoy has sold million licensed Master System variants in Brazil Retrospective criticism has recognized its role in the development of the Sega Genesis and a number of well received games particularly in PAL including PAL M regions but is critical of its limited library in the NTSC regions which were dominated by the NES br br br History br br br Mark III br On July Sega released its first video game console the SG in Japan The launch coincided with the same day its competitor Nintendo launched the Famicom In parent company Gulf and Western Industries divested its non core businesses including Sega and Sega president Hayao Nakayama was installed as CEO Sega released another console the SG II featuring several hardware alterations including detachable controllers Nakayama and Sega co founder David Rosen arranged a management buyout with financial backing from CSK Corporation and installed CSK CEO Isao Okawa as chairman br Hoping to better compete with Nintendo Sega released another console the Sega Mark III in Japan in The Mark III was a redesigned version of the SG It was engineered by the same team including Hideki Sato and Masami Ishikawa who had worked on the II and later led development of the Sega Genesis According to Sato the console was redesigned because of the limitations of the TMS graphics chip in the SG which did not have the power for the kinds of games Sega wanted to make The Mark III s chip was designed in house based around the unit in Sega s System arcade system board br The Sega Mark III was released in Japan in October at a price of Though its hardware was more powerful than the Famicom the Mark III was not successful on launch Problems arose from Nintendo s licensing practices with third party developers whereby Nintendo required that games for the Famicom not be published on other consoles Sega developed its own games and obtained the rights to port games from other developers but they did not sell well br br br North American release as Master System br br Though the SG had not been released in the United States Sega hoped that their video game console business would fare better in North America than it had in Japan To accomplish this Sega of America was established in to manage the company s consumer products in North America Rosen and Nakayama hired Bruce Lowry Nintendo of America s vice president of sales Lowry was persuaded to change companies because Sega would allow him to start his new office in San Francisco He chose the name Sega of America for his division because he had worked for Nintendo of America and liked the combination of words Initially Sega of America was tasked with repackaging the Mark III for a Western release Sega of America rebranded the Mark III as the Master System similar to Nintendo s reworking of the Famicom into the Nintendo Entertainment System NES The name was chosen by Sega of America employees throwing darts against a whiteboard of suggested names Plans to release a cheaper console the Base System also influenced the decision Okawa approved of the name after being told it was a reference to the competitive nature of both the video game industry and martial arts in which only one competitor can be the Master The console s futuristic final design was intended to appeal to Western tastes The North American packaging was white to differentiate it from the black NES packaging with a white grid design inspired by Apple computer products br The Master System was first revealed in North America at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show CES in Chicago in June It was initially sold in a package with the Power Base console a light gun two controllers and a pack in multicart The console was launched in September at a price of equivalent to in including the games Hang On and Safari Hunt Nintendo was exporting the Famicom to the US as the NES and both companies planned to spend million in late to market their consoles Sega hoped to sell to consoles in By the end of at least Master System consoles had been sold more than the Atari s but less than Nintendo s million Other sources indicate that more than Master System consoles were sold by Christmas br As in Japan the Master System in North America had a limited game library Limited by Nintendo s licensing practices Sega only had two third party American publishers Activision and Parker Brothers Agreements with both of those companies came to an end in Sega claimed that the Master System was the first console where the graphics on the box are actually matched by the graphics of the game and pushed the arcade experience in adverts Its marketing department was run by only two people giving Sega a disadvantage in advertising As one method of promoting the console at the end of Sega partnered with astronaut Scott Carpenter to start the Sega Challenge a traveling program set up in recreational centers where kids were tested on non verbal skills such as concentration and the ability to learn new skills Out Run and Shooting Gallery were two games included in the challenge br In amid struggling sales in the US Sega sold the US distribution rights for the Master System to the toy company Tonka which had no experience with electronic entertainment systems The thinking at Sega behind the deal was to leverage Tonka s knowledge of the American toy market since Nintendo had marketed the NES as a toy to great success in the region The announcement was made shortly after the Summer CES During this time much of Sega of America s infrastructure shifted from marketing and distribution to focus on customer service and Lowry departed the company Tonka blocked localization of several popular Japanese games and during were less willing to purchase EPROMs needed for game cartridge manufacture during a shortage They also became less willing to invest in video games after taking massive loans in purchasing Kenner Toys in followed by poor holiday season sales and financial losses Though the distributor of the console had changed the Master System continued to perform poorly in the market br The Mark III was rereleased as the Master System in Japan in October for but still sold poorly Neither model posed a serious challenge to Nintendo in Japan and according to Sato Sega was only able to attain of the Japanese console market br br br Europe Brazil and other markets br The Master System was launched in Europe in It was distributed by Mastertronic in the United Kingdom Master Games in France and Ariolasoft in West Germany though Ariolasoft initially purchased the distribution rights for the United Kingdom Because Ariolasoft could not agree to a pricing agreement with Sega Mastertronic signed a deal in to take control of UK distribution and announced the deal at the Summer CES The company announced the release of titles by autumn Mastertronic advertised the Master System as an arcade in the home and launched it at equivalent to in Advance orders from retailers were high but Sega proved unable to deliver inventory until Boxing Day on December causing many retailers to cancel their orders Mastertronic and Master Games entered financial crises and Ariolasoft vowed never to work with Sega again Mastertronic had already sold a minority interest to the Virgin Group to enter the console business and sold the remainder to avoid bankruptcy The newly rebranded Virgin Mastertronic took over all European distribution in br Virgin Mastertronic focused marketing the Master System on ports of Sega s arcade games and positioning it as a superior video game alternative to the Commodore and the ZX Spectrum computers As a result of this marketing and of Nintendo s less effective early approaches in Europe the Master System began to attract European developers The Master System held a significant part of the video game console market in Europe through the release of Sega s succeeding console the Mega Drive In Virgin Mastertronic began offering rentals of the Master System console and games The United Kingdom also hosted a Sega video games national championship with the winner competing against Japanese and American champions on the British television show Motormouth Players competed in a variety of games including Astro Warrior platform games and sports games During the late s the Master System was outselling the NES in the United Kingdom br The Master System was successful in Europe By the Master System was the best selling console in Europe though the NES was beginning to have a fast growing user base in the UK For the year Virgin Mastertronic sold Master Systems in the United Kingdom greater than the Mega Drives and Nintendo s consoles sold in the same period In the whole of Europe that year Sega sold a combined consoles greater than Nintendo s br The Master System was also successful in Brazil where it was distributed by Tectoy and launched in September Tectoy a Brazilian toy company startup focused on electronic toys reached out to Sega about distributing their products Despite hesitation given the situation with Tonka in the US Tectoy was eventually given liberty to manage Sega products in Brazil Their success distributing Sega s laser tag gun based on the anime Zillion gave Sega the confidence to allow Tectoy to distribute the Master System By the end of the installed base in Brazil was about units Tectoy introduced a telephone service with game tips created a Master System club and presented the program Master Tips during commercial breaks of the television show Sess o Aventura of Rede Globo Nintendo did not arrive in Brazil until and were unable to officially compete given that clones of the NES dominated the Brazilian market Tectoy claimed of the Brazilian video game market br In South Korea the Sega Mark III was released by Samsung under the name Gam Boy in April and then the Master System II was released under the name Aladdin Boy in It sold units in South Korea up until outselling the NES released by Hyundai Group as the Comboy and becoming the best selling console in South Korea up until The Master System was also popular in Australia where units were sold in alone and where it was more successful than the NES Master System consoles had been sold in Australia by November br br br Decline br br Although the Master System was a success in Europe and later in Brazil it failed to ignite significant interest in the Japanese or North American markets which by the mid to late s were both dominated by Nintendo By Nintendo held percent of the North American video game market With Sega continuing to have difficulty penetrating the home market Sega s console R D team led by Ishikawa and supervised by Sato began work on a successor to the Master System almost immediately after its launch Another competitor arose in Japan in when Japanese computer giant NEC released the PC Engine TurboGrafx in North America amid great publicity br Sega released its next console the bit Mega Drive in Japan on October The final licensed release for the Master System in Japan was Bomber Raid in In the same year Sega was preparing to release the new Mega Drive rebranded Genesis in North America Displeased with Tonka s handling of the Master System Sega reacquired the marketing and distribution rights to the Master System for the United States In Sega released the remodeled Master System II designed as a lower cost version without the Sega Card slot Sega promoted the new model but it sold poorly By early Master System production had ceased in North America having sold between million and million units behind both Nintendo and Atari which controlled percent and percent of the market respectively The last licensed Master System release in North America was Sonic the Hedgehog br In Europe where the Master System was the best selling console up until the NES caught up with and narrowly overtook the Master System in Western Europe during the early s though the Master System maintained its lead in several markets such as the United Kingdom Belgium and Spain In the Master System s estimated active installed user base in Europe was million units larger than that of the Mega Drive s million that year but less than the NES s million Combined with the Mega Drive Sega represented the majority of the European console market that year The Master System II was also successful and helped Sega to sustain their significant market share Releases continued into the s in Europe including Mercs Sonic the Hedgehog and Streets of Rage br The Master System has had continued success in Brazil where dedicated plug and play consoles emulating the original hardware continue to be sold by Tectoy including portable versions These systems include the Master System Compact and the Master System III and Tectoy has also received requests to remake the original Master System A article on UOL wrote that Tectoy re releases of the Master System and Mega Drive combined sold around units per year in Brazil By Tectoy said they had sold million units of Master System

System II s A V port was omitted leaving only RF output available this was reversed in France where the local version of the Master System II had only A V video output available and omitted the RF hardware In Brazil Tectoy released several licensed variations the Master System Super Compact functions wirelessly with an RF transmitter and the Master System Girl molded in bright pink plastic was targeted at girls The Master System Collection released in contains built in games Handheld versions of the Master System were released under several brands such as Coleco in br br br Accessories br br A number of cross compatible accessories were created for the Mark III and Master System The controller consists of a rectangle with a D pad and two buttons Sega also introduced additional Mark III controllers such as a paddle controller A combination steering wheel and flight stick the Handle Controller was released in The Sega Control Stick is an arcade style joystick with the buttons on the

same name from the Japanese anime Zillion It is compatible with games and released exclusively in the West br A pair of D glasses the SegaScope D were created for games such as Space Harrier D although Mark III users need an additional converter to use them The SegaScope D works via an active shutter system creating a stereoscopic effect The glasses need to be connected to the Sega Card slot and thus do not function with the Master System II due to lack of the card slot A total of eight games including Zaxxon D and Out Run D are compatible with the glasses br The Mark III has an optional RF transmitter accessory allowing wireless play that broadcasts the game being played on a UHF television signal br br br Game Gear br br Developed under the name Project Mercury and designed

Gear and the Master System hardware but the games are not directly compatible Master System games are only playable on Game Gear using the Master Gear Converter accessory A large part of the Game Gear s game library consists of Master System ports Because of hardware similarities including the landscape screen orientation Master System games are easily portable to the handheld In particular many Master System ports of Game Gear games were done by Tectoy for the Brazilian market as the Master System was more popular than the Game Gear in the region br br br Game library br br Master System games came in two formats ROM cartridges held up to Mbit KB of code and data while Sega Cards held up to Kbit KB Cartridges were marketed by their storage size One Mega Mbit Two Mega Mbit and Four Mega Mbit Cards cheaper to manufacture than the cartridges included Spy vs Spy and Super Tennis but were eventually dropped due to their small memory size The size of the release library varies based on region North America received just over games with Japan receiving less Europe by contrast received over licensed games including bit ports of Genesis games and PAL exclusive releases The first Mark III specific cartridge was Fantasy Zone released on June and Bomber Raid was the final release on February a few months after the launch of the Mega Drive The final North American release was Sonic the Hedgehog in October Games for PAL regions continued to be released until the mid s br The Sega Mark III and the Japanese Master System are backwards compatible with SC SG cartridges and can play Sega Card games without the Card Catcher peripheral However educational and programming cartridges for the SC require the SK keyboard peripheral which is compatible with the Mark III but not the Japanese Master System Mark III specific games were initially available in card format labelled My Card Mark III to distinguish themselves from games designed for the SC SG starting with Teddy Boy Blues and Hang On both released on October br Of the games released for the Master System Phantasy Star is considered a benchmark role playing game RPG and became a successful franchise Sega s

additional Sonic the Hedgehog games and dozens of PAL exclusives such as Lucky Dime Caper Asterix Ninja Gaiden Master of Darkness and Power Strike II Retro Gamer s Damien McFerran praised the superb PAL library of interesting ports and excellent exclusives which was richer than the North American library and provided a drip feed of quality titles br After the Master System was discontinued in other markets additional games were released in Brazil by Tectoy including ports of Street Fighter II and Dynamite Headdy Tectoy created Portuguese translations of games exclusive to the region Some of these would tie in to popular Brazilian entertainment franchises for example Teddy Boy became Geraldinho certain Wonder Boy titles became Monica s Gang games and Ghost House became Chapolim vs Dracula Um Duelo Assutador based on the Mexican TV series El Chapul n Colorado Tectoy also ported games to the Master System including various games from the Genesis and Game Gear Aside from porting the company developed F rias Frustradas do Pica Pau after finding out that Woody Woodpecker named Pica Pau in Portuguese was the most popular cartoon on Brazilian television along with at least twenty additional exclusives These titles were developed in house by Tectoy in Brazil br Due in part to Nintendo s licensing practices which stipulated that third party NES developers could not release games on other platforms few third party developers released games for the Master System According to Sato Sega was focused on porting its arcade games instead of building relationships with third parties According to Sega designer Mark Cerny most of Sega s early Master System games were developed within a strict three month deadline which affected their quality Computer Gaming World compared new Sega games to drops of water in the desert Games for the Master System took advantage of more advanced hardware compared to the NES Alex Kidd in Miracle World for example showcases blistering colors and more detailed sprites than NES games The Master System version of R Type was praised for its visuals comparable to those of the TurboGrafx port br In Sega reached a deal with Chinese company AtGames

in in Japan and Wonder Boy in North America Master System games were also released via the GameTap online service br br br Reception and legacy br Due to the continued release of new variants in Brazil the Master System is considered by many video gaming publications to be the longest lived gaming console in video games history a title it took from the Atari Sales of the Master System have been estimated between million and million units not including later Brazil sales It saw much more continued success in Europe and Brazil than it did in Japan and North America In the Master System

and out of a possible points each focusing on the better value of the Genesis and lack of quality games for the Master System In reviewers scored it and out of noting its abandonment by Sega in North America and lack of new releases By contrast over million NES units were sold in North America alone outselling the Master System s life time units globally nearly three times over According to Bill Pearse of Playthings the NES gained an advantage through better software and more recognizable characters Sega closed the gap between Nintendo in the next generation with the release of the Genesis which sold million consoles compared with the million Super Nintendo Entertainment System consoles br Retrospective feedback of the Master System praises its support toward development of the Sega Genesis but has been critical of its small game library Writing for AllGame Dave Beuscher noted that the Master System was doomed by the lack of third party software support and all but disappeared from the American market by Retro Gamer writer Adam Buchanan praised the larger PAL library as a superb library of interesting ports and excellent exclusives Damien McFerran also of Retro Gamer recognized its importance to the success of the Genesis stating Without this criminally undervalued machine Sega would not have enjoyed the considerable success it had with the Mega Drive The Master System allowed Sega to experiment with arcade conversions original IP and even create a mascot in the form of the lovable monkey boy Alex Kidd In the Master System was named the th best console of all time by IGN behind the Atari th and the NES st IGN cited the Master System s small and uneven NTSC library as the major problems Months could go by between major releases and that made a dud on the
