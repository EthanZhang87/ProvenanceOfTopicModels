The Atari is a discontinued home video game console developed and produced by Atari Inc Released in September as the Atari Video Computer System Atari VCS it popularized microprocessor based hardware and games stored on swappable ROM cartridges a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F in The VCS was bundled with two joystick controllers a conjoined pair of paddle controllers and a game cartridge initially Combat and later Pac Man Sears sold the system as the Tele Games Video Arcade Atari rebranded the VCS as the Atari in November alongside the release of the Atari br Atari was successful at creating arcade video games but their development cost and limited lifespan drove CEO Nolan Bushnell to seek a programmable home system The first inexpensive microprocessors from MOS Technology in late made this feasible The console was prototyped under the codename Stella by Atari subsidiary Cyan Engineering Lacking funding to complete the project Bushnell sold Atari to Warner Communications in br The Atari VCS launched in with nine low resolution games on KB cartridges The system s first killer app was the home conversion of Taito s arcade game Space Invaders in The VCS became widely successful leading to the founding of Activision and other third party game developers and to competition from console manufacturers Mattel and Coleco Games grew to use four or more times the storage size of the launch games with significantly more advanced visuals and gameplay than the system was designed for such as Activision s Pitfall br By the Atari was the dominant game system in North America However it faced competition from other consoles such as the Intellivision and ColecoVision and poor decisions by Atari management damaged both the system and company s reputation most notably the release of two highly anticipated games for the a port of the arcade game Pac Man and E T the Extra Terrestrial Pac Man became the s highest selling game but was panned for being inferior to the arcade version E T was rushed to market for the holiday shopping season and was similarly panned and became a commercial failure Both games and a glut of third party shovelware were factors in ending Atari s relevance in the console market contributing to the video game crash of br Warner sold Atari s home division to former Commodore CEO Jack Tramiel in In the new Atari Corporation under Tramiel released a lower cost version of the and the backward compatible Atari but it was Nintendo that led the recovery of the industry with its launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System Production of the Atari ended on January with an estimated million units sold across its lifetime br br br History br br Atari Inc was founded by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney in Its first major product was Pong released in the first successful coin operated video game While Atari continued to develop new arcade games in following years Pong gave rise to a number of competitors to the growing arcade game market The competition along with other missteps by Atari led to financial problems in though recovering by the end of the year By Atari had released a Pong home console competing against Magnavox the only other major producer of home consoles at the time Atari engineers recognized however the limitation of custom logic integrated onto the circuit board permanently confining the whole console to only one game The increasing competition increased the risk as Atari had found with past arcade games and again with dedicated home consoles Both platforms are built from integrating discrete electro mechanical components into circuits rather than programmed as on a mainframe computer Therefore development of a console had cost at least equivalent to about in plus time to complete but the final product only had about a three month shelf life until becoming outdated by competition br By Atari had acquired Cyan Engineering a Grass Valley electronics company founded by Steve Mayer and Larry Emmons both former colleagues of Bushnell and Dabney from Ampex who helped to develop new ideas for Atari s arcade games Even prior to the release of the home version of Pong Cyan s engineers led by Mayer and Ron Milner had envisioned a home console powered by new programmable microprocessors capable of playing Atari s current arcade offerings The programmable microprocessors would make a console s design significantly simpler and more powerful than any dedicated single game unit However the cost of such chips was far outside the range that their market would tolerate Atari had opened negotiations to use Motorola s new in future systems br br br MOS Technology br In September MOS Technology debuted the microprocessor for at the Wescon trade show in San Francisco Mayer and Milner attended and met with the leader of the team that created the chip Chuck Peddle They proposed using the in a game console and offered to discuss it further at Cyan s facilities after the show br Over two days MOS and Cyan engineers sketched out a based console design by Meyer and Milner s specifications Financial models showed that even at the would be too expensive and Peddle offered them a planned microprocessor a cost reduced version of the and MOS s RIOT chip for input output Cyan and MOS negotiated the and RIOT chips at a pair MOS also introduced Cyan to Microcomputer Associates who had separately developed debugging software and hardware for MOS and had developed the JOLT Computer for testing the which Peddle suggested would be useful for Atari and Cyan to use while developing their system Milner was able to demonstrate a proof of concept for a programmable console by implementing Tank an arcade game by Atari s subsidiary Kee Games on the JOLT br As part of the deal Atari wanted a second source of the chipset Peddle and Paivinen suggested Synertek whose co founder Bob Schreiner was a friend of Peddle In October Atari informed the market that it was moving forward with MOS The Motorola sales team had already told its management that the Atari deal was finalized and Motorola management was livid They announced a lawsuit against MOS the next week br br br Building the system br br By December Atari hired Joe Decuir a recent graduate from University of California Berkeley who had been doing his own testing on the Decuir began debugging the first prototype designed by Mayer and Milner which gained the codename Stella after the brand of Decuir s bicycle This prototype included a breadboard level design of the graphics interface to build upon A second prototype was completed by March with the help of Jay Miner who created a chip called the Television Interface Adaptor TIA to send graphics and audio to a television The second prototype included a TIA a and a ROM cartridge slot and adapter br As the TIA s design was refined Al Alcorn brought in Atari s game developers to provide input on features There are significant limitations in the the TIA and other components so the programmers creatively optimized their games to maximize the console The console lacks a framebuffer and requires games to instruct the system to generate graphics in synchronization with the electron gun in the cathode ray tube CRT as it scans across rows on the screen The programmers found ways to race the beam to perform other functions while the electron gun scans outside of the visible screen br Alongside the electronics development Bushnell brought in Gene Landrum a consultant who had just prior consulted for Fairchild Camera and Instrument for its upcoming Channel F to determine the consumer requirements for the console In his final report Landrum suggested a living room aesthetic with a wood grain finish and the cartridges must be idiot proof child proof and effective in resisting potential static electricity problems in a living room environment Landrum recommended it include four to five dedicated games in addition to the cartridges but this was dropped in the final designs The cartridge design was done by James Asher and Douglas Hardy Hardy had been an engineer for Fairchild and helped in the initial design of the Channel F cartridges but he quit to join Atari in The interior of the cartridge that Asher and Hardy designed was sufficiently different to avoid patent conflicts but the exterior components were directly influenced by the Channel F to help work around the static electricity concerns br Atari was still recovering from its financial woes and needed additional capital to fully enter the home console market though Bushnell was wary of being beholden to outside financial sources Atari obtained smaller investments through but not at the scale it needed and began considering a sale to a larger firm by early Atari was introduced to Warner Communications which saw the potential for the growing video game industry to help offset declining profits from its film and music divisions Negotiations took place during during which Atari cleared itself of liabilities including settling a patent infringement lawsuit with Magnavox over Ralph H Baer s patents that were the basis for the Magnavox Odyssey In mid Fairchild announced the Channel F planned for release later that year beating Atari to the market br By October Warner and Atari agreed to the purchase of Atari for million Warner provided an estimated million which was enough to fast track Stella By development had advanced enough to brand it the Atari Video Computer System VCS and start developing games br br br Launch and success br br The unit was showcased on June at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show with plans for retail release in October The announcement was purportedly delayed to wait out the terms of the Magnavox patent lawsuit settlement which would have given Magnavox all technical information on any of Atari s products announced between June and June However Atari encountered production problems during its first batch and its testing was complicated by the use of cartridges br br The Atari VCS was launched in September at equivalent to about in with two joysticks and a Combat cartridge eight additional games were sold separately Most of the launch games were based on arcade games developed by Atari or its subsidiary Kee Games for example Combat was based on Kee s Tank and Atari s Jet Fighter Atari sold between and Atari VCS units during attributed to the delay in shipping the units and consumers unfamiliarity with a swappable cartridge console that is not dedicated to only one game br In Atari sold only of the systems manufactured This required further financial support from Warner to cover losses Bushnell pushed the Warner Board of Directors to start working on Stella as he grew concerned that rising competition and aging tech specs of the VCS would render the console obsolete However the board stayed committed to the VCS and ignored Bushnell s advice leading to his departure from Atari in Atari sold million consoles in particularly during the holiday season but there was new competition from the Mattel Electronics Intellivision and Magnavox Odyssey which also use swappable ROM cartridges The book They Create Worlds has Atari selling about VCS systems in bringing the installed base to a little over million br Atari obtained a license from Taito to develop a VCS conversion of its arcade hit Space Invaders This is the first officially licensed arcade conversion for a home console Its release in March doubled the console s sales for the year to more than million units and it was considered the Atari VCS s killer application Sales then doubled again for the next two years According to They Create Worlds Atari sold million Space Invaders cartridges and over million VCS systems in nearly doubling the install base to over million and then an estimated million VCS systems in By million consoles had been sold in the United States while its best selling game was Pac Man at over million copies sold by Pac Man propelled worldwide Atari VCS sales to million units during according to a November article in InfoWorld magazine An August InfoWorld magazine article says more than million Atari machines were sold by A March article in IEEE Spectrum magazine has about million VCS sales in about million in as well as a total of over million VCS systems and an estimated million cartridges sold br In Europe the Atari VCS sold units in the United Kingdom during and in West Germany by In France where the VCS released in the system sold units by The console was distributed by Epoch Co in Japan in under the name Cassette TV Game but did not sell as well as Epoch s own Cassette Vision system in br In Atari launched its second programmable console the Atari To standardize naming the VCS was renamed to the Atari Video Computer System or Atari derived from the manufacture part number CX By the cost Atari about to make and was sold for an average of equivalent to in The company spent to to manufacture each cartridge plus to for advertising wholesaling for equivalent to in br br br Third party development br Activision formed by Crane Whitehead and Miller in started developing third party VCS games using their knowledge of VCS design and programming tricks and began releasing games in Kaboom and Pitfall are among the most successful with at least one and four million copies sold respectively In Atari attempted to block the sale of the Activision cartridges accusing the four of intellectual property infringement The two companies settled out of court with Activision agreeing to pay Atari a licensing fee for their games This made Activision the first third party video game developer and established the licensing model that continues to be used by console manufacturers for game development br Activision s success led to the establishment of other third party VCS game developers following Activision s model in the early s including U S Games Telesys Games by Apollo Data Age Zimag Mystique and CommaVid The founding of Imagic included ex Atari programmers Mattel and Coleco each already producing its own more advanced console created simplified versions of their existing games for the Mattel used the M Network brand name for its cartridges Third party games accounted for half of VCS game sales by br br br Decline and redesign br In addition to third party game development Atari also received the first major threat to its hardware dominance from the Colecovision Coleco had a license from Nintendo to develop a version of the arcade game Donkey Kong which was bundled with every Colecovision console Coleco gained about of the hardware market in compared to Atari s With third parties competing for market share Atari worked to maintain dominance in the market by acquiring licenses for popular arcade games and other properties to make games from Pac Man has numerous technical and aesthetic flaws but nevertheless more than million copies were sold Heading into the holiday shopping season Atari had placed high sales expectations on E T the Extra Terrestrial a game programmed in about six weeks Atari produced an estimated four million cartridges but the game was poorly reviewed and only about million units were sold br Warner Communications reported weaker results than expected in December to its shareholders having expected a year to year growth but only obtaining due to declining sales at Atari Coupled with the oversaturated home game market Atari s weakened position led investors to start pulling funds out of video games beginning a cascade of disastrous effects known as the video game crash of Many of the third party developers formed prior to were closed and Mattel and Coleco left the video game market by br In September Atari sent truckloads of unsold Atari cartridges and other equipment to a landfill in the New Mexico desert later labeled the Atari video game burial Long considered an urban legend that claimed the burial contained millions of unsold cartridges the site was excavated in confirming reports from former Atari executives that only about cartridges had actually been buried Atari reported a million loss for as a whole ch and continued to lose money into with a million loss reported in the second quarter By mid software development for the had essentially stopped except that of Atari and Activision br Warner wary of supporting its failing Atari division started looking for buyers in Warner sold most of Atari to Jack Tramiel the founder of Commodore International in July for about million though Warner retained Atari s arcade business Tramiel was a proponent of personal computers and halted all new game development soon after the sale br The North American video game market did not recover until about after Nintendo s launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America Atari Corporation released a redesigned model of the in supported by an ad campaign touting a price of under bucks With a large library of cartridges and a low price point the continued to sell into the late s Atari released the last batch of games in including Secret Quest and Fatal Run By over million Atari VCS units had been sold worldwide The final Atari licensed release is the PAL only version of the arcade game KLAX in br After more than years on the market the line was formally discontinued on January along with the Atari and Atari bit computers In Europe last stocks of the were sold until Summer Fall of br br br Hardware br br br Console br br The Atari s CPU is the MOS Technology a version of the running at MHz in the Though their internal silicon was identical the was cheaper than the because its package included fewer memory address pins instead of The designers of the Atari selected an inexpensive cartridge interface that has one fewer address pins than the allowed by the further reducing the already limited addressable memory from KB to KB This was believed to be sufficient as Combat was only KB Later games circumvented this limitation with bank switching br The console has bytes of RAM for scratch space the call stack and the state of the game environment br The top bezel of the console originally had six switches power TV type selection color or black and white game selection player difficulty and game reset The difficulty switches were moved to the back of the bezel in later versions of the console The back bezel also included the controller ports TV output and power input br br br Graphics br br The Atari was designed to be compatible with the cathode ray tube television sets produced in the late s and early s which commonly lack auxiliary video inputs to receive audio and video from another device Therefore to connect to a TV the console generates a radio frequency signal compatible with the regional television standards NTSC PAL or SECAM using a special switch box to act as the television s antenna br Atari developed the Television Interface Adaptor TIA chip in the VCS to handle the graphics and conversion to a television signal It provides a single color bit background register that covers the left half of the screen each bit represents adjacent pixels and is either repeated or reflected on the right side There are single color sprites two pixel wide players two bit missiles which share the same colors as the players and a pixel ball which shares the background color The bit sprites all can be controlled to stretch to or pixels br The system was designed without a frame buffer to avoid the cost of the associated RAM The background and sprites apply to a single scan line and as the display is output to the television the program can change colors sprite positions and background settings The careful timing required to sync the code to the screen on the part of the programmer was labeled racing the beam the actual game logic runs when the television beam is outside of the visible area of the screen Early games for the system use the same visuals for pairs of scan lines giving a lower vertical resolution to allow more time for the next row of graphics to be prepared Later games such as Pitfall change the visuals for each scan line or extend the black areas around the screen to extend the game code s processing time br Regional releases of the Atari use modified TIA chips for each region s television formats which require games to be developed and published separately for each region All modes are pixels wide NTSC mode provides visible lines per screen drawn at Hz with colors each at levels of brightness PAL mode provides more vertical scanlines with visible lines per screen but drawn at Hz and only colors SECAM mode also a Hz format is limited to colors each with only a single brightness level br br br Controllers br br The first VCS bundle has two types of controllers a joystick part number CX and pair of rotary paddle controllers CX Driving controllers which are similar to paddle controllers but can be continuously rotated shipped with the Indy launch game After less than a year the CX joystick was replaced with the CX model designed by James C Asher Because the Atari joystick port and CX joystick became industry standards joysticks and some other peripherals work with later systems including the MSX Commodore Amiga Atari bit computers and Atari ST The CX joystick can be used with the Master System and Sega Genesis but does not provide all the buttons of a native controller Third party controllers include Wico s Command Control joystick Later the CX Remote Control Joysticks similar in appearance but using wireless technology were released together with a receiver whose wires could be inserted in the controller jacks br Atari introduced the CX Keyboard Controller in June along with two games that require it Codebreaker and Hunt Score The similar but simpler CX Kid s Controller was released later for a series of games aimed at a younger audience The CX Trak Ball controller was announced in January and is compatible with the Atari bit computers br There were two attempts to turn the Atari into a keyboard equipped home computer Atari s never released CX Graduate keyboard and the CompuMate keyboard by Spectravideo which was released in br br br Console models br br br Minor revisions br The initial production of the VCS was made in Sunnyvale during using thick polystyrene plastic for the casing as to give the impression of weight from what was mostly an empty shell inside The initial Sunnyvale batch had also included potential mounts for an internal speaker system on the casing though the speakers were found to be too expensive to include and instead sound was routed through the TIA to the connected television All six console switches on the front panel Production of the unit was moved to Taiwan in where a less thick internal metal shielding was used and thinner plastic was used for the casing reducing the system s weight These two versions are commonly referred to as Heavy Sixers and Light Sixers respectively referencing the six front switches br In the difficulty switches were moved to the back of the console leaving four switches on the front and replacing the previous all lowercase font for the switch labels to fully capitalized wording Otherwise these four switch consoles look nearly identical to the earlier six switch models In to coincide with the release of the Atari Atari rebranded the console as the Atari a name first used on a version of the four switch model without woodgrain giving it an all black appearance This all black model is commonly referred to by fans as the Vader model due to its resemblance to the Star Wars character of the same name br br br Sears Video Arcade br Atari continued its OEM relationship with Sears under the latter s Tele Games brand which started in with the original Pong This is unrelated to the company Telegames which later produced cartridges Sears released several models of the VCS as the Sears Video Arcade series starting in The final Sears specific model was the Video Arcade II released during the fall of br Sears released versions of Atari s games with Tele Games branding usually with different titles Three games were produced by Atari for Sears as exclusive releases Steeplechase Stellar Track and Submarine Commander br br br Atari br The Atari is the Japanese version of the released in October It is the first Japan specific release of a though companies like Epoch had distributed the in Japan previously The was released a short time after Nintendo s Family Computer which became the dominant console in Japan and it did not gain a significant share of the market Sears previously released the in the US during late as the Sears Video Arcade II which came packaged with two controllers and Space Invaders Around specially branded games were released for

Huang br br br model br The cost reduced model sometimes referred to as the Jr has a smaller form factor with an Atari like appearance It was advertised as a budget gaming system under with the ability to run a large collection of games Released after the video game crash of and after the North American launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System the was supported with new games and television commercials promoting The fun is back Atari released several minor stylistic variations the large rainbow shown short rainbow and an all black version sold only in Ireland Later European

store br Atari Inc released the Atari an scale replica of the CX A model on November The includes support for original Atari and cartridges br br br Games br br In nine games were released on cartridge to accompany the launch of the console Air Sea Battle Basic Math Blackjack Combat Indy Star Ship Street Racer Surround and Video Olympics Indy shipped with special driving controllers which are like paddles but rotate freely Street Racer and Video Olympics use the standard paddle controllers Atari Inc was the only developer for the first few years releasing dozens of games br br Atari determined that box art featuring only descriptions of the game and screenshots would not be sufficient to sell games in retail stores since most games were based on abstract principles and screenshots give little information Atari outsourced box art to Cliff Spohn who created visually interesting artwork with implications of dynamic movement intended to engage the player s imagination while staying true to the gameplay Spohn s style became a standard for Atari when bringing in assistant artists including Susan Jaekel Rick Guidice John Enright and Steve Hendricks Spohn and Hendricks were the largest contributors to the covers in the Atari library Ralph McQuarrie a concept artist on the Star Wars series was commissioned for one cover the arcade conversion of Vanguard These artists generally conferred with the programmer to learn about the game before drawing the art br An Atari VCS port of the Breakout arcade game appeared in The original is in black and white with a colored overlay and the home version is in color In Atari released Adventure the first action adventure game and the first home game with a hidden Easter egg br Rick Maurer s port of Taito s Space Invaders released in is the first VCS game to have more than one million copies sold eventually doubling that within a year and totaling more than million cartridges by It became the killer app to drive console sales Versions of Atari s own Asteroids and Missile Command arcade games released in were also major hits br Each early VCS game is in a K ROM Later games like Space Invaders have K The VCS port of Asteroids is the first game for the system to use K via a bank switching technique between two K segments Some later releases including Atari s ports of Dig Dug and Crystal Castles are K cartridges One of the final games Fatal Run doubled this to K br Many early VCS titles were able to display in both monochrome black and white and full color through the use of the TV type switch on the console This allowed the VCS games to function on both monochrome and color televisions However beginning around the rebranding from VCS to support for black and white display modes diminished greatly with most releases during this period only displaying in color and the TV type switch serving no function Other later titles such as Secret Quest began using the TV type switch for gameplay functions such as pausing br Two Atari published games both from the system s peak in E T the Extra Terrestrial and Pac Man are cited as factors in the video game crash of br A company named American Multiple Industries produced a number of pornographic games for the under the Mystique Presents Swedish Erotica label The most notorious Custer s Revenge was protested by women s and Native American groups because it depicted General George Armstrong Custer raping a bound Native American woman Atari sued American Multiple Industries in court over the release of the game br br br Legacy br br The was so successful in the late s and early s that Atari was a synonym for the console in mainstream media and for video games in general Jay Miner directed the creation of the successors to the s TIA chip CTIA and ANTIC which are central to the Atari bit computers released in and later the Atari console br The Atari was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame at The Strong in Rochester New York in In the Atari was named the number two console of all time by IGN which cited its remarkable role behind both the first video game boom and the video game crash of and called it the console that our entire industry is built upon br In November the current incarnation of Atari announced three games to be published under Atari XP label Yars Return Aquaventure and Saboteur These were
