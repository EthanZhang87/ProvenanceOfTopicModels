title: Microsoft SideWinder
id: 271304
Microsoft SideWinder was the general name given to the family of digital game controllers developed by Microsoft for PCs The line was first launched in Although intended only for use with Microsoft Windows Microsoft SideWinder game controllers can also be used with macOS Mac OS with third party software and Linux br The term SideWinder describes many types of Microsoft s PC game controllers including joysticks gamepads and steering wheels Several types of joysticks were made including the Force Feedback the D Pro and the regular SideWinder joystick Also several types of gamepads were made such as the original game port version a plug and play game port version and the USB version Steering wheels are the Precision Racing Wheel and the Force Feedback Wheel variants which include throttle and brake pedals br The family also includes some more exotic devices such as the SideWinder Game Voice system and the SideWinder Strategic Commander br The SideWinder family of products was discontinued by Microsoft in citing poor sales The company has since re entered the gaming hardware market in hopes of designing a standardized gamepad for Windows Vista with both the wired Xbox controller and the Wireless Gaming Receiver that allows the use of the wireless Xbox controller on the PC br In August Microsoft announced they were relaunching the SideWinder line of gaming peripherals starting with the SideWinder Mouse The mouse was given an MSRP of and a launch date of October br br br First generation br br br Notes br See bottom of device Microsoft SideWinder D Pro Plus were sold as Sidewinder Precision Pro but have no USB support br Also known as Microsoft SideWinder Precision br Also known as Microsoft SideWinder Force Feedback Wheel USB br A user made adapter exists for modern Windows versions XP and later Mac OS X and Linux br A user made adapter exists incorporating Force feedback support for modern Windows versions XP and later Mac OS X and Linux Game must also support FFB There is a bug in the Windows joystick control panel which causes the joystick to be reported as non functional Games will still recognize and use the joystick br A user made adapter exists for modern Windows versions XP and later Mac OS X and Linux There is no support for Force feedback at this time br br br Gamepad br The original Microsoft SideWinder gamepad had a digital directional pad six fire buttons two trigger buttons and a Mode and Start button The original gameport version had a pass through so additional joypads or joysticks could be used without unplugging the SideWinder and also allowed the connection of up to four SideWinder gamepads working simultaneously Newer USB versions of the SideWinder gamepad have a round digital directional pad instead of the more traditional cross shaped directional pad and lack the mode button The Microsoft SideWinder s button layout is very similar to that of the Sega Saturn controller which was released over the same time period br The Webdings dingbat font displays a picture of this gamepad for the character br br br D Pro br br As Microsoft s first SideWinder joystick the D Pro was responsible for setting the overall design as seen in all of Microsoft s future joysticks Designed as a gaming neutral joystick rather than a specialized joystick for use with realistic combat flight simulators the D Pro was built with a functional but low key geometric design Intended to rival the other sticks from the time the D Pro included buttons on the base on the stick an way hat switch a slider based throttle and the stick itself was twistable for Z rudder spin control By going with a geometric design however it meant the D Pro lacked an effective adherence to ergonomic principles making it unsuitable for long gaming sessions for some users br Electronically the D Pro used a digital analog hybrid design that was intended to correct the outstanding flaws in traditional analog joysticks such as drift and CPU overhead by using a digital optical tracking mechanism to keep perfect track of the joystick and a digital communication method over the analog gameport However this digital mode required software support and could not be used with many DOS games at the time MechWarrior being the only major exception as most software and gameports were built completely around an analog design br Additionally some soundcard gameports and so called accelerated game ports which attempted to resolve CPU overhead issues presented by polling the gameport directly themselves such as those produced by Gravis would not always be able to handle the stick in digital mode br The D Pro had a unique feature in that it could fall back to an analog emulation mode where it could emulate either a CH Flightstick Pro or a Thrustmaster FCS Selectable by a switch on the base in environments where the digital mode would not work br In this mode manual calibration was required the four base buttons no longer function and the joystick would function essentially like a CH Flightstick Pro or Thrustmaster FCS depending on the mode selector switch br However on later operating systems the digital mode would be less and less reliable and on modern PCs most D Pro owners can only run in analog mode The D Pro was popular enough to spawn a successor the Precision Pro which was a USB device and while it did not work in DOS at all was far more reliable under Windows despite quality issues br The joystick was widely praised in its inception and was one of the few joysticks with multiple buttons that did not require a keyboard pass through The stick was especially popular with MechWarrior and Descent players as it was one of the few multi button joysticks supported by the games natively br The joystick s popularity has created a small die hard following with many people still holding onto them despite their age This resulted in the creation of a USB adapter for the D Pro br The D Pro features as a character in the Webdings dingbat font br br br Standard br The SideWinder Standard joystick was a more basic joystick released around the same time as the D Pro It was a simple two button three axis joystick It featured a trigger button a thumb button and a throttle wheel on left side of the base In addition it had two additional dials on the base for adjustment of the stick itself one above stick and the other to the right of the stick It used a gameport connector to interface with the computer br br br Precision Pro br br Microsoft introduced the SideWinder Precision Pro in correcting the ergonomic issues fixing some of the electrical issues and adding new features br The Precision Pro introduced a new stick that was far more ergonomic than the geometric design of the D Pro Microsoft also gave the rest of the Precision Pro a more rounded design replacing the rectangular base buttons with more rounded versions at the top of the base the slider based throttle with a wheel based throttle and the base itself was made more rounded The Precision Pro also added a shift button to the base doubling the number of possible button combinations br Signatures can be seen inside the joystick on the base coverplate Fred Iyc and Edie Adams are among the people who have signed it br For its electronics the Precision Pro featured a refined hybrid system resolving some of the hardware compatibility issues with the D Pro However with the widespread introduction of USB in consumer computers shortly after the Precision Pro was released Microsoft soon re released the joystick in a USB compatible form joysticks labeled as Part No X Product I D The revised joystick still featured a gameport connector but had additional circuitry for interfacing with USB and was bundled with a USB converter a DIY converter project exists Original Precision Pros remain incompatible with this converter but a user made converter exists The creation of the USB converter bypassed the problems with the analog gameport entirely and as a result became the true solution to the electrical problems However due to a flaw in the design of the Precision Pro in rare cases the stick would build up a static charge in its electronics and require either a complex process to discharge that was not always successful or simply needed to stay unpowered for a number of hours to slowly discharge on its own This is also one of the first joysticks to use light sensors instead of potentiometers so it required no calibration and thus had no electronical moving parts The only moving parts were mechanical on the throttle and joystick pivots which gave this joystick virtually unlimited lifetime The Precision Pro had reintroduced potentiometers to save money and thus their lifetime was limited to wear and tear of the potentiometers br Thanks to the timing of the launch of the Precision Pro to coincide with the widespread launch of USB along the ergonomic corrections and rarity of the static charge problem the Precision Pro saw a much higher sales volume and review scores than the earlier D Pro br br br Force Feedback Pro br From technology acquired from EXOS Inc Microsoft then released a force feedback product called the Force Feedback Pro Built on the design of the Precision Pro the Force Feedback Pro differed only in the inclusion of motors for the force feedback effects and the lack of USB compatibility A DIY converter project exists Due to the inclusion of the motors the Force Feedback Pro was significantly larger and heavier than the Precision Pro making it easy to differentiate between the two br As the PC joystick port is input only the only way for data to be sent to the joystick to trigger force feedback events is to use the MIDI capabilities of the port This extension to the original gameport first popularised by Creative Labs in their early sound cards was intended to allow MIDI instruments to be connected to the joystick port but is used here to provide bidirectional communication with the joystick instead Force feedback events are triggered by messages on MIDI channel with effect data uploaded via SysEx messages This means that force feedback would be unavailable on the earliest of PCs where the gameports lack MIDI functionality br br br Precision br br The basis of Microsoft s last generation of SideWinder joysticks the Precision design was a further refinement of the previous Precision Pro Compared to the Precision Pro the Precision dropped the Pro s shift button replaced the throttle wheel with a more traditional lever and rearranged the face buttons on the stick into a symmetric design The Precision also dropped all gameport compatibility by only shipping in a USB version and was slightly smaller and lighter than the Pro In spite of being Microsoft s nd generation USB controller the Precision in particular seemed to suffer more from the USB SideWinder s long standing static buildup problem than the original Precision Pro br br br Force Feedback br Along with replacing the Precision Pro with a new design the Force Feedback Pro was replaced with a Precision derivative the Force Feedback Compared to the Force Feedback Pro and the Precision nothing new was added to the Force Feedback that wasn t added to the Precision in fact the shift button was taken away The overall size and weight difference was not so great with the use of smaller motors This joystick came in two varieties one version with a silver trigger and textured hard plastic grip and an updated version with translucent red parts trigger buttons rounded part at the bottom that switched to a rubberized coating on the grip One of the main changes in the Force Feedback from the Force Feedback Pro was removing the external power brick and replacing it with an internal power supply Since the release of the Force Feedback the stick has garnered a reputation of reliability and resiliency many Force Feedback sticks are still in use currently On eBay Sidewinder Force Feedback joysticks regularly sell for more than the original MSRP of br br br Joystick br Using the Precision design once again Microsoft introduced a value oriented SideWinder joystick simply called the SideWinder Joystick In spite of its value designation the SideWinder Joystick was functionally similar to the Precision The main features dropped were Z axis control and the way hat switch Otherwise the differences were cosmetic including shrinking the base moving the throttle to the front of the base and replacing of the rounded buttons on the stick with more rectangular buttons Support for this joystick was dropped with the advent of Windows XP br br br Force Feedback Wheel br The Microsoft SideWinder Force Feedback Wheel is a steering wheel controller for sim racing It was the first wheel controller to contain force feedback The USB version of the wheel is compatible with one PlayStation game Tokyo Xtreme Racer Zero br br br Strategic Commander br br The Strategic Commander is designed to complement a standard mouse keyboard setup for Real Time Strategy games It features a total of programmable command buttons zoom buttons shift buttons a macro record button and a point configuration switch The device also has three movement axes X Y and Z rotation Through extensive configuration of the shift and command buttons it is possible to create a total of different commands per configuration br The Strategic Commander is a highly ergonomic device and resembles a large mouse in shape contoured for the left hand It has an upper section attached to a base On the upper section the programmable buttons mentioned above are located near the tips of the index middle and ring fingers for quick access Three buttons are located near the thumb in an arc br A feature of the device is that the upper section is also a axis motion controller with additional support for rotation It allows motion in the X Y Z axis corresponding to Forward Backwards Strafe left right Turn left right This made it useful for first person shooters because one can aim weapons or look up and down with the right hand while simultaneously slewing position with the left hand and change weapons etc with the left finger buttons br Software was included for the device to provide hotkeys for a number of then popular games The buttons are also programmable allowing the device to be used with other games and applications For example one application developed at Carnegie Mellon used the device as a peripheral for navigating massive social network maps br Linux treats this device as a joystick with all axis and plus buttons and can be used as one or using various applets can be used as a joystick action to key press device e g Joy Key br br br Game Voice br The Game Voice is an early voice chat device It was shaped like a hockey puck with four channel buttons that allowed the user to speak to individual teammates It could also be set to communicate with the entire team or globally to all players The driver software also allowed it to function as a voice command device using programmable macros The package included a headset with an attached microphone though these could be substituted with any other PC headset microphone The puck acted as an intermediary between the sound card and the sound input output devices The headset along with the system speakers plugged into the puck where a switch could be used to set whether sound would be output from the speakers or the headset The puck also had its own volume control To provide power for the puck LEDs and drive the voice command and channel functions a USB connection was also required Microsoft recommended Game Voice as a microphone for use with the speech recognition feature of Microsoft Office XP br Microsoft discontinued the product in By then the market for voice chat had seen intense competition from downloadable and free to use software like Ventrilo and TeamSpeak among others These software packages only charge the host or server whereas each person would have to own a Game Voice in order to use the hardware and software As a result the Game Voice ultimately lost that market However these competing software packages do not offer voice command systems br Microsoft has not released the hardware specifications so that an open source driver could be developed The device is supported under Windows XP but no new driver is planned for Windows Vista Despite this Linux based operating systems can use this device using various third party applets i e Kamevoice br br br Freestyle Pro br br The Freestyle Pro released in was a unique gamepad as the up down left right directions in analogue mode were controlled by the physical movement of the controller more precisely by the absolute pitch and roll position of the pad Similar behavior would later be found in the Sony PlayStation SIXAXIS line introduced in Games such as Motocross Madness which was bundled with and designed for the controller profited from this physical interaction The left side of the controller features an eight direction d pad which function varies depending on which mode the controller is on br The control pad had a total of ten digital fire buttons six buttons controlled with the right thumb named ABC XYZ two shoulder buttons one left one right and two buttons controlled with the left thumb one named start the other marked with a shift key symbol as the SideWinder software allowed to use this button to shift controls for the ABC XYZ buttons on the driver side it was just an action button like the others br A sensor button switched the control pad between analogue mode green LED and digital mode red LED In analogue mode the x and y axis were controlled by the analogue controller movements and the D pad was used as a hat switch In digital mode the D pad controlled the x and y axis like a traditional digital control pad therefore there was no hat switch function in digital mode br Due to the release in at which time USB was just taking off the Freestyle Pro supported both game port and USB connection Without the adapter the controller s cable ended in a game port plug The sale box contained the game port to USB adapter for free br br br Dual Strike br The Dual Strike which debuted in was Microsoft s second notable venture into strange gamepad designs following the Freestyle Pro The Dual Strike attempted to blend both mouse and gamepad functions into a single unit It was composed of two portions there is a hinge between the two that allows the user to rotate the right side up and down and from side to side The Dual Strike only supported USB br br br Sidewinder br br This is similar to the Precision Pro and has a USB connection Circa Serial numbers begin with br br br Second generation br br In following a collaboration with Razer in creating the Microsoft Habu and Microsoft Reclusa a gaming mouse and gaming keyboard sold under the plain Microsoft Hardware brand Microsoft resurrected the SideWinder brand with an all new SideWinder Mouse designed from the ground up for high end PC gaming The design incorporated a number of advanced features including adjustable weights programmable macro mode on the fly DPI change and a built in LCD display the first ever found in a mouse br In Microsoft also released the SideWinder X Gaming Keyboard which is designed to be the keyboard counterpart of the Sidewinder Mouse It features up to programmable macro keys volume control media control a detachable numpad and backlighting Along with this keyboard a new mouse was released dubbed the SideWinder X The X has a more basic function set than its predecessor but was well received because of its lower price Its shape is the same as the original but without the LCD weight adjusting and metal side buttons It also comes with a complete black design with red LED Jets on the back to make it stand out from the original and better fit the X keyboard br In February Microsoft released another update to the SideWinder line the SideWinder X gaming mouse This new iteration incorporated new Microsoft BlueTrack tracking technology intended to provide better tracking on non standard surfaces In addition the mouse was made wireless and the maximum DPI sensitivity was upped to br In March Microsoft released a second gaming keyboard the Sidewinder X In comparison with the earlier X anti ghosting technology was added However the detachable numpad was removed and a numpad was instead attached permanently to the keyboard br As of October Microsoft no longer offers any gaming mice or keyboards in the US br br br See also br Microsoft ergonomic keyboards br Xbox controller br Xbox
