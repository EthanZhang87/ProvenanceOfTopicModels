An arcade cabinet also known as an arcade machine or a coin op cabinet or coin op machine is the housing within which an arcade game s electronic hardware resides Most cabinets designed since the mid s conform to the Japanese Amusement Machine Manufacturers Association JAMMA wiring standard Some include additional connectors for features not included in the standard br br br Parts of an arcade cabinet br Because arcade cabinets vary according to the games they were built for or contain they may not possess all of the parts listed below br br A display output on which the game is displayed They may display either raster or vector graphics raster being most common Standard resolution is between and vertical lines depending on the refresh rate usually between and Hz Slower refresh rates allow for better vertical resolution Monitors may be oriented horizontally or vertically depending on the game Some games use more than one monitor Some newer cabinets have monitors that can display high definition video br An audio output for sound effects and music usually produced from a sound chip br Printed circuit boards PCB or arcade system boards the actual hardware upon which the game runs Hidden within the cabinet Some systems such as the SNK Neo Geo MVS use a mainboard with game carts Some mainboards may hold multiple game carts as well br A power supply to provide DC power to the arcade system boards and low voltage lighting for the coin slots and lighted buttons br A marquee a sign above the monitor displaying the game s title They are often brightly colored and backlit br A bezel which is the border around the monitor It may contain instructions or artwork br A control panel a level surface near the monitor upon which the game s controls are arranged Control panels sometimes have playing instructions Players often pile their coins or tokens on the control panels of upright and cocktail cabinets br Coin slots coin returns and the coin box which allow for the exchange of money or tokens They are usually below the control panel Very often translucent red plastic buttons are placed in between the coin return and the coin slot When they are pressed a coin or token that has become jammed in the coin mechanism is returned to the player See coin acceptor In some arcades the coin slot is replaced with a card reader that reads data from a game card bought from the arcade operator br The sides of the arcade cabinet are usually decorated with brightly colored stickers or paint representing the gameplay of their particular game br br br Types of cabinets br There are many types of arcade cabinets some being custom made for a particular game however the most common are the upright the cocktail or table and the sit down br br br Upright cabinets br br Upright cabinets are the most common in North America with their design heavily influenced by Computer Space and Pong While the futuristic look of Computer Space s outer fiberglass cabinet did not carry forward both games did establish separating parts of the arcade machine for the cathode ray tube CRT display the game controllers and the computer logic areas Atari also had placed the controls at a height suitable for most adult players to use but close enough to the console s base to also allow children to play Further the cabinets were more compact than traditional electro mechanical games and did not use flashing lights or other means to attract players The side panels of Atari s Pong had a simple wood veneer finish making it easier to market to non arcade venues such as hotels country clubs and cocktail bars In the face of growing competition Atari started to include cabinet art and attraction panels around which soon became a standard practice br Arcade cabinets today are usually made of wood and metal about six feet or two meters tall with the control panel set perpendicular to the monitor at slightly above waist level The monitor is housed inside the cabinet at approximately eye level The marquee is above it and often overhangs it br In Computer Space Pong and other early arcade games the CRT was mounted degrees from the ground facing directly outward Arcade game manufacturers began incorporating design principles from older electro magnetic games by using CRTs mounted at a degree angle facing upward and away from the player but towards a one way mirror that reflected the display to the player Additional transparent overlays could be added between the mirror and the player s view to include additional images and colorize the black and white CRT output as is the case in Boot Hill Other games like Warrior used a one sided mirror and included an illuminated background behind the mirror so that the on screen characters would appear to the players as if they were on that background With the advent of color CRT displays the need for the mirror was eliminated The CRT was subsequently positioned at an angle permitting a typical adult player to look directly at the screen br Controls are most commonly a joystick for as many players as the game allows plus action buttons and player buttons which serve the same purpose as the start button on console gamepads Trackballs are sometimes used instead of joysticks especially in games from the early s Spinners knobs for turning also called paddle controls are used to control game elements that move strictly horizontally or vertically such as the paddles in Arkanoid and Pong Games such as Robotron Smash TV and Battlezone use double joysticks instead of action buttons Some versions of the original Street Fighter had pressure sensitive rubber pads instead of buttons br If an upright is housing a driving game it may have a steering wheel and throttle pedal instead of a joystick and buttons If the upright is housing a shooting game it may have light guns attached to the front of the machine via durable cables Some arcade machines had the monitor placed at the bottom of the cabinet with a mirror mounted at around degrees above the screen facing the player This was done to save space as a large CRT monitor would otherwise poke out the back of the cabinet To correct for the mirrored image some games had an option to flip the video output using a dip switch setting Other genres of games such as Guitar Freaks feature controllers resembling musical instruments br Upright cabinet shape designs vary from the simplest symmetric perpendicular boxes as with Star Trek to complicated asymmetric forms br Games are typically for one or two players however games such as Gauntlet feature as many as four sets of controls br br br Sit down or table cabinets br br br Cocktail cabinets br br Cocktail cabinets are shaped like low rectangular tables with the controls usually set at either of the broad ends or though not as common at the narrow ends and the monitor inside the table the screen facing upward Two player games housed in cocktails were usually alternant each player taking turns The monitor reverses its orientation game software controlled for each player so the game display is properly oriented for each player This requires special programming of the cocktail versions of the game usually set by dip switches The monitor s orientation is usually in player two s favor only in two player games when it s player two s turn and in player one s favor all other times Simultaneous player games that are built as a cocktail include Warlords and others br In Japan many games manufactured by Taito from the s to the early s have the cocktail versions prefixed by T T in their titles eg T T Space Invaders br Cocktail cabinet versions were usually released alongside the upright version of the same game They were relatively common in the s especially during the Golden Age of Arcade Games but have since lost popularity Their main advantage over upright cabinets was their smaller size making them seem less obtrusive although requiring more floor space more so by having players seated at each end The top of the table was covered with a piece of tempered glass making it convenient to set drinks on hence the name and they were often seen in bars and pubs br br br Candy cabinets br br Owing to the resemblance of plastic to hard candy they are often known as candy cabinets by both arcade enthusiasts and by people in the industry They are also generally easier to clean and move than upright cabinets but usually just as heavy as most have screens as opposed to They are positioned so that the player can sit down on a chair or stool and play for extended periods SNK sold many Neo Geo MVS cabinets in this configuration though most arcade games made in Japan that only use a joystick and buttons will come in a sit down cabinet variety In Japanese arcades this type of cabinet is generally more prevalent than the upright kind and they are usually lined up in uniform looking rows A variant of this often referred to as versus style cabinets are designed to look like two cabinets facing each other with two monitors and separate controls allowing two players to fight each other without having to share the same monitor and control area Some newer cabinets can emulate these versus style cabinets through networking br br br Deluxe cabinets br br Deluxe cabinets also known as DX cabinets in Japan are most commonly used for games involving gambling long stints of gaming such as fighting games or vehicles such as flight simulators and racing games These cabinets typically have equipment resembling the controls of a vehicle though some of them are merely large cabinets with fair features such as a great screen or chairs Driving games may have a bucket seat foot pedals a stick shift and even an ignition while flight simulators may have a flight yoke or joystick and motorcycle games handlebars and a seat shaped like a full size bike Often these cabinets are arranged side by side to allow players to compete together Sega is one of the biggest manufacturers of these kinds of cabinets while Namco released Ridge Racer Full Scale in which the player sits in a full size Mazda MX road car br br br Cockpit or environmental cabinets br A cockpit or environmental cabinet is a type of deluxe cabinet where the player sits inside the cabinet itself It also typically has an enclosure Examples of this can be seen on the Killer List of Videogames including shooter games such as Star Fire Missile Command SubRoc D Star Wars Astron Belt Sinistar and Discs of Tron as well as racing games such as Monaco GP Turbo and Pole Position A number of cockpit or environmental cabinets incorporate hydraulic motion simulation as covered in the section below br br br Motion simulator cabinets br A motion simulator cabinet is a type of deluxe cabinet that is very elaborate including hydraulics which move the player according to the action on screen In Japan they are known as taikan games with taikan meaning body sensation in Japanese Sega is particularly known for these kinds of cabinets with various types of sit down and cockpit motion cabinets that Sega have been manufacturing since the s Namco was another major manufacturer of motion simulator cabinets br Motorbike racing games since Sega s Hang On have had the player sit on and move a motorbike replica to control the in game actions like a motion controller Driving games since Sega s Out Run have had hydraulic motion simulator sit down cabinets while hydraulic motion simulator cockpit cabinets have been used for space combat games such as Sega s Space Tactics and Galaxy Force rail shooters such as Space Harrier and Thunder Blade and combat flight simulators such as After Burner and G LOC Air Battle One of the most sophisticated motion simulator cabinets is Sega s R which simulates the full degree rotation of an aircraft br br br Mini or cabaret cabinets br Mini or cabaret cabinets are similar forms of arcade cabinet but are intended for different markets Modern mini cabinets are sold directly to consumers and are not intended for commercial operation They are styled just like a standard upright cabinet often with full art and marquees but are scaled down to more easily fit in a home environment or be used by children The older form of mini or cabaret cabinets were marketed for commercial use and are no longer made They were often thinner as well as shorter lacked side art and had smaller marquees and monitors This reduced their cost reduced their weight made them better suited to locations with less space and also made them less conspicuous in darker environments In place of side art they were often clad in faux wood grain vinyl instead br br br Countertop cabinets br Countertop or bartop cabinets are usually only large enough to house their monitors and control panels They are often used for trivia and gambling type games and are usually found installed on bars or tables in pubs and restaurants These cabinets often have touchscreen controls instead of traditional push button controls They are also fairly popular with home use as they can be placed upon a table or countertop br br br Large scale satellite machines br Usually found in Japan these machines have multiple screens interconnected to one system sometimes with one big screen in the middle These also often feature the dispensation of different types of cards either a smartcard in order to save stats and progress or trading cards used in the game br br br Conversion kit br br An arcade conversion kit also known as a software kit is special equipment that can be installed into an arcade machine that changes the current game it plays into another one For example a conversion kit can be used to reconfigure an arcade machine designed to play one game so that it would play its sequel or update instead such as from Street Fighter II Champion Edition to Street Fighter II Turbo br br br Restoration br Since arcade games are becoming increasingly popular as collectibles an entire niche industry has sprung up focused on arcade cabinet restoration There are many websites both commercial and hobbyist and newsgroups devoted to arcade cabinet restoration They are full of tips and advice on restoring games to mint condition br br br Artwork br Often game cabinets were used to host a variety of games Often after the cabinet s initial game was removed and replaced with another the cabinet s side art was painted over usually black so that the cabinet would not misrepresent the game contained within The side art was also painted over to hide damaged or faded artwork br Of course hobbyists prefer cabinets with original artwork in the best possible condition Since machines with good quality art are hard to find one of the first tasks is stripping any old artwork or paint from the cabinet This is done with conventional chemical paint strippers or by sanding preferences vary Normally artwork cannot be preserved that has been painted over and is removed with any covering paint New paint can be applied in any manner preferred roller brush spray Paint used is often just conventional paint with a finish matching the cabinet s original paint br Many games had artwork that was silkscreened directly on the cabinets Others used large decals for the side art Some manufacturers produce replication artwork for popular classic games each varying in quality This side art can be applied over the new paint after it has dried These appliques can be very large and must be carefully applied to avoid bubbles or wrinkles from developing Spraying the surface with a slightly soapy water solution allows the artwork to be quickly repositioned if wrinkles or bubbles develop like in window tinting applications br br br Control panels bezels marquees br Acquiring these pieces is harder than installing them Many hobbyists trade these items via newsgroups or sites such as eBay the same is true for side art As with side art some replication art shops also produce replication artwork for these pieces that is indistinguishable from the original Some even surpass the originals in quality Once these pieces are acquired they usually snap right into place br If the controls are worn and need replacing if the game is popular they can be easily obtained Rarer game controls are harder to come by but some shops stock replacement controls for classic arcade games Some shops manufacture controls that are more robust than originals and fit a variety of machines Installing them takes some experimentation for novices but are usually not too difficult to place br br br Monitors br While both use the same basic type of tube raster monitors are easier to service than vector monitors as the support circuitry is very similar to that which is used in CRT televisions and computer monitors and is typically easy to adjust for color and brightness On the other hand vector monitors can be challenging or very costly to service and some can no longer be repaired due to certain parts having been discontinued years ago Even finding a drop in replacement for a vector monitor is a challenge today as few were produced after their heyday in the early s CRT replacement is possible but the process of transferring the deflection yoke and other parts from one tube neck to the other also means a long process of positioning and adjusting the parts on the CRT for proper performance a job that may prove too challenging for the typical amateur arcade collector On the other hand it may be possible to retrofit other monitor technologies to emulate vector graphics br Some electronic components are stressed by the hot cramped conditions inside a cabinet Electrolytic capacitors dry out over time and if a classic arcade cabinet is still using its original components it may be near the end of its service life A common step in refurbishing vintage electronics of all types is recapping replacing certain capacitors and other parts to restore or ensure the continued safe operation of the monitor and power supplies Because of the capacity and voltage ratings of these parts it can be dangerous if not done properly and should only be attempted by experienced hobbyists or professionals If a monitor is broken it may be easier to just source a drop in replacement through coin op machine distributors or parts suppliers br br br Wiring br If a cabinet needs rewiring some wiring kits are available over the Internet An experienced hobbyist can usually solve most wiring problems through trial and error br Many cabinets are converted to be used to host a game other than the original In these cases if both games conform to the JAMMA standard the process is simple Other conversions can be more difficult but some manufacturers such as Nintendo have produced kits to ease the conversion process Nintendo manufactured kits to convert a cabinet from Classic wiring to VS wiring br br br See also
