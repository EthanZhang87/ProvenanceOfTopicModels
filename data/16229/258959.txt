title: Phone connector (audio)
id: 258959
A phone connector is a family of cylindrically shaped electrical connectors primarily for analog audio signals Invented in the late th century for telephone switchboards the phone connector remains in use for interfacing wired audio equipment such as headphones speakers microphones mixing consoles and electronic musical instruments e g electric guitars keyboards and effects units A male connector a plug is mated into a female connector a socket though other terminology is used br Plugs have to electrical contacts The tip contact is indented with a groove The sleeve contact is nearest the conductive or insulated handle Contacts are insulated from each other by a band of non conductive material Between the tip and sleeve are to ring contacts Since phone connectors have many uses it is common to simply name the connector according its number of rings br br The sleeve is usually a common ground reference voltage or return current for signals in the tip and any rings Thus the number of transmittable signals is less than the number of contacts br The outside diameter of the sleeve is millimetres inch for full sized connectors mm in for mini connectors and only mm in for sub mini connectors Rings are typically the same diameter as the sleeve br br br Other terms br The International Library of Technology simply uses jack for the female and plug for the male connector The Sound Reinforcement Handbook uses phone jack for the female and phone plug for the male connector Robert McLeish who worked at the BBC uses jack or jack socket for the female and jack plug for the male connector in his book Radio Production The American Society of Mechanical Engineers as of says the more fixed electrical connector is the jack while the less fixed connector is the plug without regard to the gender of the connector contacts The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in also made a standard that was withdrawn in br The intended application for a phone connector has also resulted in names such as audio jack headphone jack stereo plug microphone jack aux input etc Among audio engineers the connector may often simply be called a quarter inch to distinguish it from XLR another frequently used audio connector These naming variations are also used for the mm connectors which have been called mini phone mini stereo mini jack etc br RCA connectors are differently shaped but confusingly are similarly named as phono plugs and phono jacks or in the UK phono sockets mm connectors are sometimes counter to the connector manufacturers nomenclature referred to as mini phonos br Confusion also arises because phone jack and phone plug may sometimes refer to the RJ and various older telephone sockets and plugs that connect wired telephones to wall outlets br br br Historical development br The original inch mm version descends from as early as in Boston when the first telephone switchboard was installed or when an early switchboard was used for the first commercial manual telephone exchange in New Haven created by George W Coy br br Charles E Scribner filed a patent in to facilitate switchboard operation using his spring jack switch In it a conductive lever pushed by a spring is normally connected to one contact But when a cable with a conductive plug is inserted into a hole and makes contact with that lever the lever pivots and breaks its normal connection The receptacle was called a jack knife because of its resemblance to a pocket clasp knife This is said to be the origin of calling the receptacle a jack Scribner filed a patent in which removes the lever and resembles the modern connector and made improvements to switchboard design in subsequent patents filed in br br Henry P Clausen filed a patent in for improved construction of the telephone switchboard plug with today s inch TS form still used on audio equipment br Western Electric was the manufacturing arm of the Bell System and thus originated or refined most of the engineering designs including the telephone jacks and plugs which were later adopted by other industries including the US military br By Western Electric had designed a number of models for different purposes including br br By the two main plug designs were br br WE compatible with inch jacks such as jack for use on high density jack panels such as the A br WE compatible with inch jacks such as the br Several

MIL P also known as PJ Similar to Western Electric WE and thus not compatible with EIA RS br MIL P A Plug Telephone TYPE PJ and Accessory Screws and MIL DTL F Plugs Telephone and Accessory Screws with in mm diameter also known by the earlier Signal Corps PL designation These are commonly used as the microphone jack for aviation radios and on Collins S line and many Drake amateur radios MIL DTL F states This specification covers telephone plugs used in telephone including telephone switchboard consoles telegraph and teletype circuits and for connecting headsets handsets and microphones into communications circuits br br br Miniature size br The mm or miniature size was originally designed in the s as two conductor connectors for earpieces on transistor radios and remains a standard still used today This roughly half sized version of the original popularized by the Sony EFM J radio released in is still commonly used in portable applications and has a length of millimetres in The three conductor version became very popular with its application on the Walkman in as unlike earlier transistor radios these devices had no speaker of their own the usual way to listen to them was to plug in headphones There is also an EIA standard for inch miniature phone jacks br The mm or sub miniature sizes were similarly popularized on small portable electronics They often appeared next to a mm microphone jack for a remote control on off switch on early portable tape recorders the microphone provided with such machines had the on off switch and used a two pronged connector with both the and mm plugs They were also used for low voltage DC power input from wall adapters In the latter role they were soon replaced by coaxial DC power connectors mm phone jacks have also been used as headset jacks on mobile telephones see Mobile devices br The in and in sizes approximately mm and mm respectively in mm though those dimensions are only approximations All sizes are now readily available in two conductor unbalanced mono and three conductor balanced mono or unbalanced stereo versions br Four conductor versions of the mm plug and jack are used for certain applications A four conductor version is often used in compact camcorders and portable media players providing stereo sound and composite analog video It is also used for a combination of stereo audio a microphone and controlling media playback calls volume and or a virtual assistant on some laptop computers and most mobile phones and some handheld amateur radio transceivers from Yaesu Some headphone amplifiers have used it to connect balanced stereo headphones which require two conductors per audio channel as the channels do not share a common ground br br br Broadcast usage br By the s broadcast radio stations were using Western Electric Code No plugs and matching jacks for patching audio throughout studios This connector was used because of its use in AT T s Long Line circuits for the distribution of audio programs over the radio networks leased telephone lines Because of the large amount of space these patch panels required the industry began switching to conductor plugs and jacks in the late s using the WE Type plug with WE type jacks The type plug was used instead of the standard type switchboard plug because the location of the large bulb shape on this TRS plug would have resulted in both audio signal connections being shorted together for a brief moment while the plug was being inserted and removed The Type plug avoids this by having a shorter tip br br br Patch bay connectors br Professional audio and the telecommunication industry use a in mm diameter plug associated with trademarked names including Bantam TT Tini Telephone and Tini Tel They are not compatible with standard EIA RS IEC inch jacks In addition to a slightly smaller diameter they have a slightly different geometry The three conductor TRS versions are capable of handling balanced line signals and are used in professional audio installations Though unable to handle as much power and less reliable than a mm in jack Bantam connectors are used for mixing console and outboard patchbays in recording studio and live sound applications where large numbers of patch points are needed in a limited space The slightly different shape of Bantam plugs is also less likely to cause shorting as they are plugged in br br br Less common br br A two pin version known to the telecom industry as a connector consists of two inch phone plugs at a centre spacing of inch mm The socket versions of these can be used with normal phone plugs provided the plug bodies are not too large but the plug version will only mate with two sockets at inches centre spacing or with line sockets again with sufficiently small bodies These connectors are still used today in telephone company central offices on DSX patch panels for DS circuits A similar type of mm connector is often used in the armrests of older aircraft as part of the on board in flight entertainment system Plugging a stereo plug into one of the two mono jacks typically results in the audio coming into only one ear Adapters are available br A short barrelled version of the phone plug was used for th century high impedance mono headphones and in particular those used in World War II aircraft These have become rare It is physically possible to use a normal plug in a short socket but a short plug will neither lock into a normal socket nor complete the tip circuit br Less commonly used sizes both diameters and lengths are also available from some manufacturers and are used when it is desired to restrict the availability of matching connectors such as inch mm inside diameter jacks for fire safety communication in public buildings br br br Decline br However a trend of removing phone connectors from mobile devices started by Apple s iPhone in has resulted in the connector s decline see Mobile devices br Additionally there has been a plethora of alternative wired connectors that are capable of providing digital audio in addition to other signals which have made the phone connector redundant and thus considered a waste of space on some thinner computers see Trend removing phone connectors br br br Aviation and US military connectors br br The US military uses a variety of phone connectors including inch inch mm and inch inch mm diameter plugs br Commercial and general aviation GA civil aircraft headsets often use a pair of phone connectors A standard inch mm or conductor plug type PJ is used for headphones For the microphone a smaller inch inch mm diameter conductor plug type PJ is used br Military aircraft and civil helicopters have another type termed the U U Nexus TP also known as U A U Nexus TP and Nexus TP These are also known as US NATO plugs These have a in mm diameter shaft with four conductors allowing two for the headphones and two for the microphone Also used is the U U Nexus TP which has the same diameter as the U U but is slightly longer and has conductors instead of br There is a confusingly similar four conductor British connector Type H with a slightly larger diameter of mm in used for headsets in many UK military aircraft and often referred to as a UK NATO or European NATO connector br br br General use br br In the most common arrangement consistent with the original intention of the design the male plug is connected to a cable and the female socket is mounted in a piece of equipment A considerable variety of line plugs and panel sockets is available including plugs suiting various cable sizes right angle plugs and both plugs and sockets in a variety of price ranges and with current capacities up to amperes for certain heavy duty in versions intended for loudspeaker connections br Common uses of phone plugs and their matching sockets include br br Headphone and earphone jacks on a wide range of equipment mm in plugs are common on home and professional component equipment while mm plugs are nearly universal for portable audio equipment and headphones mm plugs are not as common but are used on communication equipment such as cordless phones mobile phones and two way radios especially in the earliest years of the st century before the mm became standard on mobile phones The use of headphone jacks in smartphones is declining as of in favor of USB C connectors and wireless Bluetooth solutions br Consumer electronics devices such as digital cameras camcorders and portable DVD players use mm connectors for composite video and audio output Typically a TRS connection is used for mono unbalanced audio plus video and a TRRS connection for stereo unbalanced audio plus analog video Cables designed for this use are often terminated with RCA connectors on the other end A combined video audio jack is also present on some computers several generations of the Raspberry Pi have analog audio and video from the same jack and Sony also used this style of connection as the TV out on some models of Vaio laptop br Hands free sets and headsets often use mm or mm connectors TRS connectors are used for mono audio out and an unbalanced microphone with a shared ground Four conductor TRRS phone connectors add an additional audio channel for stereo output TRRS connectors used for this purpose are sometimes interoperable with TRS connectors depending on how the contacts are used br Microphone inputs on tape and cassette recorders sometimes with remote control switching on the ring on early monaural cassette recorders mostly a dual pin version consisting of a mm TS for the microphone and a mm TS for remote control which switches the recorder s power supply br Patching points insert points on a wide range of equipment An unusual example is the Enigma machine which featured a plugboard as part of its encryption system br br br Computer sound br br Any number of mm sockets for input and output may be found on personal computers either from integrated sound hardware common on motherboards or from insertable sound cards The PC System Design Guide s color code for mm TRS sockets is common which assigns pink for microphone light blue for line in and lime for line level AC and its successor Intel High Definition Audio have been widely adopted specifications that while not mandating physical sockets do provide specifications for a front panel connector with pin assignments for two ports with jack detection Front panels commonly have a stereo output socket for headphones and slightly less commonly a stereo input socket for a mic The back panel may have additional sockets most commonly for line out mic line in and less commonly for multiple surround sound outs Laptops tend to have fewer sockets than desktops due to size constraints br br br Trend removing phone connectors br Sound may instead be transmitted via USB C Bluetooth display connectors with integrated sound e g DisplayPort and HDMI or via internal speakers and internal mics making the phone connector redundant br There is a recent trend for extremely thin devices e g MacBook Air and ChromeBook to eliminate phone connectors altogether Analog sound output can be achieved on these devices by using a USB sound card br br br Microphone power br Some computers include a mm TRS socket for mono microphone that delivers a V bias voltage on the ring to power an electret microphone s integrated buffer amplifier though details depend on the manufacturer The Apple PlainTalk microphone socket is a historical variant that accepts either a mm line input or an elongated mm TRS plug whose tip carries the amplifier s power br br br TRRS headset sockets br Some newer computers especially laptops have mm TRRS headset sockets which are compatible with phone headsets and may be distinguished by a headset icon instead of the usual headphones or microphone icons These are particularly used for voice over IP br br br Surround sound br Sound cards that output surround sound have three sockets to accommodate six channels front left and right surround left and right and center and subwoofer and channel sound cards from Creative Labs however use a single three conductor socket for the front speakers and two four conductor sockets This is to accommodate rear center or rear left and right channels without the need for additional sockets on the sound card br br br Combined TRS and TOSLINK br Some portable computers have a combined mm TRS TOSLINK jack supporting stereo audio output using either a TRS connector or TOSLINK stereo or Dolby Digital DTS digital output using a suitable optical adapter Most iMac computers have this digital analog combo output feature as standard with early MacBooks having two ports one for analog digital audio input and the other for output Support for input was dropped on various later models br br br Compatibility for different numbers of rings br The original application for the mm in phone jack was in manual telephone exchanges Many different configurations of these phone plugs were used some accommodating five or more conductors with several tip profiles Of these many varieties only the two conductor version with a rounded tip profile was compatible between different manufacturers and this was the design that was at first adopted for use with microphones electric guitars headphones loudspeakers and other audio equipment br When a three conductor version of the mm plug was introduced for use with stereo headphones it was given a sharper tip profile to make it possible to manufacture jacks that would accept only stereo plugs to avoid short circuiting the right channel of the amplifier This attempt has long been abandoned and now the convention is that all plugs fit all sockets of the same size regardless of whether they are balanced or unbalanced mono or stereo Most mm plugs mono or stereo now have the profile of the original stereo plug although a few rounded mono plugs are still produced The profiles of stereo miniature and sub miniature plugs have always been identical to the mono plugs of the same size br The results of this physical compatibility are br br If a conductor plug is inserted into a conductor socket then the socket s ring is shorted to ground thus any signal sent from that socket s ring is lost Equipment not designed for this short might for instance damage an audio amplifier channel br If a conductor plug is connected to a conductor socket normally the result is to leave the ring of the plug unconnected This open circuit is potentially dangerous to equipment using vacuum tubes but most solid state devices will tolerate an open condition br Equipment aware of this possible shorting allows for instance br br Mono equipment receiving stereo output will simply use the left tip channel as the mono input signal and lose the right ring channel of the stereo audio br The positive tip component of a balanced signal will be received though without the full benefits of balanced audio since the signal s negative ring component will be lost br Some devices for an even higher number of rings might possibly be backwards compatible with an opposite gendered device with fewer rings or may cause damage For example mm TRRS sockets that accept TRRS headsets stereo headphones with a mic are often compatible with standard TRS stereo headphones whereby the contact that expects a mic signal will instead simply become shorted to ground and thus will provide a zero signal Conversely those TRRS headsets can plug into TRS sockets in which case its speakers may still work even though its mic won t work the mic s signal contact will be disconnected br Because of a lack of standardization in the past regarding the dimensions length given to the ring conductor and the insulating portions on either side of it in mm in phone connectors and the width of the conductors in different brands and generations of sockets there are occasional issues with compatibility between differing brands of plug and socket This can result in a contact in the socket bridging shorting the ring and sleeve contacts on a phone connector br br br Video br br Equipment requiring video with stereo audio input or output sometimes uses mm TRRS connectors Two incompatible variants exist of millimetres in and mm in length and using the wrong variant may either simply not work or could cause physical damage br Attempting to fully insert the longer mm plug into a receptacle designed for the shorter mm plug may damage the receptacle and may damage any electronics located immediately behind the receptacle However partially inserting the plug will work as the tip ring ring distances are the same for both variants br A shorter plug in a socket designed for the longer connector may not be retained firmly and may result in wrong signal routing or a short circuit inside the equipment e g the plug tip may cause the contacts inside the receptacle tip ring etc to short together br The shorter mm TRRS variant is more common and physically compatible with standard mm TRS and TS connectors br br br Recording equipment br br Many small video cameras laptops recorders and other consumer devices use a mm microphone connector for attaching a microphone to the system These fall into three categories br br Devices that use an unpowered microphone usually a cheap dynamic or piezoelectric microphone The microphone generates its own voltage and needs no power br Devices that use a self powered microphone usually a condenser microphone with an internal battery powered amplifier br Devices that use a plug in powered microphone an electret microphone containing an internal FET amplifier These provide a good quality signal in a very small microphone However the internal FET needs a DC power supply which is provided as a bias voltage for an internal preamp transistor Plug in power is supplied on the same line as the audio signal using an RC filter The DC bias voltage supplies the FET amplifier at a low current while the capacitor decouples the DC supply from the AC input to the recorder Typically V V R k C F If a recorder provides plug in power and the microphone does not need it everything will usually work well In the converse case recorder provides no power microphone needs power no sound will be recorded br br br Mobile devices br br Three or four conductor TRS or TRRS mm and mm sockets were common on older cell phones and smartphones respectively providing mono three conductor or stereo four conductor sound and a microphone input together with signaling e g push a button to answer a call These are used both for handsfree headsets and for stereo headphones br However with the widespread use of wireless Bluetooth audio and the desire to make mobile devices thinner and waterproof there has been a trend to remove the phone socket This started in with Apple s iPhone and was initially mocked by other manufacturers like Samsung and Google who eventually followed suit However surface mount sockets waterproofed up to meter exist br mm TRRS stereo plus mic sockets became particularly common on smartphones and have been used by Nokia and others since and as mentioned in the compatibility section they are often compatible with standard mm stereo headphones Many computers especially laptops also include a TRRS headset socket compatible with the headsets intended for smartphones br The four conductors of a TRRS connector are assigned to different purposes by different manufacturers Any mm plug can be plugged mechanically into any socket but many combinations are electrically incompatible For example plugging TRRS headphones into a TRS headset socket a TRS headset into a TRRS socket or plugging TRRS headphones from one manufacturer into a TRRS socket from another may not function correctly or at all Mono audio will usually work but stereo audio or the microphone may not work or the pause play controls may be inactive as is common when trying to use headphones with controls for iPhones on an Android device or vice versa br br br TRRS standards br Two different forms are frequently found Both place left audio on the tip and right audio on the first ring same as stereo connectors They differ in the placement of the microphone and return contacts br The OMTP standard places the ground return on the sleeve and the microphone on the second ring It has been accepted as a national Chinese standard YDT In the West it is mostly used on older devices such as older Nokia mobiles older Samsung smartphones and some Sony Ericsson phones It is widely used in products meant for the Chinese market Headsets using this wiring are sometimes indicated by black plastic separators between the rings br The CTIA AHJ standard reverses these contacts putting the microphone on the sleeve It is used by Apple s iPhone line until the S and SE st In the West these products made it the de facto TRRS standard It is now used by HTC devices recent Samsung Nokia and Sony phones among others It has the disadvantage that the microphone gets shorted to ground if the device has a metal body and the sleeve has a flange touching the body Headsets using this wiring are sometimes indicated by white plastic separators between the rings br If a CTIA headset is connected to an OMTP device the missing ground effectively connects the speakers in series out of phase This removes the singer s voice on typical popular music recordings which place the singers in the center If the main microphone button is held down shorting across the microphone and restoring ground the correct sound may be audible br br The pole mm connector is defined by the Japanese standard JEITA EIAJ RC A Pole miniature concentric plugs and jacks originally published in pole mm TRS connectors are defined in JIS C See also JIS C and IEC br Apple s iPod Shuffle G reuses its TRRS socket not just for audio but also for charging and syncing over USB when docked br br br Interoperability br The USB Type C Cable and Connector Specification specifies a mapping from a USB C jack to a pole TRRS jack for the use of headsets and supports both CTIA and OMTP YD T modes Some devices transparently handle many jack standards and there are hardware implementations of this available as components This is accomplished in some cases by applying a voltage to the sleeve and second ring to detect the wiring The last two conductors may then be switched to allow a device made to one standard to be used with a headset made to the other br br br TRRRS standards br A TRRRS standard for mm connectors was developed by ITU T The standard called P formerly P MMIC outlines technical requirements and test methods for a conductor socket and plug configuration Compared to the TRRS standard TRRRS provides one extra conductor that can be used for connecting a second microphone or providing power to or from the audio accessory br P requires compliant sockets and plugs to be backward compatible with legacy TRRS and TRS connectors Therefore P compliant TRRRS connectors should allow for seamless integration when used on new products TRRRS connectors enable the following audio applications active noise canceling binaural recording and others where dual analog microphone lines can be directly connected to a host device It was commonly found on Sony phones starting with the Xperia Z XZ and Xperia II br Another TRRRS standard for mm connectors following JEITA RC C was introduced in and is used for balanced audio connections in particular for headphone cables This connector is often called a Pentaconn connector following the brand name of Nippon DICS NDICS It is used by some Sony products like the M Z Walkman of their Signature series and by some Sennheiser products like the HD headphone or the HDV DAC headphone amplifier br br br Switch contacts br br Panel mounted jacks may include switch contacts Most commonly a mono jack is provided with one normally closed NC contact which is connected to the tip live connection when no plug is in the socket and disconnected when a plug is inserted Stereo sockets commonly provide two such NC contacts one for the tip left channel and one for the ring or collar right channel Some jacks also have such a connection on the sleeve As this contact is usually ground it is not much use for signal switching but could be used to indicate to electronic circuitry that the jack is in use Less commonly jacks may feature normally open NO or change over contacts or the switch contacts may be isolated from the connector signals br The original purpose of these contacts was for switching in telephone exchanges for which there were many patterns Two sets of change over contacts isolated from the connector contacts were common The more recent pattern of one NC contact for each signal path internally attached to the connector contact stems from their use as headphone jacks In many amplifiers and equipment containing them such as electronic organs a headphone jack is provided that disconnects the loudspeakers when in use This is done by means of these switch contacts In other equipment a dummy load is provided when the headphones are not connected This is also easily provided by means of these NC contacts br Other uses for these contacts have been found One is to interrupt a signal path in a mixing console to insert an effects processor This is accomplished by using one NC contact of a stereo jack to connect the tip and ring together to affect a bypass when no plug is inserted A similar arrangement is used in patch panels for normalization see Patch panel Normalization br Where a mm or mm jack is used as a DC power inlet connector a switch contact may be used to disconnect an internal battery whenever an external power supply is connected to prevent incorrect recharging of the battery br To eliminate the need for a separate power switch a standard stereo jack is used on most battery powered guitar effects pedals The internal battery has its negative terminal wired to the sleeve contact of the jack When the user plugs in a two conductor mono plug the resulting short circuit between the sleeve and ring connects an internal battery to the unit s circuitry ensuring that it powers up or down automatically whenever a signal lead is inserted or removed br br br Design br br The connector assembly is usually made by one or more hollow and one solid pin The jack is then assembled with pins separated by an insulating material br Connectors that are tarnished or that were not manufactured within tight tolerances are prone to cause poor connections Depending upon the surface material of the connectors tarnished ones can be cleaned with a burnishing agent for solid brass contacts typical or contact cleaner for plated contacts br br br Audio signals br br Notes br br br Balanced audio br When a phone connector is used to make a balanced connection the two active conductors are used for differential versions of a monaural signal The ring used for the right channel in stereo systems is used instead for the inverting input br br br Advantages br Where space is a premium TRS connectors offer a more compact alternative to XLR connectors and so are common in small audio mixing desks br Another advantage offered by TRS connectors used for balanced microphone inputs is that a standard unbalanced signal lead using a TS phone jack can simply be plugged into such an input The inverting input on the ring contact gets correctly grounded when it makes contact with the plug body br br br Disadvantages br When using non switching phone connectors to make balanced audio connections the socket grounds the plug tip and ring when inserting or disconnecting the plug and the ground mates last This causes bursts of hum cracks and pops and may stress some outputs as they will be short circuited briefly or longer if the plug is left half in br This problem does not occur with XLR or when using gauge B which although it is of in mm diameter has a smaller tip and a recessed ring so that the ground contact of the socket never touches the tip or ring of the plug This type was designed for balanced audio use being the original telephone switchboard connector and is still common in broadcast telecommunications and many professional audio applications where it is vital that permanent circuits being monitored are not interrupted by the insertion or removal of connectors This same tapered shape used in the gauge B plug can be seen also in aviation and military applications on various diameters of jack connector including the PJ and Bantam plugs The more common straight sided profile used in domestic and commercial applications and discussed in most of this article is known as gauge A br Alternatively some switched audio jacks contain built in isolated switches that only activate when the plug is fully inserted This can be used to avoid the insertion issue for instance by wiring the connectors through a double pole double throw switch that activates only upon full insertion Or for instance by having the switch control a circuit that gracefully ramps up the audio once the plug is fully inserted and mutes the audio when not fully inserted br br br Unbalanced audio br Phone connectors with three conductors are also commonly used as unbalanced audio patch points or insert points or simply inserts with the output on many mixers found on the tip and the input on the ring This is often expressed as tip send ring return Older mixers and some outboard gear have unbalanced insert points with ring send tip return br In many implementations the switch contact within the panel socket is used to close the circuit between send and return when the patch point has no plug inserted Combining send and return functions via single in TRS connectors halves the space needed for insert jack fields which would otherwise require two jacks one for send and one for return br In some three conductor TRS phone inserts the concept is extended by using specially designed phone jacks that will accept a mono phone plug partly inserted to the first click and will then connect the tip to the signal path without breaking it Standard TRS connectors may also be used in this way with varying success br In some very compact equipment including modular synthesizers mm TS phone connectors are used for patch points br br br See also br br Banana connector br Coaxial power connector br
