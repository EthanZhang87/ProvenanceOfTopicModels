title: Attitude indicator
id: 315968
The attitude indicator AI formerly known as the gyro horizon or artificial horizon is a flight instrument that informs the pilot of the aircraft orientation relative to Earth s horizon and gives an immediate indication of the smallest orientation change The miniature aircraft and horizon bar mimic the relationship of the aircraft relative to the actual horizon It is a primary instrument for flight in instrument meteorological conditions br Attitude is always presented to users in the unit degrees However inner workings such as sensors data and calculations may use a mix of degrees and radians as scientists and engineers may prefer to work with radians br br br History br Before the advent of aviation artificial horizons were used in celestial navigation Proposals of such devices based on gyroscopes or spinning tops date back to the s Later implementations also known as bubble horizons were based on bubble levels and attached to a sextant In the s remnants of an artificial horizon using liquid mercury were recovered from the wreck of HMS Erebus br br br Use br br The essential components of the AI include a symbolic miniature aircraft mounted so that it appears to be flying relative to the horizon An adjustment knob to account for the pilot s line of vision moves the aircraft up and down to align it against the horizon bar The top half of the instrument is blue to represent the sky while the bottom half is brown to represent the ground The bank index at the top shows the aircraft angle of bank Reference lines in the middle indicate the degree of pitch up or down relative to the horizon br Most Russian built aircraft have a somewhat different design The background display is colored as in a Western instrument but moves up and down only to indicate pitch A symbol representing the aircraft which is fixed in a Western instrument rolls left or right to indicate bank angle A proposed hybrid version of the Western and Russian systems would be more intuitive but has never caught on br br br Operation br br The heart of the AI is a gyroscope gyro that spins at high speed from either an electric motor or through the action of a stream of air pushing on rotor vanes placed along its periphery The stream of air is provided by a vacuum system driven by a vacuum pump or a venturi Air passing through the narrowest portion of a venturi has lower air pressure through Bernoulli s principle The gyro is mounted in a double gimbal which allows the aircraft to pitch and roll as the gyro stays vertically upright A self erecting mechanism actuated by gravity counteracts any precession due to bearing friction It may take a few minutes for the erecting mechanism to bring the gyros to a vertical upright position after the aircraft engine is first powered up br Attitude indicators have mechanisms that keep the instrument level with respect to the direction of gravity The instrument may develop small errors in pitch or bank during extended periods of acceleration deceleration turns or due to the earth curving underneath the plane on long trips To start with they often have slightly more weight in the bottom so that when the aircraft is resting on the ground they will hang level and therefore they will be level when started But once they are started that pendulous weight in the bottom will not pull them level if they are out of level but instead its pull will cause the gyro to precess In order to let the gyro very slowly orient itself to the direction of gravity while in operation the typical vacuum powered gyro has small pendulums on the rotor casing that partially cover air holes When the gyro is out of level with respect to the direction of gravity the pendulums will swing in the direction of gravity and either uncover or cover the holes such that air is allowed or prevented from jetting out of the holes and thereby applying a small force to orient the gyro towards the direction of gravity Electric powered gyros may have different mechanisms to achieve a similar effect br Older AIs were limited in the amount of pitch or roll that they would tolerate Exceeding these limits would cause the gyro to tumble as the gyro housing contacted the gimbals causing a precession force Preventing this required a caging mechanism to lock the gyro if the pitch exceed and the roll exceeded Modern AIs do not have this limitation and therefore do not require a caging mechanism br br br Flight Director Attitude Indicator br br Attitude indicators are also used on crewed spacecraft and are called Flight Director Attitude Indicators FDAI where they indicate the craft s yaw angle nose left or right pitch nose up or down roll and orbit relative to a fixed space inertial reference frame from an Inertial Measurement Unit IMU The FDAI can be configured to use known positions relative to Earth or the stars so that the engineers scientists and astronauts can communicate the relative position attitude and orbit of the craft br br br Attitude and Heading Reference Systems br Attitude and Heading Reference Systems AHRS are able to provide three axis information based on ring laser gyroscopes that can be shared with multiple devices in the aircraft such as glass cockpit primary flight displays PFDs Rather than using a spinning gyroscope modern AHRS use solid state electronics low cost inertial sensors rate gyros and magnetometers br With most AHRS systems if an aircraft s AIs have failed there will be a standby AI located in the center of the instrument panel where other standby basic instruments such as the airspeed indicator and altimeter are also available These mostly mechanical standby instruments may remain available even if the electronic flight instruments fail although the standby attitude indicator may be electrically driven and will after a short time fail if its electrical power fails br br br Attitude Direction Indicator br br The Attitude Direction Indicator ADI or Flight Director Indicator FDI is an AI integrated with a Flight Director System FDS The ADI incorporates a computer that receives information from the navigation system such as the AHRS and processes this information to provide the pilot with a D flight trajectory cue to maintain a desired path The cue takes the form of V steering bars The aircraft is represented by a delta symbol and the pilot flies the aircraft so that the delta symbol is placed within the V steering bars br br br See also br Acronyms and abbreviations in avionics br Air India Flight br Korean Air Cargo Flight br Peripheral
