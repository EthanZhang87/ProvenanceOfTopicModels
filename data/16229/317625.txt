id: 317625
An image scanner often abbreviated to just scanner is a device that optically scans images printed text handwriting or an object and converts it to a digital image Commonly used in offices are variations of the desktop flatbed scanner where the document is placed on a glass window for scanning Hand held scanners where the device is moved by hand have evolved from text scanning wands to D scanners used for industrial design reverse engineering test and measurement orthotics gaming and other applications Mechanically driven scanners that move the document are typically used for large format documents where a flatbed design would be impractical br Modern scanners typically use a charge coupled device CCD or a contact image sensor CIS as the image sensor whereas drum scanners developed earlier and still used for the highest possible image quality use a photomultiplier tube PMT as the image sensor A rotary scanner used for high speed document scanning is a type of drum scanner that uses a CCD array instead of a photomultiplier Non contact planetary scanners essentially photograph delicate books and documents All these scanners produce two dimensional images of subjects that are usually flat but sometimes solid D scanners produce information on the three dimensional structure of solid objects br Digital cameras can be used for the same purposes as dedicated scanners When compared to a true scanner a camera image is subject to a degree of distortion reflections shadows low contrast and blur due to camera shake reduced in cameras with image stabilization Resolution is sufficient for less demanding applications Digital cameras offer the advantages of speed portability and non contact digitizing of thick documents without damaging the book spine In scanning technologies were combining D scanners with digital cameras to create full color photo realistic D models of objects br Scans are usually downloaded by a computer the unit is attached to Some scanners are able to store scans on standalone flash media e g memory cards and USB sticks br In the biomedical research area detection devices for DNA microarrays are called scanners as well These scanners are high resolution systems up to m pixel similar to microscopes The detection is done via CCD or photomultiplier tubes br br br History of scanners br Modern scanners are considered the successors of early telephotography and fax input devices br br br Types br br br Drum br br Drum scanners capture image information with photomultiplier tubes PMT rather than the charge coupled device CCD arrays found in flatbed scanners and inexpensive film scanners Reflective and transmissive originals are mounted on an acrylic cylinder the scanner drum which rotates at high speed while it passes the object being scanned in front of precision optics that deliver image information to the PMTs Modern color drum scanners use three matched PMTs which read red blue and green light respectively Light from the original artwork is split into separate red blue and green beams in the optical bench of the scanner with dichroic filters Photomultipliers offer superior dynamic range and for this reason drum scanners can extract more detail from very dark shadow areas of a transparency than flatbed scanners using CCD sensors The smaller dynamic range of the CCD sensors versus photomultiplier tubes can lead to loss of shadow detail especially when scanning very dense transparency film While mechanics vary by manufacturer most drum scanners pass light from halogen lamps though a focusing system to illuminate both reflective and transmissive originals br The drum scanner gets its name from the clear acrylic cylinder the drum on which the original artwork is mounted for scanning Depending on size it is possible to mount originals up to by inches mm mm but the maximum size varies by manufacturer One of the unique features of drum scanners is the ability to control sample area and aperture size independently The sample size is the area that the scanner encoder reads to create an individual pixel The aperture is the actual opening that allows light into the optical bench of the scanner The ability to control aperture and sample size separately are particularly useful for smoothing film grain when scanning black and white and color negative originals br While drum scanners are capable of scanning both reflective and transmissive artwork a good quality flatbed scanner can produce good scans from reflective artwork As a result drum scanners are rarely used to scan prints now that high quality inexpensive flatbed scanners are readily available Film however is where drum scanners continue to be the tool of choice for high end applications Because film can be wet mounted to the scanner drum which enhances sharpness and masks dust and scratches and because of the exceptional sensitivity of the PMTs drum scanners are capable of capturing very subtle details in film originals br The situation as of was that only a few companies continued to manufacture and service drum scanners While prices of both new and used units dropped from the start of the st century they were still much more costly than CCD flatbed and film scanners Image quality produced by flatbed scanners had improved to the degree that the best ones were suitable for many graphic arts operations and they replaced drum scanners in many cases as they were less expensive and faster However drum scanners with their superior resolution up to PPI color gradation and value structure continued to be used for scanning images to be enlarged and for museum quality archiving of photographs and print production of high quality books and magazine advertisements As second hand drum scanners became more plentiful and less costly many fine art photographers acquired them br br br Flatbed br This type of scanner is sometimes called a reflective scanner because it works by shining white light onto the object to be scanned and reading the intensity and color of light that is reflected from it usually a line at a time They are designed for scanning prints or other flat opaque materials but some have available transparency adapters which for a number of reasons in most cases are not very well suited to scanning film Some flatbed scanners incorporate sheet feeding mechanisms called ADFs Automatic Document Feeders br br br CCD scanner br A flatbed scanner is usually composed of a glass pane or platen under which there is a bright light often xenon LED or cold cathode fluorescent which illuminates the pane and a moving optical array in CCD scanning CCD type scanners typically contain three rows arrays of sensors with red green and blue filters br br br CIS scanner br br Contact image sensor CIS scanning consists of a moving set of red green and blue LEDs strobed for illumination and a connected monochromatic photodiode array under a rod lens array for light collection Images to be scanned are placed face down on the glass an opaque cover is lowered over it to exclude ambient light and the sensor array and light source move across the pane reading the entire area An image is therefore visible to the detector only because of the light it reflects Transparent images do not work in this way and require special accessories that illuminate them from the upper side Many scanners offer this as an option br br br Sheetfed br Sheetfed scanners do not have a scanning bed have a mechanism to feed paper through the scanner and some are capable of scanning several sheets at once using an ADF although others only accept one page at a time A printer cartridge the Canon IS was released that could be used to convert an inkjet printer into a sheetfed scanner br br br Book scanners br These scanners have an overhead scanning mechanism that moves a beam of light or have a fixed camera and a scanning area defined by a mat to easily scan books br br br Film br br This type of scanner is sometimes called a slide or transparency scanner and it works by passing a narrowly focused beam of light through the film and reading the intensity and color of the light that emerges Usually uncut film strips of up to six frames or four mounted slides are inserted in a carrier which is moved by a stepper motor across a lens and CCD sensor inside the scanner Some models are mainly used for same size scans Film scanners vary a great deal in price and quality The lowest cost dedicated film scanners can be had for less than and they might be sufficient for modest needs From there they inch up in staggered levels of quality and advanced features upward of five figures The specifics vary by brand and model and the end results are greatly determined by the level of sophistication of the scanner s optical system and equally important the sophistication of the scanning software br br br Roller scanner br br Scanners are available that pull a flat sheet over the scanning element between rotating rollers They can only handle single sheets up to a specified width typically inches mm to accommodate both US letter and standard A sizes but can be very compact just requiring a pair of narrow rollers between which the document is passed br br A roller scanner may be embedded inside a computer keyboard with a footprint no larger than a computer keyboard br Some roller scanners are portable powered by batteries and with their own storage eventually transferring stored scans to a computer over a USB or other interface br br br D scanner br br D scanners collect data on the three dimensional shape and appearance of an object br br br Planetary scanner br br Planetary scanners scan a delicate object without physical contact br br br Hand br br Hand scanners are moved over the subject to be imaged by hand There are two different types document and D scanners br br br Hand document scanner br br Hand held document scanners are manual devices that are dragged or gilded across the surface of the image to be scanned by hand also known as wand scanners Scanning documents in this manner requires a steady hand as an uneven scanning rate produces distorted images an indicator light on the scanner indicates if motion is too fast They typically have a start button which is held by the user for the duration of the scan some switches to set the optical resolution and a roller which generates a clock pulse for synchronization with the computer Older hand scanners were monochrome and produced light from an array of green LEDs to illuminate the image later ones scan in monochrome or color as desired A hand scanner may have a small window through which the document being scanned could be viewed In the early s many hand scanners had a proprietary interface module specific to a particular type of computer such as an Atari ST or Commodore Amiga Since the introduction of the USB standard it is the interface most commonly used As hand scanners are much narrower than most normal document or book sizes software or the end user needed to combine several narrow strips of scanned documents to produce the finished article br Inexpensive portable battery powered or USB powered glide over hand or pen scanners typically capable of scanning an area as wide as a normal letter and much longer remain available as of Some computer mice can also scan documents br br br Hand D scanner br Handheld D scanners are used in industrial design reverse engineering inspection and analysis digital manufacturing and medical applications To compensate for the uneven motion of the human hand most D scanning systems rely on the placement of reference markers typically adhesive reflective tabs that the scanner uses to align elements and mark positions in space br br br Portable br Image scanners are usually used in conjunction with a computer which controls the scanner and stores scans Small portable scanners either roller fed or glide over hand operated operated by batteries and with storage capability are available for use away from a computer stored scans can be transferred later Many can scan both small documents such as business cards and till receipts and letter sized documents br br br Smartphone scanner app br The higher resolution cameras fitted to some smartphones can produce reasonable quality document scans by taking a photograph with the phone s camera and post processing it with a scanning app a range of which are available for most phone operating systems to whiten the background of a page correct perspective distortion so that the shape of a rectangular document is corrected convert to black and white etc Many such apps can scan multiple page documents with successive camera exposures and output them either as a single file or multiple page files Some smartphone scanning apps can save documents directly to online storage locations such as Dropbox and Evernote send via email or fax documents via email to fax gateways br Smartphone scanner apps can be broadly divided into three categories br br Document scanning apps primarily designed to handle documents and output PDF and sometimes JPEG files br Photo scanning apps that output JPEG files and have editing functions useful for photo rather than document editing br Barcode like QR code scanning apps that then search the internet for information associated with the code br br br Scan quality br Color scanners typically read RGB red green blue color data from the array This data is then processed with some proprietary algorithm to correct for different exposure conditions and sent to the computer via the device s input output interface usually USB previous to which was SCSI or bidirectional parallel port in older units br Color depth varies depending on the scanning array characteristics but is usually at least bits High quality models have bits of color depth br Another qualifying parameter for a scanner is its resolution measured in pixels per inch ppi sometimes more accurately referred to as Samples per inch spi Instead of using the scanner s true optical resolution the only meaningful parameter manufacturers like to refer to the interpolated resolution which is much higher thanks to software interpolation As of a high end flatbed scanner can scan up to ppi and drum scanners have an optical resolution of between and ppi br Effective resolution is the true resolution of a scanner and is determined by using a resolution test chart The effective resolution of most all consumer flatbed scanners is considerably lower than the manufactures given optical resolution Example is the Epson V Pro with an optical resolution given by manufacturer as being dpi and dpi dual lens but tested According to this we get a resolution of only about dpi that s just of the claimed resolution Dynamic range is claimed to be Dmax but Regarding the density range of the Epson Perfection V Pro which is indicated as one must say that here it doesn t reach the high quality of film scanners either br Manufacturers often claim interpolated resolutions as high as ppi but such numbers carry little meaningful value because the number of possible interpolated pixels is unlimited and doing so does not increase the level of captured detail br The size of the file created increases with the square of the resolution doubling the resolution quadruples the file size A resolution must be chosen that is within the capabilities of the equipment preserves sufficient detail and does not produce a file of excessive size The file size can be reduced for a given resolution by using lossy compression methods such as JPEG at some cost in quality If the best possible quality is required lossless compression should be used reduced quality files of smaller size can be produced from such an image when required e g image designed to be printed on a full page and a much smaller file to be displayed as part of a fast loading web page br Purity can be diminished by scanner noise optical flare poor analog to digital conversion scratches dust Newton s rings out of focus sensors improper scanner operation and poor software Drum scanners are said to produce the purest digital representations of the film followed by high end film scanners that use the larger Kodak Tri Linear sensors br The third important parameter for a scanner is its density range Dynamic Range or Drange see Densitometry A high density range means that the scanner is able to record shadow details and brightness details in one scan Density of film is measured on a base log scale and varies between transparent and about stops Density range is the space taken up in the to scale and Dmin and Dmax denote where the least dense and most dense measurements on a negative or positive film The density range of negative film is up to d while slide film dynamic range is d Color negative density range after processing is d thanks to the compression of the stops into a small density range Dmax will be the densest on slide film for shadows and densest on negative film for highlights Some slide films can have a Dmax close to d with proper exposure and so can black and white negative film br Consumer level flatbed photo scanners have a dynamic range in the range which can be inadequate for scanning all types of photographic film as Dmax can be and often is between d and d with traditional black and white film Color film compresses its stops of a possible stops film latitude into just d of space via the process of dye coupling and removal of all silver from the emulsion Kodak Vision has stops So color negative film scans the easiest of all film types on the widest range of scanners Because traditional black and white film retains the image creating silver after processing density range can be almost twice that of color film This makes scanning traditional black and white film more difficult and requires a scanner with at least a d dynamic range but also a Dmax between d to d High end photo lab flatbed scanners can reach a dynamic range of and Dmax around d Dedicated film scanners have a dynamic range between d d Office document scanners can have a dynamic range of less than d Drum scanners have a dynamic range of br By combining full color imagery with D models modern hand held scanners are able to completely reproduce objects electronically The addition of D color printers enables accurate miniaturization of these objects with applications across many industries and professions br For scanner apps the scan quality is highly dependent on the quality of the phone camera and on the framing chosen by the user of the app br br br Computer connection br br Scans must virtually always be transferred from the scanner to a computer or information storage system for further processing or storage There are two basic issues how the scanner is physically connected to the computer and how the application retrieves the information from the scanner br br br Direct physical connection to a computer br The file size of a scan can be up to about megabytes for a DPI x cm x slightly larger than A paper uncompressed bit image Scanned files must be transferred and stored Scanners can generate this volume of data in a matter of seconds making a fast connection desirable br Scanners communicate to their host computer using one of the following physical interfaces listing roughly from slow to fast br br Parallel port Connecting through a parallel port is the slowest common transfer method Early scanners had parallel port connections that could not transfer data faster than kilobytes second The primary advantage of the parallel port connection was economic and user skill level it avoided adding an interface card to the computer br GPIB General Purpose Interface Bus Certain drumscanners like the Howtek D featured both a SCSI and GPIB interface The latter conforms to the IEEE standard introduced in the mid s The GPIB interface has only been used by a few scanner manufacturers mostly serving the DOS Windows environment For Apple Macintosh systems National Instruments provided a NuBus GPIB interface card br Small Computer System Interface SCSI rarely used since the early st century supported only by computers with a SCSI interface either on a card or built in During the evolution of the SCSI standard speeds increased Widely available and easily set up USB and Firewire largely supplanted SCSI br Universal Serial Bus USB scanners can transfer data quickly The early USB standard could transfer data at megabytes per second slower than SCSI but the later USB standards can transfer at more than megabytes per second in practice br FireWire or IEEE is an interface of comparable speed to USB Possible FireWire speeds are and and megabits per second but devices may not support all speeds br Proprietary interfaces were used on some early scanners that used a proprietary interface card rather than a standard interface br br br Indirect network connection to a computer br During the early s professional flatbed scanners were available over a local computer network This proved useful to publishers print shops etc This functionality largely fell out of use as the cost of flatbed scanners reduced enough to make sharing unnecessary br From all in one multi purpose devices became available which were suitable for both small offices and consumers with printing scanning copying and fax capability in a single apparatus that can be made available to all members of a workgroup br Battery powered portable scanners store scans on internal memory they can later be transferred to a computer either by direct connection typically USB or in some cases a memory card may be removed from the scanner and plugged into the computer br br br Applications Programming Interface br A paint application such as GIMP or Adobe Photoshop must communicate with the scanner There are many different scanners and many of those scanners use different protocols In order to simplify applications programming some Applications programming interfaces API were developed The API presents a uniform interface to the scanner This means that the application does not need to know the specific details of the scanner in order to access it directly For example Adobe Photoshop supports the TWAIN standard therefore in theory Photoshop can acquire an image from any scanner that has a TWAIN driver br In practice there are often problems with an application communicating with a scanner Either the application or the scanner manufacturer or both may have faults in their implementation of the API br Typically the API is implemented as a dynamically linked library Each scanner manufacturer provides software that translates the API procedure calls into primitive commands that are issued to a hardware controller such as the SCSI USB or FireWire controller The manufacturer s part of the API is commonly called a device driver but that designation is not strictly accurate the API does not run in kernel mode and does not directly access the device Rather the scanner API library translates application requests into hardware requests br Common scanner software API br SANE Scanner Access Now Easy is a free open source API for accessing scanners Originally developed for Unix and Linux operating systems it has been ported to OS Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows Unlike TWAIN SANE does not handle the user interface This allows batch scans and transparent network access without any special support from the device driver br TWAIN is used by most scanners Originally used for low end and home use equipment it is now widely used for large volume scanning br ISIS Image and Scanner Interface Specification created by Pixel Translations which still uses SCSI II for performance reasons is used by large departmental scale machines br WIA Windows Image Acquisition is an API provided by Microsoft for use on Microsoft Windows br br br Bundled applications br Although no software beyond a scanning utility is a feature of any scanner many scanners come bundled with software Typically in addition to the scanning utility some type of image editing application such as Adobe Photoshop and optical character recognition OCR software are supplied OCR software converts graphical images of text into standard text that can be edited using common word processing and text editing software accuracy is rarely perfect br br br Output data br Some scanners especially those designed for scanning printed documents only work in black and white but most modern scanners work in color For the latter the scanned result is a non compressed RGB image which can be transferred to a computer s memory The color output of different scanners is not the same due to the spectral response of their sensing elements the nature of their light source and the correction applied by the scanning software While most image sensors have a linear response the output values are usually gamma compressed Some scanners compress and clean up the image using embedded firmware Once on the computer the image can be processed with a raster graphics program such as Adobe Photoshop or the GIMP and saved on a storage device such as a hard disk br Images are usually stored on a hard disk Pictures are normally stored in image formats such as uncompressed Bitmap non lossy lossless compressed TIFF and PNG and lossy compressed JPEG Documents are best stored in TIFF or PDF format JPEG is particularly unsuitable for text Optical character recognition OCR software allows a scanned image of text to be converted into editable text with reasonable accuracy so long as the text is cleanly printed and in a typeface and size that can be read by the software OCR capability may be integrated into the scanning software or the scanned image file can be processed with a separate OCR program br br br Document processing br br Document imaging requirements differ from those of image scanning These requirements include scanning speed automated paper feed and the ability to automatically scan both the front and the back of a document On the other hand image scanning typically requires the ability to handle fragile and or three dimensional objects as well as scan at a much higher resolution br Document scanners have document feeders usually larger than those sometimes found on copiers or all purpose scanners Scans are made at high speed from up to or pages per minute often in grayscale although many scanners support color Many scanners can scan both sides of double sided originals duplex operation Sophisticated document scanners have firmware or software that cleans up scans of text as they are produced eliminating accidental marks and sharpening type this would be unacceptable for photographic work where marks cannot reliably be distinguished from desired fine detail Files created are compressed as they are made br The resolution used is usually from to dpi although the hardware may be capable of or higher resolution this produces images of text good enough to read and for optical character recognition OCR without the higher demands on storage space required by higher resolution images br br Document scans are often processed using OCR technology to create editable and searchable files Most scanners use ISIS or TWAIN device drivers to scan documents into TIFF format so that the scanned pages can be fed into a document management system that will handle the archiving and retrieval of the scanned pages Lossy JPEG compression which is very efficient for pictures is undesirable for text documents as slanted straight edges take on a jagged appearance and solid black or other color text on a light background compresses well with lossless compression formats br While paper feeding and scanning can be done automatically and quickly preparation and indexing are necessary and require much work by humans Preparation involves manually inspecting the papers to be scanned and making sure that they are in order unfolded without staples or anything else that might jam the scanner Additionally some industries such as legal and medical may require documents to have Bates Numbering or some other mark giving a document identification number and date time of the document scan br Indexing involves associating relevant keywords to files so that they can be retrieved by content This process can sometimes be automated to some extent but it often requires manual labour performed by data entry clerks One common practice is the use of barcode recognition technology during preparation barcode sheets with folder names or index information are inserted into the document files folders and document groups Using automatic batch scanning the documents are saved into appropriate folders and an index is created for integration into document management systems br A specialized form of document scanning is book scanning Technical difficulties arise from the books usually being bound and sometimes fragile and irreplaceable but some manufacturers have developed specialized machinery to deal with this Often special robotic mechanisms are used to automate the page turning and scanning process br br br Document camera scanners br br Another category of document scanner is the document camera Capturing images on document cameras differs from that of flatbed and Automatic document feeder ADF scanners in that there are no moving parts required to scan the object Conventionally either the illumination reflector rod inside the scanner must be moved over the document such as for a flatbed scanner or the document must be passed over the rod such as for feeder scanners in order to produce a scan of a whole image Document cameras capture the whole document or object in one step usually instantly Typically documents are placed on a flat surface usually the office desk underneath the capture area of the document camera The process of whole surface at once capturing has the benefit of increasing reaction time for the workflow of scanning After being captured the images are usually processed through software that may enhance the image and perform such tasks like automatically rotating cropping and straightening them br It is not required that the documents or objects being scanned make contact with the document camera therefore increasing flexibility of the types of documents which are able to be scanned Objects that have previously been difficult to scan on conventional scanners are now able to be done so with one device This includes in particular documents that are of varying sizes and shapes stapled in folders or bent crumpled which may get jammed in a feed scanner Other objects include books magazines receipts letters tickets etc No moving parts can also remove the need for maintenance a consideration in the Total cost of ownership which includes the continuing operational costs of scanners br Increased reaction time whilst scanning also has benefits in the realm of context scanning ADF scanners whilst very fast and very good at batch scanning also require pre and post processing of the documents Document cameras can be integrated directly into a Workflow or process for example a teller at a bank The document is scanned directly in the context of the customer in which it is to be placed or used Reaction time is an advantage in these situations Document cameras usually also require a small amount of space and are often portable br Whilst scanning with document cameras may have a quick reaction time large amounts of batch scanning of even unstapled documents is more efficient with an ADF scanner There are challenges that face this kind of technology regarding external factors such as lighting which may have influence on the scan results The way in which these issues are resolved strongly depends on the sophistication of the product and how it deals with these issues br br br Infrared cleaning br br Infrared cleaning is a technique used to remove the effects of dust and scratches on images scanned from film many modern scanners incorporate this feature It works by scanning the film with infrared light the dyes in typical color film emulsions are transparent to infrared light but dust and scratches are not and block infrared scanner software can use the visible and infrared information to detect scratches and process the image to greatly reduce their visibility considering their position size shape and surroundings br Scanner manufacturers usually have their own names attached to this technique For example Epson Minolta Nikon Konica Minolta Microtek and others use Digital ICE while Canon uses its own system FARE Film Automatic Retouching and Enhancement system Plustek uses LaserSoft Imaging iSRD Some independent software developers design infrared cleaning tools br br br Other uses br Flatbed scanners have been used as digital backs for large format cameras to create high resolution digital images of static subjects A modified flatbed scanner has been used for documentation and quantification of thin layer chromatograms detected by fluorescence quenching on silica gel layers containing an ultraviolet UV indicator ChromImage is allegedly the first commercial flatbed scanner densitometer It enables acquisition of TLC plate images and quantification of chromatograms by use of Galaxie TLC software Other than being turned into densitometers flatbed scanners were also turned into colorimeters using different methods Trichromatic Color Analyser is allegedly the first distributable system using a flatbed scanner as a tristimulus colorimetric device br br br See also br Barcode reader br Book scanning br Cintel telecine equipment br Display
