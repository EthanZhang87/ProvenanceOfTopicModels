title: Airspeed indicator
id: 315949
The airspeed indicator ASI or airspeed gauge is a flight instrument indicating the airspeed of an aircraft in kilometres per hour km h knots kn or kt miles per hour MPH and or metres per second m s The recommendation by ICAO is to use km h however knots kt is currently the most used unit The ASI measures the pressure differential between static pressure from the static port and total pressure from the pitot tube This difference in pressure is registered with the ASI pointer on the face of the instrument br br br Colour coded speeds and ranges br The ASI has standard colour coded markings to indicate safe operation within the limitations of the aircraft At a glance the pilot can determine a recommended speed V speeds or if speed adjustments are needed Single and multi engine aircraft have common markings For instance the green arc indicates the normal operating range of the aircraft from VS to VNO The white arc indicates the flap operating range VSO to VFE used for approaches and landings The yellow arc cautions that flight should be conducted in this range only in smooth air while the red line VNE at the top of the yellow arc indicates damage or structural failure may result at higher speeds br The ASI in multi engine aircraft includes two additional radial markings one red and one blue associated with potential engine failure The radial red line near the bottom of green arc indicates Vmc the minimum indicated airspeed at which the aircraft can be controlled with the critical engine inoperative The radial blue line indicates VYSE the speed for best rate of climb with the critical engine inoperative br br br Operation br br The ASI is the only flight instrument that uses both the static system and the pitot system Static pressure enters the ASI case while total pressure flexes the diaphragm which is connected to the ASI pointer via mechanical linkage The pressures are equal when the aircraft is stationary on the ground and hence shows a reading of zero When the aircraft is moving forward air entering the pitot tube is at a greater pressure than the static line which flexes the diaphragm moving the pointer The ASI is checked before takeoff for a zero reading and during takeoff that it is increasing appropriately br The pitot tube may become blocked because of insects dirt or failure to remove the pitot cover A blockage will prevent ram air from entering the system If the pitot opening is blocked but the drain hole is open the system pressure will drop to ambient pressure and the ASI pointer will drop to a zero reading If both the opening and drain holes are blocked the ASI will not indicate any change in airspeed However the ASI pointer will show altitude changes as the associated static pressure changes If both the pitot tube and the static system are blocked the ASI pointer will read zero If the static ports are blocked but the pitot tube remains open the ASI will operate but br inaccurately br br br Types of airspeeds br br There are four types of airspeed that can be remembered with the acronym ICE T Indicated airspeed IAS is read directly off the ASI It has no correction for air density variations installation or instrument errors Calibrated airspeed CAS is corrected for installation and instrument errors Equivalent airspeed EAS is calibrated airspeed CAS corrected for the compressibility of air at a non trivial Mach number True airspeed TAS is CAS corrected for altitude and nonstandard temperature TAS is used for flight planning TAS increases as altitude increases as air density decreases TAS may be determined via a flight computer such as the E B Some ASIs have a TAS ring Alternatively a rule of thumb is to add percent to the CAS for every ft m of altitude gained br br br Jet aircraft br Jet aircraft do not have VNO and VNE like piston engined aircraft but instead have a maximum operating speed expressed in knots VMO and Mach number MMO Thus a pilot of a jet aeroplane needs both an airspeed indicator and a Machmeter with appropriate red lines An ASI will include a red and white striped pointer or barber s pole that automatically moves to indicate the applicable speed limit at any given time br br br Angle of attack and Lift Reserve Indicators br br An aeroplane can stall at any speed so monitoring the ASI alone will not prevent a stall The critical angle of attack AOA determines when an aircraft will stall For a particular configuration it is a constant independent of weight bank angle temperature density altitude and the center of gravity of an aircraft An AOA indicator provides stall situational awareness as a means for monitoring the onset of the critical AOA The AOA indicator will show the current AOA and its proximity to the critical AOA br Similarly the Lift Reserve Indicator LRI provides a measure of the amount of lift being generated It uses a pressure differential system to provide the pilot with a visual representation of reserve lift
