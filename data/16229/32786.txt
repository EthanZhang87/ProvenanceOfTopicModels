id: 32786
The V German Vergeltungswaffe lit Retaliation Weapon with the technical name Aggregat A was the world s first long range guided ballistic missile The missile powered by a liquid propellant rocket engine was developed during the Second World War in Nazi Germany as a vengeance weapon and assigned to attack Allied cities as retaliation for the Allied bombings of German cities The V rocket also became the first artificial object to travel into space by crossing the K rm n line edge of space with the vertical launch of MW on June br Research of military use of long range rockets began when the graduate studies of Wernher von Braun were noticed by the Wehrmacht Heer A series of prototypes culminated in the A which went to war as the V Beginning in September more than V s were launched by the Wehrmacht against Allied targets first London and later Antwerp and Li ge According to a BBC documentary the attacks from V s resulted in the deaths of an estimated civilians and military personnel while a further laborers and concentration camp prisoners died as a result of their forced participation in the production of the weapons br The rockets travelled at supersonic speeds impacted without audible warning and proved unstoppable as no effective defense existed Teams from the Allied forces the United States the United Kingdom France and the Soviet Union raced to seize major German manufacturing facilities procure the Germans missile technology and capture the V s launching sites Von Braun and more than core R D V personnel surrendered to the Americans and many of the original V team transferred their work to the Redstone Arsenal where they were relocated as part of Operation Paperclip The US also captured enough V hardware to build approximately of the missiles The Soviets gained possession of the V manufacturing facilities after the war re established V production and moved it to the Soviet Union br br br Development history br br During the late s a young Wernher von Braun bought a copy of Hermann Oberth s book Die Rakete zu den Planetenr umen The Rocket into Interplanetary Spaces In a Raketenrummel or Rocket Rumble fad in the popular media was initiated by Fritz von Opel and Max Valier a collaborator of Oberth by experimenting with rockets including public demonstrations of manned rocket cars and rocket planes The Rocket Rumble was highly influential on von Braun as a teenage space enthusiast He was so enthusiastic after seeing one of the public Opel RAK rocket car demonstrations that he constructed and launched his own homemade toy rocket car in a crowded sidewalk and was later taken in for questioning by the local police until released to his father for disciplinary action br Starting in von Braun attended the Technical University of Berlin where he assisted Oberth in liquid fueled rocket motor tests Von Braun was working on his doctorate when the Nazi Party gained power in Germany An artillery captain Walter Dornberger arranged an Ordnance Department research grant for von Braun who from then on worked next to Dornberger s existing solid fuel rocket test site at Kummersdorf Von Braun s thesis Construction Theoretical and Experimental Solution to the Problem of the Liquid Propellant Rocket dated April was kept classified by the German Army and was not published until By the end of his group had successfully launched two rockets that reached heights of and km and mi br At the time many Germans were interested in American physicist Robert H Goddard s research Before German engineers and scientists occasionally contacted Goddard directly with technical questions Von Braun used Goddard s plans from various journals and incorporated them into the building of the Aggregate A series of rockets named for the German word for mechanism or mechanical system br After successes at Kummersdorf with the first two Aggregate series rockets Braun and Walter Riedel began thinking of a much larger rocket in the summer of based on a projected kg lb thrust engine In addition Dornberger specified the military requirements needed to include a ton payload a range of miles with a dispersion of or miles and transportable using road vehicles br After the A project was postponed due to unfavorable aerodynamic stability testing of the A in July br Braun specified the A performance in and after an extensive series of test firings of the A scale test model using a motor redesigned from the troublesome A by Walter Thiel A design and construction was ordered c During September Der Tag der Weisheit English The Day of Wisdom conference met at Peenem nde to initiate the funding of university research to solve rocket problems br By late the Army Research Center at Peenem nde possessed the technologies essential to the success of the A The four main technologies for the A were large liquid fuel rocket engines supersonic aerodynamics gyroscopic guidance and rudders in jet control At the time Adolf Hitler was not particularly impressed by the V he opined that it was merely an artillery shell with a longer range and much higher cost br During early September Braun promised the Long Range Bombardment Commission that the A development was practically complete concluded but even by the middle of a complete A parts list was still unavailable Hitler was sufficiently impressed by the enthusiasm of its developers and needed a wonder weapon to maintain German morale so he authorized its deployment in large numbers br The V s were constructed at the Mittelwerk site by prisoners from Mittelbau Dora a concentration camp where prisoners died br In the Austrian resistance group including Heinrich Maier managed to send exact drawings of the V rocket to the American Office of Strategic Services Location sketches of V rocket manufacturing facilities such as those in Peenem nde were also sent to the Allied general staff in order to enable Allied bombers to perform airstrikes This information was particularly important for Operation Crossbow and Operation Hydra both preliminary missions for Operation Overlord The group was gradually captured by the Gestapo and most of the members were executed br br br Technical details br br The A used a ethanol water mixture B Stoff for fuel and liquid oxygen LOX A Stoff for oxidizer The water reduced the flame temperature acted as a coolant by turning to steam and augmented the thrust tended to produce a smoother burn and reduced thermal stress br Rudolf Hermann s supersonic wind tunnel was used to measure the A s aerodynamic characteristics and center of pressure using a model of the A within a square centimeter chamber Measurements were made using a Mach blowdown nozzle on August Tests at Mach numbers and were made after September br At launch the A propelled itself for up to seconds on its own power and a program motor held the inclination at the specified angle until engine shutdown after which the rocket continued on a ballistic free fall trajectory The rocket reached a height of km mi or ft after shutting off the engine br The fuel and oxidizer pumps were driven by a steam turbine and the steam was produced by concentrated hydrogen peroxide T Stoff with sodium permanganate Z Stoff catalyst Both the alcohol and oxygen tanks were an aluminum magnesium alloy br The turbopump rotating at rpm forced the alcohol and oxygen into the combustion chamber at liters US gallons per second where they were ignited by a spinning electrical igniter Thrust increased from tons during this preliminary stage whilst the fuel was gravity fed before increasing to tons as the turbopump pressurised the fuel lifting the ton rocket Combustion gases exited the chamber at C F and a speed of m ft per second The oxygen to fuel mixture was at tons of thrust but as ambient pressure decreased with flight altitude thrust increased until it reached tons The turbopump assembly contained two centrifugal pumps one for the alcohol and one for the oxygen The turbine connects directly by a shaft to the alcohol pump and through a flexible joint and shaft to the oxygen pump Hydrogen peroxide converted to steam using a sodium permanganate catalyst powered the pump which delivered kg lb of alcohol and kg lb of liquid oxygen per second to a combustion chamber at MPa psi br Dr Thiel s development of the ton rocket motor relied on pump feeding rather than on the earlier pressure feeding The motor used centrifugal injection while using both regenerative cooling and film cooling Film cooling admitted alcohol into the combustion chamber and exhaust nozzle under slight pressure through four rings of small perforations The mushroom shaped injection head was removed from the combustion chamber to a mixing chamber the combustion chamber was made more spherical while being shortened from to foot in length and the connection to the nozzle was made cone shaped The resultant ton chamber operated at a combustion pressure of MPa psi Thiel s ton chamber was then scaled up to a ton motor by arranging three injection heads above the combustion chamber By eighteen injection heads in two concentric circles at the head of the mm in thick sheet steel chamber were used to make the ton motor br The warhead was another source of trouble The explosive used was amatol detonated by an electric contact fuze Amatol had the advantage of stability and the warhead was protected by a thick layer of glass wool but even so it could still explode during the re entry phase The warhead weighed kilograms lb and contained kilograms lb of explosive The warhead s percentage by weight that was explosive was a very great percentage when compared with other types of munition br A protective layer of glass wool was also used for the fuel tanks so the A did not have a tendency to form ice a problem which plagued other early ballistic missiles such as the balloon tank design SM Atlas which entered US service in The tanks held kilograms lb of ethyl alcohol and kilograms lb of oxygen br br The V was guided by four external rudders on the tail fins and four internal graphite vanes in the jet stream at the exit of the motor These control surfaces were controlled by Helmut H lzer s analog computer the Mischger t via electrical hydraulic servomotors based on electrical signals from the gyros The Siemens Vertikant LEV guidance system consisted of two free gyroscopes a horizontal for pitch and a vertical with two degrees of freedom for yaw and roll for lateral stabilization coupled with a PIGA accelerometer or the Walter Wolman radio control system to control engine cutoff at a specified velocity Other gyroscopic systems used in the A included Kreiselger te s SG and SG The V was launched from a pre surveyed location so the distance and azimuth to the target were known Fin of the missile was aligned to the target azimuth br Some later V s used guide beams radio signals transmitted from the ground to keep the missile on course but the first models used a simple analog computer that adjusted the azimuth for the rocket and the flying distance was controlled by the timing of the engine cut off Brennschluss ground controlled by a Doppler system or by different types of on board integrating accelerometers Thus range was a function of engine burn time which ended when a specific velocity was achieved Just before engine cutoff thrust was reduced to eight tons in an effort to avoid any water hammer problems a rapid cutoff could cause br Dr Friedrich Kirchstein of Siemens of Berlin developed the V radio control for motor cut off German Brennschluss For velocity measurement Professor Wolman of Dresden created an alternative of his Doppler tracking system in which used a ground signal transponded by the A to measure the velocity of the missile By February Peenem nde engineer Gerd deBeek had documented the radio interference area of a V as metres feet around the Firing Point and the first successful A flight on October used radio control for Brennschluss Although Hitler commented on September that It is a great load off our minds that we have dispensed with the radio guiding beam now no opening remains for the British to interfere technically with the missile in flight about of the operational V launches were beam guided The Operation Pinguin V offensive began on September when Lehr und Versuchsbatterie No English Training and Testing Battery launched a single rocket guided by a radio beam directed at Paris Wreckage of combat V s occasionally contained the transponder for velocity and fuel cutoff br The painting of the operational V s was mostly a ragged edged pattern with several variations but at the end of the war a plain olive green rocket was also used During tests the rocket was painted in a characteristic black and white chessboard pattern which aided in determining if the rocket was spinning around its longitudinal axis br br The original German designation of the rocket was V unhyphenated exactly as used for any Third Reich era second prototype example of an RLM registered German aircraft design but U S publications such as Life magazine were using the hyphenated form V as early as December br br br Testing br br The first successful test flight was on October reaching an altitude of kilometres miles On that day Walter Dornberger declared in a speech at Peenem nde br br This third day of October is the first of a new era in transportation that of space travel br br Two test launches were recovered by the Allies the B ckebo rocket the remnants of which landed in Sweden on June and one recovered by the Polish resistance on May from the Blizna V missile launch site and transported to the UK during Operation Most III The highest altitude reached during the war was kilometres miles June Test launches of V rockets were made at Peenem nde Blizna and Tuchola Forest and after the war at Cuxhaven by the British White Sands Proving Grounds and Cape Canaveral by the U S and Kapustin Yar by the USSR br Various design issues were identified and solved during V development and testing br br To reduce tank pressure and weight rapid flow turbopumps were used to increase pressure br A short and lighter combustion chamber without burn through was developed by using centrifugal injection nozzles a mixing compartment and a converging nozzle to the throat for homogeneous combustion br Film cooling was used to prevent burn through at the nozzle throat br Relay contacts were made more durable to withstand vibration and prevent thrust cut off just after lift off br Ensuring that the fuel pipes had tension free curves reduced the likelihood of explosions at m ft br Fins were shaped with clearance to prevent damage as the exhaust jet expanded with altitude br To control trajectory at liftoff and supersonic speeds heat resistant graphite vanes were used as rudders in the exhaust jet br br br Air burst problem br Through mid March only four of the successful Blizna launches had satisfactorily reached the Sarnaki target area due to in flight breakup Luftzerleger on re entry into the atmosphere As mentioned above one rocket was collected by the Polish Home Army with parts of it transported to London for tests Initially the German developers suspected excessive alcohol tank pressure but by April after five months of test firings the cause was still not determined Major General Rossmann the Army Weapons Office department chief recommended stationing observers in the target area c May June Dornberger and von Braun set up a camp at the centre of the Poland target zone After moving to the Heidekraut SS Mortar Battery of the th Artillery Battalion Motorized was ordered on August to begin test launches of eighty sleeved rockets Testing confirmed that the so called tin trousers a tube designed to strengthen the forward end of the rocket cladding reduced the likelihood of air bursts br br br Production br br On March Dornberger proposed production plans and the building of a launching site on the Channel coast In December Speer ordered Major Thom and Dr Steinhoff to reconnoitre the site near Watten Assembly rooms were established at Peenem nde and in the Friedrichshafen facilities of Zeppelin Works In a third factory Raxwerke was added br On December Hitler signed the order for mass production when Albert Speer assumed final technical data would be ready by July However many issues still remained to be solved even by the autumn of br On January Dornberger and von Braun met with Speer Speer stated As head of the Todt organisation I will take it on myself to start at once with the building of the launching site on the Channel coast and established an A production committee under Degenkolb br On May the Long Range Bombardment Commission chaired by AEG director Petersen met at Peenem nde to review the V and V automatic long range weapons In attendance were Speer Air Marshal Erhard Milch Admiral Karl D nitz Col General Friedrich Fromm and Karl Saur Both weapons had reached the final stage of development and the commission decided to recommend to Hitler that both weapons be mass produced As Dornberger observed The disadvantages of the one would be compensated by the other s advantages br br On July Major General Dornberger von Braun and Dr Steinhof briefed Hitler in his Wolf s Lair Also in attendance were Speer Wilhelm Keitel and Alfred Jodl The briefing included von Braun narrating a movie showing the successful launch on October with scale models of the Channel coast firing bunker and supporting vehicles including the Meillerwagen Hitler then gave Peenem nde top priority in the German armaments program stating Why was it I could not believe in the success of your work if we had had these rockets in we should never have had this war Hitler also wanted a second launch bunker built br Saur planned to build rockets per month between the existing three factories and the Nordhausen Mittelwerk factory being built However alcohol production was dependent upon the potato harvest br A production line was nearly ready at Peenem nde when the Operation Hydra attack occurred The main targets of the attack included the test stands the development works the Pre Production Works the settlement where the scientists and technicians lived the Trassenheide camp and the harbor sector According to Dornberger Serious damage to the works contrary to first impressions was surprisingly small Work resumed after a delay of four to six weeks and because of camouflage to mimic complete destruction there were no more raids during the next nine months The raid resulted in lives lost with heavy losses at Trassenheide while were killed in the settlement including Dr Thiel his family and Chief Engineer Walther The Germans eventually moved production to the underground Mittelwerk in the Kohnstein where V rockets were built with the use of forced labour br br br Launch sites br br After the Operation Crossbow bombing initial plans for launching from the massive underground Watten Wizernes and Sottevast bunkers or from fixed pads such as near the Ch teau du Molay were dismissed in favour of mobile launching Eight main storage dumps were planned and four had been completed by July the one at Mery sur Oise was begun during August and completed by February The missile could be launched practically anywhere roads running through forests being a particular favourite The system was so mobile and small that only one Meillerwagen was ever caught in action by Allied aircraft during the Operation Bodenplatte attack on January near Lochem by a USAAF th Fighter Group aircraft although Raymond Baxter described flying over a site during a launch and his wingman firing at the missile without hitting it br It was estimated that a sustained rate of V s could be launched per week with per day at maximum effort given sufficient supply of the rockets br br br Operational history br br The LXV Armeekorps z b V formed during the last days of November in France commanded by General der Artillerie z V Erich Heinemann was responsible for the operational use of V Three launch battalions were formed in late Artillerie Abteilung Mot Grossborn Artillerie Abteilung Mot Naugard and Artillerie Abteilung Mot Combat operations commenced in Sept when training Batterie deployed On September the SS Werfer Abteilung was formed and by October the SS under the command of SS Lt Gen Hans Kammler took operational control of all units He formed Gruppe S d with Art Abt Merzig and Gruppe Nord with Art Abt and Batterie Burgsteinfurt and The Hague br After Hitler s August declaration to begin V attacks as soon as possible the offensive began on September when two were launched at Paris which the Allies had liberated less than two weeks earlier but both crashed soon after launch On September a single rocket was launched at Paris which caused modest damage near Porte d Italie Two more launches by the th followed including one from The Hague against London on the same day at pm the first landed at Staveley Road Chiswick killing year old Mrs Ada Harrison three year old Rosemary Clarke and Sapper Bernard Browning on leave from the Royal Engineers and one that hit Epping with no casualties br The British government concerned about spreading panic or giving away vital intelligence to German forces initially attempted to conceal the cause of the explosions by making no official announcement and euphemistically blaming them on defective gas mains The public did not believe this explanation and therefore began referring to the V s as flying gas mains The Germans themselves finally announced the V on November and only then on November did Winston Churchill inform Parliament and the world that England had been under rocket attack for the last few weeks br In September control of the V mission was transferred to the Waffen SS and Division z V br Positions of the German launch units changed a number of times For example Artillerie Init arrived in the southwest Netherlands in Zeeland in September From a field near the village of Serooskerke five V s were launched on and September with one more successful and one failed launch on the th That same date a transport carrying a missile took a wrong turn and ended up in Serooskerke itself giving a villager the opportunity to surreptitiously take some photographs of the weapon these were smuggled to London by the Dutch Resistance After that the unit moved to the woods near Rijs Gaasterland in the northwest Netherlands to ensure that the technology was not captured by the Allies From Gaasterland V s were launched against Ipswich and Norwich from September London being out of range Because of their inaccuracy these V s did not hit their target cities Soon after that only London and Antwerp remained as designated targets as ordered by Adolf Hitler himself Antwerp being targeted in the period of to October after which time the unit moved to The Hague br br br Targets br During the succeeding months about V rockets were fired at the following targets br br Belgium Antwerp Li ge Hasselt Tournai Mons Diest br United Kingdom London Norwich Ipswich br France Lille Paris Tourcoing Arras Cambrai br Netherlands Maastricht br Germany Remagen br Antwerp Belgium was a target for a large number of V weapon attacks from October through to the virtual end of the war in March leaving dead and injured in greater Antwerp Thousands of buildings were damaged or destroyed as the city was struck by direct hits The largest loss of life by a single rocket attack during the war came on December when the roof of the crowded Cine Rex was struck leaving dead and injured br An estimated civilians were killed in London by V attacks with another injured which is two people killed per V rocket However this understates the potential of the V since many rockets were misdirected and exploded harmlessly Accuracy increased during the war particularly for batteries where the Leitstrahl radio guide beam system was used Missile strikes that hit targets could cause large numbers of deaths were killed and seriously injured in one explosion at pm on November at a Woolworth s department store in New Cross south east London br British intelligence sent false reports via their Double Cross System implying that the rockets were over shooting their London target by to miles to km This tactic worked more than half of the V s aimed at London landed outside the London Civil Defence Region p Most landed on less heavily populated areas in Kent due to erroneous recalibration For the remainder of the war British intelligence maintained the ruse by repeatedly sending bogus reports implying that the rockets were now striking the British capital with heavy loss of life br br br Possible use during Operation Bodenplatte br At least one V missile on a mobile Meillerwagen launch trailer was observed being elevated to launch position by a USAAF th Fighter Group pilot defending against the massive New Year s Day Operation Bodenplatte strike by the Luftwaffe over the northern German attack route near the town of Lochem on January Possibly from the potential sighting of the American fighter by the missile s launch crew the rocket was quickly lowered from a near launch ready elevation to br br br Tactical use on German target br After the US Army captured the Ludendorff Bridge during the Battle of Remagen on March the Germans were desperate to destroy it On March they fired eleven V missiles at the bridge their first use against a tactical target and the only time they were fired on a German target during the war They could not employ the more accurate Leitstrahl device because it was oriented towards Antwerp and could not be easily adjusted for another target Fired from near Hellendoorn the Netherlands one of the missiles landed as far away as Cologne miles km to the north while one missed the bridge by only to yards to m They also struck the town of Remagen destroying a number of buildings and killing at least six American soldiers br br br Final use br br The final two rockets exploded on March One of these was the last V to kill a British civilian and the final civilian casualty of the war on British soil Ivy Millichamp aged killed in her home in Kynaston Road Orpington in Kent A scientific reconstruction performed in demonstrated that the V creates a crater metres feet wide and metres feet deep ejecting approximately tons of material into the air br br br Countermeasures br br br Big Ben and Operation Crossbow br Unlike the V the V s speed and trajectory made it practically invulnerable to anti aircraft guns and fighters as it dropped from an altitude of km mi at up to three times the speed of sound at sea level approximately km h mph Nevertheless the threat of what was then code named Big Ben was great enough that efforts were made to seek countermeasures The situation was similar to the pre war concerns about manned bombers and resulted in a similar solution the formation of the Crossbow Committee to collect examine and develop countermeasures br Early on it was believed that the V employed some form of radio guidance a belief that persisted in spite of several rockets being examined without discovering anything like a radio receiver This resulted in efforts to jam this non existent guidance system as early as September using both ground and air based jammers flying over the UK In October a group had been sent to jam the missiles during launch By December it was clear these systems were not having any obvious effect and jamming efforts ended br br br Anti aircraft gun system proposed br General Frederick Alfred Pile commander of Anti Aircraft Command studied the problem and proposed that enough anti aircraft guns were available to produce a barrage of fire in the rocket s path but only if provided with a reasonable prediction of the trajectory The first estimates suggested that shells would have to be fired for each rocket About of these were expected to fall back to the ground almost tons of rounds which would cause far more damage than the missile At a August meeting of the Crossbow Committee the concept was rejected br Pile continued studying the problem and returned with a proposal to fire only shells at a single rocket with those shells using a new fuse that would greatly reduce the number that fell back to Earth unexploded Some low level analysis suggested that this would be successful against in rockets provided that accurate trajectories were forwarded to the gunners in time Work on this basic concept continued and developed into a plan to deploy a large number of guns in Hyde Park that were provided with pre configured firing data for mile kilometre grids of the London area After the trajectory was determined the guns would aim and fire between and rounds br At a Crossbow meeting on January Pile s updated plan was presented with some strong advocacy from Roderic Hill and Charles Drummond Ellis However the Committee suggested that a test not be performed as no technique for tracking the missiles with sufficient accuracy had yet been developed By March this had changed significantly with of incoming missiles correctly allotted to the grid square each fell into or the one beside it At a March meeting Pile was directed to a subcommittee with RV Jones and Ellis to further develop the statistics Three days later the team returned a report stating that if the guns fired rounds at a missile there was a in chance of shooting it down Plans for an operational test began but as Pile later put it Monty beat us to it as the attacks ended with the Allied capture of their launching areas br With the Germans no longer in control of any part of the continent that could be used as a launching site capable of striking London they began targeting Antwerp Plans were made to move the Pile system to protect that city but the war ended before anything could be done br br br Direct attack and disinformation br The only effective defences against the V campaign were to destroy the launch infrastructure expensive in terms of bomber resources and casualties or to cause the Germans to aim at the wrong place by disinformation The British were able to convince the Germans to direct V s and V s aimed at London to less populated areas east of the city This was done by sending deceptive reports on the sites hit and damage caused via the German espionage network in Britain which was secretly controlled by the British the Double Cross System br According to the BBC television presenter Raymond Baxter who served with the RAF during the war in February his squadron was performing a mission against a V launch site when they saw one missile being launched One member of Baxter s squadron opened fire on it without effect br On March the Allies attempted to destroy V s and launching equipment in the Haagse Bos in The Hague by a large scale bombardment but due to navigational errors the Bezuidenhout quarter was destroyed killing Dutch civilians br br br Assessment br The German V weapons V and V cost the equivalent of about US million Given the relatively smaller size of the German economy this represented an industrial effort equivalent to but slightly less than that of the U S Manhattan Project that produced the atomic bomb V s were built at a cost of approximately in each were launched br SS General Hans Kammler who as an engineer had constructed several concentration camps including Auschwitz had a reputation for brutality and had originated the idea of using concentration camp prisoners as slave laborers for the rocket program More people died manufacturing the V than were killed by its deployment br br The V consumed a third of Germany s fuel alcohol production and major portions of other critical technologies to distil the fuel alcohol for one V launch required tonnes of potatoes at a time when food was becoming scarce Due to a lack of explosives some warheads were simply filled with concrete using the kinetic energy alone for destruction and sometimes the warhead contained photographic propaganda of German citizens who had died in Allied bombings br The psychological effect of the V was considerable as the V traveling faster than the speed of sound gave no warning before impact unlike bombing planes or the V flying bomb which made a characteristic buzzing sound There was no effective defence and no risk of pilot or crew casualties An example of the impression it made is in the reaction of American pilot and future nuclear strategist and Congressional aide William Liscum Borden who in November while returning from a nighttime air mission over Holland saw a V in flight on its way to strike London It resembled a meteor streaming red sparks and whizzing past us as though the aircraft were motionless I became convinced that it was only a matter of time until rockets would expose the United States to direct transoceanic attack br With the war all but lost regardless of the factory output of conventional weapons the Nazis resorted to V weapons as a tenuous last hope to influence the war militarily hence Antwerp as V target as an extension of their desire to punish their foes and most importantly to give hope to their sympathizers with their miracle weapon The V did not affect the outcome of the war but it resulted in the development of the intercontinental ballistic missiles of the Cold War which were also used for space exploration br br br Unfulfilled plans br A submarine towed launch platform was tested successfully making it the prototype for submarine launched ballistic missiles The project codename was Pr fstand XII Test stand XII sometimes termed the rocket U boat If deployed it would have allowed a U boat to launch V missiles against United States cities though only with considerable effort and limited effect Hitler in July and Speer in January made speeches alluding to the scheme though Germany did not possess the capability to fulfill these threats These schemes were met by the Americans with Operation Teardrop br While interned after the war by the British at CSDIC camp Dornberger was recorded saying that he had begged the F hrer to stop the V weapon propaganda because nothing more could be expected from one ton of explosive To this Hitler had replied that Dornberger might not expect more but he Hitler certainly did br According to decrypted messages from the Japanese embassy in Germany twelve dismantled V rockets were shipped to Japan These left Bordeaux in August on the transport U boats U and U which reached Jakarta in December A civilian V expert was a passenger on U bound for Japan in May when the war ended in Europe The fate of these V rockets is unknown br br br Post war use br At the end of the war a competition began between the United States and the USSR to retrieve as many V rockets and staff as possible Three hundred rail car loads of V s and parts were captured and shipped to the United States and of the principal designers including Wernher von Braun and Walter Dornberger were captives of the Americans Von Braun his brother Magnus von Braun and seven others decided to surrender to the United States military Operation Paperclip to ensure they were not captured by the advancing Soviets or shot dead by the Nazis to prevent their capture br After the Nazi defeat German engineers were relocated to the United States the USSR France and the United Kingdom where they further developed the V rocket for military and civilian purposes The V rocket also laid the foundation for the liquid fuel missiles and space launchers used later br br br United States br br Operation Paperclip recruited German engineers and Special Mission V transported the captured V parts to the United States At the close of the Second World War more than rail cars filled with V engines fuselages propellant tanks gyroscopes and associated equipment were brought to the railyards in Las Cruces New Mexico so they could be placed on trucks and driven to the White Sands Proving Grounds also in New Mexico br In addition to V hardware the U S Government delivered German mechanization equations for the V guidance navigation and control systems as well as for advanced development concept vehicles to U S defence contractors for analysis During the s some of these documents were useful to U S contractors in developing direction cosine matrix transformations and other inertial navigation architecture concepts that were applied to early U S programs such as the Atlas and Minuteman guidance systems as well as the Navy s Subs Inertial Navigation System br A committee was formed with military and civilian scientists to review payload proposals for the reassembled V rockets By January the U S Army Ordnance Corps invited civilian scientists and engineers to participate in developing a space research program using the V The committee was initially named the V Rocket Panel then the V Upper Atmosphere Research Panel and finally the Upper Atmosphere Rocket Research Panel This resulted in an eclectic array of experiments that flew on V s and helped prepare for American manned space exploration Devices were sent aloft to sample the air at all levels to determine atmospheric pressures and to see what gases were present Other instruments measured the level of cosmic radiation br br Only percent of the V trials were considered successful A supposed V launched on May landed near Juarez Mexico and was actually a Hermes B vehicle br The U S Navy attempted to launch a German V rocket at sea one test launch from the aircraft carrier USS Midway was performed on September as part of the Navy s Operation Sandy The test launch was a partial success the V went off the pad but splashed down in the ocean only some km mi from the carrier The launch setup on the Midway s deck is notable in that it used foldaway arms to prevent the missile from falling over The arms pulled away just after the engine ignited releasing the missile The setup may look similar to the R Semyorka launch procedure but in the case of the R the trusses hold the full weight of the rocket rather than just reacting to side forces br The PGM Redstone rocket is a direct descendant of the V br br br USSR br br The USSR also captured a number of V s and staff letting them stay in Germany for a time The first work contracts were signed in the middle of During October as part of Operation Osoaviakhim they were obliged to relocate to Branch of NII on Gorodomlya Island in Lake Seliger where Helmut Gr ttrup directed a group of engineers In October a group of German scientists supported the USSR in launching rebuilt V s in Kapustin Yar The German team was indirectly overseen by Sergei Korolev one of the leaders of the Soviet rocketry program br The first Soviet missile was the R a duplicate of the V manufactured completely in the USSR which was launched first during October From until the end of the German team elaborated concepts and improvements for extended payload and range for the projects G G and G The German team had to remain on Gorodomlya island until as late as and In parallel Soviet work emphasized larger missiles the R and R based on further developing the V technology with using ideas of the German concept studies Details of Soviet achievements were unknown to the German team and completely underestimated by Western intelligence until in November the satellite Sputnik was launched successfully to orbit by the Sputnik rocket based on R the world s first intercontinental ballistic missile br During the autumn of the group directed by M Tikhonravov K and N G Chernyshov at the NII rocket artillery institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences developed on their own initiative the first stratospheric rocket project Project VR planned for vertical flight of two pilots to an altitude of km using captured German V rockets br br br France br br Between May and September of CEPA the forerunner to today s French space agency CNES undertook the recruitment of approximately thirty German engineers who had previous experience working on rocket programs for Nazi Germany at the Peenem nde Army Research Center Much like their counterparts in the United Kingdom the United States and the Soviet Union France s objective was to acquire and advance the rocket technology developed by Germany during World War II The initial initiative known as the Super V program had plans for four rocket variants capable of achieving ranges of up to km mi and carrying warheads weighing up to kg lb However this program was canceled in br From to the research done on the Super V program was repurposed to develop the V ronique sounding rocket which became the first liquid fuel research rocket in Western Europe and was ultimately capable of carrying a kg lb payload to an altitude of km mi The V ronique program then lead to the Diamant rocket and the Ariane rocket family br br br UK br br During October the Allied Operation Backfire assembled a small number of V missiles and launched three of them from a site in northern Germany The engineers involved had already agreed to relocate to the US when the test firings were complete The Backfire report published in January contains extensive technical documentation of the rocket including all support procedures tailored vehicles and fuel composition br In the British Interplanetary Society proposed an enlarged man carrying version of the V named Megaroc It could have enabled sub orbital
