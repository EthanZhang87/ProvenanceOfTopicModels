and the Neo Geo video game platform and electronics SNK s predecessor Shin Nihon Kikaku Corporation was founded in by Eikichi Kawasaki In the name was informally shortened to SNK Corporation which became the company s official name in br SNK is known for its creation of the Neo Geo family of arcade home and handheld game consoles in The Neo Geo line was halted in because financial troubles forced SNK Corporation to close in the same year Anticipating the end of the company Kawasaki established Playmore Corporation in which acquired all of the intellectual property of the first iteration of SNK Corporation In Playmore Corporation was renamed to SNK Playmore Corporation In SNK dropped the name Playmore from its logo and reintroduced its old slogan The Future Is Now officially changing its corporate name back to SNK br Traditionally SNK operated primarily as a video game developer publisher and hardware manufacturer with a focus on arcade games however it has ventured into developing console and PC games In SNK started manufacturing pachislot machines but the company withdrew from the market in In the company entered mobile game development Classic SNK franchises include Art of Fighting Fatal Fury Metal Slug Samurai Shodown The Last Blade World Heroes Aggressors of Dark Kombat King of the Monsters Twinkle Star Sprites and The King of Fighters br br br History br br br Beginnings br br SNK was founded in as Shin Nihon Kikaku and reorganized on July as a stock company kabushiki gaisha under the name Shin Nihon Kikaku Corporation When Eikichi Kawasaki noticed rapid growth in the coin operated video game market he expanded Shin Nihon Kikaku to include the development and marketing of stand alone coin op games br The company was nicknamed Shin Nihon Kikaku in katakana at first however since it has been changed to SNK by taking the initials from the Roman alphabet Shin Nihon Kikaku The English copyright notation was also SNK CORPORATION It established itself in Sunnyvale California to deliver its own brand of coin operated games to arcades in North America SNK chose John Rowe to head its American operation br The first two titles that SNK released were Ozma Wars a vertical space shooter and Safari Rally a maze game Game quality improved over time most notably with Vanguard a side scrolling space shooter SNK licensed the game to Centuri for distribution in North America Centuri started manufacturing and distributing the game by itself when profits exceeded projections In part due to the success of Vanguard SNK began to gain fame and reputation An American branch opened on October named SNK Electronics Corporation br br br SNK Corporation first incarnation br In April the company name was changed to the nickname SNK but the registered trade name had to be SNK Corporation This is because the Ministry of Justice at the time did not allow the registration of business names in alphabets In November the American subsidiary SNK Corporation of America was born in Sunnyvale California In March SNK staff moved to a building in Suita Osaka Japan br At this point the Japanese operations of SNK Corporation had shifted their focus solely toward developing and licensing video games for arcade use and later for early consoles Between and SNK produced stand alone arcade games Highlights from this period include Mad Crasher Alpha Mission and Athena a game that gained a large following when it was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System NES in SNK s most successful game from this time was Ikari Warriors released in It was so popular that it was licensed and ported to the Atari Atari Commodore Amiga Amstrad CPC Apple II ZX Spectrum and NES After Ikari Warriors SNK released two sequels Victory Road and Ikari III The Rescue br At the time Japan was affected by the video game crash of The console manufacturer Nintendo remained in business throughout and after the crash SNK became a third party licensee for Nintendo s Famicom alternative name for the NES system in It opened a second branch in the US called SNK Home Entertainment based in Torrance California The branch handled the North American distribution and marketing of the company s products for home consoles John Rowe had already left the company to form Tradewest which went on to market the Ikari Warriors series in North America Paul Jacobs took over Rowe s position over both halves of SNK America He is known for having helped launch the company s Neo Geo system outside of Asia br In response to strong sales of the company s NES ports SNK began to dabble in the development of original software designed specifically for the NES console Two games came out of this effort Baseball Stars and Crystalis known as God Slayer in Japan In two home video game consoles were released in North America the Sega Genesis and NEC and Hudson Soft s TurboGrafx Nintendo followed suit with a new system in the Super Nintendo Entertainment System Super NES SNES SNK as a whole did not become involved in the system wars of the early s Instead it refocused its efforts on arcades Other third parties such as Romstar and Takara were left to license and port SNK s properties to the various home consoles of the time with help from SNK s American home entertainment division With console ports mainly handled outside the company it moved on to developing SNK branded arcade equipment SNK also licensed Tiger Electronics to market handheld electronic games from some of its brands br In SNK created the idea of a modular cabinet for arcades Up to that point arcade cabinets typically contained only one game When an arcade operator wanted to switch or replace that game it would have to completely remove the internals of the existing cabinet or exchange the entire setup for another game SNK s new system called the Neo Geo MVS short for Multi Video System developed by Fatal Fury and The King of Fighters director Takashi Nishiyama featured multiple games in a single cabinet and used a cartridge based storage mechanism The system debuted in and could contain one two four or six separate games in a single cabinet To swap in a new game all the operator had to do was remove one cartridge and exchange it for another The MVS was an immediate success It greatly shortened the setup time needed for each game minimized floor space for cabinets and reduced costs for new cartridges to US less than half of what a traditional arcade unit cost at the time br SNK wanted to bring arcade games to people s homes without making CPU and memory performance compromises that typical home consoles were forced to make In the Neo Geo family was created The company released a home version of the MVS a single cartridge unit called the Neo Geo Advanced Entertainment System Neo Geo AES Initially the AES was only available for rent or for use in hotel settings but SNK quickly began selling the system through stores when customer response indicated that people were willing to spend money on home versions Several franchises of games derived from it including Sengoku The King of Fighters The Last Blade Super Sidekicks Art of Fighting Metal Slug Burning Fight Savage Reign Samurai Shodown and Fatal Fury The King of Fighters Samurai Shodown and Metal Slug series were continued on later consoles SNK also helped publish third party Neo Geo games such as ADK s World Heroes and Aggressors of Dark Kombat Visco s Breakers and Ganryu Noise Factory s Rage of the Dragons and Sengoku Sunsoft s Galaxy Fight Universal Warriors and Waku Waku Sammy s Viewpoint NMK s Zed Blade Psikyo s Strikers Plus Aiky Taito s Pochi and Nyaa Paon Eleven Gavaking s Nightmare in the Dark Face s Money Puzzle Exchanger Data East s Spinmaster and Street Slam and Techn s Japan s Double Dragon and Voltage Fighter Gowcaizer During this time SNK also released stand alone arcade games some of which were ported to home consoles including Vanguard Alpha Mission Athena Ikari Warriors Psycho Soldier Touch Down Fever Time Soldiers P O W Prisoners of War Beast Busters and Street Smart br Compared to other consoles at the time the Neo Geo AES had much better graphics and sound It debuted at equivalent to in sold with two joystick controllers and a game either Baseball Stars Professional or NAM Within a few months of the system s introduction in North America SNK increased the cost to and changed the pack in game to Magician Lord Alternatively the console could be bought for with one control stick and without an accompanying game Other games cost at least each Joystick controllers contained the same four button layout as the arcade MVS cabinet The quality of AES games varied Some such as the Super Sidekicks series were all new creations while others were updated versions of earlier successes such as Baseball Stars Professional SNK games were graphically bold and bright Games such as Top Hunter Roddy Cathy and the famous Metal Slug series were distinctive and instantly recognizable contributing to the system s success in arcades br SNK also produced the Neo Geo CD home console the Hyper Neo Geo arcade system and two handheld game consoles the Neo Geo Pocket and Pocket Color Several more famous franchise titles originally created for the MVS and AES systems have been ported to other consoles such as the Genesis Saturn and Dreamcast SNES PlayStation and PlayStation Xbox and Wii br The Neo Geo Pocket was SNK s original handheld system It was released in Japan in late and featured a monochrome one color display Because its sales were fewer than the expected number it was discontinued in in favor of the Neo Geo Pocket Color which was later released in North America and Europe br In SNK opened the Neo Geo World Tokyo Bayside amusement park as part of the Palette Town entertainment complex in Odaiba Tokyo equipped with attractions such as Ferris wheels and roller coasters A large scale tie in was established with the Fujisankei Communications Group owners of the nearby television station Fuji TV and was frequently promoted in various media br However by the late s the D fighting game boom which had been behind much of SNK s recent success had come to an end and both the Neo Geo CD and Hyper Neo Geo failed to meet sales expectations At the same time the Neo Geo Pocket while initially selling well began to fall behind in the market after the release of the Game Boy Color and Neo Geo World Tokyo Bayside quickly lost attendance after the re opening of Yokohama Cosmo World a few months later with the park considered to be a massive failure In addition the arcade game magazine Gamest one of the biggest promoters of SNK titles ceased publication after its publisher Shinseisha declared bankruptcy in br br br Bankruptcy br SNK had focused on the booming arcade industry for the s but as interest in arcades fell in favor of home and portable consoles going into the s they were unable to adjust to the changing market with their recent hardware releases selling poorly and attempts to diversify into new markets such as amusement parks failing SNK tried to develop more titles for the home console market such as Shinsetsu Samurai Spirits Bushid Retsuden Athena Awakening from the Ordinary Life Koudelka and Cool Cool Toon but as none of them sold well it left the company s financial situation in a dire state br In January SNK s poor financial status led to its acquisition by Aruze a company known for its pachinko machines and the parent company of its competitor SETA Instead of developing video games using SNK s intellectual properties Aruze manufactured pachinko machines that featured popular series such as King of Fighters SNK saw little success in the video game market br The same year Capcom agreed to create a series of fighting games featuring both companies fighting game characters The Capcom vs SNK games were a success however most of the profits went to Capcom because it developed and published the games SNK released SNK vs Capcom The Match of the Millennium and SNK vs Capcom Card Fighters Clash on the Neo Geo Pocket Color Combined the two games sold around copies br SNK closed all American Canadian and European operations on June The company sold rights to distribution in North America for MVS arcade systems and Neo Print photo systems It licensed North American localizations of some console releases to outside companies br With low morale and an unclear future many of the company s employees left their jobs Some joined rivals Capcom and Arc System Works and others moved on to found the developer Dimps Kawasaki along with five other former SNK executives funded the formation of BrezzaSoft which continued to develop Neo Geo games such as The King of Fighters br With a total debt of about billion yen SNK gave up on voluntary reconstruction and on April SNK applied for the application of the Civil Rehabilitation Law to the Osaka District Court effectively going bankrupt The application was accepted and the revitalization procedures were once proceeded and the head office returned to Suita City Osaka Prefecture The district court decided to abolish the civil rehabilitation proceedings on October of the same year and declared bankruptcy on October br Licenses for SNK s game production and development rights to its franchises were sold to several other companies These included BrezzaSoft which produced The King of Fighters such as South Korean based Eolith which produced The King of Fighters franchise between and and Mega Enterprise which produced Metal Slug In the Neo Geo family ended It was briefly revived years later with the Neo Geo X br br br Playmore is founded br Established as Playmore Corporation on August It was originally an affiliate of the former SNK Initially it was a legal company specializing in copyright management services and it would be incorrect to refer to the former SNK as its predecessor company On October of the same year the company won the company s intellectual property rights in a bid made during the bankruptcy of the former SNK br To re establish its presence in the gaming market Playmore acquired BrezzaSoft and its former SNK developers as well as Japan based Neo Geo developer Noise Factory Sun Amusement a Japanese commercial games distributor was acquired by SNK to provide the company with an arcade distribution outlet in Japan International offices were established in South Korea Hong Kong and the United States under the name SNK NeoGeo for commercial and later consumer gaming distribution On July with the permission of Eikichi Kawasaki the founder of the former SNK company and after it reacquired the rights to SNK trademark from Aruze the company changed its name to SNK Playmore Corporation In the same year SNK purchased ADK shortly after it filed for bankruptcy Previously ADK was a third party company that had been heavily associated with SNK since the late s SNK Playmore s operations in Japan already largely resembled the original company SNK employed many employees who left after its bankruptcy filing and occupied its former building br In October Kawasaki sued Aruze for copyright infringement claiming billion Japanese yen US in damages He cited that Aruze had continued to use SNK s intellectual properties after Playmore re acquired them A preliminary decision in January by the Osaka District Court favored SNK Playmore awarding it billion yen US br br In the fall and winter of SNK Playmore obtained an injunction against a group of four different companies causing hundreds of AES cartridges to be seized In the following year SNK Playmore struck a compromise with two of the companies The two were allowed to sell AES cartridges under the conditions that the cartridges would not be modified again and that any legitimate materials would be returned to SNK Playmore br Within the same year SNK Playmore would discontinue the AES system preferring to publish video games in cooperation with Sammy Using its arcade board Atomiswave SNK Playmore gained a more secure and modern platform for new arcade releases In SNK Playmore officially became licensed to manufacture pachislot machines Japanese slot machines played in pachinko parlors The company released its first two machines that year Metal Slug and Dragon Gal Pachislots would be more heavily featured in SNK Playmore s product lineup for the next decade br In September at the Tokyo Game Show TGS SNK Playmore announced that it had ceased producing games on the Atomiswave favoring Taito s Type X arcade platform To counter the decline in the commercial gaming industry the company shifted some of its development focus to consumer games including original games for the PlayStation Nintendo DS mobile phones and other platforms Games continue to be ported to the PlayStation mostly in Europe because Sony Computer Entertainment of America SCEA did not approve most SNK Playmore games and more rarely to the Xbox In Japan SNK Playmore released the NeoGeo Online Collection for the PlayStation which contained some of its older games It featured emulations and online play was available through the KDDI matching service The company also released original titles based on existing franchises such as Metal Slug and the KOF Maximum Impact series

the first for any handheld console In the company released The King of Fighters XII which was not well received by the public and critics alike due to polemic changes in the game s graphics and structure In SNK Playmore released a sequel The King of Fighters XIII which was considered a much better game than its immediate predecessor It either won or was nominated to multiple Game of the Year awards br SNK has developed a great number of mobile games since It has licensed its characters for Chinese and other Asian games mostly mobile br In December SNK Playmore released the Neo Geo X a relaunched mobile Neo Geo console On October SNK Playmore terminated its licensing agreement with the console s manufacturer Tommo effectively ending production of the Neo Geo X less than a year after

in Rome hosted an event dedicated to the history of SNK tracing back the origins of the company and explaining the evolution of its games Yamamoto Kei Kiyoji Tomita and Ogura Eisuke participated at the event and were interviewed Ogura also drew two original illustrations to exhibit at the museum br br br Acquisition and re branding present br In March Leyou Technologies Holdings submitted a

mobile game giant Games and asset management firm Orient Securities had formed a joint venture to invest in Ledo Millennium a subsidiary of Leyou Through Ledo the venture acquired Kawasaki s stake in SNK Playmore for million The reason given for the acquisition was to gain rights to SNK Playmore s intellectual property and further develop them by following Marvel Entertainment s approach to mass media The joint venture planned to integrate games comics film and television in a media franchise br With the purchase completed SNK Playmore signaled a shift in the company s strategy which had previously been focused more on the production of pachislot and mobile games than its traditional area console and arcade games In November SNK Playmore announced that it was withdrawing from the pachislot market choosing instead to focus on console and mobile gaming as well as character licensing using its popular characters such as Mai Shiranui Ukyou Tachibana Nakoruru and Haohmaru Additionally all of the aforementioned characters made their appearance as guest characters in a mobile multiplayer online battle arena MOBA Wangzhe Rongyao roughly translated to English as Honor of
