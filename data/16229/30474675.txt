title: Interactive urinal
id: 30474675
An interactive urinal is a device that allows users to play video games or control interactive displays while urinating Several designs have been produced to date usually comprising a urinal fitted with a pressure sensor to measure the strength and position of the urine flow and an LCD screen mounted above the urinal to provide animated graphics br br br Captive Media br br A British company called Captive Media developed and patented an interactive video game system for installation above urinal bowls in Their system operates by use of infra red detection of urine temperature with the sensors integral to the screen unit which is positioned above the bowl Amongst others the system is installed in The Exhibit Bar in Balham in London and Ta Bouche Bar in Cambridge UK br Players control the system by directing their stream left or right Currently the system has two games br br On The Piste a skiing game in which the player must knock over penguins to score points br Clever Dick a pub quiz game in which players must answer True or False questions br Players can then access an affiliated website called Captive Games to view their scores on a leader board and use Twitter to broadcast them When not in use the screens display entertainment content including YouTube videos and Internet memes as well as the venue s own promotional material and third party advertisements br br br Yanko Design br In the design magazine Yanko Design presented a concept for a urinal containing a pressure sensitive display screen that is triggered when it is urinated on producing images and sound According to the designer Marcel Neundorfer it transforms urination into more than just a necessary nuisance By projecting the game experience into the public space viewers are treated to a new way of visualizing the abstract and the entertainment value is boosted br br br PlaceToPee br An interactive urinal named PlaceToPee formerly named PleeStation plee means toilet in Dutch was devised in Belgium by software engineer Werner Dupont and electrical engineer Bar Geraets The pair came up with the idea during a drinking session in a bar and attracted the interest of sanitary equipment company Guedens Sanitair Verhuur which provided financial support to develop a single PlaceToPee unit The PlaceToPee was installed in the GamePower Expo in Ghent with a racing game that allowed visitors to steer on screen cars with their urine The system gave warnings to players about drunk driving if their urine was off target It was shut down after the Belgian police deemed it to be indecent The following year the makers displayed the PlaceToPee at the Arendonk Zingt Swingt festival It allowed users to answer on screen questions by urinating in a particular direction The creators publicly expressed confidence in their product and suggested that it could be used as a sophisticated means of counting votes for the Miss Belgium contest Women are catered for by providing them with a cardboard cone to direct their urine br br br Interactive urinal communicator br The interactive urinal communicator is an advertising device invented by bioengineer Dr Richard Deutsch for the Islip New York company Wizmark The inch cm screen is placed in a urinal to promote products or services Deutsch commented Now when nature calls there is going to be something entertaining to look at and listen to br Features of the advertising include br br Flashing lights that are activated by physical presence or actual urination br A lenticular image that changes depending on viewpoint br A second pre recorded audio message br A temperature sensitive image br Deutsch commented to Marketing Magazine that Beginning with early attempts at writing one s name in the snow there has always been an element of recreation associated with urination for men Such advertising vehicles are not entirely new some plain screens have carried advertising for a few years now and poster style ads in washrooms are quite common The use of interactive urinal screens is being advocated by guerrilla marketers br br br Global Warming br In artist Ricardo Carvalho and programmer Alias Cummings created an interactive urinal entitled Global Warming in which the trail of urine hits on a grid of ultra sensitive piezos housed within the urinal The strength and direction of the urine is calculated and used to control the navigation of a D Earth globe leaving a trail of thousands of Google Earth place markers on its surface The spectator s action is reminiscent of spraying the animal behaviour of identifying and marking territory Global Warming besides its obvious environmental connotation is an ironic take on how primitive territorial instincts such as the visceral act of spraying can be exercised through supposedly intelligent and networked devices and at the same time disguised by them br br br Sega Toylet br br The Japanese company Sega has developed an interactive urinal system called the Toylet A choice of four mini games can be selected br br Manneken Pis named after the eponymous statue of a urinating boy in Brussels awards the player a score based on how hard and how much they can urinate br Graffiti Eraser requires the player to spray urine around to clean graffiti off a virtual wall br The Northern Wind The Sun and Me puts the player in the role of the wind trying to lift a girl s skirt by blowing air at her the strength of the wind depends on the force of the flow of urine br Battle Milk From Nose allows the player to compete against the person who last used the urinal by comparing the strength of their urine streams The streams are represented on screen as jets of milk squirting out of the noses of two characters standing in a sumo ring If the player s urine stream is stronger his opponent is blasted out of the ring br The Toylet records players scores and allows them to be saved onto a USB memory stick Advertisements are shown between games The system has been installed in the men s toilets in four stations of the Tokyo Metro including Akihabara Soga and Ikebukuro It was trialed until the end of January Some units are available at the new Tokyo Sega Joypolis br Simulated versions of Toylets are playable in the video game Yakuza Kiwami br br br Open source implementation br br Open source hardware project The Pinect a hand free game console for pissoirs named after the popular hand free controller Kinect The Pinect is an open source project meaning that the hardware and software designs as well as the D case design are freely available to the public br The Pinect s electronics are based on an Android tablet Mediapad T Arduino and a low cost M USB camera This makes it accessible to a wide range of DIY makers and developers The use of the Android platform allows for easy game development using popular game engines such as Libgdx Unity and Godot etc br Currently there is one game available for the Pinect console PiBall is a network football arcade game for two players which was developed for the FIFA World Cup in Russia br br This open source implementation of an interactive urinal not only provides a unique and entertaining experience for users but it also allows for a wider community of developers and makers to contribute and innovate on the project It opens up new possibilities for interactive public spaces and provides a fun and engaging way for people to interact with technology br The Pinect project is fully open source and all of its software for Android and Arduino is available on GitHub The repository includes everything needed to build and replicate the Pinect including the D case model PCB and scheme layout br The D case model can be used to D print the housing for the Pinect while the PCB and scheme layout can be used to assemble the electronic components All the necessary software including the Android app and Arduino sketch can be found in the repository and can be easily compiled and loaded onto the device br br br br br br External links br br Global Warming Photographs and video of Global Warming at the Kinetica Art Fair br PlaceToPee official website in
