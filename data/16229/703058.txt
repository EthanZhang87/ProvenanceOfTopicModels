title: Aircraft flight control system
id: 703058
A conventional fixed wing aircraft flight control system AFCS consists of flight control surfaces the respective cockpit controls connecting linkages and the necessary operating mechanisms to control an aircraft s direction in flight Aircraft engine controls are also considered flight controls as they change speed br The fundamentals of aircraft controls are explained in flight dynamics This article centers on the operating mechanisms of the flight controls The basic system in use on aircraft first appeared in a readily recognizable form as early as April on Louis Bl riot s Bl riot VIII pioneer era monoplane design br br br Cockpit controls br br br Primary controls br br Generally the primary cockpit flight controls are arranged as follows br br A control yoke also known as a control column centre stick or side stick the latter two also colloquially known as a control or joystick governs the aircraft s roll and pitch by moving the ailerons or activating wing warping on some very early aircraft designs when turned or deflected left and right and moves the elevators when moved backwards or forwards br Rudder pedals or the earlier pre rudder bar control yaw by moving the rudder the left foot forward will move the rudder left for instance br Thrust lever or throttle which controls engine speed or thrust for powered aircraft br The control yokes also vary greatly among aircraft There are yokes where roll is controlled by rotating the yoke clockwise counterclockwise like steering a car and pitch is controlled by moving the control column towards or away from the pilot but in others the pitch is controlled by sliding the yoke into and out of the instrument panel like most Cessnas such as the and and in some the roll is controlled by sliding the whole yoke to the left and right like the Cessna Centre sticks also vary between aircraft Some are directly connected to the control surfaces using cables others fly by wire airplanes have a computer in between which then controls the electrical actuators br br Even when an aircraft uses variant flight control surfaces such as a V tail ruddervator flaperons or elevons because these various combined purpose control surfaces control rotation about the same three axes in space the aircraft s flight control system will still be designed so that the stick or yoke controls pitch and roll conventionally as will the rudder pedals for yaw The basic pattern for modern flight controls was pioneered by French aviation figure Robert Esnault Pelterie with fellow French aviator Louis Bl riot popularizing Esnault Pelterie s control format initially on Louis Bl riot VIII monoplane in April and standardizing the format on the July Channel crossing Bl riot XI Flight control has long been taught in such fashion for many decades as popularized in ab initio instructional books such as the work Stick and Rudder br In some aircraft the control surfaces are not manipulated with a linkage In ultralight aircraft and motorized hang gliders for example there is no mechanism at all Instead the pilot just grabs the lifting surface by hand using a rigid frame that hangs from its underside and moves it br br br Secondary controls br br In addition to the primary flight controls for roll pitch and yaw there are often secondary controls available to give the pilot finer control over flight or to ease the workload The most commonly available control is a wheel or other device to control elevator trim so that the pilot does not have to maintain constant backward or forward pressure to hold a specific pitch attitude other types of trim for rudder and ailerons are common on larger aircraft but may also appear on smaller ones Many aircraft have wing flaps controlled by a switch or a mechanical lever or in some cases are fully automatic by computer control which alter the shape of the wing for improved control at the slower speeds used for take off and landing Other secondary flight control systems may include slats spoilers air brakes and variable sweep wings br br br Flight control systems br br br Mechanical br br Mechanical or manually operated flight control systems are the most basic method of controlling an aircraft They were used in early aircraft and are currently used in small aircraft where the aerodynamic forces are not excessive Very early aircraft such as the Wright Flyer I Bl riot XI and Fokker Eindecker used a system of wing warping where no conventionally hinged control surfaces were used on the wing and sometimes not even for pitch control as on the Wright Flyer I and original versions of the Etrich Taube which only had a hinged pivoting rudder in addition to the warping operated pitch and roll controls A manual flight control system uses a collection of mechanical parts such as pushrods tension cables pulleys counterweights and sometimes chains to transmit the forces applied to the cockpit controls directly to the control surfaces Turnbuckles are often used to adjust control cable tension The Cessna Skyhawk is a typical example of an aircraft that uses this type of system Gust locks are often used on parked aircraft with mechanical systems to protect the control surfaces and linkages from damage from wind Some aircraft have gust locks fitted as part of the control system br Increases in the control surface area and the higher airspeeds required by faster aircraft resulted in higher aerodynamic loads on the flight control systems As a result the forces required to move them also become significantly larger Consequently complicated mechanical gearing arrangements were developed to extract maximum mechanical advantage in order to reduce the forces required from the pilots This arrangement can be found on bigger or higher performance propeller aircraft such as the Fokker br Some mechanical flight control systems use servo tabs that provide aerodynamic assistance Servo tabs are small surfaces hinged to the control surfaces The flight control mechanisms move these tabs aerodynamic forces in turn move or assist the movement of the control surfaces reducing the amount of mechanical forces needed This arrangement was used in early piston engined transport aircraft and in early jet transports The Boeing incorporates a system whereby in the unlikely event of total hydraulic system failure it automatically and seamlessly reverts to being controlled via servo tab br br br Hydro mechanical br br The complexity and weight of mechanical flight control systems increase considerably with the size and performance of the aircraft Hydraulically powered control surfaces help to overcome these limitations With hydraulic flight control systems the aircraft s size and performance are limited by economics rather than a pilot s muscular strength At first only partially boosted systems were used in which the pilot could still feel some of the aerodynamic loads on the control surfaces feedback br A hydro mechanical flight control system has two parts br br The mechanical circuit which links the cockpit controls with the hydraulic circuits Like the mechanical flight control system it consists of rods cables pulleys and sometimes chains br The hydraulic circuit which has hydraulic pumps reservoirs filters pipes valves and actuators The actuators are powered by the hydraulic pressure generated by the pumps in the hydraulic circuit The actuators convert hydraulic pressure into control surface movements The electro hydraulic servo valves control the movement of the actuators br The pilot s movement of a control causes the mechanical circuit to open the matching servo valve in the hydraulic circuit The hydraulic circuit powers the actuators which then move the control surfaces As the actuator moves the servo valve is closed by a mechanical feedback linkage one that stops movement of the control surface at the desired position br This arrangement was found in the older designed jet transports and in some high performance aircraft Examples include the Antonov An and the Lockheed SR br br br Artificial feel devices br With purely mechanical flight control systems the aerodynamic forces on the control surfaces are transmitted through the mechanisms and are felt directly by the pilot allowing tactile feedback of airspeed With hydromechanical flight control systems the load on the surfaces cannot be felt and there is a risk of overstressing the aircraft through excessive control surface movement To overcome this problem artificial feel systems can be used For example for the controls of the RAF s Avro Vulcan jet bomber and the RCAF s Avro Canada CF Arrow supersonic interceptor both s era designs the required force feedback was achieved by a spring device The fulcrum of this device was moved in proportion to the square of the air speed for the elevators to give increased resistance at higher speeds For the controls of the American Vought F Crusader and the LTV A Corsair II warplanes a bob weight was used in the pitch axis of the control stick giving force feedback that was proportional to the airplane s normal acceleration br br br Stick shaker br br A stick shaker is a device that is attached to the control column in some hydraulic aircraft It shakes the control column when the aircraft is approaching stall conditions Some aircraft such as the McDonnell Douglas DC are equipped with a back up electrical power supply that can be activated to enable the stick shaker in case of hydraulic failure br br br Power by wire br In most current systems the power is provided to the control actuators by high pressure hydraulic systems In fly by wire systems the valves which control these systems are activated by electrical signals In power by wire systems electrical actuators are used in favour of hydraulic pistons The power is carried to the actuators by electrical cables These are lighter than hydraulic pipes easier to install and maintain and more reliable Elements of the F flight control system are power by wire The actuators in such an electro hydrostatic actuation EHA system are self contained hydraulic devices small closed circuit hydraulic systems The overall aim is towards more or all electric aircraft and an early example of the approach was the Avro Vulcan Serious consideration was given to using the approach on the Airbus A br br br Fly by wire control systems br br A fly by wire FBW system replaces manual flight control of an aircraft with an electronic interface The movements of flight controls are converted to electronic signals transmitted by wires hence the term fly by wire and flight control computers determine how to move the actuators at each control surface to provide the expected response Commands from the computers are also input without the pilot s knowledge to stabilize the aircraft and perform other tasks Electronics for aircraft flight control systems are part of the field known as avionics br Fly by optics also known as fly by light is a further development using fiber optic cables br br br Research br Several technology research and development efforts exist to integrate the functions of flight control systems such as ailerons elevators elevons flaps and flaperons into wings to perform the aerodynamic purpose with the advantages of less mass cost drag inertia for faster stronger control response complexity mechanically simpler fewer moving parts or surfaces less maintenance and radar cross section for stealth These may be used in many unmanned aerial vehicles UAVs and th generation fighter aircraft Two promising approaches are flexible wings and fluidics br br br Flexible wings br br In flexible wings also known as morphing aerofoils much or all of a wing surface can change shape in flight to deflect air flow much like an ornithopter Adaptive compliant wings are a military and commercial effort The X Active Aeroelastic Wing was a US Air Force NASA and Boeing effort Notable efforts have also been made by FlexSys who have conducted flight tests using flexible aerofoils retrofitted to a Gulf stream III aircraft br br br Active Flow Control br In active flow control systems forces in vehicles occur via circulation control in which larger and more complex mechanical parts are replaced by smaller simpler fluidic systems slots which emit air flows where larger forces in fluids are diverted by smaller jets or flows of fluid intermittently to change the direction of vehicles In this use active flow control promises simplicity and lower mass costs up to half less and inertia and response times This was demonstrated in the Demon UAV which flew for the first time in the UK in September br br br See also br Dual control aviation br Flight envelope
