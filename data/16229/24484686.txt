title: Thunderbolt (interface)
id: 24484686
Thunderbolt is the brand name of a hardware interface for the connection of external peripherals to a computer It was developed by Intel in collaboration with Apple It was initially marketed under the name Light Peak and first sold as part of an end user product on February br Thunderbolt combines PCI Express PCIe and DisplayPort DP into two serial signals and additionally provides DC power via a single cable Up to six peripherals may be supported by one connector through various topologies Thunderbolt and use the same connector as Mini DisplayPort MDP whereas Thunderbolt and use the USB C connector and support USB devices br br br Description br br Thunderbolt controllers multiplex one or more individual data lanes from connected PCIe and DisplayPort devices for transmission via two duplex Thunderbolt lanes then de multiplex them for use by PCIe and DisplayPort devices on the other end A single Thunderbolt port supports up to six Thunderbolt devices via hubs or daisy chains as many of these as the host has DP sources may be Thunderbolt monitors br A single Mini DisplayPort monitor or other device of any kind may be connected directly or at the very end of the chain Thunderbolt is interoperable with DP a compatible devices When connected to a DP compatible device the Thunderbolt port can provide a native DisplayPort signal with four lanes of output data at no more than Gbit s per Thunderbolt lane When connected to a Thunderbolt device the per lane data rate becomes Gbit s and the four Thunderbolt lanes are configured as two duplex lanes each Gbit s comprising one lane of input and one lane of output br Thunderbolt can be implemented on PCIe graphics cards which have access to DisplayPort data and PCIe connectivity or on the motherboard of computers with onboard video such as the MacBook Air br The interface was originally intended to run exclusively on an optical physical layer using components and flexible optical fiber cabling developed by Intel partners and at Intel s Silicon Photonics lab It was initially marketed under the name Light Peak and after as Silicon Photonics Link However it was discovered that conventional copper wiring could furnish the desired Gbit s per channel at lower cost br This copper based version of the Light Peak concept was co developed by Apple and Intel Apple registered Thunderbolt as a trademark but later transferred the mark to Intel which held overriding intellectual property rights Thunderbolt was commercially introduced on Apple s MacBook Pro using the same Apple developed connector as Mini DisplayPort Certain MacBook Air MacBook Pro Mac mini and iMac models downgrade Thunderbolt protocol to Thunderbolt due to not supporting dual K displays over Thunderbolt br Sumitomo Electric Industries started selling up to m ft optical Thunderbolt cables in Japan in January and Corning Inc began selling up to m ft optical cables in the US in late September br br br History br br br Introduction br Intel introduced Light Peak at the Intel Developer Forum IDF using a prototype Mac Pro logic board to run two p video streams plus LAN and storage devices over a single meter optical cable with modified USB ends The system was driven by a prototype PCI Express card with two optical buses powering four ports Jason Ziller head of Intel s Optical I O Program Office showed the internal components of the technology under a microscope and the sending of data through an oscilloscope The technology was described as having an initial speed of Gbit s over plastic optical cables and promising a final speed of Gbit s At the show Intel said Light Peak equipped systems would begin to appear in and posted a YouTube video showing Light Peak connected HD cameras laptops docking stations and HD monitors br On May in Brussels Intel demonstrated a laptop with a Light Peak connector indicating that the technology had shrunk enough to fit inside such a device and had the laptop send two simultaneous HD video streams down the connection indicating that at least some fraction of the software firmware stacks and protocols were functional At the same demonstration Intel officials said they expected hardware manufacturing to begin around the end of br In September some early commercial prototypes from manufacturers were demonstrated at Intel Developer Forum br br br Copper vs optical br br Though Thunderbolt was originally conceived as an optical technology Intel switched to electrical connections to reduce costs and to supply up to watts of power to connected devices br In Intel officials said the company was working on bundling the optical fiber with copper wire so Light Peak can be used to power devices plugged into the PC In Intel said the original intent was to have one single connector technology that would let electrical USB and piggyback on USB or DC power Light Peak aimed to make great strides in consumer ready optical technology by then having achieved connectors rated for insertions which matches or exceeds other PC connections cables that were tied in multiple knots to make sure it didn t break and the loss is acceptable and You can almost get two people pulling on it at once and it won t break the fibre They predicted that Light Peak cables will be no more expensive than HDMI br In January Intel s David Perlmutter told Computerworld that initial Thunderbolt implementations would be based on copper wires The copper came out very good surprisingly better than what we thought he said A major advantage of copper is the ability to carry power The final Thunderbolt standard specifies W DC on every port See comparison section below br Intel and industry partners are still developing optical Thunderbolt hardware and cables The optical fiber cables would run tens of meters but would not supply power at least not initially The version from Corning contains four m VSDN Very Short Distance Network fibers to transport an infrared signal up to m ft The conversion of electrical signal to optical is embedded into the cable itself so the current MDP connector is forward compatible Eventually Intel hopes for a purely optical transceiver assembly embedded in the PC br The first such optical Thunderbolt cable was introduced by Sumitomo Electric Industries in January It is available in lengths of m ft m ft and m ft However those cables are retailed almost exclusively in Japan and the price is to times that of copper Thunderbolt cables br German company DeLock also released optical Thunderbolt cables in lengths of m ft m ft and m ft in priced similarly to the Sumitomo ones and retailed only in Germany br In September glass company Corning Inc released the first range of optical Thunderbolt cables available in the Western marketplace along with optical USB cables both under the brand name Optical Cables Half the diameter and a fifth the mass of comparable copper Thunderbolt cables they work with the Gbit s Thunderbolt protocol and the Gbit s Thunderbolt protocol and thus are able to work with all self powered Thunderbolt devices unlike copper cables optical cables cannot provide power The cables extend the current m ft maximum length offered by copper to a maximum of m ft br Before there were no optical Thunderbolt cables on the market However optical Thunderbolt and cables could be used at the time with Apple s Thunderbolt USB C to Thunderbolt adapters on each end of the cable This achieves connections up to the m ft maximum offered by previous versions of the standard br In April Corning showed an optical Thunderbolt cable at the NAB Show in Las Vegas Just over a year later in September Corning released their optical Thunderbolt cables in lengths of m ft m ft m ft m ft and m ft In the meantime Taiwanese company Areca released optical Thunderbolt cables in April in lengths of m ft m ft and m ft br Copper versions of Thunderbolt cables offer full Gbit s speed and support backward compatibility with all versions of USB up to USB DisplayPort Alternate Mode DP HBR and Thunderbolt Released in early they were also to be available in three specified lengths m ft m ft and m ft with many companies initially offering m ft ones br Copper Thunderbolt cables up to m ft are passive cables while longer cables must integrate active signal conditioning circuitry m ft maximum is the length of active cables available from most brands including CalDigit Cable Matters et al while Apple are currently the only company that offers a m ft active copper cable br Optical Thunderbolt cables were targeting lengths from m ft to m ft although this may not happen instead jumping to Thunderbolt optical cables sometime after the arrival of that standard in late br br br Compatibility br Details on compatibilty are available from the Thunderbolt Technology Community Web site br A single Thunderbolt or later port provides data transfer support for two K Hz displays and quick notebook charging up to W with a single cable Any Thunderbolt or USB dock can connect to a Thunderbolt computer USB devices can be connected to a Thunderbolt or later port DisplayPort and Mini DisplayPort devices are supported br Some functionality may be available if a Thunderbolt device is connected to a USB C port this is implementation dependent and not guaranteed br Thunderbolt supports Thunderbolt devices but not earlier versions Thunderbolt and devices can be used with most but not all Thunderbolt PCs with the use of an adapter br br br Thunderbolt br CNET s Brooke Crothers said it was rumored that the early MacBook Pro update would include some sort of new data port and he speculated it would be Light Peak Thunderbolt At the time there were no details on the physical implementation and mock ups appeared showing a system similar to the earlier Intel demos using a combined USB Light Peak port Shortly before the release of the new machines the USB Implementers Forum USB IF announced they would not allow such a combination port and that USB was not open to modification in that way br Other implementations of the technology began in with desktop boards offering the interconnection now available br Apple stated in February that the port was based on Mini DisplayPort not USB As the system was described Intel s solution to the display connection problem became clear Thunderbolt controllers multiplex data from existing DP systems with data from the PCIe port into a single cable Older displays that using DP a or earlier must be located at the end of a Thunderbolt device chain but native displays can be anywhere along the line Thunderbolt devices can go anywhere on the chain In that respect Thunderbolt shares a relationship with the older ACCESS bus system which used the display connector to support a low speed bus br Apple states that up to six daisy chained peripherals are supported per Thunderbolt port and that the display should come at the end of the chain if it does not support daisy chaining br In February Apple introduced MacBook Pro inch Early Macbook Pro inch Early and Macbook Pro inch Early featuring one Thunderbolt port In May Apple introduced iMac inch Mid featuring one Thunderbolt port and iMac inch Mid featuring two Thunderbolt ports In July Apple introduced Mac mini Mid MacBook Air inch Mid MacBook Air inch Mid and Apple Thunderbolt Display featuring one Thunderbolt port for daisy chaining or other devices br In May Apple announced a new line of iMacs that include the Thunderbolt interface br The Thunderbolt port on the new Macs is in the same location relative to other ports and maintains the same physical dimensions and pinout as the prior MDP connector The main visible difference on Thunderbolt equipped Macs is a Thunderbolt symbol next to the port br The DisplayPort standard is partially compatible with Thunderbolt as the two share Apple s physically compatible MDP connector The Target Display mode on iMacs requires a Thunderbolt cable to accept a video in signal from another Thunderbolt capable computer A DP monitor must be the last or only device in a chain of Thunderbolt devices br Intel announced they would release a developer kit in the second quarter of while manufacturers of hardware development equipment have indicated they will add support for the testing and development of Thunderbolt devices The developer kit is being provided only on request br In July Sony released its Vaio Z line of notebook computers that had a Power Media Dock that uses optical Thunderbolt Light Peak to connect to an external graphics card using a combination port that behaves like USB electrically but that also includes the optical interconnect required for Thunderbolt br br br Thunderbolt br In June Intel announced that the next version of Thunderbolt based on the controller code named Falcon Ridge running at Gbit s is officially named Thunderbolt and entered production in The data rate of Gbit s is made possible by joining the two existing Gbit s channels which does not change the maximum bandwidth but makes using it more flexible br In June Apple announced Mac Pro Late featuring six Thunderbolt ports In October Apple announced MacBook Pro Retina inch Late and MacBook Pro Retina inch Late featuring two Thunderbolt ports In October Apple announced Mac mini Late and iMac Retina K inch Late featuring two Thunderbolt ports In March Apple announced MacBook Air inch Early and MacBook Air inch Early featuring one Thunderbolt port br At the physical level the bandwidth of Thunderbolt and Thunderbolt are identical and Thunderbolt cabling is thus compatible with Thunderbolt interfaces At the logical level Thunderbolt enables channel aggregation whereby the two previously separate Gbit s channels can be combined into a single logical Gbit s channel br Intel says Thunderbolt will be able to transfer a K video while simultaneously displaying it on a discrete monitor br Thunderbolt incorporates DisplayPort support which allows for video streaming to a single K video monitor or dual QHD monitors Thunderbolt is backwards compatible which means that all Thunderbolt cables and connectors are compatible with Thunderbolt br The first Thunderbolt product for the consumer market was Asus s Z Deluxe Quad motherboard announced on August and the first system released with Thunderbolt was Apple s late Retina MacBook Pro on October br br br Thunderbolt br br Thunderbolt is a hardware interface developed by Intel It shares USB C connectors with USB supports USB Gen and can require special active cables for maximum performance for cable lengths over meters feet Compared to Thunderbolt it doubles the bandwidth to Gbit s GB s It allows up to lanes of PCI Express Gbit s for general purpose data transfer and lanes of DisplayPort HBR Gbit s before encoding removal and Gbit s after for video but the maximum combined data rate cannot exceed Gbit s video data will be using all needed speed limiting PCIe data DP support is mandatory while DP is optional Other overheads are possible on PCIe data of b b is also removed and Thunderbolt protocol you either optimise for speed or for latency the last one gives only Gbit s to Gbit s Thunderbolt uses b b encoding after that which means the real rate is bigger than Gbit s times Gbit s br Intel s Thunderbolt controller codenamed Alpine Ridge or the new Titan Ridge halves power consumption and simultaneously drives two external K displays at Hz or a single external K display at Hz or a K display at Hz when using Apple s implementation for the late MacBook Pros instead of just the single display previous controllers can drive The new controller supports PCIe and other protocols including DisplayPort allowing for K resolutions at Hz Thunderbolt has up to watts of power delivery on copper cables and no power delivery capability on optical cables Using USB C on copper cables it can incorporate USB power delivery allowing the ports to source or sink up to watts of power This eliminates the need for a separate power supply from some devices Thunderbolt allows backwards compatibility with the first two versions by the use of adapters or transitional cables br Intel offers three varieties for each of the controllers br br Double Port DP uses a PCIe link to provide two Thunderbolt ports DSL JHL JHL br Single Port SP uses a PCIe link to provide one Thunderbolt port DSL JHL JHL br Low Power LP uses a PCIe link to provide one Thunderbolt port JHL br This follows previous practice where higher end devices such as the second generation Mac Pro iMac Retina MacBook Pro and Mac Mini use two port controllers while lower end lower power devices such as the MacBook Air use the one port version br Support was added to Intel s Skylake architecture chipsets shipping during late into early br Devices with Thunderbolt ports began shipping at the beginning of December including notebooks running Microsoft Windows from Acer Asus Clevo HP Dell Dell Alienware Lenovo MSI Razer and Sony as well as motherboards from Gigabyte Technology and a m Thunderbolt passive USB C cable from Lintes Technology br In October Apple announced MacBook Pro inch Thunderbolt Ports which as the name indicates features two Thunderbolt ports MacBook Pro inch Thunderbolt Ports and MacBook Pro inch which features four Thunderbolt ports In June Apple announced iMac inch iMac Retina K inch iMac Retina K inch which feature two Thunderbolt ports as well as the iMac Pro which featured four Thunderbolt ports and was released in December In October Apple announced MacBook Air Retina inch featuring Thunderbolt ports and Mac mini featuring four Thunderbolt ports In June Apple unveils Mac Pro and Mac Pro Rack featuring up to twelve Thunderbolt ports and Pro Display XDR with features one Thunderbolt port both released in December In April Apple announced iPad Pro inch rd generation and iPad Pro inch th generation featuring one Thunderbolt port In March Apple released Studio Display featuring one Thunderbolt port br On January Intel announced a product refresh codenamed Titan Ridge with enhanced robustness and support for DisplayPort Intel offers a single port JHL and double port JHL version of this host controller and a peripheral controller supporting two Thunderbolt ports JHL The new peripheral controller can now act as a USB sink compatible with regular USB C ports br The Apple Pro Display XDR which macOS allows to connect using two HBR connections to a Mac doesn t support Display Stream Compression DSC That would be Gbit s impossible for Thunderbolt but it works because the two bpc Hz MHz signals of the XDR display only require Gbit s total and Thunderbolt does not transmit the DisplayPort stuffing symbols used to fill the HBR bandwidth br br br USB br br The USB specification was released on August by USB Implementers Forum based on the Thunderbolt protocol specification br It supports Gbit s GB s throughput is optionally compatible with Thunderbolt and is backwards compatible with USB and USB The architecture defines a method to share a single high speed link with multiple end device types dynamically that best serves the transfer of data by type and application br USB supports DisplayPort over its alternative mode br In November Apple announced MacBook Air M MacBook Pro inch M and Mac mini M featuring USB In April Apple announced iMac inch M featuring two USB ports br br br USB PCIe Mode br USB makes the PCIe aspects of Thunderbolt open source PCIe USB devices can be released without Thunderbolt certification But notably those devices will not be allowed to use Thunderbolt branding However Thunderbolt devices use PCIe Mode with added certification labeling and promoting backwards compatibility This means multiple rival devices may use different brandings to accomplish the same task USB PCIe devices can be backwards compatible with Thunderbolt but this is not required USB PCIe Mode is not an Alternate Mode like DisplayPort Alternate Mode and Microsoft requires devices with USB to include PCIe support currently in order to be WHQL Windows certified PCs br br br Thunderbolt br Thunderbolt was announced at CES and the final specification was released in July The key differences between Thunderbolt and Thunderbolt are a minimum bandwidth requirement of Gbit s for PCIe link support for dual K displays DisplayPort and Intel VT d based direct memory access protection to prevent physical DMA attacks br Another major improvement is that Thunderbolt supports Thunderbolt Alternate Mode USB hubs Multi port Accessory Architecture and not just daisy chaining Those hubs are backwards compatible with Thunderbolt devices and can be backwards compatible with Thunderbolt hosts Titan Ridge only with Alpine Ridge the additional downstream ports get downgraded to USB br The maximum bandwidth remains at Gbit s the same as Thunderbolt and four times as fast as USB Gen x Supporting products began arriving in late and included Tiger Lake mobile processors for Intel Evo notebooks and series standalone Thunderbolt controllers codenamed Goshen Ridge for devices and Maple Ridge for hosts br USB supports DisplayPort over its alternative mode DisplayPort can support higher than K resolution at Hz losslessly due to new UHBR and signaling standards DSC used in DisplayPort for that resolution is not lossless in bit and K Hz with bit color and use up to Gbit s effective bandwidth Gbit s which is double the amount available to USB data because just as previously in DisplayPort it sends almost all the data in one direction to the monitor and can thus use all four data lanes at once Resolutions up to K Hz display with bit Y CbCr or RGB are possible br November Apple introduced the M Mac Mini with Thunderbolt ports The M update in included ports In October Apple announced a inch MacBook Pro and a inch MacBook Pro which each featured three Thunderbolt ports In March Apple announced the Mac Studio with up to six Thunderbolt ports br br br Thunderbolt br On September Intel previewed Thunderbolt codenamed Barlow Ridge aligned to the USB Implementers Forum s USB IF USB specification It provides symmetric bandwidth of Gbit s e g for mass storage devices double that of Thunderbolt and unidirectional bandwidth of Gbit s for displays three times that of Thunderbolt and supporting dual K displays at Hz br The full specifications cover br br Supporting the latest version of USB Gbit s specification br Two times the total bandwidth of Thunderbolt to Gbit s while providing up to three times the bandwidth to Gbit s for video intensive uses br Support for DisplayPort br Two times Gbit s the PCI Express data throughput using PCI Express Gen x for faster storage and external graphics br Up to W of charging power downstream br Works with existing passive cables up to m ft via PAM br Compatible with previous versions of Thunderbolt USB and DisplayPort br Supported by Intel s enabling and certification programs br Intel announced that computers and accessories compatible with Thunderbolt will come out starting in br br br Royalty situation br On May Intel announced that Thunderbolt would become a royalty free standard to OEMs and chip manufacturers in as part of an effort to boost the adoption of the protocol The Thunderbolt specification was later released to the USB IF on March making it royalty free to be used to form USB Intel says it will retain control over certification of all Thunderbolt devices Intel also states it employs mandatory certification for all Thunderbolt products br Before March there were no AMD chipsets or computers with Thunderbolt support released or announced due to the certification requirements Intel did not certify non Intel platforms However the YouTuber Wendell Wilson from Level Techs was able to get Thunderbolt support on an AMD computer with a Threadripper CPU and Titan Ridge add in card working by modifying the firmware indicating that the lack of Thunderbolt support on non Intel systems is not due to any hardware limitations As of May it is possible to have Thunderbolt support on AMD using add in cards without any problems and motherboards like ASRock X Creator already have Thunderbolt ports br In January Intel certified ASRock X Phantom Gaming ITX TB and now vendors are freely allowed to produce Thunderbolt controller silicon even though those ASRock motherboards used Intel Titan Ridge br Asus currently supports Thunderbolt on AMD with the add in card Thunderboltex TR being compatible with AMD motherboards and Ryzen xx ROG Strix B E Gaming ROG Strix B F Gaming Prime B PLUS TUF Gaming B Plus The ASUS ProArt B Creator has Thunderbolt ports br GIGABYTE also has pair of certified motherboards B VISION D P and B VISION D with an Intel Thunderbolt controller br br br Peripheral devices br br The first Thunderbolt peripheral devices appeared in retail stores only in late following Apple s release of its first Thunderbolt equipped computer in early with MacBook Pro with the relatively expensive Pegasus R drive and Pegasus R drive RAID enclosures by Promise Technology aimed at the prosumer and professional market initially offering up to TB of storage later increased to TB Sales of these units were hurt by the floods in Thailand who manufacture much of the world s supply of hard drives resulting in a cut to worldwide hard drive production and a subsequent driving up of storage costs hence the retail price of these Promise units increased in response contributing to a slower take up of the devices br It also took some time for other storage manufacturers to release products most were smaller devices aimed at the professional market and focused on speed rather than high capacity Many storage devices were under TB in size with some featuring SSDs for faster external data access rather than standard hard drives br Other companies have offered interface products that can route multiple older usually slower connections through a single Thunderbolt port In July Apple released its Apple Thunderbolt Display whose gigabit Ethernet and other older connector types made it the first hub of its type Later companies such as Belkin CalDigit Other World Computing Matrox StarTech and Elgato have all released Thunderbolt docks br As of late few other storage devices offering double digit TB capacity had appeared Exceptions included Sonnet Technologies highly priced professional units and Drobo s and drive enclosures the latter featuring their own BeyondRAID proprietary data handling system br Backwards compatibility with non Thunderbolt equipped computers was a problem as most storage devices featured only two Thunderbolt ports for daisy chaining up to six devices from each one In mid LaCie Drobo and other device makers started to swap out one of the two Thunderbolt ports for a USB connection on some of their low to mid end products Later models had the USB added in addition to the two Thunderbolt ports including those from LaCie on their big range br br br Apple devices br Apple released its first Thunderbolt equipped computer in early with MacBook Pro and have continued to immediately update their devices

those featuring the newer faster Gbit s connection throughout Again among the first was Promise Technology who released updated Pegasus versions of their R and R models along with an even larger R drive RAID unit offering up to TBs of storage Later other brands similarly introduced high capacity models with the newer connection type including SanDisk Professional with their G RAID Studio models offering up to TB and LaCie with their big and rack mounted big models offering up to TB LaCie also offering updated designed versions of their big mainstream consumer models up to TB using new TB

initially had poor hardware support outside of Apple devices and has been relegated to a niche gadget port with the adoption of Thunderbolt that uses the USB C connector standard meant that a much wider array of hardware was accepting of the market acceptance of the standard especially when it later became part of USB standard br List of Apple devices featuring Thunderbolt ports include br br

many high speed expansion buses including PCI Express PC Card ExpressCard FireWire PCI and PCI X is potentially vulnerable to a direct memory access DMA attack If users extend the PCI Express bus the most common high speed expansion bus in systems as of with Thunderbolt it allows very low level access to the computer An attacker could physically attach a malicious device which through its direct and unimpeded access to system memory and other devices would be able to bypass almost all security measures of the operating system allowing the attacker to read and write system memory potentially exposing encryption keys or installing malware Such attacks have been demonstrated modifying inexpensive commodity Thunderbolt hardware The IOMMU virtualization if present and configured by the BIOS and the operating system can close a computer s vulnerability to DMA attacks but only if the IOMMU can block the DMA access of malicious device As of the major OS vendors had not taken into account the variety of ways in which a malicious device could take advantage of complex interactions between multiple emulated peripherals exposing subtle bugs and vulnerabilities Some motherboard and UEFI implementations offer Kernel DMA Protection Intel VT d based direct memory access DMA protection is a mandatory requirement for Thunderbolt Host Certification br This vulnerability is not present when Thunderbolt is used as a system interconnection IPoTB supported on OS X Mavericks because the IP implementation runs on the underlying Thunderbolt low latency packet switching fabric and the PCI Express protocol is not present on the cable That means that if IPoTB networking is used between a group of computers there is no threat of such DMA attack between them br br br Vulnerability to Option ROM attacks br When a system with Thunderbolt boots it loads and executes Option ROMs from attached devices A malicious Option ROM can allow malware to execute before an operating system is started It can then invade the kernel log keystrokes or steal encryption keys The ease of connecting Thunderbolt devices to portable computers makes them ideal for evil maid attacks br Some systems load Option ROMs during firmware updates allowing the malware in a Thunderbolt device s Option ROM to potentially overwrite the SPI flash ROM containing the system s boot firmware In February Apple issued a Security Update to Mac OS X to eliminate the vulnerability of loading Option ROMs during firmware updates although the system is still vulnerable to Option ROM attacks during normal boots br Firmware enforced boot security measures such as UEFI Secure Boot which specifies the enforcement of signatures or hash allowlists of Option ROMs are designed to mitigate this kind of attack br br br Vulnerability to data exposure attacks Thunderspy br In May seven major security flaws were discovered in the Thunderbolt protocol collectively named Thunderspy They allow a malicious party to access all data stored in a computer even if the device is locked password protected and has an encrypted hard drive These vulnerabilities affect all Thunderbolt and ports The attack requries the computer to be in sleep mode and have a Thunderbolt controller with a writable fireware chip A well trained attacker with physical access to the computer evil maid can perform the required steps in minutes With a malicious firmware the attacker can covertly disable Thunderbolt security clone device identities and proceed to use DMA to extract data Thunderspy vulnerabilities can largely be mitigated using Kernel DMA Protection along with traditional anti intrusion hardware features br br br Cables br br In June Apple introduced the first Thunderbolt cable a m ft Gbit s full duplex active cable costing US br In June Apple began selling a Thunderbolt to gigabit Ethernet adapter for US In the third quarter of other manufacturers started shipping Thunderbolt cables including cables reaching the metres feet length limit while some storage enclosure builders began bundling Thunderbolt cables with their devices rather than making customers buy them separately as had been standard practice br In January Apple reduced the price of their m ft length cable to US and added a half meter cable for US br In Thunderbolt s introduction Intel announced passive USB C cables would connect Thunderbolt devices at speeds greater than USB though less than active Thunderbolt cables thereby eliminating the adoption barrier of Thunderbolt active cable costs br In mid copper Thunderbolt cables became available at lengths up to m ft However Gbit s on copper required either active cables or short initially m ft later m ft passive cables Passive copper cables exceeding m ft are limited to Gbit s Despite that limit passive cables provide USB Gbit s backward compatibility while active cables support only USB Mbit s In April optical Thunderbolt cables debuted see Copper vs optical br Copper versions of Thunderbolt cables offer full Gbit s speed and backward compatibility with all versions of USB up to USB DisplayPort Alternate Mode DP HBR and Thunderbolt Released in early they are also all to be available in three specified lengths m ft m ft and m ft with many companies initially offering m ft lengths Copper Thunderbolt cables up to m ft are passive cables while longer cables must integrate active signal conditioning circuitry Interestingly Apple are currently the only company that offers a m ft copper cable whilst other companies maximum length of copper cables are m ft Optical Thunderbolt cables were targeting lengths from m ft to m ft although this may not happen instead jumping to Thunderbolt optical cables sometime after the arrival of that standard in late br br
