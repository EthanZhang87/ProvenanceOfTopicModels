AZON or Azon from azimuth only was one of the world s first guided weapons deployed by the Allies and contemporary with the German Fritz X br Officially designated VB Vertical Bomb it was invented by Major Henry J Rand and Thomas J O Donnell during the latter stages of World War II as the answer to the difficult problem of destroying the narrow wooden bridges that supported much of the Burma Railway br AZON was essentially a lb kg general purpose AN M bomb with a quadrilateral fin style radio controlled tail fin design as part of a tail package to give the desired guidance capability allowing adjustment of the vertical trajectory in the yaw axis giving the Azon unit a lateral steering capability meaning it could only steer left and right and could not alter its pitch or rate of fall This lack of any pitch control meant that the bombardier still had to accurately release it with a bombsight to ensure it could not fall short of or beyond the target The tail package bolted onto the standard bomb warhead in place of the usual sheet metal fixed fins this concept was an early iteration of a now common method of making modern guided bombs such as the JDAM the Paveway family the KAB L etc making the guidance and control units as separate pieces that attach to the tail and or nose of a standard iron bomb making it into a guided weapon There were gyroscopes mounted in the bomb s added tail package that made it an Azon unit to autonomously stabilize it in the roll axis via operating a pair of ailerons and a radio control system to operate the proportional control rudders to directly control the bomb s direction of lateral aim with the antennas for the tail mounted receiver unit built into the diagonal support struts of the tail surface assembly The bomb s receiver and control system were powered by a battery which had around three minutes of battery life The entire setup in the added tail package was sufficient to guide the weapon from a foot m drop height to the target Situated on the tail of the bomb was a candela flare which also left behind a noticeable smoke trail to enable the bombardier to observe and control it from the control aircraft When used in combat it was dropped from a modified Consolidated B Liberator with earlier development test drops of the Azon in the United States sometimes using the B Flying Fortress as the platform Some ten crews of the th Bombardment Group based at RAF Horsham St Faith were trained to drop the device for use in the European theater br The ability to only control the path of the bomb in the azimuth direction made AZON bombs most suitable for long and narrow targets such as bridges or railways A disadvantage of using an AZON bomb was that after a bomb was dropped the bomber could not break way immediately because the bombardier had to keep the bomb in view so he could guide it The bombardier used a BC joystick control to adjust the course left or right The directional commands were sent to the guidance package via a special purpose radio system br The rd Bomb Squadron also dropped Azon bombs in Burma in early from similarly modified B s based at Pandaveswar Airfield India with considerable success fulfilling the designers original purpose for the ordnance br br br Azon operations br br br See also br Bat U S Navy autonomously radar guided bomb br Fritz X br GB br Kehl Strasbourg radio control link for MCLOS control of WW II German PGM ordnance br List of anti ship missiles br br br br br br External links br br NMUSAF page about the Azon ordnance br Official USAAF film describing the AZON bomb br USAAF and USN guided air to surface ordnance of World War II br The Dawn of the Smart Bomb br Guided weapons of World War II br GB series weapons br Account of AZON Bomb Use by the th Bomb Group in ETO Archived at the Wayback Machine br Account of AZON Bomb Use by the rd Bomb Squadron in CBI Theater br Video account of AZON Use Against the Burma Railway bridges br WW II video of AZON Bomb Drop over Burma br Another video of AZONs in action over Burma
