Hampshire when he conceived the idea of playing games on a television screen around With support of his employers he worked through several prototypes until he arrived at a Brown Box that would later become the blueprint for the first home video game console licensed by Magnavox as the Magnavox Odyssey Baer continued to design several other consoles and computer game units including contributing to design of the Simon electronic game Baer continued to work in electronics until his death in with over patents to his name br Baer is considered the Father of Video Games due to his many contributions to games and helping to spark the video game industry in the latter half of the th century In February he was awarded the National Medal of Technology for his groundbreaking and pioneering creation development and commercialization of interactive video games which spawned related uses applications and mega industries in both the entertainment and education realms br br br Life br Ralph Baer was born in to Lotte Kirschbaum and Leo Baer a Jewish family living in Germany in Pirmasens and was originally named Rudolf Heinrich Baer At age he was expelled from school due to anti Jewish legislation implemented in Nazi Germany and had to go to an all Jewish school His father worked in a shoe factory in Pirmasens at the time Baer s family fearing increasing persecution moved from Germany to New York City in just two months prior to Kristallnacht while Baer was a teenager Baer would later become a naturalized United States citizen br In the United States he was self taught and worked in a factory for a weekly wage of twelve dollars After seeing an advertisement at a bus station for education in the budding electronics field he quit his job to study in the field He graduated from the National Radio Institute as a radio service technician in In he was drafted to fight in World War II and assigned to military intelligence at the United States Army headquarters in London On returning from war duty in he presented a large collection of weaponry he had amassed about short tons kg to museums in Aberdeen Maryland Springfield Massachusetts and Fort Riley Kansas With his secondary education funded by the G I Bill Baer graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Television Engineering which was unique at the time from the American Television Institute of Technology in Chicago in br In Baer went to work as chief engineer for a small electro medical equipment firm called Wappler Inc There he designed and built surgical cutting machines epilators and low frequency pulse generating muscle toning equipment In Baer went to work as a senior engineer for Loral Electronics in Bronx New York where he designed power line carrier signaling equipment contracting for IBM From to he worked at Transitron Inc in New York City as a chief engineer and later as vice president br br He started his own company before joining defense contractor Sanders Associates in Nashua New Hampshire now part of BAE Systems Inc in where he stayed until retiring in Baer s primary responsibility at Sanders was overseeing about engineers in the development of electronic systems being used for military applications Out of this work came the concept of a home video game console He would go on to create the first commercial video game consoles among several other patented advances in video games and electronic toys As he approached retirement Baer partnered with Bob Pelovitz of Acsiom LLC and they invented and marketed toy and game ideas from until Baer s death br Baer was a Life Senior Member of Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers His son Mark helped lead the nomination process to elevate him to become an IEEE Life Fellow the highest level of membership within the organization br br br Family and death br Baer married Dena Whinston in she died in They had three children during their marriage and at the time of Baer s death he had four grandchildren Baer died at his home in Manchester New Hampshire on December according to family and friends close to him br br br Inventions br br In while an employee at Sanders Associates Baer started to explore the possibility of playing games on television screens He first got the idea while working at Loral in another electronics company however they were uninterested in the project at the time In a interview Baer said that he recognized that the price reduction of owning a television set at the time had opened a large potential market for other applications considering that various military groups had identified ways of using television for their purposes Upon coming up with the idea of creating a game using the television screen he wrote a four page proposal with which he was able to convince one of his supervisors to allow him to proceed He was given US and the time of two other engineers Bill Harrison and Bill Rusch They developed the Brown Box console video game system so named because of the brown tape in which they wrapped the units to simulate wood veneer Baer recounted that in an early meeting with a patent examiner and his attorney to patent one of the prototypes he had set up the prototype on a television in the examiner s office and within minutes every examiner on the floor of that building was in that office wanting to play the game The Brown Box was ultimately patented on April given U S Patent No and became jointly owned by Ralph Baer and BAE Systems br Baer began seeking a buyer for the system turning to various television manufacturers many whom showed little interest in the unit In the technology was licensed to Magnavox which completed the design and released it in September as the Magnavox Odyssey br After the release of Pong which was partially inspired by the table tennis game on the Odyssey a lengthy conflict ensued between Baer and Atari co founder Nolan Bushnell over who was the true father of video games Baer was willing to concede this to Bushnell though noted that Bushnell has been telling the same nonsensical stories for years Ultimately the industry came to name Baer as the father of the home video game console while crediting Bushnell with creating the concept of the arcade machine Upon Baer s death Bushnell stated that Baer s contributions to the rise of videogames should not be forgotten br Baer is also credited with co developing three popular electronic games Baer along with Howard J Morrison developed Simon and its sequel Super Simon for Milton Bradley electronic pattern matching games that were immensely popular through the late s Simon was assigned Pat No in Baer also developed a similar pattern matching game Maniac for the Ideal Toy Company on his own though the game was not as popular as Simon Baer considered that Maniac was really hard to play and thus not as popular as his earlier game br br In Baer donated hardware prototypes and documents to the Smithsonian Institution He continued to tinker in until at least By the time of his death Baer had over patents in his name In addition to the patents related to video games he also held patents for electronic greeting cards and tracking systems for submarines br br br Death br br br Awards and tributes br br In addition to being considered The Father of Video Games Baer was recognized as a pioneer in the video game field His accolades include the G Phoria Legend Award the IEEE Masaru Ibuka Consumer Electronics Award the Game Developers Conference Developers Choice Pioneer award and the IEEE Edison Medal Baer was posthumously given the Pioneer Award by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences at the Game Developers Conference br br On February Baer was awarded the National Medal of Technology by President George W Bush in honor of his groundbreaking and pioneering creation development and commercialization of interactive video games On April Baer was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame at a ceremony at the United States Department of Commerce in Washington D C While Baer s contributions had generally been overlooked by more recent advances in video game technology development Baer had stated In view of the fact that the President of the United States of America hung the National Medal of Technology around my neck in a White House ceremony in and in view of my having been inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame I really don t feel neglected br In Baer donated many of his inventions to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History Following his death in his workshop was removed from the basement of his house on Mayflower Drive in Manchester and to the museum where it is now on permanent display in the museum s Innovation Wing br On April the United
