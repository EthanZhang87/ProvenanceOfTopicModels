title: Wired glove
id: 2685091
A wired glove also called a dataglove or cyberglove is an input device for human computer interaction worn like a glove br Various sensor technologies are used to capture physical data such as bending of fingers Often a motion tracker such as a magnetic tracking device or inertial tracking device is attached to capture the global position rotation data of the glove These movements are then interpreted by the software that accompanies the glove so any one movement can mean any number of things Gestures can then be categorized into useful information such as to recognize sign language or other symbolic functions br Expensive high end wired gloves can also provide haptic feedback which is a simulation of the sense of touch This allows a wired glove to also be used as an output device Traditionally wired gloves have only been available at a huge cost with the finger bend sensors and the tracking device having to be bought separately br Wired gloves are often used in virtual reality environments and to mimic human hand movement by robots br br br History br The Sayre Glove created by Electronic Visualization Laboratory in was the first wired glove br In Thomas G Zimmerman filed a patent US Patent on an optical flex sensor mounted in a glove to measure finger bending Zimmerman worked with Jaron Lanier to incorporate ultrasonic and magnetic hand position tracking technology to create the Power Glove and Data Glove respectively US Patent filed The optical flex sensor used in the Data Glove was invented by Young L Harvill who scratched the fiber near the finger joint to make it locally sensitive to bending br One of the first wired gloves available to home users in was the Nintendo Power Glove This was designed as a gaming glove for the Nintendo Entertainment System It had a crude tracker and finger bend sensors plus buttons on the back The resistive sensors in the PowerGlove were also used by hobbyists to create their own datagloves br This was followed by the CyberGlove created by Virtual Technologies Inc in Virtual Technologies was acquired by Immersion Corporation in September In the CyberGlove line of products was divested by Immersion Corporation and a new company CyberGlove Systems LLC took over development manufacturing and sales of the CyberGlove br In addition to the CyberGlove Immersion Corp also developed three other data glove products the CyberTouch which vibrates each individual finger of the glove when a finger touches an object in virtual reality the CyberGrasp which actually simulates squeezing and touching of solid as well as spongy objects and the CyberForce device which does all of the above and also measures the precise motion of the user s entire arm br br In the P Glove was released by Essential Reality hardware designed by Johathan Clarke and Leigh Boyd In normal applications it worked as a two dimensional mouse and a few computer games were specially adapted to provide D support for it The P glove is compatible with Microsoft Windows XP and the classic Mac OS Unofficial drivers for Linux exist as well While it received some positive reviews from gadget and gaming magazines its lack of compatible software and other issues caused it to remain a novelty It has since been discontinued br Following the P Glove was the th Glove a data glove and flexor strip kit th Glove DFK sold by Fifth Dimension Technologies The package uses flexible optical bending sensing to track hand and arm movement The glove can be used with DT s ultrasonic tracking system the DT Head and DT Hand tracker which can track movement from up to two metres away from the unit s transmitter br Concerned about the high cost of the most complete commercial solutions Pamplona et al propose a new input device an image based data glove IBDG By attaching a camera to the hand of the user and a visual marker to each finger tip they use computer vision techniques to estimate the relative position of the finger tips Once they have information about the tips they apply inverse kinematics techniques in order to estimate the position of each finger joint and recreate the movements of the fingers of the user in a virtual world Adding a motion tracker device one can also map pitch yaw roll and XYZ translations of the hand of the user almost recreating all the gesture and posture performed by the hand of the user in a low cost device br A modern alternative to inertial optical and magnetic technology is the use of stretch sensors New Zealand company StretchSense has developed the first stretch sensor enabled motion capture glove called the MoCap Pro Stretch sensors are silicone based flexible capacitors that measure stretch bend shear and pressure changes The data can then be streamed into software platforms such as Unreal Engine Unity and Maya to animate the hand of a virtual character br br br Alternatives br An alternative to wired gloves is to use a camera and computer vision to track the D pose and trajectory of the hand at the cost of tactile feedback br br br Popular culture br The film adaptation of Minority Report makes use of wireless gloves to control futuristic computer like peripherals br The Mattel Power Glove was prominently shown off in the Nintendo product placement film The Wizard memorably wielded by antagonist Lucas Barton Jackey Vinson br br br Academic and research projects br The concept of a wired glove has been traditionally popular in the research and engineering community Engineers continue to develop prototypes that use innovative sensor technologies and architectures to achieve the goal of gesture recognition For example one such project is the Smart Glove developed in by the then electronics engineering students Arvind Ramana Subramanian KS Suresh and Shiva This project was an innovative design making interesting use of hall effect switches and custom home made bend sensors br One major barrier to adoption of datagloves is sweat br br br See
