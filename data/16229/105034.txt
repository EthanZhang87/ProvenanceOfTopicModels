Pau French pronunciation po Occitan pronunciation paw is a commune overlooking the Pyrenees and prefecture of the department of Pyr n es Atlantiques region of Nouvelle Aquitaine France br The city is located in the heart of the former sovereign principality of B arn of which it was the capital from Pau lies on the Gave de Pau and is located kilometres mi from the Atlantic Ocean and kilometres mi from Spain This position gives it a striking panorama across the mountain range of the Pyrenees especially from its landmark Boulevard des Pyr n es as well as the hillsides of Juran on According to Alphonse de Lamartine Pau has the world s most beautiful view of the earth just as Naples has the most beautiful view of the sea br The site has been occupied since at least the Gallo Roman era However the first references to Pau as a settlement only occur in the first half of the th century The town developed from the construction of its castle likely from the th century by the Viscounts of B arn to protect the ford which was a strategic point providing access to the Bearn valleys and to Spain The city takes its name from the stockade pau in B arnese which surrounded the original castle br Pau became the capital of B arn in and the seat of the Kings of Navarre in after the capture of Pamplona by the Kingdom of Castile Pau became a leading political and intellectual centre under the reign of Henry d Albret With the end of B arnaise independence in Pau lost its influence but remained at the head of a largely autonomous province It was home to the Parliament of Navarre and B arn during the Revolution when it was dismantled to create the Department of Basses Pyr n es The Belle poque marked a resurgence for the B arnaise capital with a massive influx of wealthy foreign tourists who came to spend the winter to take advantage of the benefits of Pau s climate It was at this time that Pau became one of the world capitals of the nascent aerospace industry under the influence of the Wright brothers br With the decline of tourism during the th century Pau s economy gradually shifted towards the aviation industry and then to petrochemicals with the discovery of the Lacq gas field in The Universit de Pau et des Pays de l Adour founded in accounts for a large student population The city plays a leading role for B arn but also for a wide segment of the Adour area Pau s heritage extends over several centuries its diversity and its quality allowed it to obtain the label of City of Art and History in br The name of its people is Palois in French and paulin in Occitan The motto of Pau is in Latin Urbis palladium et gentis protective of the city and its people br br br Geography br br br Location br br Pau is kilometres miles from the Atlantic Ocean and km miles from the border with Spain on the Pyrenees The frontier is crossed by the col du Somport metres feet and the col du Pourtalet m ft Access to the crossings partly accounts for Pau s strategic importance br Pau is located km mi west of Toulouse km mi from Tarbes and Lourdes km mi from Oloron The conglomeration of Bayonne Anglet Biarritz is at km mi Bordeaux km mi br br br Communal boundaries br To the north Buros Montardon and Morla s br To the east Bizanos and Idron br To the south Gelos and Juran on br To the west Lons and Bill re br br br Hydrography br br The city located at an average altitude of metres ft is crossed by the Gave de Pau where a ford gave passage to the Pyrenees Gave is the name given to a torrent in the Pyrenees The Gave de Pau which becomes a torrent when mountain snow melts takes its source in the Cirque de Gavarnie and is the main tributary of the Adour into which it empties after kilometres mi The crossing was used for pasturage for sheep in the high meadows The old route is now a hiking path GR that runs km mi south to the border br The lands of the commune are also watered by the Luy de B arn a tributary the Luy and by its tributaries the A gue Longue and the Uzan as well as the Soust the Herr re the Ousse and the Ousse des Bois tributaries of the Gave de Pau The Aygue Longue is in turn joined the territory of Pau by the Bruscos and the Lata streams just as the Ousse is joined by the Merd stream The Lau Creek that feeds the Canal du Moulin meanwhile is also present in the municipality br br br Climate br Pau features wet mild winters with warm mild summers that are drier Its geographical location not far from the Pyrenees gives the city a contrasting warm oceanic climate Temperatures colder than C F are rare and those below C F are exceptional Temperatures reached lows of C F in February and C F in January Snow falls about days per year metres in in from November to March br In summer the maximum temperatures are of the order of to C to F and temperatures above C F are reached very rarely During some days of winter the foehn a warm wind can raise the temperature over C F As soon as the wind stops snow can fall br Rainfall is high of the order of millimetres in per year compared to millimetres in in Paris millimetres in in Bordeaux and millimetres in in Toulouse Sunshine averages around hours per year or a little less than its neighbour of the Hautes Pyr n es Tarbes which averages hours of sunshine per year Fog is infrequent and does not persist much beyond noon The lack of wind especially characterizes the climate of the Pau region Strong winds are very rare in general winds are very low or zero br This climate has helped Pau to become at the end of the th century a winter resort spot popular with the English Russian and Brazilian bourgeoisie In a British doctor Alexander Taylor attributed healing sedative virtues to the Pau climate br This mild and rather wet climate is also an enhancement to the gardens parks and public spaces of the city and for plants from more exotic regions such as Chinese windmill palm Trachycarpus fortunei originating in the Chinese mountains but also for giant sequoias Sequoiadendron giganteum and laurel magnolia Magnolia grandiflora of American origin br br br History br br br Toponymy br br The origin of the name is uncertain One tradition suggests it is a derivation of pal fr pieu from the palisade around the original ch teau Another is that the name refers to a ford across the river administered by the church the pious According to Michel Grosclaude and other onomasticians more recent research suggests the pre Indo European root for a rockface was pal or bal and that the name refers to Pau s position at the foot of the mountains The palisade or pal from the Latin palum also has the same ancient basis but it is not under this meaning that formed the name of Pau this can be compared to the Col de Pau in the Aspe Valley metres ft Lescun which has nothing to do with the city Its name in the B arnese dialect is Pau br The name of the town was recorded in the th century The inhabitants of the city are known as paulins in Occitan and palois in French Their motto is Urbis palladium et gentis br br br Origins br Before the th century there are no traces to date of occupation of the site on which the city is now built The city was built on a site with very special qualities The Gave de Pau which descends from the Pyrenees was a river which was fairly difficult to cross and for a distance of approximately kilometres mi only three fords existed from Nay to the east from Orthez to the west and that of Pau strategically located between the two The northern extremity of a plateau formed to a point overlooks this ford of almost metres ft In summary it is an ideal natural location to control the passage and the arrivals from the Pyrenees and a small monitoring station was built around the year a fort surrounded by a simple palisade br The site was fortified in the th century to control the ford across the Gave de Pau It was built on the north bank equidistant from Lescar seat of the bishops and from Morla s br Until the th century this fort was consolidated and some houses were combined there together in a small hamlet The lords of B arn then granted the status of viguerie a small administrative district in the Middle Ages to this new village which continued to expand gently In Bearnese the palisade was called Pa Historians agree to this being the origin of the name of the city br In the th century new recognition of the importance and the expansion of Pau which had become the town of Castelnau with a bailli appointed by the viscounts of B arn br Gaston F bus descendant of the counts of Foix and one of the first iconic figures of B arn who was very attached to the independence of his small country He began his major work to reinforce the strongholds of B arn including the Ch teau of Pau where he finally settled br Pau was made the capital of B arn in instead of Orthez During the early th century the Ch teau de Pau became the residence of the Kings of Navarre who were also viscounts of B arn br Pau is the only city in Europe in which two founders of royal dynasties were born Henry IV of France of the House of Bourbon born in and Charles XIV John of Sweden of the House of Bernadotte born in br br br History br br br Middle Ages br Pau was a castelnau founded at an unknown date in the second half of the th or the very beginning of the th century to control a fording of the Gave de Pau which was used for the passage of the shepherds in transhumance between the mountains of Ossau and pasture of the plain of the Pont Long A castle was built overlooking the north bank at equal distance from Lescar seat of the bishops and from Morla s capital of the Viscounts of B arn br In Gaston VI assembled his cour majour there predecessor of the conseil souverain and roughly equivalent to the House of Lords Gaston VII added a third tower in the th century Gaston F bus Gaston III of Foix and Gaston X of B arn added a brick donjon keep known as la tour Bill re the Tower of Bill re br br br th th

refugees north of the Pyrenees after the capture of Pamplona by the Spaniards In it had a sovereign council and a chamber of accounts br In Henri d Albret King of Navarre and sovereign viscountcy of B arn married Marguerite of Angoul me sister of Francis I of France She transformed the ch teau in the Renaissance style and created its gardens br In his daughter Jeanne d Albret gave birth to Henry III of Navarre by singing a song of B arn to the Virgin Mary so that the future Henry IV was neither fearful nor balked She had crossed into France to ensure her son would be born there The baby s lips were moistened with the local Juran on wine and rubbed with garlic shortly after birth When Henry IV left Pau to become King of France he remarked to local notables that he was not giving B arn to France but giving France to B arn br br The troops of Charles IX took the city but d Albret took over in Catherine of Bourbon sister of Henri IV governed B arn in his place br In Pau revolted Louis XIII occupied it and after receiving the submission of the fortified town of Navarrenx pronounced the attachment of B arn and Navarre to France by the edict of October It thus transformed the sovereign Council of B arn in the Parliament of Navarre joining the future courses of Pau and Saint Palais br Pau had a new enclosure in and then a university in br King Charles XIV of Sweden the first royal Bernadotte was born in Pau in the th century br On October it was declared after Navarrenx the new capital of the Department of Basses Pyr n es This status was removed on October in favor of Oloron then made permanent on March br br br th century br br Napoleon expressed his interest and helped to save the ch teau which became a prison for a time In Louis Philippe did boldly restore it to highlight the medieval and Renaissance character Napoleon III added a double tower framing a false entry to the West He also added streets of Belle poque architecture before the fashion transferred to Biarritz br After the July Monarchy Pau became between and had the most famous climate and sports resort in Western Europe In the Scottish physician Alexander Taylor advocated Pau for a winter cure

kilometres mi It disappeared in The town of Pau was also served by the Pau Oloron Maul on railway POM whose main station was found at the Place de la R publique Three lines served Monein Pontacq and Lembeye Steam traction was used on the network which disappeared in December br While the upper town thrived because of the coming of the rich European tourists the lower city specialised in industry Many small structures gradually developed at the foot of the ch teau the production focused on textiles and the food industry Many of them marked this industrial fabric such as Courriades dyes the He d flour mill and the tram factory br Mary Todd Lincoln the widow of the American president also lived in Pau for several years in the late s br br br th century br At the beginning of the th century Pau was still a resort town where European nobility spent the winter Good English American Russian Spanish or Prussian society met in the B arnaise city Many public amenities were from this period including the Pau Funicular to connect the station to the upper town Next to these public amenities wealthy foreign visitors were building villas to improve the conditions of their stay First built in the centre of town these residences spread out more and more to enjoy the great outdoors and views of the Pyrenees Between and many residences were thus built and still evoke the splendour of this
