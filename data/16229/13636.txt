title: History of computing hardware
id: 13636
The history of computing hardware covers the developments from early simple devices to aid calculation to modern day computers br The first aids to computation were purely mechanical devices which required the operator to set up the initial values of an elementary arithmetic operation then manipulate the device to obtain the result Later computers represented numbers in a continuous form e g distance along a scale rotation of a shaft or a voltage Numbers could also be represented in the form of digits automatically manipulated by a mechanism Although this approach generally required more complex mechanisms it greatly increased the precision of results The development of transistor technology and then the integrated circuit chip led to a series of breakthroughs starting with transistor computers and then integrated circuit computers causing digital computers to largely replace analog computers Metal oxide semiconductor MOS large scale integration LSI then enabled semiconductor memory and the microprocessor leading to another key breakthrough the miniaturized personal computer PC in the s The cost of computers gradually became so low that personal computers by the s and then mobile computers smartphones and tablets in the s became ubiquitous br br br Early devices br br br Ancient and medieval br br Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years mostly using one to one correspondence with fingers The earliest counting device was probably a form of tally stick The Lebombo bone from the mountains between Eswatini and South Africa may be the oldest known mathematical artifact It dates from BCE and consists of distinct notches that were deliberately cut into a baboon s fibula Later record keeping aids throughout the Fertile Crescent included calculi clay spheres cones etc which represented counts of items probably livestock or grains sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers The use of counting rods is one example The abacus was early used for arithmetic tasks What we now call the Roman abacus was used in Babylonia as early as c BC Since then many other forms of reckoning boards or tables have been invented In a medieval European counting house a checkered cloth would be placed on a table and markers moved around on it according to certain rules as an aid to calculating sums of money br Several analog computers were constructed in ancient and medieval times to perform astronomical calculations These included the astrolabe and Antikythera mechanism from the Hellenistic world c BC In Roman Egypt Hero of Alexandria c AD made mechanical devices including automata and a programmable cart Other early mechanical devices used to perform one or another type of calculations include the planisphere and other mechanical computing devices invented by Al Biruni c AD the equatorium and universal latitude independent astrolabe by Al Zarqali c AD the astronomical analog computers of other medieval Muslim astronomers and engineers and the astronomical clock tower of Su Song during the Song dynasty The castle clock a hydropowered mechanical astronomical clock invented by Ismail al Jazari in was the first programmable analog computer Ramon Llull invented the Lullian Circle a notional machine for calculating answers to philosophical questions in this case to do with Christianity via logical combinatorics This idea was taken up by Leibniz centuries later and is thus one of the founding elements in computing and information science br br br Renaissance calculating tools br Scottish mathematician and physicist John Napier discovered that the multiplication and division of numbers could be performed by the addition and subtraction respectively of the logarithms of those numbers While producing the first logarithmic tables Napier needed to perform many tedious multiplications It was at this point that he designed his Napier s bones an abacus like device that greatly simplified calculations that involved multiplication and division br br Since real numbers can be represented as distances or intervals on a line the slide rule was invented in the s shortly after Napier s work to allow multiplication and division operations to be carried out significantly faster than was previously possible Edmund Gunter built a calculating device with a single logarithmic scale at the University of Oxford His device greatly simplified arithmetic calculations including multiplication and division William Oughtred greatly improved this in with his circular slide rule He followed this up with the modern slide rule in essentially a combination of two Gunter rules held together with the hands Slide rules were used by generations of engineers and other mathematically involved professional workers until the invention of the pocket calculator br br br Mechanical calculators br In Guidobaldo del Monte made a mechanical multiplier to calculate fractions of a degree Based on a system of four gears the rotation of an index on one quadrant corresponds to rotations of another index on an opposite quadrant Thanks to this machine errors in the calculation of first second third and quarter degrees can be avoided Guidobaldo is the first to document the use of gears for mechanical calculation br Wilhelm Schickard a German polymath designed a calculating machine in which combined a mechanized form of Napier s rods with the world s first mechanical adding machine built into the base Because it made use of a single tooth gear there were circumstances in which its carry mechanism would jam A fire destroyed at least one of the machines in and it is believed Schickard was too disheartened to build another br br In while still a teenager Blaise Pascal started some pioneering work on calculating machines and after three years of effort and prototypes he invented a mechanical calculator He built twenty of these machines called Pascal s calculator or Pascaline in the following ten years Nine Pascalines have survived most of which are on display in European museums A continuing debate exists over whether Schickard or Pascal should be regarded as the inventor of the mechanical calculator and the range of issues to be considered is discussed elsewhere br br Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz invented the stepped reckoner and his famous stepped drum mechanism around He attempted to create a machine that could be used not only for addition and subtraction but would use a moveable carriage to enable multiplication and division Leibniz once said It is unworthy of excellent men to lose hours like slaves in the labour of calculation which could safely be relegated to anyone else if machines were used However Leibniz did not incorporate a fully successful carry mechanism Leibniz also described the binary numeral system a central ingredient of all modern computers However up to the s many subsequent designs including Charles Babbage s machines of and even ENIAC of were based on the decimal system br br Around Charles Xavier Thomas de Colmar created what would over the rest of the century become the first successful mass produced mechanical calculator the Thomas Arithmometer It could be used to add and subtract and with a moveable carriage the operator could also multiply and divide by a process of long multiplication and long division It utilised a stepped drum similar in conception to that invented by Leibniz Mechanical calculators remained in use until the s br br br Punched card data processing br In French weaver Joseph Marie Jacquard developed a loom in which the pattern being woven was controlled by a paper tape constructed from punched cards The paper tape could be changed without changing the mechanical design of the loom This was a landmark achievement in programmability His machine was an improvement over similar weaving looms Punched cards were preceded by punch bands as in the machine proposed by Basile Bouchon These bands would inspire information recording for automatic pianos and more recently numerical control machine tools br br In the late s the American Herman Hollerith invented data storage on punched cards that could then be read by a machine To process these punched cards he invented the tabulator and the keypunch machine His machines used electromechanical relays and counters Hollerith s method was used in the United States Census That census was processed two years faster than the prior census had been Hollerith s company eventually became the core of IBM br By electromechanical tabulating machines could add subtract and print accumulated totals Machine functions were directed by inserting dozens of wire jumpers into removable control panels When the United States instituted Social Security in IBM punched card systems were used to process records of million workers Punched cards became ubiquitous in industry and government for accounting and administration br Leslie Comrie s articles on punched card methods and W J Eckert s publication of Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation in described punched card techniques sufficiently advanced to solve some differential equations or perform multiplication and division using floating point representations all on punched cards and unit record machines Such machines were used during World War II for cryptographic statistical processing as well as a vast number of administrative uses The Astronomical Computing Bureau Columbia University performed astronomical calculations representing the state of the art in computing br br br Calculators br br By the th century earlier mechanical calculators cash registers accounting machines and so on were redesigned to use electric motors with gear position as the representation for the state of a variable The word computer was a job title assigned to primarily women who used these calculators to perform mathematical calculations By the s British scientist Lewis Fry Richardson s interest in weather prediction led him to propose human computers and numerical analysis to model the weather to this day the most powerful computers on Earth are needed to adequately model its weather using the Navier Stokes equations br Companies like Friden Marchant Calculator and Monroe made desktop mechanical calculators from the s that could add subtract multiply and divide In the Curta was introduced by Austrian inventor Curt Herzstark It was a small hand cranked mechanical calculator and as such a descendant of Gottfried Leibniz s Stepped Reckoner and Thomas Arithmometer br The world s first all electronic desktop calculator was the British Bell Punch ANITA released in It used vacuum tubes cold cathode tubes and Dekatrons in its circuits with cold cathode Nixie tubes for its display The ANITA sold well since it was the only electronic desktop calculator available and was silent and quick The tube technology was superseded in June by the U S manufactured Friden EC which had an all transistor design a stack of four digit numbers displayed on a inch cm CRT and introduced reverse Polish notation RPN br br br First proposed general purpose computing device br br Charles Babbage an English mechanical engineer and polymath originated the concept of a programmable computer though none of his designs were successfully implemented until Often regarded as the father of the computer he conceptualized and invented the first mechanical computer in the early th century After working on his revolutionary difference engine designed to aid in navigational calculations in he realized that a much more general design an Analytical Engine was possible The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the Jacquard loom For output the machine would have a printer a curve plotter and a bell The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later It employed ordinary base fixed point arithmetic br The Engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops and integrated memory making it the first design for a general purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing complete br There was to be a store that is a memory capable of holding numbers of decimal digits each ca kB An arithmetic unit the mill would be able to perform all four arithmetic operations plus comparisons and optionally square roots Initially it was conceived as a difference engine curved back upon itself in a generally circular layout with the long store exiting off to one side Later drawings depict a regularised grid layout Like the central processing unit CPU in a modern computer the mill would rely on its own internal procedures roughly equivalent to microcode in modern CPUs to be stored in the form of pegs inserted into rotating drums called barrels to carry out some of the more complex instructions the user s program might specify br br The programming language to be employed by users was akin to modern day assembly languages Loops and conditional branching were possible and so the language as conceived would have been Turing complete as later defined by Alan Turing Three different types of punch cards were used one for arithmetical operations one for numerical constants and one for load and store operations transferring numbers from the store to the arithmetical unit or back There were three separate readers for the three types of cards br The project was slowed by various problems including disputes with the chief machinist building parts for it All the parts for his machine had to be made by hand this was a major problem for a machine with thousands of parts Eventually the project was dissolved with the decision of the British Government to cease funding Babbage s failure to complete the analytical engine can be chiefly attributed to difficulties not only of politics and financing but also to his desire to develop an increasingly sophisticated computer and to move ahead faster than anyone else could follow Ada Lovelace translated and added notes to the Sketch of the Analytical Engine by Luigi Federico Menabrea This appears to be the first published description of programming so Ada Lovelace is widely regarded as the first computer programmer br Following Babbage although at first unaware of his earlier work was Percy Ludgate a clerk to a corn merchant in Dublin Ireland He independently designed a programmable mechanical computer which he described in a work that was published in br Two other inventors Leonardo Torres Quevedo and Vannevar Bush also did follow on research based on Babbage s work In Torres published Essays on Automatics where he wrote about Babbage s efforts at constructing a mechanical Analytical Engine and designed an electromechanical analytical machine which was to be controlled by a read only program The paper also introduced the idea of floating point arithmetic In he presented in a Paris conference the Electromechanical Arithmometer an arithmetic unit that could perform operations automatically Bush s paper Instrumental Analysis discussed using existing IBM punch card machines to implement Babbage s design In the same year he started the Rapid Arithmetical Machine project to investigate the problems of constructing an electronic digital computer br br br Analog computers br br In the first half of the th century analog computers were considered by many to be the future of computing These devices used the continuously changeable aspects of physical phenomena such as electrical mechanical or hydraulic quantities to model the problem being solved in contrast to digital computers that represented varying quantities symbolically as their numerical values change As an analog computer does not use discrete values but rather continuous values processes cannot be reliably repeated with exact equivalence as they can with Turing machines br The first modern analog computer was a tide predicting machine invented by Sir William Thomson later Lord Kelvin in It used a system of pulleys and wires to automatically calculate predicted tide levels for a set period at a particular location and was of great utility to navigation in shallow waters His device was the foundation for further developments in analog computing br The differential analyser a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration using wheel and disc mechanisms was conceptualized in by James Thomson the brother of the more famous Lord Kelvin He explored the possible construction of such calculators but was stymied by the limited output torque of the ball and disk integrators In a differential analyzer the output of one integrator drove the input of the next integrator or a graphing output br A notable series of analog calculating machines were developed by Leonardo Torres Quevedo since including one that was able to compute the roots of arbitrary polynomials of order eight including the complex ones with a precision down to thousandths br br An important advance in analog computing was the development of the first fire control systems for long range ship gunlaying When gunnery ranges increased dramatically in the late th century it was no longer a simple matter of calculating the proper aim point given the flight times of the shells Various spotters on board the ship would relay distance measures and observations to a central plotting station There the fire direction teams fed in the location speed and direction of the ship and its target as well as various adjustments for Coriolis effect weather effects on the air and other adjustments the computer would then output a firing solution which would be fed to the turrets for laying In British engineer Arthur Pollen developed the first electrically powered mechanical analogue computer called at the time the Argo Clock It was used by the Imperial Russian Navy in World War I The alternative Dreyer Table fire control system was fitted to British capital ships by mid br Mechanical devices were also used to aid the accuracy of aerial bombing Drift Sight was the first such aid developed by Harry Wimperis in for the Royal Naval Air Service it measured the wind speed from the air and used that measurement to calculate the wind s effects on the trajectory of the bombs The system was later improved with the Course Setting Bomb Sight and reached a climax with World War II bomb sights Mark XIV bomb sight RAF Bomber Command and the Norden United States Army Air Forces br The art of mechanical analog computing reached its zenith with the differential analyzer built by H L Hazen and Vannevar Bush at MIT starting in which built on the mechanical integrators of James Thomson and the torque amplifiers invented by H W Nieman A dozen of these devices were built before their obsolescence became obvious the most powerful was constructed at the University of Pennsylvania s Moore School of Electrical Engineering where the ENIAC was built br A fully electronic analog computer was built by Helmut H lzer in at Peenem nde Army Research Center br By the s the success of digital electronic computers had spelled the end for most analog computing machines but hybrid analog computers controlled by digital electronics remained in substantial use into the s and s and later in some specialized applications br br br Advent of the digital computer br br The principle of the modern computer was first described by computer scientist Alan Turing who set out the idea in his seminal paper On Computable Numbers Turing reformulated Kurt G del s results on the limits of proof and computation replacing G del s universal arithmetic based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines He proved that some such machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm He went on to prove that there was no solution to the Entscheidungsproblem by first showing that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable in general it is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a given Turing machine will ever halt br He also introduced the notion of a universal machine now known as a universal Turing machine with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other machine or in other words it is provably capable of computing anything that is computable by executing a program stored on tape allowing the machine to be programmable Von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper Turing machines are to this day a central object of study in theory of computation Except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores modern computers are said to be Turing complete which is to say they have algorithm execution capability equivalent to a universal Turing machine br br br Electromechanical computers br br The era of modern computing began with a flurry of development before and during World War II Most digital computers built in this period were built with electromechanical electric switches drove mechanical relays to perform the calculation These mechanical components had a low operating speed due to their mechanical nature and were eventually superseded by much faster all electric components originally using vacuum tubes and later transistors br The Z was one of the earliest examples of an electric operated digital computer built with electromechanical relays and was created by civil engineer Konrad Zuse in in Germany It was an improvement on his earlier mechanical Z although it used the same mechanical memory it replaced the arithmetic and control logic with electrical relay circuits br In the same year electro mechanical devices called bombes were built by British cryptologists to help decipher German Enigma machine encrypted secret messages during World War II The bombe s initial design was created in at the UK Government Code and Cypher School GC CS at Bletchley Park by Alan Turing with an important refinement devised in by Gordon Welchman The engineering design and construction was the work of Harold Keen of the British Tabulating Machine Company It was a substantial development from a device that had been designed in by Polish Cipher Bureau cryptologist Marian Rejewski and known as the cryptologic bomb Polish bomba kryptologiczna br br In Zuse followed his earlier machine up with the Z the world s first working electromechanical programmable fully automatic digital computer The Z was built with relays implementing a bit word length that operated at a clock frequency of about Hz Program code and data were stored on punched film It was quite similar to modern machines in some respects pioneering numerous advances such as floating point numbers Replacement of the hard to implement decimal system used in Charles Babbage s earlier design by the simpler binary system meant that Zuse s machines were easier to build and potentially more reliable given the technologies available at that time The Z was proven to have been a Turing complete machine in by Ra l Rojas In two patent applications Zuse also anticipated that machine instructions could be stored in the same storage used for data the key insight of what became known as the von Neumann architecture first implemented in in America in the electromechanical IBM SSEC and in Britain in the fully electronic Manchester Baby br Zuse suffered setbacks during World War II when some of his machines were destroyed in the course of Allied bombing campaigns Apparently his work remained largely unknown to engineers in the UK and US until much later although at least IBM was aware of it as it financed his post war startup company in in return for an option on Zuse s patents br In the Harvard Mark I was constructed at IBM s Endicott laboratories It was a similar general purpose electro mechanical computer to the Z but was not quite Turing complete br br br Digital computation br The term digital was first suggested by George Robert Stibitz and refers to where a signal such as a voltage is not used to directly represent a value as it would be in an analog computer but to encode it In November Stibitz then working at Bell Labs completed a relay based calculator he later dubbed the Model K for kitchen table on which he had assembled it which became the first binary adder Typically signals have two states low usually representing and high usually representing but sometimes three valued logic is used especially in high density memory Modern computers generally use binary logic but many early machines were decimal computers In these machines the basic unit of data was the decimal digit encoded in one of several schemes including binary coded decimal or BCD bi quinary excess and two out of five code br The mathematical basis of digital computing is Boolean algebra developed by the British mathematician George Boole in his work The Laws of Thought published in His Boolean algebra was further refined in the s by William Jevons and Charles Sanders Peirce and was first presented systematically by Ernst Schr der and A N Whitehead In Gottlob Frege develops the formal approach to logic and proposes the first logic language for logical equations br In the s and working independently American electronic engineer Claude Shannon and Soviet logician Victor Shestakov both showed a one to one correspondence between the concepts of Boolean logic and certain electrical circuits now called logic gates which are now ubiquitous in digital computers They showed that electronic relays and switches can realize the expressions of Boolean algebra This thesis essentially founded practical digital circuit design In addition Shannon s paper gives a correct circuit diagram for a bit digital binary adder br br br Electronic data processing br br Purely electronic circuit elements soon replaced their mechanical and electromechanical equivalents at the same time that digital calculation replaced analog Machines such as the Z the Atanasoff Berry Computer the Colossus computers and the ENIAC were built by hand using circuits containing relays or valves vacuum tubes and often used punched cards or punched paper tape for input and as the main non volatile storage medium br Engineer Tommy Flowers joined the telecommunications branch of the General Post Office in While working at the research station in Dollis Hill in the s he began to explore the possible use of electronics for the telephone exchange Experimental equipment that he built in went into operation years later converting a portion of the telephone exchange network into an electronic data processing system using thousands of vacuum tubes br In the US in Arthur Dickinson IBM invented the first digital electronic computer This calculating device was fully electronic control calculations and output the first electronic display John Vincent Atanasoff and Clifford E Berry of Iowa State University developed the Atanasoff Berry Computer ABC in the first binary electronic digital calculating device This design was semi electronic electro mechanical control and electronic calculations and used about vacuum tubes with capacitors fixed in a mechanically rotating drum for memory However its paper card writer reader was unreliable and the regenerative drum contact system was mechanical The machine s special purpose nature and lack of changeable stored program distinguish it from modern computers br Computers whose logic was primarily built using vacuum tubes are now known as first generation computers br br br The electronic programmable computer br br During World War II British codebreakers at Bletchley Park miles km north of London achieved a number of successes at breaking encrypted enemy military communications The German encryption machine Enigma was first attacked with the help of the electro mechanical bombes They ruled out possible Enigma settings by performing chains of logical deductions implemented electrically Most possibilities led to a contradiction and the few remaining could be tested by hand br The Germans also developed a series of teleprinter encryption systems quite different from Enigma The Lorenz SZ machine was used for high level Army communications code named Tunny by the British The first intercepts of Lorenz messages began in As part of an attack on Tunny Max Newman and his colleagues developed the Heath Robinson a fixed function machine to aid in code breaking Tommy Flowers a senior engineer at the Post Office Research Station was recommended to Max Newman by Alan Turing and spent eleven months from early February designing and building the more flexible Colossus computer which superseded the Heath Robinson After a functional test in December Colossus was shipped to Bletchley Park where it was delivered on January and attacked its first message on February By the time Germany surrendered in May there were ten Colossi working at Bletchley Park br br Colossus was the world s first electronic digital programmable computer It used a large number of valves vacuum tubes It had paper tape input and was capable of being configured to perform a variety of Boolean logical operations on its data but it was not Turing complete Data input to Colossus was by photoelectric reading of a paper tape transcription of the enciphered intercepted message This was arranged in a continuous loop so that it could be read and re read multiple times there being no internal store for the data The reading mechanism ran at characters per second with the paper tape moving at ft s m s mph Colossus Mark contained thermionic valves tubes but Mark with valves and five processors in parallel was both times faster and simpler to operate than Mark greatly speeding the decoding process Mark was designed while Mark was being constructed Allen Coombs took over leadership of the Colossus Mark project when Tommy Flowers moved on to other projects The first Mark Colossus became operational on June just in time for the Allied Invasion of Normandy on D Day br Most of the use of Colossus was in determining the start positions of the Tunny rotors for a message which was called wheel setting Colossus included the first ever use of shift registers and systolic arrays enabling five simultaneous tests each involving up to Boolean calculations This enabled five different possible start positions to be examined for one transit of the paper tape As well as wheel setting some later Colossi included mechanisms intended to help determine pin patterns known as wheel breaking Both models were programmable using switches and plug panels in a way their predecessors had not been br br Without the use of these machines the Allies would have been deprived of the very valuable intelligence that was obtained from reading the vast quantity of enciphered high level telegraphic messages between the German High Command OKW and their army commands throughout occupied Europe Details of their existence design and use were kept secret well into the s Winston Churchill personally issued an order for their destruction into pieces no larger than a man s hand to keep secret that the British were capable of cracking Lorenz SZ cyphers from German rotor stream cipher machines during the oncoming Cold War Two of the machines were transferred to the newly formed GCHQ and the others were destroyed As a result the machines were not included in many histories of computing A reconstructed working copy of one of the Colossus machines is now on display at Bletchley Park br The ENIAC Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer was the first electronic programmable computer built in the US Although the ENIAC used similar technology to the Colossi it was much faster and more flexible and was Turing complete Like the Colossi a program on the ENIAC was defined by the states of its patch cables and switches a far cry from the stored program electronic machines that came later Once a program was ready to be run it had to be mechanically set into the machine with manual resetting of plugs and switches The programmers of the ENIAC were women who had been trained as mathematicians br It combined the high speed of electronics with the ability to be programmed for many complex problems It could add or subtract times a second a thousand times faster than any other machine It also had modules to multiply divide and square root High speed memory was limited to words equivalent to about bytes Built under the direction of John Mauchly and J Presper Eckert at the University of Pennsylvania ENIAC s development and construction lasted from to full operation at the end of The machine was huge weighing tons using kilowatts of electric power and contained over vacuum tubes relays and hundreds of thousands of resistors capacitors and inductors One of its major engineering feats was to minimize the effects of tube burnout which was a common problem in machine reliability at that time The machine was in almost constant use for the next ten years br br br Stored program computer br br The theoretical basis for the stored program computer was proposed by Alan Turing in his paper On Computable Numbers Whilst Turing was at Princeton working on his PhD John von Neumann got to know him and became intrigued by his concept of a universal computing machine br Early computing machines executed the set sequence of steps known as a program that could be altered by changing electrical connections using switches or a patch panel or plugboard However this process of reprogramming was often difficult and time consuming requiring engineers to create flowcharts and physically re wire the machines Stored program computers by contrast were designed to store a set of instructions a program in memory typically the same memory as stored data br ENIAC inventors John Mauchly and J Presper Eckert proposed in August the construction of a machine called the Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer EDVAC and design work for it commenced at the University of Pennsylvania s Moore School of Electrical Engineering before the ENIAC was fully operational The design implemented a number of important architectural and logical improvements conceived during the ENIAC s construction and a high speed serial access memory However Eckert and Mauchly left the project and its construction floundered br In von Neumann visited the Moore School and wrote notes on what he saw which he sent to the project The U S Army liaison there had them typed and circulated as the First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC The draft did not mention Eckert and Mauchly and despite its incomplete nature and questionable lack of attribution of the sources of some of the ideas the computer architecture it outlined became known as the von Neumann architecture br In Turing joined the UK National Physical Laboratory and began work on developing an electronic stored program digital computer His late report Proposed Electronic Calculator was the first reasonably detailed specification for such a device Turing presented a more detailed paper to the National Physical Laboratory NPL Executive Committee in March giving the first substantially complete design of a stored program computer a device that was called the Automatic Computing Engine ACE br Turing considered that the speed and the size of computer memory were crucial elements p so he proposed a high speed memory of what would today be called KB accessed at a speed of MHz The ACE implemented subroutine calls whereas the EDVAC did not and the ACE also used Abbreviated Computer Instructions an early form of programming language br br br Manchester Baby br br The Manchester Baby Small Scale Experimental Machine SSEM was the world s first electronic stored program computer It was built at the Victoria University of Manchester by Frederic C Williams Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill and ran its first program on June br The machine was not intended to be a practical computer but was instead designed as a testbed for the Williams tube the first random access digital storage device Invented by Freddie Williams and Tom Kilburn at the University of Manchester in and it was a cathode ray tube that used an effect called secondary emission to temporarily store electronic binary data and was used successfully in several early computers br Described as small and primitive in a retrospective the Baby was the first working machine to contain all of the elements essential to a modern electronic computer As soon as it had demonstrated the feasibility of its design a project was initiated at the university to develop the design into a more usable computer the Manchester Mark The Mark in turn quickly became the prototype for the Ferranti Mark the world s first commercially available general purpose computer br The Baby had a bit word length and a memory of words As it was designed to be the simplest possible stored program computer the only arithmetic operations implemented in hardware were subtraction and negation other arithmetic operations were implemented in software The first of three programs written for the machine found the highest proper divisor of a calculation that was known would take a long time to run and so prove the computer s reliability by testing every integer from downwards as division was implemented by repeated subtraction of the divisor The program consisted of instructions and ran for minutes before reaching the correct answer of after the Baby had performed million operations for an effective CPU speed of kIPS The successive approximations to the answer were displayed as a pattern of dots on the output CRT which mirrored the pattern held on the Williams tube used for storage br br br Manchester Mark br The SSEM led to the development of the Manchester Mark at the University of Manchester Work began in August and the first version was operational by April a program written to search for Mersenne primes ran error free for nine hours on the night of June The machine s successful operation was widely reported in the British press which used the phrase electronic brain in describing it to their readers br The computer is especially historically significant because of its pioneering inclusion of index registers an innovation which made it easier for a program to read sequentially through an array of words in memory Thirty four patents resulted from the machine s development and many of the ideas behind its design were incorporated in subsequent commercial products such as the IBM and as well as the Ferranti Mark The chief designers Frederic C Williams and Tom Kilburn concluded from their experiences with the Mark that computers would be used more in scientific roles than in pure mathematics In they started development work on Meg the Mark s successor which would include a floating point unit br br br EDSAC br br The other contender for being the first recognizably modern digital stored program computer was the EDSAC designed and constructed by Maurice Wilkes and his team at the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in England at the University of Cambridge in The machine was inspired by John von Neumann s seminal First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC and was one of the first usefully operational electronic digital stored program computer br EDSAC ran its first programs on May when it calculated a table of squares and a list of prime numbers The EDSAC also served as the basis for the first commercially applied computer the LEO I used by food manufacturing company J Lyons Co Ltd EDSAC was finally shut down on July having been superseded by EDSAC which stayed in use until br br The brain computer may one day come down to our level of the common people and help with our income tax and book keeping calculations But this is speculation and there is no sign of it so far br br br EDVAC br br ENIAC inventors John Mauchly and J Presper Eckert proposed the EDVAC s construction in August and design work for the EDVAC commenced at the University of Pennsylvania s Moore School of Electrical Engineering before the ENIAC was fully operational The design implemented a number of important architectural and logical improvements conceived during the ENIAC s construction and a high speed serial access memory However Eckert and Mauchly left the project and its construction floundered br It was finally delivered to the U S Army s Ballistics Research Laboratory at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in August but due to a number of problems the computer only began operation in and then only on a limited basis br br br Commercial computers br The first commercial computer was the Ferranti Mark built by Ferranti and delivered to the University of Manchester in February It was based on the Manchester Mark The main improvements over the Manchester Mark were in the size of the primary storage using random access Williams tubes secondary storage using a magnetic drum a faster multiplier and additional instructions The basic cycle time was milliseconds and a multiplication could be completed in about milliseconds The multiplier used almost a quarter of the machine s vacuum tubes valves A second machine was purchased by the University of Toronto before the design was revised into the Mark Star At least seven of these later machines were delivered between and one of them to Shell labs in Amsterdam br In October the directors of J Lyons Company a British catering company famous for its teashops but with strong interests in new office management techniques decided to take an active role in promoting the commercial development of computers The LEO I computer Lyons Electronic Office became operational in April and ran the world s first regular routine office computer job On November the J Lyons company began weekly operation of a bakery valuations job on the LEO the first business application to go live on a stored program computer br In June the UNIVAC I Universal Automatic Computer was delivered to the U S Census Bureau Remington Rand eventually sold machines at more than US million each million as of UNIVAC was the first mass produced computer It used vacuum tubes and consumed kW of power Its primary storage was serial access mercury delay lines capable of storing words of decimal digits plus sign bit words br In Compagnie des Machines Bull released the Gamma computer which became a large success in Europe eventually selling more than units and the first computer produced in more than units The Gamma had innovative features for its time including a dual mode software switchable BCD and binary ALU as well as a hardwired floating point library for scientific computing In its E T configuration the Gamma drum memory could fit about instructions for a capacity of words around kB a large amount for the time br br Compared to the UNIVAC IBM introduced a smaller more affordable computer in that proved very popular The IBM weighed over kg the attached power supply weighed around kg and both were held in separate cabinets of roughly m The system cost US million as of or could be leased for US a month as of Its drum memory was originally ten digit words later expanded to words Memory limitations such as this were to dominate programming for decades afterward The program instructions were fetched from the spinning drum as the code ran Efficient execution using drum memory was provided by a combination of hardware architecture the instruction format included the address of the next instruction and software the Symbolic Optimal Assembly Program SOAP assigned instructions to the optimal addresses to the extent possible by static analysis of the source program Thus many instructions were when needed located in the next row of the drum to be read and additional wait time for drum rotation was reduced br br br Microprogramming br In British scientist Maurice Wilkes developed the concept of microprogramming from the realisation that the central processing unit of a computer could be controlled by a miniature highly specialized computer program in high speed ROM Microprogramming allows the base instruction set to be defined or extended by built in programs now called firmware or microcode This concept greatly simplified CPU development He first described this at the University of Manchester Computer Inaugural Conference in then published in expanded form in IEEE Spectrum in br It was widely used in the CPUs and floating point units of mainframe and other computers it was implemented for the first time in EDSAC which also used multiple identical bit slices to simplify design Interchangeable replaceable tube assemblies were used for each bit of the processor br br br Magnetic memory br br Magnetic drum memories were developed for the US Navy during WW II with the work continuing at Engineering Research Associates ERA in and ERA then a part of Univac included a drum memory in its announced in February The first mass produced computer the IBM also announced in had about kilobytes of drum memory br Magnetic core memory patented in with its first usage demonstrated for the Whirlwind computer in August Commercialization followed quickly Magnetic core was used in peripherals of the IBM delivered in July and later in the itself The IBM and the Ferranti Mercury used magnetic core memory It went on to dominate the field into the s when it was replaced with semiconductor memory Magnetic core peaked in volume about and declined in usage and market share thereafter br As late as PDP machines using magnetic core main memory and drums for swapping were still in use at many of the original UNIX sites br br br Early digital computer characteristics br br br Transistor computers br br The bipolar transistor was invented in From onward transistors replaced vacuum tubes in computer designs giving rise to the second generation of computers Compared to vacuum tubes transistors have many advantages they are smaller and require less power than vacuum tubes so give off less heat Silicon junction transistors were much more reliable than vacuum tubes and had longer service life Transistorized computers could contain tens of thousands of binary logic circuits in a relatively compact space Transistors greatly reduced computers size initial cost and operating cost Typically second generation computers were composed of large numbers of printed circuit boards such as the IBM Standard Modular System each carrying one to four logic gates or flip flops br At the University of Manchester a team under the leadership of Tom Kilburn designed and built a machine using the newly developed transistors instead of valves Initially the only devices available were germanium point contact transistors less reliable than the valves they replaced but which consumed far less power Their first transistorized computer and the first in the world was operational by and a second version was completed there in April The version used transistors solid state diodes and had a power consumption of watts However the machine did make use of valves to generate its kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its magnetic drum memory so it was not the first completely transistorized computer br That distinction goes to the Harwell CADET of built by the electronics division of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell The design featured a kilobyte magnetic drum memory store with multiple moving heads that had been designed at the National Physical Laboratory UK By this team had transistor circuits operating to read and write on a smaller magnetic drum from the Royal Radar Establishment The machine used a low clock speed of only kHz to avoid having to use any valves to generate the clock waveforms br CADET used point contact transistors provided by the UK company Standard Telephones and Cables junction transistors were used for the first stage amplifiers for data read from the drum since point contact transistors were too noisy From August CADET was offering a regular computing service during which it often executed continuous computing runs of hours or more Problems with the reliability of early batches of point contact and alloyed junction transistors meant that the machine s mean time between failures was about minutes but this improved once the more reliable bipolar junction transistors became available br The Manchester University Transistor Computer s design was adopted by the local engineering firm of Metropolitan Vickers in their Metrovick the first commercial transistor computer anywhere Six Metrovick s were built the first completed in They were successfully deployed within various departments of the company and were in use for about five years A second generation computer the IBM captured about one third of the world market IBM installed more than ten thousand s between and br br br Transistor peripherals br Transistorized electronics improved not only the CPU Central Processing Unit but also the peripheral devices The second generation disk data storage units were able to store tens of millions of letters and digits Next to the fixed disk storage units connected to the CPU via high speed data transmission were removable disk data storage units A removable disk pack can be easily exchanged with another pack in a few seconds Even if the removable disks capacity is smaller than fixed disks their interchangeability guarantees a nearly unlimited quantity of data close at hand Magnetic tape provided archival capability for this data at a lower cost than disk br Many second generation CPUs delegated peripheral device communications to a secondary processor For example while the communication processor controlled card reading and punching the main CPU executed calculations and binary branch instructions One databus would bear data between the main CPU and core memory at the CPU s fetch execute cycle rate and other databusses would typically serve the peripheral devices On the PDP the core memory s cycle time was microseconds consequently most arithmetic instructions took microseconds operations per second because most operations took at least two memory cycles one for the instruction one for the operand data fetch br During the second generation remote terminal units often in the form of Teleprinters like a Friden Flexowriter saw greatly increased use Telephone connections provided sufficient speed for early remote terminals and allowed hundreds of kilometers separation between remote terminals and the computing center Eventually these stand alone computer networks would be generalized into an interconnected network of networks the Internet br br br Transistor supercomputers br br The early s saw the advent of supercomputing The Atlas was a joint development between the University of Manchester Ferranti and Plessey and was first installed at Manchester University and officially commissioned in as one of the world s first supercomputers considered to be the most powerful computer in the world at that time It was said that whenever Atlas went offline half of the United Kingdom s computer capacity was lost It was a second generation machine using discrete germanium transistors Atlas also pioneered the Atlas Supervisor considered by many to be the first recognisable modern operating system br In the US a series of computers at Control Data Corporation CDC were designed by Seymour Cray to use innovative designs and parallelism to achieve superior computational peak performance The CDC released in is generally considered the first supercomputer The CDC outperformed its predecessor the IBM Stretch by about a factor of With performance of about megaFLOPS the CDC was the world s fastest computer from to when it relinquished that status to its successor the CDC br br br Integrated circuit computers br br The third generation of digital electronic computers used integrated circuit IC chips as the basis of their logic br The idea of an integrated circuit was conceived by a radar scientist working for the Royal Radar Establishment of the Ministry of Defence Geoffrey W A Dummer br The first working integrated circuits were invented by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor Kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in July successfully demonstrating the first working integrated example on September Kilby s invention was a hybrid integrated circuit hybrid IC It had external wire connections which made it difficult to mass produce br Noyce came up with his own idea of an integrated circuit half a year after Kilby Noyce s invention was a monolithic integrated circuit IC chip His chip solved many practical problems that Kilby s had not Produced at Fairchild Semiconductor it was made of silicon whereas Kilby s chip was made of germanium The basis for Noyce s monolithic IC was Fairchild s planar process which allowed integrated circuits to be laid out using the same principles as those of printed circuits The planar process was developed by Noyce s colleague Jean Hoerni in early based on Mohamed M Atalla s work on semiconductor surface passivation by silicon dioxide at Bell Labs in the late s br Third generation integrated circuit computers first appeared in the early s in computers developed for government purposes and then in commercial computers beginning in the mid s The first silicon IC computer was the Apollo Guidance Computer or AGC Although not the most powerful computer of its time the extreme constraints on size mass and power of the Apollo spacecraft required the AGC to be much smaller and denser than any prior computer weighing in at only pounds kg Each lunar landing mission carried two AGCs one each in the command and lunar ascent modules br br br Semiconductor memory br br The MOSFET metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor or MOS transistor was invented by Mohamed M Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in In addition to data processing the MOSFET enabled the practical use of MOS transistors as memory cell storage elements a function previously served by magnetic cores Semiconductor memory also known as MOS memory was cheaper and consumed less power than magnetic core memory MOS random access memory RAM in the form of static RAM SRAM was developed by John Schmidt at Fairchild Semiconductor in In Robert Dennard at the IBM Thomas J Watson Research Center developed MOS dynamic RAM DRAM In Dawon Kahng and Simon Sze at Bell Labs developed the floating gate MOSFET the basis for MOS non volatile memory such as EPROM EEPROM and flash memory br br br Microprocessor computers br br The fourth generation of digital electronic computers used microprocessors as the basis of their logic The microprocessor has origins in the MOS integrated circuit MOS IC chip Due to rapid MOSFET scaling MOS IC chips rapidly increased in complexity at a rate predicted by Moore s law leading to large scale integration LSI with hundreds of transistors on a single MOS chip by the late s The application of MOS LSI chips to computing was the basis for the first microprocessors as engineers began recognizing that a complete computer processor could be contained on a single MOS LSI chip br The subject of exactly which device was the first microprocessor is contentious partly due to lack of agreement on the exact definition of the term microprocessor The earliest multi chip microprocessors were the Four Phase Systems AL in and Garrett AiResearch MP in developed with multiple MOS LSI chips The first single chip microprocessor was the Intel developed on a single PMOS LSI chip It was designed and realized by Ted Hoff Federico Faggin Masatoshi Shima and Stanley Mazor at Intel and released in Tadashi Sasaki and Masatoshi Shima at Busicom a calculator manufacturer had the initial insight that the CPU could be a single MOS LSI chip supplied by Intel br br While the earliest microprocessor ICs literally contained only the processor i e the central processing unit of a computer their progressive development naturally led to chips containing most or all of the internal electronic parts of a computer The integrated circuit in the image on the right for example an Intel is an bit microcontroller that includes a CPU running at MHz bytes of RAM bytes of EPROM and I O in the same chip br During the s there was considerable overlap between second and third generation technologies IBM implemented its IBM Solid Logic Technology modules in hybrid circuits for the IBM System in As late as Sperry Univac continued the manufacture of second generation machines such as the UNIVAC The Burroughs large systems such as the B were stack machines which allowed for simpler programming These pushdown automatons were also implemented in minicomputers and microprocessors later which influenced programming language design Minicomputers served as low cost computer centers for industry business and universities It became possible to simulate analog circuits with the simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis or SPICE on minicomputers one of the programs for electronic design automation EDA The microprocessor led to the development of microcomputers small low cost computers that could be owned by individuals and small businesses Microcomputers the first of which appeared in the s became ubiquitous in the s and beyond br br While which specific product is considered the first microcomputer system is a matter of debate one of the earliest is R E s Micral N Fran ois Gernelle Andr Truong launched early using the Intel The first commercially available microcomputer kit was the Intel based Altair which was announced in the January cover article of Popular Electronics However the Altair was an extremely limited system in its initial stages having only bytes of DRAM in its initial package and no input output except its toggle switches and LED register display Despite this it was initially surprisingly popular with several hundred sales in the first year and demand rapidly outstripped supply Several early third party vendors such as Cromemco and Processor Technology soon began supplying additional S bus hardware for the Altair br In April at the Hannover Fair Olivetti presented the P the world s first complete pre assembled personal computer system The central processing unit consisted of two cards code named PUCE and PUCE and unlike most other personal computers was built with TTL components rather than a microprocessor It had one or two floppy disk drives a character plasma display column graphical thermal printer Kbytes of RAM and BASIC language It weighed kg lb As a complete system this was a significant step from the Altair though it never achieved the same success It was in competition with a similar product by IBM that had an external floppy disk drive br From to most microcomputers such as the MOS Technology KIM the Altair and some versions of the Apple I were sold as kits for do it yourselfers Pre assembled systems did not gain much ground until with the introduction of the Apple II the Tandy TRS the first SWTPC computers and the Commodore PET Computing has evolved with microcomputer architectures with features added from their larger brethren now dominant in most market segments br A NeXT Computer and its object oriented development tools and libraries were used by Tim Berners Lee and Robert Cailliau at CERN to develop the world s first web server software CERN httpd and also used to write the first web browser WorldWideWeb br Systems as complicated as computers require very high reliability ENIAC remained on in continuous operation from to for eight years before being shut down Although a vacuum tube might fail it would be replaced without bringing down the system By the simple strategy of never shutting down ENIAC the failures were dramatically reduced The vacuum tube SAGE air defense computers became remarkably reliable installed in pairs one off line tubes likely to fail did so when the computer was intentionally run at reduced power to find them Hot pluggable hard disks like the hot pluggable vacuum tubes of yesteryear continue the tradition of repair during continuous operation Semiconductor memories routinely have no errors when they operate although operating systems like Unix have employed memory tests on start up to detect failing hardware Today the requirement of reliable performance is made even more stringent when server farms are the delivery platform Google has managed this by using fault tolerant software to recover from hardware failures and is even working on the concept of replacing entire server farms on the fly during a service event br In the st century multi core CPUs became commercially available Content addressable memory CAM has become inexpensive enough to be used in networking and is frequently used for on chip cache memory in modern microprocessors although no computer system has yet implemented hardware CAMs for use in programming languages Currently CAMs or associative arrays in software are programming language specific Semiconductor memory cell arrays are very regular structures and manufacturers prove their processes on them this allows price reductions on memory products During the s CMOS logic gates developed into devices that could be made as fast as other circuit types computer power consumption could therefore be decreased dramatically Unlike the continuous current draw of a gate based on other logic types a CMOS gate only draws significant current except for leakage during the transition between logic states br CMOS circuits have allowed computing to become a commodity which is now ubiquitous embedded in many forms from greeting cards and telephones to satellites The thermal design power which is dissipated during operation has become as essential as computing speed of operation In servers consumed of the total energy budget of the U S The energy consumption of computer data centers was expected to double to of world consumption by The SoC system on a chip has compressed even more of the integrated circuitry into a single chip SoCs are enabling phones and PCs to converge into single hand held wireless mobile devices br Quantum computing is an emerging technology in the field of computing MIT Technology Review reported November that IBM has created a qubit computer currently its quantum state lasts microseconds Google researchers have been able to extend the microsecond time limit as reported July in Nature stability has been extended fold by spreading a single logical qubit over chains of data qubits for quantum error correction Physical Review X reported a technique for single gate sensing as a viable readout method for spin qubits a singlet triplet spin state in silicon on November A Google team has succeeded in operating their RF pulse modulator chip at kelvins simplifying the cryogenics of their qubit computer which is set up to operate at K but the readout circuitry and another driver remain to be brought into the cryogenics See Quantum supremacy Silicon qubit systems have demonstrated entanglement at non local distances br Computing hardware and its software have even become a metaphor for the operation of the universe br br br Epilogue br An indication of the rapidity of development of this field can be inferred from the history of the seminal article by Burks Goldstine and von Neumann By the time that anyone had time to write anything down it was obsolete After others read John von Neumann s
