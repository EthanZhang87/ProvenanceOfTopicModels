title: Parallel port
id: 100616
In computing a parallel port is a type of interface found on early computers personal and otherwise for connecting peripherals The name refers to the way the data is sent parallel ports send multiple bits of data at once parallel communication as opposed to serial communication in which bits are sent one at a time To do this parallel ports require multiple data lines in their cables and port connectors and tend to be larger than contemporary serial ports which only require one data line br There are many types of parallel ports but the term has become most closely associated with the printer port or Centronics port found on most personal computers from the s through the s It was an industry de facto standard for many years and was finally standardized as IEEE in the late s which defined the Enhanced Parallel Port EPP and Extended Capability Port ECP bi directional versions Today the parallel port interface is virtually non existent in new computers because of the rise of Universal Serial Bus USB devices along with network printing using Ethernet and Wi Fi connected printers br The parallel port interface was originally known as the Parallel Printer Adapter on IBM PC compatible computers It was primarily designed to operate printers that used IBM s eight bit extended ASCII character set to print text but could also be used to adapt other peripherals Graphical printers along with a host of other devices have been designed to communicate with the system br br br History br br br Centronics br An Wang Robert Howard and Prentice Robinson began development of a low cost printer at Centronics a subsidiary of Wang Laboratories that produced specialty computer terminals The printer used the dot matrix printing principle with a print head consisting of a vertical row of seven metal pins connected to solenoids When power was applied to the solenoids the pin was pushed forward to strike the paper and leave a dot To make a complete character glyph the print head would receive power to specified pins to create a single vertical pattern then the print head would move to the right by a small amount and the process repeated On their original design a typical glyph was printed as a matrix seven high and five wide while the A models used a print head with pins and formed glyphs that were by br This left the problem of sending the ASCII data to the printer While a serial port does so with the minimum of pins and wires it requires the device to buffer up the data as it arrives bit by bit and turn it back into multi bit values A parallel port makes this simpler the entire ASCII value is presented on the pins in complete form In addition to the eight data pins the system also needed various control pins as well as electrical grounds Wang happened to have a surplus stock of Amphenol pin micro ribbon connectors that were originally used for one of their early calculators The interface only required of these pins the rest were grounded or not connected The connector has become so closely associated with Centronics that it is now popularly known as the Centronics connector br The Centronics Model printer featuring this connector was released in The host sent ASCII characters to the printer using seven of eight data pins pulling them high to V to represent a When the data was ready the host pulled the STROBE pin low to V The printer responded by pulling the BUSY line high printing the character and then returning BUSY to low again The host could then send another character Control characters in the data caused other actions like the CR or EOF The host could also have the printer automatically start a new line by pulling the AUTOFEED line high and keeping it there The host had to carefully watch the BUSY line to ensure it did not feed data to the printer too rapidly especially given variable time operations like a paper feed br The printer side of the interface quickly became an industry de facto standard but manufacturers used various connectors on the system side so a variety of cables were required For example NCR used the pin micro ribbon connector on both ends of the connection early VAX systems used a DC connector Texas Instruments used a pin card edge connector and Data General used a pin micro ribbon connector When IBM implemented the parallel interface on the IBM PC they used the DB F connector at the PC end of the interface creating the now familiar parallel cable with a DB M at one end and a pin micro ribbon connector at the other br In theory the Centronics port could transfer data as rapidly as characters per second This was far faster than the printer which averaged about characters per second meaning the port spent much of its time idle The performance was defined by how rapidly the host could respond to the printer s BUSY signal asking for more data To improve performance printers began incorporating buffers so the host could send them data more rapidly in bursts This not only reduced or eliminated delays due to latency waiting for the next character to arrive from the host but also freed the host to perform other operations without causing a loss of performance Performance was further improved by using the buffer to store several lines and then printing in both directions eliminating the delay while the print head returned to the left side of the page Such changes more than doubled the performance of an otherwise unchanged printer as was the case on Centronics models like the and br br br IBM br IBM released the IBM Personal Computer in and included a variant of the Centronics interface only IBM logo printers rebranded from Epson could be used with the IBM PC IBM standardized the parallel cable with a DB F connector on the PC side and the pin Centronics connector on the printer side Vendors soon released printers compatible with both standard Centronics and the IBM implementation br The original IBM parallel printer adapter for the IBM PC of was designed to support limited bidirectionality with lines of data output and lines of data input This allowed the port to be used for other purposes not just output to a printer This was accomplished by allowing the data lines to be written to by devices on either end of the cable which required the ports on the host to be bidirectional This feature saw little use and was removed in later revisions of the hardware Years later in IBM reintroduced the bidirectional interface with its IBM PS series where it could be enabled or disabled for compatibility with applications hardwired not to expect a printer port to be bidirectional br br br Bi Tronics br As the printer market expanded new types of printing mechanisms appeared These often supported new features and error conditions that could not be represented on the existing port s relatively few status pins While the IBM solution could support this it was not trivial to implement and was not at that time being supported This led to the Bi Tronics system introduced by HP on their LaserJet Si in April This used four existing status pins ERROR SELECT PE and BUSY to represent a nibble using two transfers to send an bit value Bi Tronics mode now known as nibble mode was indicated by the host pulling the SELECT line high and data was transferred when the host toggles the AUTOFEED low Other changes in the handshaking protocols improved performance reaching cps to the printer and about cps back to the host A major advantage of the Bi Tronics system is that it can be driven entirely in software in the host and uses otherwise unmodified hardware all the pins used for data transfer back to the host were already printer to host lines br br br EPP and ECP br The introduction of new devices like scanners and multi function printers demanded much more performance than either the Bi Tronics or IBM style backchannels could handle Two other standards have become more popular for these purposes The Enhanced Parallel Port EPP originally defined by Zenith Electronics is similar to IBM s byte mode in concept but changes details of the handshaking to allow up to MB s The Extended Capability Port ECP is essentially an entirely new port in the same physical housing that also adds direct memory access based on ISA and run length encoding to compress the data which is especially useful when transferring simple images like faxes or black and white scanned images ECP offers performance up to MB s in both directions br All of these enhancements are collected as part of the IEEE standard The first release in included original Centronics mode compatibility mode nibble and byte modes as well as a change to the handshaking that was already widely used the original Centronics implementation called for the BUSY lead to toggle with each change on any line of data busy by line whereas IEEE calls for BUSY to toggle with each received character busy by character This reduces the number of BUSY toggles and the resulting interruptions on both sides A update standardized the printer status codes In the EPP and ECP modes were moved into the standard as well as several connector and cable styles and a method for daisy chaining up to eight devices from a single port br Some host systems or print servers may use a strobe signal with a relatively low voltage output or a fast toggle Any of these issues might cause no or intermittent printing missing or repeated characters or garbage printing Some printer models may have a switch or setting to set busy by character others may require a handshake adapter br br br Dataproducts br Dataproducts introduced a very different implementation of the parallel interface for their printers It used a DC connector on the host side and a pin connector on the printer side either a DD sometimes incorrectly referred to as a DB or the block shaped M connector the M was also referred to as Winchester Dataproducts parallel was available in a short line for connections up to feet m and a long line version using differential signaling for connections to feet m The Dataproducts interface was found on many mainframe systems up through the s and many printer manufacturers offered the Dataproducts interface as an option br A wide variety of devices were eventually designed to operate on a parallel port Most devices were uni directional one way devices only meant to respond to information sent from the PC However some devices such as Zip drives were able to operate in bi directional mode Printers also eventually took up the bi directional system allowing various status report information to be sent br br br Historical uses br br Before the advent of USB the parallel interface was adapted to access a number of peripheral devices other than printers One early use of the parallel port was for dongles used as hardware keys which were supplied with application software as a form of software copy protection Other uses included optical disc drives such as CD readers and writers Zip drives scanners tape drives external modems gamepads and joysticks Some of the earliest portable MP players required a parallel port connection for transferring songs to the device Adapters were available to run SCSI devices via parallel Other devices such as EPROM programmers and hardware controllers could be connected via the parallel port br br br Interfaces br Most PC compatible systems in the s and s had one to three ports with communication interfaces defined like this br br Logical parallel port I O port x BC IRQ usually in monochrome graphics adapters br Logical parallel port I O port x IRQ dedicated IO cards or using a controller built into the mainboard br Logical parallel port I O port x IRQ dedicated IO cards or using a controller built into the mainboard br If no printer port is present at x BC the second port in the row x becomes logical parallel port and x becomes logical parallel port for the BIOS Sometimes printer ports are jumpered to share an interrupt despite having their own IO addresses i e only one can be used interrupt driven at a time In some cases the BIOS supports a fourth printer port as well but the base address for it differs significantly between vendors Since the reserved entry for a fourth logical printer port in the BIOS Data Area BDA is shared with other uses on PS machines and with S compatible graphics cards it typically requires special drivers in most environments br Under DR DOS the BIOS port assignments can be changed and overridden using the LPT LPT LPT and optionally LPT CONFIG SYS directives br br br Access br DOS based systems make the logical parallel ports detected by the BIOS available under device names such as LPT LPT or LPT corresponding with logical parallel port and respectively These names derive from terms like Line Print Terminal Local Print Terminal both abbreviated as LPT or Line Printer A similar naming convention was used on ITS DEC systems as well as in CP M and DOS LST br In DOS the parallel printers could be accessed directly on the command line For example the command TYPE C AUTOEXEC BAT LPT would redirect the contents of the AUTOEXEC BAT file to the printer port A PRN device was also available as an alias for LPT Some operating systems like Multiuser DOS allow to change this fixed assignment by different means Some DOS versions use resident driver extensions provided by MODE or users can change the mapping internally via a CONFIG SYS PRN n directive as under DR DOS and higher DR DOS also provides optional built in support for LPT if the underlying BIOS supports it br PRN along with CON AUX and a few others are invalid file and directory names in DOS and Windows even on Windows XP and later This set of invalid file and directory names also affects Windows and which had an MS DOS device in path name vulnerability in which it causes the computer to crash if the user types C CON CON C PRN PRN or C AUX AUX in the Windows Explorer address bar or via the Run command Microsoft has since released a patch to fix this issue however fresh installs of Windows and are not patched with this fix and will still have this issue br A special PRINT command also existed to achieve the same effect Microsoft Windows still refers to the ports in this manner in many cases though this is often fairly hidden br In SCO UNIX and Linux the first parallel port is available via the filesystem as dev lp Linux IDE devices can use a paride parallel port IDE driver br br br Notable consumer products br br The Iomega ZIP drive br The Snappy Video SnapShot video capture device br MS DOS s INTERLNK and INTERSRV drive sharing utility br The Covox Speech Thing audio device br The OPL LPT and OPL LPT audio devices br br br Current use br For consumers USB and computer networks have replaced the parallel printer port for connections both to printers and to other devices br Many manufacturers of personal computers and laptops consider parallel to be a legacy port and no longer include the parallel interface Smaller machines have less room for large parallel port connectors USB to parallel adapters are available that can make parallel only printers work with USB only systems br There are PCI and PCI express cards that provide parallel ports There are also some print servers that provide an interface to parallel ports through a network USB to EPP chips can also allow other non printer devices to continue to work on modern computers without a parallel port br For electronics hobbyists the parallel port is still often the easiest way to connect to an external circuit board It is faster than the other common legacy port serial port requires no serial to parallel converter and requires far less interface logic and software than a USB target interface However Microsoft operating systems later than Windows prevent user programs from directly writing to or reading from the LPT without additional software kernel extensions br Older CNC Milling Machines also often make use of the parallel port to directly control the machine s motors and attachments br br br IBM PC implementation br br br Port addresses br Traditionally IBM PC systems have allocated their first three parallel ports according to the configuration in the table below if all three printer ports exist br br If there is an unused slot the port addresses of the others are moved up For example if a port at x BC does not exist the port at x will then become the first logical parallel port The base address x BC is typically supported by printer ports on MDA and Hercules display adapters whereas printer ports provided by the mainboard chipset or add on cards rarely allow to be configured to this base address Therefore in absence of a monochrome display adapter a common assignment for the first logical parallel port and therefore also for the corresponding LPT DOS device driver today is x even though the default is still x BC and would be selected by the BIOS if it detects a printer port at this address The IRQ lines are typically configurable in the hardware as well Assigning the same interrupt to more than one printer port should be avoided and will typically cause one of the corresponding ports to work in polled mode only The port addresses assigned to slot can be determined by reading the BIOS Data Area BDA at h h br Bit to pin mapping for the Standard Parallel Port SPP br br indicates a hardware inversion of the bit br br br Program interface br In versions of Windows that did not use the Windows NT kernel as well as DOS and some other operating systems programs could access the parallel port with simple outportb and inportb subroutine commands In operating systems such as Windows NT and Unix NetBSD FreeBSD Solaris BSD etc the microprocessor is operated in a different security ring and access to the parallel port is prohibited unless using the required driver This improves security and arbitration of device contention On Linux inb and outb can be used when a process is run as root and an ioperm command is used to allow access to its base address alternatively ppdev allows shared access and can be used from userspace if the appropriate permissions are set br The cross platform library for parallel port access libieee also is available on many Linux distributions and provides an abstract interface to the parallel ports of the system Access is handled in an open claim release close sequence which allows for concurrent access in userspace br br br Pinouts br The older parallel printer ports had an bit data bus and four pins for control output Strobe Linefeed Initialize and Select In and five more for control input ACK Busy Select Error and Paper Out Its data transfer speed is at kB s br The newer EPPs Enhanced Parallel Ports have an bit data bus and the same control pins as the normal parallel printer port Newer ports reach speeds of up to MB s br Pinouts for parallel port connectors are br br
