Blu ray Blu ray Disc or BD is a digital optical disc data storage format designed to supersede the DVD format It was invented and developed in and released worldwide on June capable of storing several hours of high definition video HDTV p and p The main application of Blu ray is as a medium for video material such as feature films and for the physical distribution of video games for the PlayStation PlayStation PlayStation Xbox One and Xbox Series X The name refers to the blue laser actually a violet laser used to read the disc which allows information to be stored at a greater density than is possible with the longer wavelength red laser used for DVDs br The polycarbonate disc is centimetres inches in diameter and millimetres inch thick the same size as DVDs and CDs Conventional or pre BD XL Blu ray Discs contain GB per layer with dual layer discs GB being the industry standard for feature length video discs Triple layer discs GB and quadruple layer discs GB are available for BD XL re writer drives br While the DVD Video specification has a maximum resolution of p NTSC pixels or p PAL pixels the initial Blu ray specification defined a maximum resolution of p pixels at up to progressive or interlaced frames per second Revisions to the specification allowed newer Blu ray players to support videos with a resolution of pixels with Ultra HD Blu ray players extending the maximum resolution to K pixels and progressive frame rates up to frames per second Aside from a K resolution pixels Blu ray format exclusive to Japan videos with non standard resolutions must use letterboxing to conform to a resolution supported by the Blu ray specification Besides these hardware specifications Blu ray is associated with a set of multimedia formats br The BD format was developed by the Blu ray Disc Association a group representing makers of consumer electronics computer hardware and motion pictures Sony unveiled the first Blu ray Disc prototypes in October and the first prototype player was released in Japan in April Afterward it continued to be developed until its official worldwide release on June beginning the high definition optical disc format war where Blu ray Disc competed with the HD DVD format Toshiba the main company supporting HD DVD conceded in February and later released its own Blu ray Disc player in late According to Media Research high definition software sales in the United States were slower in the first two years than DVD software sales Blu ray s competition includes video on demand VOD and DVD In January of U S broadband households had a Blu ray player br br br History br br br Early history br The information density of the DVD format was limited by the wavelength of the laser diodes used Following protracted development blue laser diodes operating at nanometers became available on a production basis allowing for development of a denser storage format that could hold higher definition media with prototype discs made with diodes at a slightly longer wavelength of nanometers in October Sony commenced two projects in collaboration with Panasonic Philips and TDK applying the new diodes UDO Ultra Density Optical and DVR Blue together with Pioneer a format of rewritable discs that would eventually become Blu ray Disc more specifically BD RE The core technologies of the formats are similar The first DVR Blue prototypes were unveiled by Sony at the CEATEC exhibition in October A trademark for the Blue Disc logo was filed on February On February the project was officially announced as Blu ray Disc and Blu ray Disc Founders was founded by the nine initial members br The first consumer device arrived in stores on April the Sony BDZ S a US BD RE recorder that was made available only in Japan However there was no standard for pre recorded video and no movies were released for this player Hollywood studios insisted that players be equipped with digital rights management before they would release movies for the new format and they wanted a new DRM system that would be more secure than the failed Content Scramble System CSS used on DVDs On October the name Blu ray Disc Founders was officially changed to the Blu ray Disc Association BDA and th Century Fox joined the BDA s Board of Directors The Blu ray Disc physical specifications were completed in The recording layer on which the data is stored lies under a millimeter protective layer and on top of a millimeter substrate made of polycarbonate plastic Sony also announced in April a version using paper as the substrate developed with Toppan Printing with up to GB storage br In January TDK announced that it had developed an ultra hard yet very thin polymer coating Durabis for Blu ray Discs this was a significant technical advance because a far tougher protection was desired in the consumer market to protect bare discs against scratching and damage compared to DVD while technically Blu ray Disc required a much thinner layer for the denser and higher frequency blue laser Cartridges originally used for scratch protection were no longer necessary and were scrapped The BD ROM specifications were finalized in early br Advanced Access Content System Licensing Administrator AACS LA a consortium founded in had been developing the DRM platform that could be used to securely distribute movies to consumers However the final AACS standard was delayed and then delayed again when an important member of the Blu ray Disc group voiced concerns At the request of the initial hardware manufacturers including Toshiba Pioneer and Samsung an interim standard was published that did not include some features such as managed copy br br br Launch and sales developments br The first BD ROM players Samsung BD P were shipped in mid June though HD DVD players beat them to market by a few months The first Blu ray Disc titles were released on June First Dates The Fifth Element Hitch House of Flying Daggers Underworld Evolution xXx all from Sony and MGM s The Terminator The earliest releases used MPEG video compression the same method used on standard DVDs The first releases using the newer VC and AVC formats were introduced in September The first movies using GB dual layer discs were introduced in October The first audio only albums were released in May br By June over Blu ray Disc titles were available in Australia and the United Kingdom with in the United States and Canada In Japan over titles had been released as of July br br br Competition from HD DVD br br The DVD Forum chaired by Toshiba was split over whether to develop the more expensive blue laser technology In March the forum approved a proposal which was endorsed by Warner Bros and other motion picture studios The proposal involved compressing high definition video onto dual layer standard DVD discs In spite of this decision however the DVD Forum s Steering Committee announced in April that it was pursuing its own blue laser high definition video solution In August Toshiba and NEC announced their competing standard the Advanced Optical Disc It was finally adopted by the DVD Forum and renamed HD DVD the next year after being voted down twice by DVD Forum members who were also Blu ray Disc Association members a situation that drew preliminary investigations by the U S Department of Justice br HD DVD had a head start in the high definition video market as Blu ray Disc sales were slow to gain market share The first Blu ray Disc player was perceived as expensive and buggy and there were few titles available br The Sony PlayStation which contained a Blu ray Disc player for primary storage helped support Blu ray Sony also ran a more thorough and influential marketing campaign for the format AVCHD camcorders were also introduced in These recordings can be played back on many Blu ray Disc players without re encoding but are not compatible with HD DVD players By January Blu ray Discs had outsold HD DVDs and during the first three quarters of BD outsold HD DVD by about two to one At CES Warner proposed Total Hi Def a hybrid disc containing Blu ray on one side and HD DVD on the other but it was never released br On June th Century Fox cited Blu ray Discs adoption of the BD anticopying system as key to their decision to support the Blu ray Disc format br On January a day before CES Warner Bros the only major studio still releasing movies in both HD DVD and Blu ray Disc format announced that it would release only in Blu ray after May This effectively included other studios that came under the Warner umbrella such as New Line Cinema and HBO though in Europe HBO s distribution partner the BBC announced it would continue to release product on both formats while keeping an eye on market forces This led to a chain reaction in the industry with major American retailers such as Best Buy Walmart and Circuit City and Canadian chains such as Future Shop dropping HD DVD in their stores Woolworths then a major European retailer dropped HD DVD from its inventory Major DVD rental companies Netflix and Blockbuster said they would no longer carry HD DVD br Following these new developments on February Toshiba announced it would end production of HD DVD devices allowing Blu ray Disc to become the industry standard for high density optical discs Universal Studios the sole major studio to back HD DVD since its inception said shortly after Toshiba s announcement While Universal values the close partnership we have shared with Toshiba it is time to turn our focus to releasing new and catalog titles on Blu ray Disc Paramount Pictures which started releasing movies only in HD DVD format during late also said it would start releasing on Blu ray Disc Both studios announced initial Blu ray lineups in May With this all major Hollywood studios supported Blu ray br br br Ongoing development br br br br br Although the Blu ray Disc specification has been finalized engineers continue to work on advancing the technology By quad layer GB discs had been demonstrated on a drive with modified optics and standard unaltered optics Hitachi stated that such a disc could be used to store hours of Mbit s video HDTV or hours and minutes of Mbit s video ultra high definition television In April TDK canceled plans to produce layer GB Blu ray Discs In August TDK announced that it had created a working experimental Blu ray Disc capable of holding GB of data on a single side using six GB data layers In Hitachi was reported to have plans to produce GB discs by br Behind closed doors at CES Ritek revealed that it had successfully developed a high definition optical disc process that extended the disc capacity to ten layers increasing the capacity of the discs to GB However it noted the major obstacle was that current read write technology did not allow additional layers JVC developed a three layer technology that allows putting both standard definition DVD data and HD data on a BD standard DVD combination This would have enabled the consumer to purchase a disc that can be played on DVD players and can also reveal its HD version when played on a BD player Japanese optical disc manufacturer Infinity announced the first hybrid Blu ray Disc standard DVD combo to be released February This disc set of the TV series Code Blue featured four hybrid discs containing a single Blu ray Disc layer GB and two DVD layers GB on the same side of the disc br In January Hitachi showcased a GB Blu ray Disc consisting of four layers containing GB each It claimed that unlike TDK s and Panasonic s GB discs this disc would be readable on standard Blu ray Disc drives that were currently in circulation and it was believed that a firmware update was the only requirement to make it readable by then current players and drives In October they revealed a GB Blu ray Disc drive In December Pioneer Corporation unveiled a GB Blu ray Disc containing data layers GB each compatible with current players after a firmware update Its planned launch was in the time frame for ROM and for rewritable discs Ongoing development was underway to create a TB Blu ray Disc br At CES Panasonic unveiled the DMP B the first portable Blu ray Disc player and Sharp introduced the LC BD U and LC BD U series the first LCD HDTVs with integrated Blu ray Disc players Sharp also announced that it would sell HDTVs with integrated Blu ray Disc recorders in the United States by the end of Set top box recorders were not being sold in the U S for fear of unauthorized copying However personal computers with Blu ray recorder drives were available In October TDK demonstrated a layer GB Blu ray Disc On January Sony in association with Panasonic announced plans to increase the storage capacity on their Blu ray Discs from GB to GB via a technology called i MLSE maximum likelihood sequence estimation The higher capacity discs according to Sony would be readable on existing Blu ray Disc players with a firmware upgrade This technology was later used on BDXL discs br On July the research team of Sony and Japanese Tohoku University announced the joint development of a blue violet laser to help create Blu ray Discs with a capacity of TB using only two layers and potentially more than TB with additional layering By comparison the first blue laser was invented in with the first prototype discs coming four years later br br br present br br On January Sony announced that it would release Mastered in K Blu ray Disc titles sourced at K and encoded at p Mastered in K Blu ray Disc titles can be played on existing Blu ray Disc players and have a larger color space using xvYCC On January Blu ray Disc Association president Andy Parsons stated that a task force was created three months prior to conduct a study concerning an extension to the Blu ray Disc specification that would add the ability to contain K UHD video br On August the BDA announced it would commence licensing the Ultra HD Blu ray format starting on August The Ultra HD Blu ray format delivered high dynamic range content that significantly expanded the range between the brightest and darkest elements expanded color range high frame rate up to fps and up to resolution object based sound formats and an optional digital bridge feature New players were required to play this format which were able to play both DVDs traditional Blu rays and the new format New Ultra HD Blu ray Discs hold up to GB and GB of data on dual and triple layer discs respectively br Blu ray s physical and file system specifications are publicly available on the BDA s website br br br Future scope and market trends br br According to Media Research high definition software sales in the United States were slower in the first two years than DVD software sales million DVD software units were sold in the first two years compared to million high definition software units One reason given for this difference was the smaller marketplace million HDTVs in compared to million SDTVs in Former HD DVD supporter Microsoft did not make a Blu ray Disc drive for the Xbox The s successor Xbox One features a Blu ray drive as does the PS with both supporting D Blu ray after later firmware updates br Shortly after the format war ended Blu ray Disc sales began to increase A study by the NPD Group found that awareness of Blu ray Disc had reached of households in the United States Nielsen VideoScan sales numbers showed that for some titles such as th Century Fox s Hitman up to of total disc sales were from Blu ray although the average Blu ray sales for the first half of the year were only around In December the Blu ray Disc version of Warner Bros The Dark Knight sold copies on the first day of its launch in the United States Canada and the United Kingdom A week after the launch The Dark Knight BD had sold over million copies worldwide making it the first Blu ray Disc title to sell over a million copies in the first week of release br br According to Singulus Technologies AG Blu ray was adopted faster than the DVD format was at a similar period in its development This conclusion was based on the fact that Singulus Technologies received orders for Blu ray dual layer replication machines during the first quarter of while DVD replication machines of this type were made in the same period in According to GfK Retail and Technology in the first week of November sales of Blu ray recorders surpassed DVD recorders in Japan According to the Digital Entertainment Group the number of Blu ray Disc playback devices both set top box and game console sold in the United States had reached million by the end of br Blu ray faces competition from video on demand and from new technologies that allow access to movies on any format or device such as Digital Entertainment Content Ecosystem or Disney s Keychest Some commentators suggested that renting Blu ray would play a vital part in keeping the technology affordable while allowing it to move forward In an effort to increase sales studios began releasing films in combo packs with Blu ray Discs and DVDs as well as digital copies that can be played on computers and mobile devices Some are released on flipper discs with Blu ray on one side and DVD on the other Other strategies are to release movies with the special features only on Blu ray Discs and none on DVDs br Blu ray Discs cost no more to produce than DVD discs However reading and writing mechanisms are more complicated making Blu ray recorders drives and players more expensive than their DVD counterparts Adoption is also limited due to the widespread use of streaming media Blu ray Discs are used to distribute PlayStation PlayStation PlayStation Xbox One and Xbox Series X games and the aforementioned game consoles can play back regular Blu ray Discs br In the mid s the Ultra HD Blu ray format was released which is an enhanced variant of Blu ray compatible with the K resolution Ultra HD Blu ray discs and players became available in the first quarter of having a storage capacity of up to GB br By December the specification for an K Blu ray format was also completed However this specification was for Japan only so that it could be used by Japanese public broadcasters like NHK to broadcast in K resolution for the Tokyo Olympic Games in Japan br br br Beyond Blu ray br The Holographic Versatile Disc HVD described in the ECMA standard was in development by the Holography System Development HSD Forum using a green writing reading laser nm and a red positioning addressing laser nm It was to offer MPEG MPEG AVC H HEVC H and VC encoding supporting a maximum storage capacity of TB No systems conforming to the Ecma International HVD standard have been released The company responsible for HVD went bankrupt in making any releases unlikely br br br Rise of boutique labels br A boutique Blu ray label or specialty Blu ray label is a home video distributor that releases films on Blu ray or K Ultra HD Blu ray format characterized by a specific or niche target market and collectable features like limited edition or special edition releases deluxe slipcases or packaging and other materials Examples of boutique Blu ray labels include the American Genre Film Archive AGFA Arrow Films Canadian International Pictures The Criterion Collection Kino Lorber Severin Films Shout Factory Twilight Time Vinegar Syndrome and the Warner Archive Collection br Boutique Blu ray labels which are popular among collectors and enthusiasts of film and physical media have been credited as a factor in a Blu ray renaissance dating back to at least with some consumers choosing to purchase films on physical formats in an age of digital streaming Reasons some consumers prefer Blu rays to streaming include higher video quality the tactile nature of owning a film physically elaborate packaging bonus features and the desire to own or watch films that are not available in streaming services libraries br br br Physical media br br br Laser and optics br While a DVD uses a nm red laser Blu ray Disc uses a nm blue laser diode Although the laser is called blue its color is actually in the violet range The shorter wavelength can be focused to a smaller area thus enabling it to read information recorded in pits that are less than half the size of those on a DVD and can consequently be spaced more closely resulting in a shorter track pitch enabling a Blu ray Disc to hold about five times the amount of information that can be stored on a DVD The lasers are GaN gallium nitride laser diodes that produce nm light directly that is without frequency doubling or other nonlinear optical mechanisms CDs use nm near infrared lasers br The minimum spot size on which a laser can be focused is limited by diffraction and depends on the wavelength of the light and the numerical aperture of the lens used to focus it By decreasing the wavelength increasing the numerical aperture from to and making the cover layer thinner to avoid unwanted optical effects designers can cause the laser beam to focus on a smaller spot which effectively allows more information to be stored in the same area For a Blu ray Disc the spot size is nm This allows a reduction of the pit size from nm for DVD to nm for Blu ray Disc and of the track pitch from nm to nm See compact disc for information on optical discs physical structure In addition to the optical improvements Blu ray Discs feature improvements in data encoding that further increase the amount of content that can be stored br br br Hard coating technology br Given that the Blu ray Disc data layer is closer to the surface of the disc compared to the DVD standard it was found in early designs to be more vulnerable to scratches The first discs were therefore housed in cartridges for protection resembling Professional Discs introduced by Sony in Using a cartridge would increase the price of an already expensive medium and would increase the size of Blu ray Disc drives so designers chose hard coating of the pickup surface instead TDK was the first company to develop a working scratch protection coating for Blu ray Discs naming it Durabis In addition both Sony s and Panasonic s replication methods include proprietary hard coat technologies Sony s rewritable media are spin coated using a scratch resistant acrylic and antistatic coating Verbatim s recordable and rewritable Blu ray Discs use their own proprietary technology called Hard Coat Colloidal silica dispersed UV curable resins are used for the hard coating given that according to the Blu ray Disc Association they offer the best tradeoff between scratch resistance optical properties and productivity br The Blu ray Disc specification requires the testing of resistance to scratches by mechanical abrasion In contrast DVD media are not required to be scratch resistant but since development of the technology some companies such as Verbatim implemented hard coating for more expensive lines of recordable DVDs br br br Drive speeds br br The table shows the speeds available Even the lowest speed is sufficient to play and record real time p video the higher speeds are relevant for general data storage and more sophisticated handling of video BD discs are designed to cope with at least rpm of rotational speed br The usable data rate of a Blu ray Disc drive can be limited by the capacity of the drive s data interface With a USB interface the maximum exploitable drive speed is Mbit s or MB s also called speed A USB interface with proper cabling does not have this limitation nor do even the oldest version of Serial ATA SATA MB s nor the latest Parallel ATA MB s standards Internal Blu ray drives that are integrated into a computer as opposed to physically separate and connected via a cable typically have a SATA interface br More recent half height Blu Ray writers have reached writing speeds of up to constant angular velocity on single layer BD R media while the highest reading speeds are presumably to prevent repeated physical stress on the disc Slim type drives are limited to speeds constant angular velocity due to spacial and power limitations br br br Media quality and data integrity br br The quality and data integrity of optical media can be determined by measuring the rate of errors of which higher rates may be an indication for deteriorating media low quality media physical damage such as scratches dust and or media written using a defective optical drive br Errors on Blu Ray media are measured using the so called LDC Long Distance Codes and BIS Burst Indication Subcodes error parameters of which rates below and respectively can be considered healthy br Not all vendors and models of optical drives have error scanning functionality implemented br br br Packaging br br Pre recorded Blu ray Disc titles usually ship in packages similar to but slightly smaller mm shorter and mm thinner mm mm mm and more rounded than a standard DVD keep case generally with the format prominently displayed in a horizontal stripe across the top of the case translucent blue for Blu ray video discs clear for Blu ray D video releases red for PlayStation Greatest Hits Games transparent for regular PlayStation games transparent dark blue for PlayStation and PlayStation games transparent green for Xbox One and Xbox Series X games and black for Ultra HD Blu ray video releases Warren Osborn and The Seastone Media Group LLC created the package that was adopted worldwide following the Blu ray versus HD DVD market adoption choice Because Blu ray cases are smaller than DVD cases more Blu rays than DVDs can fit on a shelf br br br Types br br br Mini Blu ray Disc br The Mini Blu ray Disc also Mini BD and Mini Blu ray is a compact centimetre diameter in variant of the Blu ray Disc that can store GB of data in its single layer configuration or GB on a dual layer disc It is similar in concept to the MiniDVD and Mini CD Recordable BD R and rewritable BD RE versions of Mini Blu ray Disc have been developed specifically for compact camcorders and other compact recording devices br br br Blu ray Disc recordable br br Blu ray Disc recordable BD R refers to two optical disc formats that can be recorded with an optical disc recorder BD Rs can be written to once whereas Blu ray Disc Recordable Erasable BD REs can be erased and re recorded multiple times The current practical maximum speed for Blu ray Discs is about MB s Higher speeds of rotation rpm cause too much wobble for the discs to be written properly as with the MB s and MB s rpm maximum speeds respectively of standard DVDs and CDs Since September BD RE is also available in the smaller cm Mini Blu ray Disc size br On September Pioneer and Mitsubishi codeveloped BD R LTH Low to High in groove recording which features an organic dye recording layer that can be manufactured by modifying existing CD R and DVD R production equipment significantly reducing manufacturing costs In February Taiyo Yuden Mitsubishi and Maxell released the first BD R LTH Discs and in March Sony s PlayStation officially gained the ability to use BD R LTH Discs with the firmware update In May Verbatim Mitsubishi announced the industry s first X BD R LTH media which allows recording a GB disc in about minutes Unlike with the previous releases of mm optical discs i e CDs and standard DVDs Blu ray recorders hit the market almost simultaneously with Blu ray s debut br br br BD and BD br The BD format was proposed to the Blu ray Disc Association by Warner Home Video as a cost effective alternative to the GB BD ROM discs The format was supposed to use the same codecs and program structure as Blu ray Disc video but recorded onto less expensive GB dual layer DVD This red laser media could be manufactured on existing DVD production lines with lower costs of production than the GB Blu ray media br Usage of BD for releasing content on pressed discs never caught on With the end of the format war manufacturers ramped production of Blu ray Discs and lowered prices to compete with DVDs On the other hand the idea of using inexpensive DVD media became popular among individual users A lower capacity version of this format that uses single layer GB DVDs has been unofficially called BD Both formats are being used by individuals for recording high definition content in Blu ray format onto recordable DVD media Despite the fact that the BD format has been adopted as part of the BD ROM basic format none of the existing Blu ray player models explicitly claim to be able to read it Consequently the discs recorded in BD and BD formats are not guaranteed to play on standard Blu ray Disc players AVCHD and AVCREC also use inexpensive media like DVDs but unlike BD and BD these formats have limited interactivity codec types and data rates As of March BD was removed as an official BD ROM disc br br br BDXL br br The BDXL format allows GB and GB write once discs and GB rewritable discs for commercial applications The BDXL specification was finalised in June BD R Format Specification BDXL defined a multi layered disc recordable in BDAV format with the speed of and capable of GB and usage of UDF BD RE Format Specification BDXL defined a multi layered disc rewritable in BDAV with the speed of and capable of GB and usage of UDF as file system Although the GB and GB BD ROM discs used for Ultra HD Blu ray use the same linear density as BDXL the two formats are not compatible with each other therefore it is not possible to use a triple layer BDXL disc to burn an Ultra HD Blu ray Disc playable in an Ultra HD Blu ray player although standard GB BD R DL discs can be burned in the Ultra HD Blu ray format br br br IH BD br The IH BD Intra Hybrid Blu ray format includes a GB rewritable layer BD RE and a GB write once layer BD ROM designed to work with existing Blu ray Discs br br br Data format standards br br br Filesystem br Blu ray Disc specifies the use of Universal Disk Format UDF as a convergent friendly format for both PC and consumer electronics environments It is used in the latest specifications of BD ROM BD RE and BD R In the first BD RE specification defined in the BDFS Blu ray Disc File System was used The BD RE specification was defined mainly for the digital recording of high definition television HDTV broadcast television The BDFS was replaced by UDF in the second BD RE specification in to enable interoperability among consumer electronics Blu ray recorders and personal computer systems These optical disc recording technologies enabled PC recording and playback of BD RE BD R can use UDF br The Blu ray Disc application for recording of digital broadcasting has been developed as System Description Blu

br br br Container format br Audio video and other streams are multiplexed and stored on Blu ray Discs in a container format based on the MPEG transport stream It is also known as BDAV MPEG transport stream and can use filename extension m ts Blu ray Disc titles authored with menus are in the BDMV Blu ray Disc Movie format and contain audio video and other streams in BDAV container There is also the BDAV Blu ray Disc Audio Visual format the consumer oriented alternative to the BDMV format used for movie releases The BDAV format is used on BD REs and BD Rs for audio video recording BDMV format was later defined also for BD RE and BD R in September in the third revision of BD RE specification and second revision of BD R specification br Blu ray Disc employs the MPEG transport stream recording method That enables transport streams of digital broadcasts to be recorded as they are broadcast without altering the format It also enables flexible editing of a digital broadcast that is recorded as is and where the data can be edited just by rewriting the playback stream Although it is quite natural a function for high speed and easy to use retrieval is built in Blu ray Disc Video use MPEG transport streams compared to DVD s MPEG program streams An MPEG transport stream contains one or more MPEG program streams so this allows multiple video programs to be stored in the same file so they can be played back simultaneously e g with picture in picture effect br br br Codecs br The BD ROM specification mandates certain codec compatibilities for both hardware decoders players and movie software content Windows Media Player does not come with the codecs required to play Blu ray Discs br br br Video br Originally BD ROMs stored video up to pixel resolution at up to fields per second Currently with UHD BD ROM videos can be stored at a maximum of pixel resolution at up to frames per second progressively scanned While most current Blu ray players and recorders can read and write video at the full p and p progressive format new players for the UHD specifications will be able to read at video at either p and p formats br br For video all players are required to process H MPEG Part H MPEG Part AVC and SMPTE VC BD ROM titles with video must store video using one of the three mandatory formats multiple formats on a single title are allowed Blu ray Disc allows video with a bit depth of bits per color YCbCr with chroma subsampling The choice of formats affects the producer s licensing royalty costs as well as the title s maximum run time due to differences in compression efficiency Discs encoded in MPEG video typically limit content producers to around two hours of high definition content on a single layer GB BD ROM The more advanced video formats VC and MPEG AVC typically achieve a video run time twice that of MPEG with comparable quality MPEG however does have the advantage that it is available without licensing costs as all MPEG patents have expired br MPEG was used by many studios including Paramount Pictures which initially used the VC format for HD DVD releases for the first series of Blu ray Discs which were launched throughout Modern releases are now often encoded in either MPEG AVC or VC allowing film studios to place all content on one disc reducing costs and improving ease of use Using these formats also frees a lot of space for storage of bonus content in HD i p as opposed to the SD i p typically used for most titles Some studios such as Warner Bros have released bonus content on discs encoded in a different format than the main feature title For example the Blu ray Disc release of Superman Returns uses VC for the feature film and MPEG for some of its bonus content Today Warner and other studios typically provide bonus content in the video format that matches the feature br br br Audio br For audio BD ROM players are required to implement Dolby Digital AC DTS and linear PCM Players may optionally implement Dolby Digital Plus and DTS HD High Resolution Audio as well as lossless and surround sound formats Dolby TrueHD and DTS HD Master Audio BD ROM titles must use one of the mandatory schemes for the primary soundtrack A secondary audiotrack if present may use any of the mandatory or optional codecs br br br Bit rate br The Blu ray specification defines a maximum data transfer rate of Mbit s a maximum AV bitrate of Mbit s for both audio and video data and a maximum video bit rate of Mbit s In contrast the HD DVD standard has a maximum data transfer rate of Mbit s a maximum AV bitrate of Mbit s and a maximum video bitrate of Mbit s br br br Java software interface br br At the JavaOne trade show it was announced that Sun Microsystems Java cross platform software environment would be included in all Blu ray Disc players as a mandatory part of the standard Java is used to implement interactive menus on Blu ray Discs as opposed to the method used on DVD video discs DVDs use pre rendered MPEG segments and selectable subtitle pictures which are considerably more primitive and rarely seamless At the conference Java creator James Gosling suggested that the inclusion of a Java virtual machine as well as network connectivity in some BD devices will allow updates to Blu ray Discs via the Internet adding content such as additional subtitle languages and promotional features not included on the disc at pressing time This Java version is called BD J and is built on a profile of the Globally Executable MHP GEM standard GEM is the worldwide version of the Multimedia Home Platform standard br br br Player profiles br The BD ROM specification defines four Blu ray Disc player profiles including an audio only player profile BD Audio that does not require video decoding or BD J All of the video based player profiles BD Video are required to have a full implementation of BD J br br On November the Grace Period Profile was superseded by Bonus View as the minimum profile for new BD Video players released to the market When Blu ray Disc software not authored with interactive features dependent on Bonus View or BD Live hardware capabilities is played on Profile players it is able to play the main feature of the disc but some extra features may not be available or will have limited capability br br br BD Live br The biggest difference between Bonus View and BD Live is that BD Live requires the Blu ray Disc player to have an Internet connection to access Internet based content BD Live features have included Internet chats scheduled chats with the director Internet games downloadable featurettes downloadable quizzes and downloadable movie trailers While some Bonus View players may have an Ethernet port it is used for firmware updates and is not used for Internet based content In addition Profile also requires more local storage in order to handle this content br Profile players are not eligible for Bonus View or BD Live compliant upgrades and do not have the function or capability to access these upgrades with the exception of the latest players and the PlayStation Internet is required to use br br br Region codes br br As with the implementation of region codes for DVDs Blu ray Disc players sold in a specific geographical region are designed to play only discs authorized by the content provider for that region This is intended to permit content providers motion picture studios television production company etc to enact regional price discrimination and or exclusive content licensing According to the Blu ray Disc Association all Blu ray Disc players and Blu ray Disc equipped computer systems are required to enforce regional coding However content providers need not use region playback codes Some current estimates suggest of available movie Blu ray Discs from the major studios are region free and can therefore be played on any Blu ray Disc player in any region br Movie distributors have different region coding policies Among major U S studios Walt Disney Pictures Warner Bros Paramount Pictures Universal Studios and Sony Pictures have released most of their titles free of region coding MGM and Lionsgate have released a mix of region free and region coded titles While th Century Fox initially released most of their titles region coded most of their post Disney merger content is region free Vintage film restoration and distribution company The Criterion Collection uses US region coding in all Blu ray releases with their releases in the UK market using UK region coding br The Blu ray Disc region coding scheme divides the world into three regions labeled A B and C br br A new form of Blu ray region coding tests not only the region of the player player software but also its country code repurposing a user setting intended for localization PSR as a new form of regional lockout This means for example while both the US and Japan are Region A some American discs will not play on devices software configured for Japan or vice versa since the two countries have different country codes For example the United States is US or hex x Japan is JP or hex x a and Canada is CA or hex x Although there are only three Blu ray regions the country code allows much more precise control of the regional distribution of Blu ray Discs than the six or eight DVD regions With Blu ray Discs there are no special regions such as the regions and for DVDs br In circumvention of region coding restrictions stand alone Blu ray Disc players are sometimes modified by third parties to allow for playback of Blu ray Discs and DVDs with any region code Instructions hacks describing how to reset the Blu ray region counter of computer player applications to make them multi region indefinitely are also regularly posted to video enthusiast websites and forums Unlike DVD region codes Blu ray region codes are verified only by the player software not by the optical drive s firmware br As of the latest types of Blu ray players suitable for Ultra HD Blu ray content are not region free but Ultra HD Blu ray disc manufacturers have not yet locked the discs to any region and they work worldwide br br br Digital rights management br The Blu ray Disc format employs several layers of digital rights management DRM which restrict the usage of the discs This has led to extensive criticism of the format by organizations opposed to DRM such as the Free Software Foundation and consumers because new releases require player firmware updates to allow disc playback br br br High bandwidth Digital Content Protection br br Blu ray equipment is required to implement the High bandwidth Digital Content Protection HDCP system to encrypt the data sent by players to rendering devices through physical connections This is aimed at preventing the copying of copyrighted content as it travels across cables Through a protocol flag in the media stream called the Image Constraint Token ICT a Blu ray Disc can enforce its reproduction in a lower resolution whenever a full HDCP compliant link is not used In order to ease the transition to high definition formats the adoption of this protection method was postponed until br br br Advanced Access Content System br br The Advanced Access Content System AACS is a standard for content distribution and digital rights management It was developed by AS Licensing Administrator LLC AACS LA a consortium that includes Disney Intel Microsoft Panasonic Warner Bros IBM Toshiba and Sony Since the appearance of the format on devices in several successful attacks have been made on it The first known attack relied on the trusted client problem In addition decryption keys have been extracted from a weakly protected player WinDVD Since keys can be revoked in newer releases this is only a temporary attack and new keys must continually be discovered in order to decrypt the latest discs br br br BD br br BD was developed by Cryptography Research Inc and is based on their concept of Self Protecting Digital Content BD effectively a small virtual machine embedded in authorized players allows content providers to include executable programs on Blu ray Discs Such programs can br br Examine the host environment to see if the player has been tampered with Every licensed playback device manufacturer must provide the BD licensing authority with memory footprints that identify their devices br Verify that the player s keys have not been changed br Execute native code possibly to patch an otherwise insecure system br Transform the audio and video output Parts of the content will not be viewable without letting the BD program unscramble it br If a playback device manufacturer finds that its devices have been hacked it can potentially release BD code that detects and circumvents the vulnerability These programs can then be included in all new content releases The specifications of the BD virtual machine are available only to licensed device manufacturers A list of licensed commercial adopters is available from the BD website br The first titles using BD were released in October Since November versions of BD protection have been circumvented by various versions of the AnyDVD HD program Other programs known to be capable of circumventing BD protection are DumpHD versions and above along with some supporting software MakeMKV and two applications from DVDFab Passkey and HD Decrypter br br br BD ROM Mark br br ROM Mark is a small amount of cryptographic data that is stored separately from normal Blu ray Disc data aiming to prevent replication of the discs The cryptographic data is needed to decrypt the copyrighted disc content protected by AACS A specially licensed piece of hardware is required to insert the ROM Mark into the media during mastering During replication this ROM Mark is transferred together with the recorded data to the disc In consequence any copies of a disc made with a regular recorder will lack the ROM Mark data and will be unreadable on standard players br br br Backward compatibility br The Blu ray Disc Association recommends but does not require that Blu ray Disc drives be capable of reading standard DVDs and CDs for backward compatibility Most Blu ray Disc players are capable of reading both CDs and DVDs however a few of the early Blu ray Disc players released in such as the Sony BDP S could play DVDs but not CDs In addition with the exception of some early models from LG and Samsung Blu ray players cannot play HD DVDs and HD DVD players cannot play Blu ray Discs Some Blu ray players can also play Video CDs Super Audio CDs and or DVD Audio discs All Ultra HD Blu ray players can play regular Blu ray Discs and most can play DVDs and CDs The PlayStation and PlayStation do not support CDs br br br Variations br br br High Fidelity Pure Audio BD A br br High Fidelity Pure Audio HFPA is a marketing initiative spearheaded by the Universal Music Group for audio only Blu ray optical discs Launched in as a potential successor to the compact disc it has been compared with DVD A and SACD which had similar aims br br br AVCHD br br AVCHD was originally developed as a high definition format for consumer tapeless camcorders Derived from the Blu ray Disc specification AVCHD shares a similar random access directory structure but is restricted to lower audio and video bitrates simpler interactivity and the use of AVC video and Dolby AC or linear PCM audio Being primarily an acquisition format AVCHD playback is not universally recognized among devices that play Blu ray Discs Nevertheless many such devices are capable of playing AVCHD recordings from removable media such as DVDs SD SDHC memory cards Memory Stick cards and hard disk drives br br br AVCREC br br AVCREC uses a BDAV container to record high definition content on conventional DVDs Presently AVCREC is tightly integrated with the Japanese ISDB broadcast standard and is not marketed outside of Japan AVCREC is used primarily in set top digital video recorders and in this regard it is comparable to HD REC br br br Blu ray D br br The Blu ray Disc Association BDA created a task force made up of executives from the film industry and the consumer electronics and IT sectors to help define standards for putting D film and D television content on a Blu ray Disc On December the BDA officially announced D specs for Blu ray Disc allowing backward compatibility with current D Blu ray players though compatibility is limited by the fact that the longer D discs are triple layer which normal D only players cannot read The BDA has said The Blu ray D specification calls for encoding D video using the Stereo High profile defined by Multiview Video Coding MVC an extension to the ITU T H Advanced Video Coding AVC codec currently implemented by all Blu ray Disc players MPEG MVC compresses both left and right eye views with a typical overhead compared to equivalent D content and can provide full p resolution backward compatibility with current D Blu ray Disc players This means the MVC D stream is backward compatible with H AVC D stream allowing older D devices and software to decode stereoscopic video streams ignoring additional information for the second view However some D discs have a user limitation set preventing the disc from being viewed in D though a D disc is often included in the packaging br Sony added Blu ray D support to its PlayStation console via a firmware upgrade on September The console had previously gained D gaming capability via an update on April Since the version software update on August the PlayStation can play DTS HD Master Audio and DTS HD High Resolution Audio while playing D Blu ray Dolby TrueHD is used on a small minority of Blu ray D releases and bitstreaming implemented in slim PlayStation models only original fat PS models decode internally and send audio as LPCM The PlayStation VR can also be used to watch these movies in D on a PlayStation As of most major home entertainment studios such as Walt Disney Studios Sony Pictures MGM and Universal Pictures had discontinued the Blu ray D format in North America but continued to produce and sell them in other regions such as South America Europe Asia and Australia Paramount Pictures has ceased sales and productions of D Blu ray Discs all over the world its last D releases being Ghost in the Shell and Transformers The Last Knight while Warner Bros continued to sell and produce D Blu ray Discs in North America until with their last film released on the format being Dune br br br Ultra HD Blu ray br br Ultra HD Blu ray Discs are incompatible with existing standard Blu ray players They support K UHD pixel resolution video at frame rates up to progressive frames per second encoded using High Efficiency Video Coding The discs support both high dynamic range HDR by increasing the color depth to bit per color and a greater color gamut than supported by conventional Blu ray video by using the Rec color space br The specification for an K Blu ray format was also completed by the Blu ray Disc Association for use in Japan More than two hours of K content can be recorded on BDXL discs br br br
