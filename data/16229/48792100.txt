id: 48792100
The Atari joystick port is a computer port used to connect various gaming controllers to game console and home computer systems in the s to the s It was originally introduced on the Atari in and then used on the Atari and in It went cross platform with the VIC in and was then used on many following machines from both companies as well as a growing list of rd party machines like the MSX platform and various Sega consoles br The port based on the inexpensive pin D connector became a de facto standard through the s and into the s supported by a wide variety of joysticks and other devices most commonly paddle controllers light pens and computer mice The standard was so engrained that it led to devices like the Kempston Interface that allowed Atari joysticks to be used on the ZX Spectrum The port was also used for all sorts of non gaming roles including the AtariLab interface modems numeric keypads and even a video expansion card br By the mid s the last home computer and game console models using Atari ports often for both joystick and mouse were discontinued IBM PC compatible computers which did not have Atari joystick ports became dominant in the home computer market and console manufacturers such as Sega switched to other types of ports br br br History br br The Atari Video Computer System later the developed out of an effort to address problems Atari found when releasing their first home video game console Pong Although successful Pong was an expensive system to design and was dedicated solely to one game It would be much more practical to have a machine that could run multiple games The list of games it would need to support included Pong variations and Tank It was the desire to run these two games that led to the need for some sort of flexible input system Pong used analog paddle controllers while Tank used dual digital on off joysticks Arcade games of the era generally used paddles joysticks or a unique sort of steering wheel controller that was spun entirely unlike a real car br Development of the was strictly a paper project until September when the MOS Technology processor was released The offered the right combinations of features performance and price that made a console using ROM cartridges for program storage practical for the first time Now that such a machine seemed like a real possibility the design team at Cyan Engineering began serious development br As part of this effort Joe Decuir began development of an I O system based primarily on the MOS Technology which included bit I O ports as well as the hardware needed to control memory refresh and similar housekeeping tasks Ultimately the design used five of the I O ports pins to control the various front panel switches and four each for the two controllers Additionally the TIA whose primary task was sound and video was used to handle timing based controllers like paddles and light pens The physical interface was the pin D sub connector which was already relatively common for reduced pin count serial ports on the Apple II and S bus machines Each of the pins in the connector went directly to the appropriate pin on the associated chip br The was released in shipping with both the paddle controllers and a single joystick The port allowed the to more easily support a wider variety of games not just specific games but entire genres Most game consoles before the Atari had paddle controllers even detachable ones in the case of the Fairchild Channel F and Magnavox Odyssey But the joystick was new and quickly garnered praise as it allowed direct input into a number of games that would otherwise be difficult to control using a paddle The joystick has been called the pinnacle of home entertainment controllers in its day br After the release of the the Cyan team immediately turned to the development of its replacement aiming for the time frame As the standard was already set on the the new machines naturally used the same controller interface although the details of the systems used to read it changed As approached the home computer market emerged and Atari repositioned the new system as the Atari and home computers This meant the standard now crossed the line between consoles and computers br The port design was extremely flexible and over time saw not only a wide variety of input devices but output as well Included among the non controller devices was the AtariLab system that allowed users to plug in various laboratory devices like digital thermometers the baud MPP C modem and even Atari s own column adaptor for the bit series the XEP It was widely used in the home brew market as a lightweight input device and articles on how to build various adapters were common br Commodore included an Atari joystick port with the VIC computer Atari had patents on the joystick and won an injunction against Commodore which produced an almost identical imitation joystick for the VIC but held no patents on the port itself By the time Commodore began development of the VIC millions of controllers compatible with the port were in the market br The Atari joystick port rapidly proliferated across the industry Hundreds of new devices using the system cropped up over time including trackballs and other advanced inputs The standard became so widely used that almost every bit machine released after used it and adapters were available for those that did not like the Apple II and ZX Spectrum One TI A reseller reported that its best selling product was the Atari joystick adapter The port moved to bit machines like the Atari ST and Amiga as well br The introduction of the Nintendo Entertainment System was the first widespread example of a gaming system in that era that did not use the Atari design its D pad having been designed specifically to be less bulky As newer consoles were released into the newly invigorated market new port designs were introduced for every different model Meanwhile the IBM PC had introduced the pin game port that was designed primarily for analog inputs but use remained rare until the introduction of popular flight simulators br By the mid s the Atari standard was becoming obsolete when home computers like Atari ST and Amiga exited markets along with Sega Genesis game console With the Atari STE Atari introduced the enhanced joystick port pin dsub alongside the joystick ports from Atari ST and when the Jaguar was released they only used the enhanced joystick port Nevertheless it was so popular during its run that it remains a common staple in video game iconography to this day and is commonly referred to as the symbol of the s video game system and system design There have also been numerous systems to allow the ports to be adapted to Universal Serial Bus and even entirely new Atari like joystick designs using USB br br br Description br The Atari joystick port used a pin male socket in the host system and female connectors on the devices Classic Atari peripherals used a teardrop shaped rounded plug that was easy to grip to make it easier to plug in Almost all compatible devices used similar physical layouts often to the point of copying the plug design outright br In the Atari consoles and bit computers reading the stick inputs was handled by a polling process that set values in various bit registers In the bit machines for instance the pins in the port were connected to custom I O hardware The instantaneous values were polled times a second during the vertical blank interrupt VBI when the operating system OS handled a number of housekeeping tasks Depending on settings in other registers the inputs on the pins were interpreted in a number of ways and then the output data was placed in a number of RAM registers Atari referred to this copying from hardware to the RAM as shadowing br br br Joysticks br br Atari joysticks included four internal switches to encode direction and a fifth for the trigger button Each of these led directly to a pin in the port and from there to an input on one of the I O chips The OS would read these inputs on each VBI and then copy their status into the shadow registers with the lower numbered ports in the least significant bits For instance if stick was being pushed up and to the right the PORTA register would have bits and set or decimal value The status of each of the joystick s trigger buttons was instead placed in four separate registers whose zero bit would be set to if the trigger was pushed br br br Driving controllers br Driving games of the s were generally top down and used a unique controller that would cause the car to turn at a fixed rate to one side or the other or go in a straight line Atari s Night Driver is a notable exception These games were controlled not by a wheel that pointed left or right like in a real car but a wheel that sent left or right commands only if it was actively spinning in that direction Players would spin the wheel rapidly to get the car to turn as fast as possible in the desired direction and then brake the wheel with their hands to go straight again br Driving controllers were implemented on Atari consoles with a device that worked in the same fashion as the joysticks pressing each directional switch in turn as it spun Programs had to watch the sequence of bits in the shadow registers in order to tell if the controller was being spun to the right or left The OS itself did not attempt to interpret this to provide right and left instructions for the programmer br br br Paddles br br Paddles are analog devices normally used to control horizontal positioning of the player on the screen On the Atari systems the paddles were connected in pairs allowing up to four people to play together on a two port system br The paddles worked by connecting the V line through a potentiometer pot and then back into pins and one for each paddle in the pair Those pins were connected to a capacitor slowly charging it at a rate set by the position of the pot When the voltage in the capacitor reached a threshold value it caused an interrupt in the OS that copied the value of the color clock value from the video hardware Normally this produced a value from to which was stored as an bit value in the appropriate POT shadow register br One advantage to this system was the color clock values provided by the paddle controllers were the same numbers that controlled the horizontal location of sprites meaning that the programmer could simply copy the value of the pot shadow register into the sprite s horizontal position register and it would appear at the appropriate location on screen br br br Keyboard controllers br br Keyboard controllers were used in the Atari systems as auxiliary inputs for numeric keypads on the bit machines and special purpose controllers on the like the Star Raiders port They were based on a by matrix for a total of possible keys For any keypress the row was encoded by setting one of four bits in the joystick shadow register PORTA or PORTB while the column set a bit on one of the trigger registers The programmer then had to read both to determine which key was pressed there was no firmware to map this onto key codes which the lacked anyway br br br Light pen br br Light pens were directly supported as well In this case a phototransistor in the light pen was connected to the trigger line of the port If placed in light pen mode whenever the trigger was seen to go low the OS would copy the color clock value into the PENH register to record the horizontal position and the VCOUNT register of the video hardware into the PENV register The result was a set of two eight bit values directly encoding the position of the pen in X and Y using the same coordinates as the video hardware A sprite can then be set to those coordinates and will appear under the light pen As the timers were not very accurate the positions had to be averaged over several screens to produce a usable value br br br Graphics tablets br Graphics tablets were handled using the same hardware as the paddle controllers encoding the X axis as the output of one paddle and the Y axis as the other There were three buttons one on the stylus and one on either upper corner of the pad The stylus button was connected to the up direction of the joystick port while the left and right buttons on the tablet itself were connected to two of the trigger inputs br br br Output br Because the pins of the joystick were wired directly to the input output controllers on the motherboard it was possible to program them to output to the port rather than input This capability was used in the Atari XEP column card which used pin as an output pin and pin as an input A device driver used these pins to implement a bidirectional serial port which worked in joystick port or Similar drivers were used by other devices like modems which avoided the need to use the more expensive Atari SIO system br br br Other platforms br br br Fully compatible systems br The VIC has one Control Port and the Commodore had two ports each a complete implementation of the Atari standard They differed from the Atari systems primarily in the hardware used to decode the inputs br The digital pins on the Commodore s control ports were read by a MOS Technology CIA chip and the analog paddle inputs in fashion similar to the Atari by the MOS Technology SID sound chip in conjunction with a timer br There was only one set of two inputs for this purpose in the SID so another register controlled which of the two ports was connected to the SID at any given instant Light pens could only be used in Control Port and worked in a similar way to the Atari but was based on a faster clock so the horizontal axis read from to The accuracy was the same as the Atari however as the values were rounded off to even values only br The same port pins on the CIA were also used for handling the keyboard and other housekeeping tasks which led to some problems For instance the left direction switch of Control Port was wired to the same input as the CTRL key on the keyboard and when it was used it would cause scrolling in BASIC programs to slow down Due to the way keyboard scanning was handled holding down the trigger would cause random characters to be generated As a result many C games required the joystick to be plugged into Control Port br On the Atari ST the two ports were normally configured with Port set to mouse mode and Port to joystick In joystick mode they operated largely identically to the earlier machines but in mouse mode the system watched the ports for discrete inputs on the various directional pins or events The mouse sensor generated events for every inch of movement and the system could track these fast enough to handle movements of up to inches per second Handling the ports the keyboard and a real time clock was a dedicated Intelligent Keyboard ikbd controller The ST implementation of the joystick port lacked analog input the following STE model introduced an enhanced joystick port which used a pin dsub that had analog support br The Commodore Amiga had a complete two port implementation known as gameports Unlike earlier systems that had to be interpreted by examining bits in registers the Amiga s OS had a number of drivers and libraries that made interaction simple This included handlers for five types of input devices include mice joysticks light pens and proportional controllers as a catch all for analog inputs like paddles and analog joysticks They also had settings for how and when the OS would report changes For instance the programmer could set the drivers to only report when the mouse had moved at least events thus lowering how often they had to deal with mouse movement br br br Semi compatible systems br The TI A home computer series used a pin connector that was physically identical to the Atari version as well as being similar in terms of the devices and the way they worked However the port s pins were re arranged and it used the separate grounds to select which joystick to read so it was not directly compatible Converters allowing Atari standard devices to be plugged in were both simple and very common The manufacturer and most makers of adapters included diodes on all lines of each joystick except the grounds to prevent false key presses br The ColecoVision game console extended the controller with two or four triggers and a key pad The ColecoVision also supported driving controllers and trackballs Many ColecoVision games can be played with an Atari compatible controller if a Coleco controller is plugged into the second port and used to select the game br The Atari game console extended the controller with a second trigger games not requiring two triggers can be played with classic controllers br MSX home computers used a slightly modified version of the port replacing one of the analog inputs with a second trigger and the other with a strobe pin Under normal operation any Atari style joystick could be used although it would lack the second trigger button The strobe pin was used to support mouse input Electrically a mouse generates what is essentially a random stream of pulses as it moves On systems like the ST and Amiga custom hardware was used to carefully track these in order for the motion to be smoothly followed as the CPU might become too busy with other tasks to follow the rapid interrupts Less powerful bit designs did not have the performance to smoothly track a mouse without additional hardware and the MSX designs based on off the shelf hardware lacked this ability Instead the tracking hardware was moved into the mouse The mice held two bit values tracking the movement in X and Y since the last time they had been polled To read the values out the strobe pin was pulled high four times With each pulse a nibble of the two bytes was output on the four directional pins in serial fashion The strobe pulse also reset the value to zero starting the polling process over again MSX mice were expensive and this led to adaptors for PS style mice which operated along similar principles br Sega Master System and Genesis game console controllers are backward compatible and can be used with the Atari br Not all Magnavox Odyssey systems had removable controllers For the models that do a simple adapter to rearrange the pins is all that is required br Some Amstrad PCs that were otherwise IBM PC compatible had Atari compatible digital gameports rather than the PC analog standard Software such as Elite and GEM had support for the Amstrad digital gameport Otherwise the joystick directionals were mapped to keys on the keyboard br br br Systems using adaptors br The Apple II also had a joystick port using a pin D sub but it was a very different system that connected two analog joysticks to a single port These were not very suitable for directional games and adapters for Atari port devices were common both commercial ones like the Sirius Joyport as well as many home brew systems Unlike the ports used on the Commodore systems most of the homebrew systems only adapted the joystick and generally did not include the other inputs These adapters did not allow the analog inputs of paddles to be used in spite of the port already handling these inputs directly meaning all that was needed was a mechanical adapter br The ZX Spectrum prior to the Spectrum had no built in controller port which led to a profusion of different inputs Atari port adapters were common and several devices emerged including the Kempston Interface and ZX Interface that were incompatible with each other The Interface turned joystick presses into keyboard presses and thus could not generate the analog signals of the paddles The later Amstrad built Spectrum models the A and included two built in joystick ports however the pinout of the connectors was non standard One button Atari joysticks can be used with a simple wiring adaptor to convert the ports to the standard pinout br The BBC Micro had a relatively complex port system which was based on a pin D connector that supported two analog joysticks like the ones on the Apple II These ran to dedicated analog to digital circuitry which made them excellent for the sort of interfacing tasks seen in for instance AtariLab However the popularity of the Atari port was such that adapters were also available for this system varying widely in the number and types of control devices they supported br br br Chart of compatible systems br
