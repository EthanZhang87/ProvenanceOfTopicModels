In computing an input device is a piece of equipment used to provide data and control signals to an information processing system such as a computer or information appliance Examples of input devices include keyboards computer mice scanners cameras joysticks and microphones br Input devices can be categorized based on br br modality of input e g mechanical motion audio visual etc br whether the input is discrete e g pressing of key or continuous e g a mouse s position though digitized into a discrete quantity is fast enough to be considered continuous br the number of degrees of freedom involved e g two dimensional traditional mice or three dimensional navigators designed for CAD applications br br br Keyboard br br br A keyboard is a human interface device which is represented as a matrix of buttons Each button or key can be used to either input an alphanumeric character to a computer or to call upon a particular function of the computer It acts as the main text entry interface for most users br br br Types br Keyboards are available in many form factors depending on the use case Standard keyboards can be categorized by its size and number of keys and the type of switch it employs Other keyboards cater to specific use cases such as a numeric keypad or a keyer br Desktop keyboards are typically large often have full key travel distance and features such as multimedia keys and a numeric keypad Keyboards on laptops and tablets typically compromise on comfort to achieve a thin figure br There are various switch technologies used in modern keyboards such as mechanical switches which use springs scissor switches usually found on a laptop keyboard or a membrane br Other keyboards do not have physical keys such as a virtual keyboard or a projection keyboard br br Ergonomic keyboard br A keyboard placing design emphasis on ergonomics and comfort br Chorded keyboard br A keyboard used by pressing several keys together br Thumb keyboard br A miniature keyboard found in PDAs and mobile phones br Keyer br A chorded keyboard without the board br Numeric keypad br While some keyboards include one commonly found on the right side numeric keypads can be found as independent devices br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Pointing device br br A pointing device allows a user to input spatial data to a computer It is commonly used as a simple and intuitive way to select items on a computer screen on a graphical user interface GUI either by moving a mouse pointer or in the case of a touch screen by physically touching the item on screen Common pointing devices include mice touchpads and touch screens br Whereas mice operate by detecting their displacement on a surface analog devices such as D mice joysticks or pointing sticks function by reporting their angle of deflection br br br Types br Pointing devices can be classified on br br Whether the input is direct or indirect With direct input the input space coincides with the display space i e pointing is done in the space where visual feedback or the pointer appears Touchscreens and light pens involve direct input Examples involving indirect input include the mouse and trackball br Whether the positional information is absolute e g on a touch screen or relative e g with a mouse that can be lifted and repositioned br Direct input is almost necessarily absolute but indirect input may be either absolute or relative For example digitizing graphics tablets that do not have an embedded screen involve indirect input and sense absolute positions and are often run in an absolute input mode but they may also be set up to simulate a relative input mode like that of a touchpad where the stylus or puck can be lifted and repositioned Embedded LCD tablets which are also referred to as graphics tablet monitors are the extension of digitizing graphics tablets They enable users to see the real time positions via the screen while being used br br mouse br A hand held pointing device that is moved across a surface br touchpad or trackpad br A flat surface operated by moving a finger across its surface br touch screen br A layer placed over a computer screen used by physically touching it br trackball br Similar to a mouse a trackball has a ball held by a socket Instead of moving the mouse the user rolls the ball with their finger br graphics tablet digitizer or drawing tablet br A flat surface on which a pen is used usually to draw images or capture signatures br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br

their physical orientation and acceleration but may also be found in desktop computers in the form of a thermometer used to monitor system temperature br br br Types br Accelerometer br Detects acceleration br Gyroscope br Detects spatial orientation br Magnetometer br Similar to a compass a magnetometer senses magnetic heading br Proximity sensor br Detects whether an object is in proximity br Barometer br Measures atmospheric pressure May be used to determine elevation above sea level br Ultrasonic transducer br Detects movement and range of objects using ultrasound br LIDAR br Detects the range of objects using laser br Thermometer br Measures temperature Usually uses a thermistor or thermocouple br br br br br br br Some sensors can be built with MEMS which allows them to be microscopic in size br br br High degree of freedom input devices br br Some devices allow many continuous degrees of freedom as input These can be used as pointing devices but are generally used in ways that don t involve pointing to a location in space such as the control of a camera angle while in D applications These kinds of devices are typically used in virtual reality systems CAVEs where input that registers six degrees of freedom is required br br br Composite devices br Input devices such as buttons and joysticks can be combined on a single physical device that could be thought of as a composite device Many gaming devices have controllers like this Technically mice are composite devices as they both track movement and provide buttons for clicking but composite devices are generally considered to have more than two different forms of input br br br Examples br Joystick br Consists of a stick pivoting on a stationary base br Gamepad or joypad br Hand held device often used to play modern video games br Paddle br A paddle could be a game controller consisting of a dial and a button or an input device such as a Griffin PowerMate or a Microsoft Surface Dial br Racing wheel br An imitation steering wheel that can be used to play racing video games br Wii Remote br A remote control used with the Nintendo Wii video game console which integrates an accelerometer and pointing capabilities br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Video input devices br br Video input devices are used to digitize images or video from the outside world into the computer The information can be stored in a multitude of formats depending on the user s requirement br Many video input devices use a camera sensor br br br Types br Digital camera br Digital camcorder br Portable media player br Webcam br Microsoft Kinect Sensor br Image scanner br Fingerprint scanner br Barcode reader br D scanner br Laser rangefinder br Eye gaze tracker br br br Voice recorder br Voice input devices are used to capture sound In some cases an audio output device can be used as an input device in order to capture produced sound Audio input devices allow a user to send audio info to a computer for processing recording or carrying out commands Devices such as microphones allow users to speak to the computer in order to record a voice message or navigate software Aside from recording audio input devices are also used with speech recognition software br br br Types br Microphones br MIDI keyboard or other digital musical instrument br br br Punched paper br Punched cards and punched tapes were used often in the th century A punched hole represented a one its absence represented a zero A mechanical or optical reader was used to input a punched card or tape br br br Other types br Gesture recognition br Digital pen br Magnetic ink character recognition br Sip and puff Computer input device br br br See also br Display device br Peripheral br
