Intelligence has been defined in many ways the capacity for abstraction logic understanding self awareness learning emotional knowledge reasoning planning creativity critical thinking and problem solving It can be described as the ability to perceive or infer information and to retain it as knowledge to be applied to adaptive behaviors within an environment or context br The term rose to prominence during the early s Most psychologists believe that intelligence can be divided into various domains or competencies br Intelligence has been long studied in humans and across numerous disciplines It has also been observed in both non human animals and plants despite controversy as to whether some of these forms of life exhibit intelligence Intelligence in computers or other machines is called artificial intelligence br br br Etymology br br The word intelligence derives from the Latin nouns intelligentia or intell ctus which in turn stem from the verb intelligere to comprehend or perceive In the Middle Ages the word intellectus became the scholarly technical term for understanding and a translation for the Greek philosophical term nous This term however was strongly linked to the metaphysical and cosmological theories of teleological scholasticism including theories of the immortality of the soul and the concept of the active intellect also known as the active intelligence This approach to the study of nature was strongly rejected by early modern philosophers such as Francis Bacon Thomas Hobbes John Locke and David Hume all of whom preferred understanding in place of intellectus or intelligence in their English philosophical works Hobbes for example in his Latin De Corpore used intellectus intelligit translated in the English version as the understanding understandeth as a typical example of a logical absurdity Intelligence has therefore become less common in English language philosophy but it has later been taken up with the scholastic theories that it now implies in more contemporary psychology br br br Definitions br br The definition of intelligence is controversial varying in what its abilities are and whether or not it is quantifiable br In the Mainstream Science on Intelligence was published as an op ed statement in the Wall Street Journal as a response to controversy over the book The Bell Curve which proposed policy changes based on purported connections between race and intelligence It was signed by fifty two researchers out of total invited to sign with explicitly refusing to sign The op ed described intelligence thus br br A very general mental capability that among other things involves the ability to reason plan solve problems think abstractly comprehend complex ideas learn quickly and learn from experience It is not merely book learning a narrow academic skill or test taking smarts Rather it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings catching on making sense of things or figuring out what to do br From Intelligence Knowns and Unknowns a report published by the Board of Scientific Affairs of the American Psychological Association also in response to controversy over The Bell Curve br br Individuals differ from one another in their ability to understand complex ideas to adapt effectively to the environment to learn from experience to engage in various forms of reasoning to overcome obstacles by taking thought Although these individual differences can be substantial they are never entirely consistent a given person s intellectual performance will vary on different occasions in different domains as judged by different criteria Concepts of intelligence are attempts to clarify and organize this complex set of phenomena Although considerable clarity has been achieved in some areas no such conceptualization has yet answered all the important questions and none commands universal assent Indeed when two dozen prominent theorists were recently asked to define intelligence they gave two dozen somewhat different definitions br Besides those definitions psychology and learning researchers also have suggested definitions of intelligence such as the following br br br Human br br Human intelligence is the intellectual power of humans which is marked by complex cognitive feats and high levels of motivation and self awareness Intelligence enables humans to remember descriptions of things and use those descriptions in future behaviors It gives humans the cognitive abilities to learn form concepts understand and reason including the capacities to recognize patterns innovate plan solve problems and employ language to communicate These cognitive abilities can be organized into frameworks like fluid vs crystallized and the Unified Cattell Horn Carroll model which contains abilities like fluid reasoning perceptual speed verbal abilities and others Intelligence enables humans to experience and think br Intelligence is different from learning Learning refers to the act of retaining facts and information or abilities and being able to recall them for future use Intelligence on the other hand is the cognitive ability of someone to perform these and other processes There have been various attempts to quantify intelligence via testing such as the Intelligence Quotient IQ test However many people disagree with the validity of IQ tests stating that they cannot accurately measure intelligence br There is debate about if human intelligence is based on hereditary factors or if it is based on environmental factors Hereditary intelligence is the theory that intelligence is fixed upon birth and does not grow Environmental intelligence is the theory that intelligence is developed throughout life depending on the environment around the person An environment that cultivates intelligence is one that challenges the person s cognitive abilities br br br Emotional br br Emotional intelligence is thought to be the ability to convey emotion to others in an understandable way as well as to read the emotions of others accurately Some theories imply that a heightened emotional intelligence could also lead to faster generating and processing of emotions in addition to the accuracy In addition higher emotional intelligence is thought to help us manage emotions which is beneficial for our problem solving skills Emotional intelligence is important to our mental health and has ties to social intelligence br br br Social br br Social intelligence is the ability to understand the social cues and motivations of others and oneself in social situations It is thought to be distinct to other types of intelligence but has relations to emotional intelligence Social intelligence has coincided with other studies that focus on how we make judgements of others the accuracy with which we do so and why people would be viewed as having positive or negative social character There is debate as to whether or not these studies and social intelligence come from the same theories or if there is a distinction between them and they are generally thought to be of two different schools of thought br br br Moral br br Moral intelligence is the capacity to understand right from wrong and to behave based on the value that is believed to be right It is considered a distinct form of intelligence independent to both emotional and cognitive intelligence br br br Book smart and street smart br Concepts of book smarts and street smart are contrasting views based on the premise that some people have knowledge gained through academic study but may lack the experience to sensibly apply that knowledge while others have knowledge gained through practical experience but may lack accurate information usually gained through study by which to effectively apply that knowledge Artificial intelligence researcher Hector Levesque has noted that br br Given the importance of learning through text in our own personal lives and in our culture it is perhaps surprising how utterly dismissive we tend to be of it It is sometimes derided as being merely book knowledge and having it is being book smart In contrast knowledge acquired through direct experience and apprenticeship is called street knowledge and having it is being street smart br br br Nonhuman animal br br Although humans have been the primary focus of intelligence researchers scientists have also attempted to investigate animal intelligence or more broadly animal cognition These researchers are interested in studying both mental ability in a particular species and comparing abilities between species They study various measures of problem solving as well as numerical and verbal reasoning abilities Some challenges include defining intelligence so it has the same meaning across species and operationalizing a measure that accurately compares mental ability across species and contexts br Wolfgang K hler s research on the intelligence of apes is an example of research in this area as is Stanley Coren s book The Intelligence of Dogs Non human animals particularly noted and studied for their intelligence include chimpanzees bonobos notably the language using Kanzi and other great apes dolphins elephants and to some extent parrots rats and ravens br Cephalopod intelligence provides an important comparative study Cephalopods appear to exhibit characteristics of significant intelligence yet their nervous systems differ radically from those of backboned animals Vertebrates such as mammals birds reptiles and fish have shown a fairly high degree of intellect that varies according to each species The same is true with arthropods br br br g factor in non humans br br Evidence of a general factor of intelligence has been observed in non human animals The general factor of intelligence or g factor is a psychometric construct that summarizes the correlations observed between an individual s scores on a wide range of cognitive abilities First described in humans the g factor has since been identified in a number of non human species br Cognitive ability and intelligence cannot be measured using the same largely verbally dependent scales developed for humans Instead intelligence is measured using a variety of interactive and observational tools focusing on innovation habit reversal social learning and responses to novelty Studies have shown that g is responsible for of the individual variance in cognitive ability measures in primates and between and of the variance in mice Locurto Locurto These values are similar to the accepted variance in IQ explained by g in humans br br br Plant br br It has been argued that plants should also be classified as intelligent based on their ability to sense and model external and internal environments and adjust their morphology physiology and phenotype accordingly to ensure self preservation and reproduction br A counter argument is that intelligence is commonly understood to involve the creation and use of persistent memories as opposed to computation that does not involve learning If this is accepted as definitive of intelligence then it includes the artificial intelligence of robots capable of machine learning but excludes those purely autonomic sense reaction responses that can be observed in many plants Plants are not limited to automated sensory motor responses however they are capable of discriminating positive and negative experiences and of learning registering memories from their past experiences They are also capable of communication accurately computing their circumstances using sophisticated cost benefit analysis and taking tightly controlled actions to mitigate and control the diverse environmental stressors br br br Artificial br br Scholars studying artificial intelligence have proposed definitions of intelligence that include the intelligence demonstrated by machines Some of these definitions are meant to be general enough to encompass human and other animal intelligence as well An intelligent agent can be defined as a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success Kaplan and Haenlein define artificial intelligence as a system s ability to correctly interpret external data to learn from such data and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation Progress in artificial intelligence can be demonstrated in benchmarks ranging from games to practical tasks such as protein folding Existing AI lags humans in terms of general intelligence which is sometimes defined as the capacity to learn how to carry out a huge range of tasks br Mathematician Olle H ggstr m defines intelligence in terms of optimization power an agent s capacity for efficient cross domain optimization of the world according to the agent s preferences or more simply the ability to steer the future into regions of possibility ranked high in a preference ordering In this optimization framework Deep Blue has the power to steer a chessboard s future into a subspace of possibility which it labels as winning despite attempts by Garry Kasparov to steer the future elsewhere Hutter and Legg after surveying the literature define intelligence as an agent s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments While cognitive ability is sometimes measured as a one dimensional parameter it could also be represented as a hypersurface in a multidimensional space to compare systems that are good at different intellectual tasks Some skeptics believe that there is no meaningful way to define intelligence aside from just pointing to ourselves br br br See also br br br br br br
