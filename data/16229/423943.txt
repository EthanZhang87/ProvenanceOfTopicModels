The rhesus macaque Macaca mulatta colloquially rhesus monkey is a species of Old World monkey There are between six and nine recognised subspecies that are split between two groups the Chinese derived and the Indian derived Generally brown or grey in colour it is cm in in length with a cm in tail and weighs kg lb It is native to South Central and Southeast Asia and has the widest geographic range of all non human primates occupying a great diversity of altitudes and a great variety of habitats from grasslands to arid and forested areas but also close to human settlements Feral colonies are found in the United States thought to be either released by humans or escapees after hurricanes destroyed zoo and wildlife park facilities br The rhesus macaque is diurnal arboreal and terrestrial It is mostly herbivorous feeding mainly on fruit but also eating seeds roots buds bark and cereals and consumes around different plant species Rhesus macaques living in cities also eat human food and trash It is gregarious with troops comprising individuals The social groups are matrilineal whereby a female s rank is decided by the rank of her mother There has been extensive research into female philopatry common in social animals as females tend not to leave the social group The rhesus macaque communicates with a variety of facial expressions vocalisations body postures and gestures Facial expressions are used to appease or redirect aggression assert dominance and threaten other individuals and vocalisations may be made to elicit grooming while moving or in threatening situations It spends most of its day feeding and resting the remainder is occupied with traveling grooming and playing br Due to its relatively easy upkeep wide availability and closeness to humans anatomically and physiologically it has been used extensively in medical and biological research on human and animal health related topics It has facilitated many scientific breakthroughs including vaccines for rabies smallpox and polio and antiretroviral medication to treat HIV AIDS A rhesus macaque became the first primate astronaut in but died during the flight followed on June by Albert II who became the first primate and first mammal in space It is listed as Least Concern in the IUCN Red List in view of its wide distribution presumed large population and its tolerance of a broad range of habitats br br br Etymology br The name rhesus is reminiscent of the mythological king Rhesus of Thrace a minor character in the Iliad However the French naturalist Jean Baptiste Audebert who applied the name to the species stated it has no meaning The rhesus macaque is also known colloquially as the rhesus monkey br br br Taxonomy br br According to Zimmermann s first description of the rhesus macaque is distributed in eastern Afghanistan Bangladesh Bhutan as far east as the Brahmaputra Valley Barak valley and in peninsular India Nepal and northern Pakistan Today this is known as the Indian rhesus macaque M m mulatta which includes the morphologically similar M rhesus villosus described by True in from Kashmir and M m mcmahoni described by Pocock in from Kootai Pakistan Several Chinese subspecies of rhesus macaques were described between and The molecular differences identified among populations however are alone not consistent enough to conclusively define any subspecies br The Chinese subspecies can be divided as follows br br M m mulatta is found in western and central China in the south of Yunnan and southwest of Guangxi br M m lasiota Gray the west Chinese rhesus macaque is distributed in the west of Sichuan northwest of Yunnan and southeast of Qinghai it is possibly synonymous with M m sanctijohannis R Swinhoe if not with M m mulatta br M m tcheliensis Milne Edwards the north Chinese rhesus macaque lives in the north of Henan south of Shanxi and near Beijing Some consider it as the most endangered subspecies Others consider it possibly synonymous with M m sanctijohannis if not with M m mulatta br M m vestita Milne Edwards the Tibetan rhesus macaque lives in the southeast of Tibet northwest of Yunnan Deqing and perhaps including Yushu it is possibly synonymous with M m sanctijohannis if not with M m mulatta br M m littoralis Elliot the south Chinese rhesus macaque lives in Fujian Zhejiang Anhui Jiangxi Hunan Hubei Guizhou northwest of Guangdong north of Guangxi northeast of Yunnan east of Sichuan and south of Shaanxi it is possibly synonymous with M m sanctijohannis if not with M m mulatta br M m brevicaudus also referred to as Pithecus brevicaudus Elliot lives on the Hainan Island and Wanshan Islands in Guangdong and the islands near Hong Kong it may be synonymous with M m mulatta br M m siamica Kloss the Indochinese rhesus macaque is distributed in Myanmar in the north of Thailand and Vietnam in Laos and in the Chinese provinces of Anhui northwest Guangxi Guizhou Hubei Hunan central and eastern Sichuan and western and south central Yunnan possibly synonymous with M m sanctijohannis if not with M m mulatta br br br Description br br The rhesus macaque is brown or grey in color and has a pink face which is bereft of fur It has on average vertebrae and a wide rib cage Its tail averages between and cm and in Adult males measure about cm in on average and weigh about kg lb Females are smaller averaging cm in in length and kg lb in weight The ratio of arm length to leg length is br The rhesus macaque has a dental formula of and bilophodont molar teeth br br br Distribution and habitat br Rhesus macaques are native to India Bangladesh Pakistan Nepal Myanmar Thailand Afghanistan Vietnam southern China and some neighbouring areas They have the widest geographic ranges of any non human primate occupying a great diversity of altitudes throughout Central South and Southeast Asia Inhabiting arid open areas rhesus macaques may be found in grasslands woodlands and in mountainous regions up to m ft in elevation They are strong swimmers and can swim across rivers Rhesus macaques are noted for their tendency to move from rural to urban areas coming to rely on handouts or refuse from humans They adapt well to human presence and form larger troops in human dominated landscapes than in forests Rhesus monkeys live in patches of forest within agricultural areas which gives them access to agroecosystem habitats and makes them at ease in navigating through them br The southern and the northern distributional limits for rhesus and bonnet macaques respectively currently run parallel to each other in the western part of India are separated by a large gap in the center and converge on the eastern coast of the peninsula to form a distribution overlap zone This overlap region is characterized by the presence of mixed species troops with pure troops of both species sometimes occurring even in close proximity to one another The range extension of rhesus macaque a natural process in some areas and a direct consequence of introduction by humans in other regions poses grave implications for the endemic and declining populations of bonnet macaques in southern India br Kumar et al provides a summary of population distribution and habitat in India It states that there were sightings of rhesus macaques in all surveyed habitats except semi evergreen forests br br br Fossil record br Fossilized isolated teeth and mandible fragments from Tianyuan Cave and a juvenile maxilla from Wanglaopu Cave near Zhoukoudian represent the first recognized occurrence of rhesus macaque fossils in the far north of China and thus the population of rhesus macaques which lived around Beijing decades ago is believed to have originated from Pleistocene ancestors rather than being human introduced Fossil mandible fragments from the Taedong River Basin around Pyongyang North Korea have also been assigned to this species br br br Feral colonies br Rhesus macaques have also been introduced to other areas such as the United States and become feral The most common area for release has been Florida with wild ranging other colonies in Puerto Rico and a semi captive colony established in South Carolina br Around the spring of a colony of rhesus macaques was released in and around Silver Springs in Florida by a tour boat operator known locally as Colonel Tooey to enhance his Jungle Cruise Tooey had been hoping to profit from the boom in jungle adventure stories in film and print media buying the monkeys to be attractions at his river boat tour Tooey apparently hadn t been aware of rhesus macaques being proficient swimmers meaning his original plan to keep the monkeys isolated to an island inside the river didn t work The macaques nevertheless remained in the region thanks to daily feedings by Tooey and the boat tours Tooey subsequently released additional monkeys to add to the gene pool and avoid Inbreeding The traditional story that the monkeys were released for scenery enhancement in the Tarzan movies that were filmed at that location is false as the only Tarzan movie filmed in the area s Tarzan Finds a Son does not contain rhesus macaques Whilst this was the first colony established and the longest lasting other colonies have since been established intentionally or accidentally A population in Titusville Florida was featured at the now defunct Tropical Wonderland theme park which coincidentally was at one time endorsed by Johnny Weissmuller who had portrayed Tarzan in the aforementioned films This association might have contributed to the misconception the monkeys were associated directly with the Tarzan films This colony either escaped or was intentionally released roaming the woods of the area for a decade In the s a trapper captured several monkeys from the Titusville population and released them in the Silver Springs area to join that population The last printed records of monkeys in the Titusville area occurred in early s but sightings continue to this day br Various colonies of rhesus macaque are speculated to be the result of zoos and wildlife parks destroyed in hurricanes most notably Hurricane Andrew A estimate put the number at rhesus macaques living in the state officials have caught more than of the monkeys in the past decade Most of the captured monkeys tested positive for herpes B virus which leads wildlife officials to consider the animals a public health hazard Of the three monkey species to have had any lasting presence in Florida the other two being African Vervet monkeys and South American Squirrel monkeys the Rhesus macaques have endured the longest and are the only ones to show continual population growth The species adaptable nature generalized diet and larger size as to reduce the chance of cold stress or predator attack are thought to be reasons for their success br Despite the risks the macaques have continued to enjoy long standing support from residents in Florida strongly disagreeing with their removal The Silver Springs colony has continued to grow in size and range being commonly sighted in both the park grounds the nearby city of Ocala Florida and the neighboring Ocala National Forest Individuals likely originating from this colony have been seen hundreds of kilometers away in St Augustine Florida and St Petersburg Florida One infamous individual titled the Mystery Monkey of Tampa Bay evaded capture for years in the Tampa Bay area inspiring social media posts and a song to be written about it br Feral colonies have also resulted from research activities There is a colony of rhesus macaques on Morgan Island one of the Sea Islands in the South Carolina Lowcountry They were imported in the s for use in the local labs Another research colony was established by the Caribbean Primate Research Center of the University of Puerto Rico on the island of Cayo Santiago off of Puerto Rico There are no predators on the island and humans are not permitted to land except as part of the research program Another Puerto Rico research colony was released into the Desecheo National Wildlife Refuge in As of they are continuing to do ecological harm damage crops amounting to year and cost year to manage br br br Ecology and behavior br br The Rhesus macaque is diurnal and both arboreal and terrestrial It is quadrupedal and when on the ground it walks digitigrade and plantigrade It is mostly herbivorous feeding mainly on fruit but also eating seeds roots buds bark and cereals It is estimated to consume around different plant species in families During the monsoon season it gets much of its water from ripe and succulent fruit Rhesus macaques living far from water sources lick dewdrops from leaves and drink rainwater accumulated in tree hollows They have also been observed eating termites grasshoppers ants and beetles When food is abundant they are distributed in patches and forage throughout the day in their home ranges They drink water when foraging and gather around streams and rivers Rhesus macaques have specialized pouch like cheeks allowing them to temporarily hoard their food br It has specialised cheek pouches where it can temporarily store food and also eats invertebrates including adult and larval insects spiders lice honeycombs crabs and bird eggs With an increase in anthropogenic land changes the rhesus macaque has evolved alongside intense and rapid environmental disturbance associated with human agriculture and urbanization resulting in proportions of their diet to be altered br In psychological research rhesus macaques have demonstrated a variety of complex cognitive abilities including the ability to make same different judgments understand simple rules and monitor their own mental states They have even been shown to demonstrate self agency an important type of self awareness In onlookers at a train station in Kanpur India documented a rhesus monkey knocked unconscious by overhead power lines that was revived by another rhesus that systematically administered a series of resuscitative actions br br br Group structure br br Like other macaques rhesus troops comprise a mixture of males and females Females may outnumber the males by a ratio of Males and females both have separate hierarchies Female philopatry common among social mammals has been extensively studied in rhesus macaques Females tend not to leave the social group and have highly stable matrilineal hierarchies in which a female s rank is dependent on the rank of her mother In addition a single group may have multiple matrilineal lines existing in a hierarchy and a female outranks any unrelated females that rank lower than her mother Rhesus macaques are unusual in that the youngest females tend to outrank their older sisters This is likely because young females are more fit and fertile Mothers seem to prevent the older daughters from forming coalitions against her The youngest daughter is the most dependent on the mother and would have nothing to gain from helping her siblings in overthrowing their mother Since each daughter had a high rank in her early years rebelling against her mother is discouraged Juvenile male macaques also exist in matrilineal lines but once they reach four to five years of age they are driven out of their natal groups by the dominant male Thus adult males gain dominance by age and experience br In the group macaques position themselves based on rank The central male subgroup contains the two or three oldest and most dominant males which are codominant along with females their infants and juveniles This subgroup occupies the center of the group and determines the movements foraging and other routines The females of this subgroup are also the most dominant of the entire group The farther to the periphery a subgroup is the less dominant it is Subgroups on the periphery of the central group are run by one dominant male of a rank lower than the central males and he maintains order in the group and communicates messages between the central and peripheral males A subgroup of subordinate often subadult males occupy the very edge of the groups and have the responsibility of communicating with other macaque groups and making alarm calls Rhesus social behaviour has been described as despotic in that high ranking individuals often show little tolerance and frequently become aggressive towards non kin Top ranking female rhesus monkeys are known to sexually coerce unreceptive males and also physically injure them biting off digits and damaging their genitals br Rhesus macaques have been observed engaging in interspecies grooming with Hanuman langurs and with Sambar deer br br br Communication br Rhesus macaques interact using a variety of facial expressions vocalizations body postures and gestures Perhaps the most common facial expression the macaque makes is the silent bared teeth face This is made between individuals of different social ranks with the lower ranking one giving the expression to its superior A less dominant individual also makes a fear grimace accompanied by a scream to appease or redirect aggression Another submissive behavior is the present rump where an individual raises its tail and exposes its genitals to the dominant one A dominant individual threatens another individual by standing quadrupedally and making a silent open mouth stare accompanied by the tail sticking straight During movements macaques make coos and grunts These are also made during affiliative interactions and approaches before grooming When they find rare food of high quality macaques emit warbles harmonic arches or chirps When in threatening situations macaques emit a single loud high pitched sound called a shrill bark Screeches screams squeaks pant threats growls and barks are used during aggressive interactions Infants gecker to attract their mother s attention br br br Reproduction br br Adult male macaques try to maximize their reproductive success by entering into sex with females both in and outside the breeding period Females prefer to mate with males that are not familiar to them Outsider males who are not members of the female s own troop are preferred over higher ranking males Outside of the consortship period males and females return the prior behavior of not exhibiting preferential treatment or any special relationship The breeding period can last up to eleven days and a female usually mates with numerous males during that time Male rhesus macaques have been observed to fight for access to sexually receptive females and they suffer more wounds during the mating season Female macaques first breed when they are four years old and reach menopause at around twenty five years of age Male macaques generally play no role in raising the young but do have peaceful relationships with the offspring of their consort pairs br Manson and Parry found that free ranging rhesus macaques avoid inbreeding Adult females were never observed to copulate with males of their own matrilineage during their fertile periods br Mothers with one or more immature daughters in addition to their infants are in contact with their infants less than those with no older immature daughters because the mothers may pass the parenting responsibilities to their daughters High ranking mothers with older immature daughters also reject their infants significantly more than those without older daughters and tend to begin mating earlier in the mating season than expected based on their dates of parturition the preceding birth season Infants farther from the center of the groups are more vulnerable to infanticide from outside groups Some mothers abuse their infants which is believed to be the result of controlling parenting styles br br br Aging br The rhesus monkey has been used as a model for studying aging of the ovaries of primate females Ovarian aging was found to be associated with increased DNA double strand breaks and reduced DNA repair in granulosa cells that is somatic cells closely associated with developing oocytes br br br Self awareness br In several experiments giving mirrors to rhesus monkeys they looked into the mirrors and groomed themselves as well as flexed various muscle groups This behaviour indicates that they recognised and were aware of themselves br br br Human rhesus conflict br The macaque human relationships is complex and culturally specific ranging from relatively peaceful coexistence to extreme levels of conflict The relationship between rhesus macaques and humans is in constant change with conflict being shaped by historic changes in social and cultural practices The changing perceptions of nature and human nature relationships is influenced by larger political economic decisions When looking at conflict between humans and rhesus macaques there lacks an integrative approach that draws upon multiple fields to provide a more holistic understanding of the emergence and evolution of this conflict Conflicts can be as a result of rapidly changing agricultural practices increasing infrastructure to support urbanisation and emerging economic activities e g tourism food processing etc requiring more clearing of land including forests and rising numbers of rhesus macaques The issue is multi dimensional and has a direct connection to overall economic policy more specifically the relationship among agricultural forest and land use policies Deeply understanding factors relating to conflict is all the more critical in an uncertain and unpredictable future of climate change that is likely to increase the vulnerability of fragile mountain ecosystems and marginal communities br Conflict between rhesus macaques and humans is at all time high with areas once forested habitat being converted to industrial agriculture Specifically looking at Nepal this process has increased urban infrastructure such as housing and roads that increasingly fragment forest ecosystems The expansion of monocultures increased forest fragmentation degradation of natural habitats and changing agricultural practices have led to a significant increase in the frequency of human macaque conflict Crop raiding is one of the biggest visible effects of human rhesus conflict occurring where rhesus macaques feed on growing crops that directly affected harvest size and crop health The estimated financial cost to individual farmer households of macaque corn and rice raiding is approximately US or of their yearly income This has resulted in farmers and other members of the population viewing macaques inhabiting agricultural landscapes as serious crop pests Nepal is a significant study area with almost of Nepal s land area containing suitable habitat for rhesus macaques but only having of such suitable area being protected national parks As well the rating of rhesus macaques as the top ten crop raiding wildlife species in Nepal adds to such negative perception Studying crop raiding behaviour is essential to developing effective strategies to manage human macaque conflict while promoting both primate conservation and the economic well being of the local community A study stated that human macaque conflict is one of the most critical challenges faced by wildlife managers in the South and Southeast Asian regions Suggestions to mitigate conflict include prioritizing forest restoration programs strategic management plans designed to connect isolated forest fragments with high rhesus macaque population densities creating government programs that compensate farmers for income lost due to crop raiding and educational outreach that informs local villagers of the importance of conservation and protecting biodiversity Mitigation strategies offers the most effective solutions to reduce conflict occurring between rhesus macaques and humans in Nepal br India is another country that is seeing the rise of human macaque conflict Macaque human conflict particularly occurs in the twin hill states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh with such conflict being a source of contentious debate in political scenarios resentment and polarization amongst agriculturalists and wildlife conservationists In India crop raiding by rhesus macaques has been identified as the main cause of conflict In urban areas rhesus macaques damage property and injure people in house raids in order to access food and provisions whereas in agricultural areas they cause financial losses to farmers due to crop depredation The estimated extent of crop damages in Himachal Pradesh ranges from to of all crop losses The financial implications of such damage is estimated at approximately USD in agriculture and USD in horticulture Quantification of crop and financial loses is challenging with a potential misrepresentation due to farmer perspectives where perception of perceived losses are potentially higher than actual losses This has led to harsh actions against rhesus macaque communities Another factor in rhesus perception includes economic status farmer economic stability cultural attitudes towards the given species and the frequency and intensity of wildlife conflicts All of the above have resulted in changed in conservation and management with legal rhesus macaque culling issued in br Human wildlife conflict is also occurring in China specifically in the area of Longyang District Baoshan City Yunnan Province The peak period of conflict occurs from August October when wildlife overlaps with humans severely due to the high natural productivity stemming from the warm and humid climate Factors associated with accessibility and availability of food and shelter appear to be the key drivers of human macaque conflict with an overall increase between the years of and br One key factor of conflict that directly affects the human macaque relationship is visibility Visibility of rhesus macaques in agroecosystem dominated areas largely impacts conflict between humans and rhesus macaques The conspicuous presence of rhesus macaques in and around farms results in farmers believing that macaques cause heavy crop depredations which in turn have led to negative perceptions and actions against the species Whereas visibility in urban areas can result in a positive relationship areas include around temples and tourist areas where their dietary needs are largely met by food provisioning br Towards the end of March it was reported that a monkey had entered a house in the village of Talabasta Odisha India and kidnapped a baby The baby was later found dead in a well Though monkeys are known to attack people enter homes and damage property this reported behaviour was unusual br br br Population management tools br Managing conflict between humans and rhesus macaques is a difficult challenge As mentioned previously there are many factors that go into why conflict occurs This nuanced relationship requires thoughtfulness in management practices Behaviour and population management are the two main areas of management that humans will look into to try and minimize conflict protect wildlife and promote co existence br When looking at and altering behaviour crop raiding is potentially the most significant behaviour change that is crucial in reducing conflict rates One example is the implementation of guards in agricultural settings to chase off intruding monkeys using dogs slingshots and firecrackers This method is non lethal and can alter behavioural patterns of crop raiding monkeys Another strategy that farmers can employ is to plant alternative buffer crops which are unattractive to monkeys in high conflict zones such as along the edges of macaque habitats In urban settings planting food trees within city periphery and country parks aim to discourage macaques from entering nearby residential areas for food br Better establishing tourism and urban behaviour in areas that have population of rhesus macaques as means to facilitate better relationship In areas of tourism human behaviour is necessary to prevent conflict One method of this is to introduce public education programs as well as restrict visitors to specific viewing platforms with the goal to minimize physical proximity An important aspect is enforcing no feed regulations that only allow provisioning to be performed by trained staff at scheduled times Regulating visitor behaviours that provoke aggressive responses from macaques including noise regulation greatly benefits conflict reduction Replacing food conditioned behaviours established by human visitors and further human education will greatly aid in returning co existence between rhesus macaques and humans br A method of population management is translocation Translocation of problem macaques in urban rhesus communities in India has been employed as a non lethal solution to human macaque conflicts Translocation can be seen as a short term fix due to the fact that they have the potential to return and other rhesus macaques populations may take their place As well translocation can be inappropriate when there is a lack of suitable habitat to move animals because of anthropogenic habitat modification Before translocation occurs there must be a cost benefit appraisal of relative costs should be done to quantify the resources it will take An in depth understanding of issues prior to translocation is vital for positive effects to occur Recognizing landscape health and productivity is the first step before making management decisions br Another tool of population management is found in sterilisation and or contraceptive programmes that represent an alternative management practice Fertility control looks to be a feasible management tool for reducing human macaque conflict because it avoids the extermination of the animals and avoids costs and problems associated with translocation Although there is potential for sterilization and general fertility control to be positive there is limited research and understanding of the long term effects of sterilization programs and its effectiveness br br br In science br br The rhesus macaque is well known to science Due to its relatively easy upkeep in captivity wide availability and closeness to humans anatomically and physiologically it has been used extensively in medical and biological research on human and animal health related topics It has given its name to the Rh factor one of the elements of a person s blood group by the discoverers of the factor Karl Landsteiner and Alexander Wiener The rhesus macaque was also used in the well known experiments on maternal deprivation carried out in the s by controversial comparative psychologist Harry Harlow Other medical breakthroughs facilitated by the use of the rhesus macaque include br br development of the rabies smallpox and polio vaccines br creation of drugs to manage HIV AIDS br understanding of the female reproductive cycle and development of the embryo and the propagation of embryonic stem cells br The U S Army the U S Air Force and NASA launched rhesus macaques into outer space during the s and s and the Soviet Russian space program launched them into space as recently as on the Bion missions Albert II became the first primate and first mammal in space during a U S V rocket suborbital flight on June and died on impact when a parachute failed br Another rhesus monkey Able was launched on a suborbital spaceflight in and was among the first living beings along with Miss Baker a squirrel monkey on the same mission to travel in space and return alive br On October the rhesus macaque became the first cloned primate with the birth of Tetra January had the birth of ANDi the first transgenic primate ANDi carries foreign genes originally from a jellyfish br Though most studies of the rhesus macaque are from various locations in northern India some knowledge of the natural behavior of the species comes from studies carried out on a colony established by the Caribbean Primate Research Center of the University of Puerto Rico on the island of Cayo Santiago off Puerto Rico No predators are on the island and humans are not permitted to land except as part of the research programmes The colony is provisioned to some extent but about half of its food comes from natural foraging br Rhesus macaques like many macaques carry the herpes B virus This virus does not typically harm the monkey but is very dangerous to humans in the rare event that it jumps species for example in the death of Yerkes National Primate Research Center researcher Elizabeth Griffin br br br Genome sequencing br br Work on the genome of the rhesus macaque was completed in making the species the second nonhuman primate whose genome was sequenced Humans and macaques apparently share about of their DNA sequence and shared a common ancestor roughly million years ago The rhesus macaque has pairs of chromosomes br Comparison of rhesus macaques chimpanzees and humans revealed the structure of ancestral primate genomes positive selection pressure and lineage specific expansions and contractions of gene families The goal is to reconstruct the history of every gene in the human genome said Evan Eichler University of Washington Seattle DNA from different branches of the primate tree will allow us to trace back the evolutionary changes that occurred at various time points leading from the common ancestors of the primate clade to Homo sapiens said Bruce Lahn University of Chicago br After the human and chimpanzee genomes were sequenced and compared it was usually impossible to tell whether differences were the result of the human or chimpanzee gene changing from the common ancestor After the rhesus macaque genome was sequenced three genes could be compared If two genes were the same they were presumed to be the original gene br The chimpanzee and human genome diverged million years ago They have identity and many conserved regulatory regions Comparing the macaque and human genomes further identified evolutionary pressure and gene function Like the chimpanzee changes were on the level of gene rearrangements rather than single mutations Frequent insertions deletions changes in the order and number of genes and segmental duplications near gaps centromeres and telomeres occurred So macaque chimpanzee and human chromosomes are mosaics of each other br Some normal gene sequences in healthy macaques and chimpanzees cause profound disease in humans For example the normal sequence of phenylalanine hydroxylase in macaques and chimpanzees is the mutated sequence responsible for phenylketonuria in humans So humans must have been under evolutionary pressure to adopt a different mechanism Some gene families are conserved or under evolutionary pressure and expansion in all three primate species while some are under expansion uniquely in human chimpanzee or macaque For example cholesterol pathways are conserved in all three species and other primate species In all three species immune response genes are under positive selection and genes of T cell mediated immunity signal transduction cell adhesion and membrane proteins generally Genes for keratin which produce hair shafts were rapidly evolving in all three species possibly because of climate change or mate selection The X chromosome has three times more rearrangements than other chromosomes The macaque gained genes by duplication Triangulation of human chimpanzee and macaque sequences showed expansion of gene families in each species br The PKFP gene important in sugar fructose metabolism is expanded in macaques possibly because of their high fruit diet So are genes for the olfactory receptor cytochrome P which degrades toxins and CCL L CCL associated in humans with HIV susceptibility Immune genes are expanded in macaques relative to all four great ape species The macaque genome has major histocompatibility genes three times those of human This has clinical significance because the macaque is used as an experimental model of the human immune system br In humans the preferentially expressed antigen of melanoma PRAME gene family is expanded It is actively expressed in cancers but normally is testis specific possibly involved in spermatogenesis The PRAME family has members on human chromosome In the macaque it has eight and has been very simple and stable for millions of years The PRAME family arose in translocations in the common mouse primate ancestor million years ago and is expanded on mouse chromosome br DNA microarrays are used in macaque research For example Michael Katze of University of Washington Seattle infected macaques with and modern influenzas The DNA microarray showed the macaque genomic response to human influenza on a cellular level in each tissue Both viruses stimulated innate immune system inflammation but the flu stimulated stronger and more persistent inflammation causing extensive tissue damage and it did not stimulate the interferon pathway The DNA response showed a transition from innate to adaptive immune response over seven days br The full sequence and annotation of the macaque genome is available on the Ensembl genome browser br br br Conservation status br The rhesus macaque is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List and estimated to exist in large numbers it is tolerant of a broad range of habitats including urban environments It has the largest natural range of any non human primate The Thai population is locally threatened In addition to habitat destruction and agricultural encroachment pet releases of the different species into existing troops are diluting the gene pool and putting its genetic integrity at risk Despite the wealth of information on its ecology and behaviour little attention has been paid to its demography or population status which can pose a risk for future Rhesus macaque populations The extension of its distributional limits by approximately km sq mi in southeast India caused population stress on other species This range extension has been caused by human intervention tactics whereby village translocation occurs from urban conflict ridden areas br br br See also br Girneys br br br br br br External links br br ARKive images and movies of the rhesus macaque Macaca mulatta br Brain maps
