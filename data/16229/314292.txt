The Sukhoi Su Russian NATO reporting name Flanker E M is the designation for two improved derivatives of the Su air defence fighter They are single seat twin engine supermaneuverable air superiority fighters designed by the Sukhoi Design Bureau and built by Sukhoi br The type was originally developed by the Soviet Union from the Su and was known as the Su M It incorporated canards and a multi function radar giving it multi role capabilities The first prototype made its maiden flight in June Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union Sukhoi re designated it as the Su to attract export orders Fourteen aircraft were produced and used for tests and demonstrations one example had thrust vectoring engines and was in turn redesignated the Su A sole Su UB two seat trainer was also built in the late s that resembled the Su MK family br In Sukhoi embarked on a second deep modernization of the Su to serve as an interim export aircraft awaiting the development of the Sukhoi PAK FA Su program Also known as the Su this version incorporates technology from the PAK FA program and has a redesigned cockpit and weapons control system and features thrust vectoring engines in place of the canards The type made its first flight in February Although it was designed for export the Russian Air Force became the launch customer in with the production version designated Su S China s People s Liberation Army Air Force has also placed orders br br br Design and development br br br Upgraded Su br The first aircraft design to receive the Su designation had its origins in the early s at a time when the Su was being introduced into service with the Soviet Armed Forces The definitive production version of the Su which had the factory code of T S started mass serial production with the Komsomolsk on Amur Aircraft Production Association KnAAPO in The following year this Su version reached initial operational readiness with the Soviet Air Defence Forces Having begun work on an upgraded Su variant in the Sukhoi Design Bureau was instructed in December by the Soviet Council of Ministers to use the Su as the basis for the development of the Su M T M Nikolay Nikitin would lead the design effort throughout much of the project s existence under the oversight of General Director Mikhail Simonov who had been the chief designer of the Su along with Mikhail Pogosyan br br While sharing broadly the blended wing body design of the Su the Su M is visibly distinguished from the basic version by the addition of canards which are small lifting surfaces ahead of the wings First tested in using an experimental aircraft the canards in complement with the reshaped wing leading edge extension redirected the airflow in such a way so as to eliminate buffeting at high angles of attack and allowed the airframe to sustain g manoeuvres as opposed to g on the Su without additional structural reinforcement More importantly when working with the relaxed stability design and the accompanying fly by wire flight control system the aerodynamic layout improved the aircraft s manoeuvrability and enabled it to briefly fly with its nose past the vertical while maintaining forward momentum Because of this theoretically during combat the pilot could pitch the Su M up degrees in under two seconds and fire missiles at the target Other notable visible changes compared to the T S design included taller vertical tails provisions for in flight refuelling and the use of two wheel nose undercarriage to support the heavier airframe br Besides the increase in manoeuvrability another feature that distinguished the Su M from the original design was the new weapons control system The centrepiece of this system was the multi function N Bars literally Leopard phased array radar with pulse Doppler tracking that allowed it to detect targets below the horizon First installed on the third prototype the radar transformed the Su M from simply being an air defence fighter into a multi role aircraft capable of attacking ground targets Compared to the N Myech Sword radar of the Su which could track targets and only direct two missiles towards one target at a time the new radar could track fifteen targets and direct missiles towards six of them simultaneously The extra weight of the N radar at the front of the aircraft necessitated the addition of the canards engineers would only later discover the aerodynamic advantages of these devices In addition an N self defence radar was housed in the rearward projecting tail boom making the aircraft the first in the world to have such a radar Other changes to the aircraft included the use of uprated turbofan engines as well as the increased use of lightweight composites and aluminium lithium alloys in the aircraft s structure br br br Testing and demonstration br In Sukhoi started converting the first prototype designated T M from a T S airframe at its experimental plant in Moscow Although it had canards the first prototype like several subsequent aircraft lacked the many physical alterations of the new design It made its first flight after conversion on June piloted by Oleg Tsoi followed by the second prototype in January Following the conversions of the two Su M prototypes the actual production of the aircraft was transferred to the country s Far East where it was carried out by KnAAPO The third aircraft T M which was the first new built Su M and first to be constructed by KnAAPO made its first flight in April By then the Soviet Union had disintegrated and the ensuing economic crisis in Russia throughout the s meant that the original plan to mass produce the aircraft between and was abandoned with the aircraft to serve as experimental test beds to validate the canards the flight control system and thrust vectoring technology In total two prototypes nine flying pre production and three production aircraft were constructed by the production aircraft were delivered in to the Russian Air Force for weapons testing br br By the time of the disintegration of the Soviet Union Sukhoi had been demonstrating the Su M to senior defence and government officials With its debut to a Western audience at the Farnborough Airshow the company redesignated the aircraft as Su The aircraft subsequently made flying demonstrations overseas in an effort to attract export orders starting in November with Dubai where Viktor Pugachev flew it in a mock aerial engagement with an Su MK in front of spectators The aircraft then flew in Berlin and Paris and would be a regular feature at Moscow s MAKS Air Show The Russian government cleared the aircraft for export during Sukhoi s unsuccessful sales campaign in South Korea during the late s and early s the company also marketed the aircraft to Brazil China and the United Arab Emirates br As the flight test programme of the Su M proceeded engineers discovered that the pilot failed to maintain active control of the aircraft during certain manoeuvres such as the Pugachev s Cobra The eleventh Su M T M was therefore equipped with thrust vectoring engine nozzles in and the resultant Su technology demonstrator made its first flight on April It also tested the enhanced N M radar as did the twelfth developmental Su M The Su s ability to maintain a high angle of attack while flying at close to zero airspeed attracted considerable press attention It later received different engines and updated fly by wire controls and cockpit systems for evaluation br Apart from the single seat design a two seat aircraft was also constructed Working in cooperation with Sukhoi KnAAPO s own engineers designed the Su UB so as to combine thrust vectoring engines with features of the Su M Modified from an Su MKK airframe the aircraft made its first flight on August and afterwards served as an avionics test bed While the original Su M never entered mass production due to a lack of funding Sukhoi refined the Su M s use of canards and the Su s thrust vectoring technology and later applied them to the Su MKI two seat fighter for the Indian Air Force The tenth Su M T M also served as a test bed for the Saturn AL F engine that is intended for the Sukhoi Su previously known under the acronym PAK FA jet fighter br br br Modernization br br With the need to update Russia s aging fleet of Su aircraft Sukhoi and KnAAPO in started integrating glass cockpits and improved weapons control systems to accommodate a greater variety of weapons to existing air force aircraft The Su SM as the modified aircraft is called made its first flight in December The initial success of this project led Sukhoi in December to proceed with a follow up deep modernization programme Known internally as T BM the programme was aimed at a more thorough redesign of the airframe to narrow the qualitative gap between Russian aircraft and foreign fourth generation aircraft The resultant design also designated Su would serve as an interim solution pending the introduction of the PAK FA fifth generation fighter which eventually became the Su many features of which the aircraft would incorporate Initially the aircraft was primarily aimed at the export market being offered by KnAAPO as a single seat alternative to the two seat Su MK variants built by Irkutsk Aviation Plant IAP br In many respects the T BM design outwardly resembles the Su more than the Su M During tests of the thrust vectoring engines and the Su M s aerodynamic layout Sukhoi had concluded that the loss of manoeuvrability due to the removal of the canards the design of which imposed a weight penalty on the airframe could be compensated for by the addition of thrust vectoring nozzles Industry progress in the fields of avionics and radars has also reduced the weight and size of such components which shifts the centre of gravity of an aircraft rearward Accordingly we saw SW designers removed the canards and the dorsal air brake found on the Su M the size of the vertical tails aft cockpit hump and tail boom were also reduced With such changes as well as the increased use of aluminium and titanium alloys and composites designers had reduced the empty weight of the aircraft while maintaining a similar maximum take off weight to the Su M br br While the Su M design had the avionics to give the aircraft the nominal designation as a multi role fighter flight tests with the Russian Air Force revealed difficulties in deploying the aircraft s armament efficiently According to Aviation Week Space Technology air force pilots described weapons trials with the aircraft in Akhtubinsk and Lipetsk as a negative experience with a particular emphasis on the layout of the cockpit and its adverse impact on the workload of the single pilot Designers test pilots and avionics software specialists therefore worked together to redesign the cockpit and its attendant systems and improve the human machine interface The information management system of aircraft s avionics suite had been changed so that it now has two digital computers which process information from the flight and weapons control systems The information is then displayed on two in in cm cm multi function liquid crystal displays which replaced the smaller multi function cathode ray tube displays found on the Su M The pilot can also view critical flight information on the head up display and is equipped with Hands On Throttle And Stick HOTAS controls br The Su employs the N Irbis E Snow Leopard passive electronically scanned array PESA radar which is a further development of the N M radar that had been evaluated on Su M test beds and constitutes the core of the Su s weapons control system It is capable of detecting an aerial target up to km mi nmi away and can track thirty airborne targets and engage eight of them simultaneously in addition the multi function radar is capable of providing high resolution images of the ground using synthetic aperture mode The aircraft is equipped with an OLS optoelectronic targeting system ahead of the cockpit to provide other forms of tracking including infra red search and track For defences against enemy tracking the Su is equipped with the L M Khibiny M electronic countermeasure system while engineers have applied radar absorbent materials to the engine inlets and front stages of the engine compressor to halve the Su s frontal radar cross section and minimise the detection range of enemy radars The radar cross section of the Su is reportedly to square meters The multi role Su can deploy air to air missiles of up to kilometre mi range and can carry the heavy Oniks anti ship cruise missile as well as a multitude of air to ground weaponry br br The Su is powered by a pair of Saturn AL F S turbofan engines formerly known as izdeliye Product S A highly upgraded variant of the AL F the AL F S is closely related to the Su s Saturn AL F izdeliye differing primarily in the engine control system The engines are equipped with thrust vectoring nozzles which have their rotational axes canted at an angle the nozzles operate in one plane for pitch but the canting allows the aircraft to produce both roll and yaw by vectoring each engine nozzle differently this configuration was first implemented on the Su MKI and is also used on the Su The Su s thrust vectoring system and integrated flight and propulsion control systems allow the aircraft to attain g manoeuvres and supermaneuverability enabling it to perform post stall manoeuvres at low speeds This differs from Western air combat doctrine which emphasises the maintenance of a fighter aircraft s kinetic energy The engine gives the Su the limited ability to sustain supersonic speed above Mach without the use of afterburners also known as supercruise br br br Testing and production br br Following the completion of design work KnAAPO constructed the first prototype which was finished in mid The prototype Su was then transferred to the Gromov Flight Research Institute at Zhukovsky Airfield in preparation for its maiden flight On February Sergey Bogdan took the aircraft aloft for its minute first flight from Zhukovsky Bogdan later piloted the second prototype on its maiden flight on October from KnAAPO s Dzyomgi Airport The flight test programme was expected to involve three flying prototypes but on April a day before its scheduled maiden flight the fourth Su there s a static test aircraft crashed during a taxi run at Dzyomgi Airport The aircraft struck a barrier at the end of the runway and was destroyed by fire the pilot ejected and sustained burn injuries The cause of the accident was the failure of the engine management system as a result of which the afterburner was not turned off br Although the Su project was aimed primarily at the export market the actual launch order for Su S aircraft was placed by the Russian Defence Ministry at the MAKS Air Show as part of a larger deal worth US billion for fighter aircraft During the early stages of the flight test programme Sukhoi estimated that there was such a market for aircraft with a particular emphasis on Latin America Southeast Asia and the Middle East Some of the candidate countries such as Algeria Malaysia and India were already operators of the Su MK family As the aircraft was to be available for export starting in During the type s international debut at the Paris Air Show Mikhail Pogosyan General Director of Sukhoi s parent company United Aircraft Corporation stated that there was an estimated demand for aircraft split evenly between the domestic and export markets It was not until the end of when the first export contract was signed with China by then the Russian government had placed a follow up order for aircraft br Apart from the launch order at the MAKS Air Show the Russian government and the state owned VEB development bank agreed to provide Sukhoi with capital for the aircraft s production In November KnAAPO which was renamed KnAAZ in after it became part of the Sukhoi Company started manufacturing the first production aircraft the general assembly of which was completed in October by then pilots and engineers had successfully completed preliminary tests of the aircraft s systems The first Su S took its maiden flight in May and would be delivered along with other aircraft to Akhtubinsk to start state joint tests with the Defence Ministry to prepare the aircraft for service Because production of the Su S occurred alongside trials some early production aircraft were later modified as a result of such tests In December United Aircraft Corporation has reported th serial Su S was produced at the Komsomolsk on Amur Aircraft Plant br br br Operational history br br br Russia br In three production Su Ms were delivered to the air force s th State Flight Test Centre named for V P Chkalov GLITs at Vladimirovka air base Akhtubinsk to perform weapons trials In the air force decided to transfer several Su Ms to re equip the Russian Knights aerobatics team and so the team s pilots took familiarisation flights with the aircraft The three production and two other pre production Su Ms arrived at the team s Kubinka air base near Moscow in However they were used as a source of spare parts for other aircraft in the demonstration fleet br br Initially one static and three flyable prototypes bort no were built between and The third one bort no was later destroyed when it crashed into a barrier during its taxi runs br The first contract for production aircraft was signed at the MAKS Air show in Moscow In May Sukhoi delivered the first Su S to Akhtubinsk to conduct state joint tests with the Defence Ministry to prepare for operational service The first of two stages of the trials commenced in August By March the two prototypes and four production aircraft were conducting flights to test the type s technical characteristics which were assessed by the end of that year to have generally complied with requirements A batch of six production aircraft was handed over in December In February five of these at the Gromov Flight Research Institute in Zhukovsky started the second stage of the trials focusing on the Su s weapons and combat maneuverability br Twelve production Su Ss were delivered in December followed by another twelve production aircraft in February ten of which were handed over to the rd Fighter Aviation Regiment stationed in the Far East with the remaining two tasked with carrying out the final phase of state joint tests The handover marked its official entry into operational service Several Su Ss were later transferred to Lipetsk to further develop combat tactics and to train service personnel The Russia s Su Ss are also permanently based at Besovets air base near the Finnish border and at Centralnaya Uglovaya air base near Vladivostok br br The introduction of the Su S into the service with the Russian Aerospace Forces is a part of the Russia s state armament programme for that was formulated following the war with Georgia in with an aim to significantly increase the number of modern military equipment in the Russian Armed Forces The aircraft is delivered alongside the Su M and Su SM and the heavier Su strike aircraft The first two are domestic variants of KnAAPO s Su MK and Irkut s Su MKI two seat export aircraft According to reports the simultaneous acquisition of three fighter derivatives of the original Su was to support the two aircraft manufacturers amidst a slump in export orders The Su M serves as a trainer aircraft for the Su br The Su S attained full operational capability FOC in late br In July the Russian Knights aerobatic team received eight new Su Ss as an addition to its previously acquired Su SM aircraft br The th Combat Training and Combat Application Center also known as an aggressor squadron of the Russian Aerospace Forces has received three new Su S on September br br br Russian military intervention in Syria br br In January Russia made the first combat deployment of the Su S when it sent four aircraft to Syria This occurred following the increased tensions between Russia and Turkey as result of reported incursions by Russian aircraft into the Turkish airspace and the shooting down of a Russian Su bomber by a Turkish F fighter in November Its combat deployment to Syria helped to find and subsequently resolve number of problems for example with the aircraft avionics Su s in Syria have been seen carrying unguided bombs with Russian sources claiming that the Su has carried out strikes against ground targets using guided weapons br br On August two Russian Aerospace Forces Su Ss operating from the Khmeimim Air Base intercepted two Turkish Air Force F s over the southern Idlib and forced them to leave the Syrian airspace Russian Su Ss again intercepted several Israeli aircraft over southern Syria on September and prevented them from carrying out airstrikes Another interception allegedly occurred on September when two Russian Su Ss intercepted Israeli aircraft preparing to attack suburbs of Damascus On October a Turkish F fighter was intercepted by Russian Su Ss and forced to retreat as it was attempting to bomb the Syrian Democratic Forces s headquarters in Manbij On November Russian Su Ss intercepted an Israeli fighter during airstrikes on Damascus On December several Israeli aircraft were intercepted by Russian Su Ss and forced to retreat during an attempt to bomb the T Airbase br br br Russian invasion of Ukraine br br Russian Su SM and Su S fighters were used for air superiority missions during the war At least seven air to air victories were reported over Ukrainian fighters and one over a Ukrainian Naval Aviation Mil Mi br On April a Russian Su S was shot down by Ukrainian forces with the pilot ejecting and being captured the pilot stated that his Su S was shot down near Izyum while battling Ukrainian air defenses On May the Ukraine Defence Ministry confirmed that Colonel Ihor Bedzay the deputy head of the Ukrainian Navy Aviation Office was killed in action His Mi PS was shot down by a Russian Su br On July the Ukrainian Air Force command claimed that a Su was shot down by Ukrainian air defences near Kakhovka but at the time there were no photos confirming the loss In early February photos of the crash site emerged confirming the crashed plane was an Su S br On May a Ukrainian MIM Patriot missile shot down a Su fighter over Bryansk region On May another Ukrainian MIM Patriot missile shot down a Su over Bryansk region br On September a Russian S surface to air missile shot down a friendly Su near the Tokmak region The preliminary report suggests the S missile s fire control radar could not identify friend or foe leading to a friendly fire incident that downed the Su br Ministry of Defense of Ukraine claimed that Ukrainian air defences shot down two Su s in February According to them this was its greatest results in downing Russian jets since October when they claimed to have downed ten Su s and one A that month br According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies Russia has lost more than five Su fighters since the beginning of the Ukraine war either to friendly fire crashed or Ukrainian forces shot down the aircraft using Western supplied air defences br br br China br During the early s sales arrangements for the Su M were discussed with China In Sukhoi officials announced a co production proposal contingent on Beijing s agreement to purchase aircraft However the Russian Foreign Ministry allegedly blocked the sale of the Su M and Tupolev Tu M bomber over concerns about the arrangements for Chinese production of the Su derivatives br In November China became the Su s first export customer when the Russian and Chinese governments signed a contract worth billion to buy aircraft for the People s Liberation Army Air Force This deal drew international commentaries due to its significance David Ochmanek of RAND Corporation said the deal serves both countries as Russia relied on foreign sales to maintain its military production capacity while China sought to enhance its military capabilities through the advanced weapon platforms such as the Su However the low number of purchases also signified that the deal was symbolic in nature as the two countries are still competing over influence in Central Asia according to Moritz Rudolf of Mercator Institute for China Studies Ben Moores of IHS believed the Su deal would be the last major order from China as the Sino Russian military cooperation saw very little action or real substance China doesn t need Russia as much as Russia needs China br Chinese officials had reportedly first shown interest in the Su in it was not until Zhuhai Airshow that Alexander Mikheyev of the Rosoboronexport the Russian state agency responsible for the export and import of defence products signified that Russia was ready to start talks with China over the Su Russian officials publicly confirmed that talks had been going on in when a protocol agreement on the purchase was signed There were subsequent reports of the two countries signing a contract and of imminent deliveries but negotiations would not actually conclude until br Sales discussions were protracted due to intellectual property rights concerns China had reverse engineered the Su SK and Su to create the J B and J respectively there were fears of China copying the airframe and offer the copied design on the export market At one stage Rosoboronexport demanded that China issue a legally binding guarantee against copying Chinese industry was reportedly interested in the AL F S engine and Irbis E radar According to The Diplomat China held a specific interest in the Su s engine and was already test flying the J D which reportedly has less range payload and maneuverability than the Su but has an active electronically scanned array radar instead of the less advanced PESA radar of the Su Rosoboronexport insisted on China purchasing a minimum of aircraft to offset risks of copying after the Kremlin intervened in the minimum quantity was lowered to Another problem was China s insistence that the Su include Chinese made components and avionics The Kremlin again intervened and conceded to this demand allowed the deal to proceed it was viewed as a major concession since the sales of such components are reportedly lucrative The contract did not include any technology transfer br The Chinese military received the first four aircraft in December Followed by the first delivery the People s Liberation Army s website opined that with the J s commissioning Russia understood that the Su would lose its value on the Chinese market in the near future we hope very much that Su will be the last combat aircraft China imports China has received a second batch of ten aircraft in and another ten in The Su S entered service with PLAAF in April and are based in Guangdong province in southeast China In June Russia offered China a second batch of Su s According to Asia Times Chinese source remarked further purchase of Su is not feasible as Russian jet offers little value over the Chinese J due to the latter having superior radar avionics and other equipment br On September the U S imposed sanctions on China s Equipment Development Department and its director Li Shangfu for engaging in significant transactions with Rosoboronexport specifically naming China s purchase of ten Su s in as well as S surface to air missile system related equipment in br br br Potential operators br br br United Arab Emirates br In the mid s the United Arab Emirates evaluated the Su M but later acquired the Mirage due to the country s close relationship with France In February the country was to sign a preliminary agreement for the Su purchase and also signed an agreement with Rostec Russia s state owned corporation responsible for the development of advanced industrial products to develop a fifth generation aircraft based on the MiG br br br India br India has been reluctant to order the Sukhoi HAL FGFA due to high cost and it has been reported that India and Russia are studying an upgrade to the Su with stealth technology similar to the F Silent Eagle as a more affordable alternative to the FGFA Su The aircraft is competing with other aircraft in a fresh tender which is referred as MMRCA in the Indian media for the procurement of multi role combat aircraft br br br Algeria br According to Kommersant the Algerian military had requested a Su for testing in February it was reported the country was satisfied with the fighter s flight characteristics and so Moscow is waiting for a formal application On December Algeria has reportedly signed a contract for aircraft as part of large military deal that also includes purchase of Su and Su fighters However neither Russian nor Algerian governments ever confirmed that such deal exists br br br Turkey br In July Russia offered the Su to Turkey after it was removed from the F programme by United States due to the purchase of the S missile system CEO of Rostec Sergey Chemezov said If our Turkish colleagues express a desire we are ready to work out the deliveries of Su fighter jets Previously in May Sergey Chemezov had said that Russia was ready to cooperate with Turkey on the export and local production of the Su br br br Iran br Following the Russian purchase of Iranian suicide drones during the invasion in Ukraine the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force IRIAF is reportedly considering the procurement of the Sukhoi Su in exchange for further delivery of ammunition drones and ballistic missiles to the Russian Armed Forces according to US officials It was also reported that training of Iranian pilots has begun in Spring and that the aircraft may be delivered in The deal may include Su s originally built for Egypt but no official reports of delivery have emerged so far The deal was confirmed by Iranian state owned media Tasnim news agency on December and on January by an Iranian MP who said that supplies will begin in the spring and also said that Iran has ordered from Russia air defense and missile systems as well as helicopters br However in July the Iranian Defense Minister Mohammad Reza Gharaei Ashtiani made vague statements alluding that Iran is reconsidering the acquisition of the Su due to increasing investment towards indigenous fighter building capabilities leading to some sources to declare that the deal has collapsed Despite this the Iranian Air Force has received deliveries of the Yak advanced jet trainer which are used to train aspiring cadets before they graduate to actual fighter aircraft such as the Su The trainers have received IRIAF livery and serial numbers On November Iran s deputy defense minister announced that Iran had finalized a deal for the purchase of Su aircraft from Russia although further details on the quantity or timeline were not shared br br br Others br Following the deployment to Syria of several new Russian military systems various countries had reportedly expressed interest in the Su These countries included Algeria Egypt and Vietnam Other countries that had also expressed interest in the aircraft include Kazakhstan North Korea and Pakistan although a Russian official denied that the country was in talks with the latter about the Su Sudan has reportedly also expressed an interest in acquiring of the Su fighters during the Sudanese president Omar Hassan al Bashir s visitation of Moscow in November br br br Failed bids br br br Brazil br In the mid s Brazilian and Russian authorities conducted talks on the possible acquisition of the Su M In the Brazilian government launched the F X tender the objective of which was to procure at least aircraft to replace the Brazilian Air Force s ageing aircraft primarily the Mirage IIIs Since the Brazilian government was also looking to develop the country s aerospace and defence industries Sukhoi partnered with the Brazilian defence contractor Avibras during the tender The two companies submitted the Su M to the US million tender and included an offset agreement wherein the Brazilian industry would have participated in the manufacturing of certain aircraft equipment The tender was suspended in because of domestic political issues and then scrapped in pending the availability of new fighters The Su M was preferred over the next favourite the Mirage BR had the aircraft been purchased it would have been the first heavy fighter delivered to Latin America br With the tender relaunched in as the F X competition the Brazilian Defence Ministry looked to purchase at least aircraft with a potential for additional aircraft to replace the country s A Ms F BRs and Mirage IIIs Among the participants were the F A E F Super Hornet F BR JAS Gripen NG Dassault Rafale Eurofighter Typhoon and the modernized Su Although the Brazilian government eliminated the Su in Rosoboronexport subsequently offered to sell the country aircraft with full technology transfer as well as participation in the PAK FA programme In December the Gripen NG light fighter was selected because of its low cost and the transfer of technology to the Brazilian industry br br br Egypt br In March it was reported that Egypt would procure over two dozen Su s from Russia in a deal valued about US billion finalized in late Deliveries were expected to begin as early as or Deputy head of the Rosoboronexport Sergei Kornev denied the signing of any contract to supply Su s to Egypt U S Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned Egypt against buying Su s saying if those systems were to be purchased the CAATSA statute would require sanctions on the regime br On May Russia began Su production for Egypt and first five production aircraft took off from the KnAAZ plant on July By June in total aircraft were produced for Egypt Egyptian newspaper Arabo reported on January Egypt Algeria and Indonesia announced that they would cancel their Su orders with Russia In March an agreement with the US to sell variants of F Es to the Egyptian Air Force was announced which confirms that Egypt either abandoned or cancelled the Su deal and the planes originally produced for Egypt will be delivered to Iran instead A contract needs to be finalized after price and delivery date are determined br br br Indonesia br In Russia offered the Su to Indonesia to replace its ageing F E Tiger II fleet The following year the Indonesian Ministry of Defense selected the Su ahead of the Eurofighter Typhoon Dassault Rafale F and Saab JAS Gripen the Defense Ministry cited the Indonesian Air Force s familiarity with the Su SK and Su MK as the reason for its selection By negotiations between the two parties over the Su had reached an advanced stage with the Indonesian government later agreed in principle to conduct a barter trade of agricultural products for a reported eleven aircraft In February Russia and Indonesia finalised a contract for aircraft worth billion The first delivery was expected in October but was delayed to br On March Bloomberg reported that Indonesia canceled the deal due to the US pressure and is instead looking to negotiate an order for F s On March Indonesia s Deputy Defense Minister Sakti Wahyu Trenggono confirmed that the government had not revoked the procurement despite facing unnamed obstacles On July Russian Ambassador to Indonesia Lyudmila Vorobieva stated that Indonesia s plan to buy Su s from Russia is still continuing In February the Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Air Force Air Chief Marshal Fadjar Prasetyo unveiled plans to purchase new aircraft such as F EX and Dassault Rafale while not mentioning the current status of the Su order However On December during a Press Tour and Media Gathering Fadjar Prasetyo has confirmed that the Su purchase will not go ahead Regarding the planned purchase of the Sukhoi Su Fadjar said it would be abandoned In June during a Ministry of Defense press conference it was stated that the Su program has been constrained by the threat of CAATSA and OFAC sanctions list from the United States br br br Others br In Russia submitted the Su M and Su for South Korea s F X programme which sought a aircraft replacement for the Republic of Korea Air Force s F D Es RF Cs and F E Fs The two Russian designs competed against the Dassault Rafale Eurofighter Typhoon and F K Slam Eagle Sukhoi proposed a design which featured a phased grid radar and thrust vectoring engines and offered full technology transfer as well as final assembly in South Korea The US billion contract would have been partially financed through a debt reduction deal on money Russia owed to South Korea However the Su M was eliminated early in the competition which was won by the F K br A country that had been reported to be a likely early export customer for the modernized Su was Venezuela The Venezuelan government of Hugo Ch vez in July placed an order for Su MK s to replace its fleet of F s that were subjected to a US arms embargo The aircraft were delivered to the Venezuelan Air Force from to The country was expected to follow up with a second order for the same type or make a purchase of the Su Despite subsequent reports that the Venezuelan government were interested in the aircraft and had placed an order for the Su br Libya was also expected to be an early export customer for to Su s along with other Russian weapons however the civil war in Libya and the resulting military intervention cancelled such plans Russia has also offered the modernized Su to India Malaysia and Greece no firm contracts have materialised with the first two countries having been occupied with other fighter projects and unlikely to procure the modernized Su br br br Variants br Su M Su br Single seat fighter design with a factory code of T M
