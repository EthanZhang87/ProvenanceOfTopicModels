Mortal Kombat is an American media franchise centered on a series of fighting video games originally developed by Midway Games in br The original Mortal Kombat arcade game spawned a franchise consisting of action adventure games a comic book series a card game films an animated TV series and a live action tour Mortal Kombat has become the best selling fighting game franchise worldwide and one of the highest grossing media franchises of all time br The series has a reputation for high levels of graphic violence including most notably its fatalities which are finishing moves that kill defeated opponents instead of knocking them out Controversies surrounding Mortal Kombat in part led to the creation of the Entertainment Software Rating Board ESRB video game rating system Early games in the series were noted for their realistic digitized sprites and an extensive use of palette swapping to create new characters Following Midway s bankruptcy the Mortal Kombat development team was acquired by Warner Bros Entertainment and re established as NetherRealm Studios br br br Gameplay br br The original three games and their updates Mortal Kombat Mortal Kombat II Mortal Kombat Ultimate Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat Trilogy are D fighting games The arcade cabinet versions of the first two used a joystick and five buttons high punch low punch high kick low kick and block Mortal Kombat and its updates added a sixth run button Characters in the early Mortal Kombat games play virtually identically to one another with the only major differences being their special moves Through the s the developer and publisher Midway Games kept their single styled fighting moves with four attack buttons for a different array of punches kicks and blocks Mortal Kombat was the first Mortal Kombat game in which the characters could move in three dimensions and the first to use D computer graphics From Deadly Alliance to Mortal Kombat Deception characters had three fighting styles per character two unarmed styles and one weapon style While most of the styles used in the series are based on real martial arts some are fictitious Goro s fighting styles for example are designed to take advantage of the fact that he has four arms For Armageddon fighting styles were reduced to a maximum of two per character generally one hand to hand combat style and one weapon style due to the sheer number of playable characters Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe dropped multiple fighting styles for most characters in favor of giving each character a wider variety of special moves s Mortal Kombat returned to a single D fighting plane although characters are rendered in D unlike previous Mortal Kombat games each of the controller s four attack buttons corresponds to one of the character s limbs the buttons thus becoming front punch back punch front kick and back kick front indicates the limb that is closer to the opponent and back indicates the limb that is farther away from the opponent br br Mortal Kombat Deception and Mortal Kombat Armageddon feature Konquest a free roaming action adventure mode Both games include distinct minigame modes such as Chess Kombat an action strategy game Two other bonus minigames Puzzle Kombat inspired by Puzzle Fighter and Motor Kombat inspired by Mario Kart feature super deformed versions of Mortal Kombat characters The games contain various unlockable content and hidden cheats br br br Finishing moves br br One of the most notable features of the Mortal Kombat series is its brutal and gruesome finishing moves known as Fatalities The basic Fatalities are finishing moves that allow the victorious characters to end a match by murdering their defeated defenseless opponent Usually Fatalities are exclusive to each character the exception being Mortal Kombat Armageddon which instead features Kreate A Fatality a feature that allows players to perform their own Fatalities by conducting a series of violent moves chosen from a pool that is common to all characters br Other finishing moves in the various Mortal Kombat games include Animalities introduced in Mortal Kombat in which the victor turns into an animal to violently finish off the opponent Brutality introduced in Ultimate Mortal Kombat which consists of bashing the opponent into pieces with a long combo of hits and Stage Fatalities Death Traps introduced in the original Mortal Kombat Pit Stage where the victor can uppercut their opponent off of the platform into a bed of spikes below later made more difficult in Mortal Kombat II by requiring a character specific button sequence utilizing parts of certain stages to execute a lethal finishing move such as a pool of acid Mortal Kombat Deception added the Hara Kiri a move that allows the loser to perform a suicidal finishing move giving way to a potential race between both players to see if the winner can finish off their opponent before they can kill themselves br There are two non violent finishing moves in the series which were introduced in Mortal Kombat II as a satire to controversies surrounding Mortal Kombat Friendship moves which result in a display of friendship towards the enemy instead of slaughter and Babalities which turn the opponent into a baby br br br Plot br The series takes place in a fictional universe consisting of numerous realms which according to in game backstories were created by an ancient eternal and ethereal pantheon of preternatural divine beings known as the Elder Gods The Mortal Kombat Deception manual described six of the realms as Earthrealm home to such legendary heroes as Liu Kang Kung Lao Sonya Blade Johnny Cage and Jax Briggs and under the protection of the Thunder God Raiden Netherrealm the fiery depths of which are inhospitable to all but the most vile a realm of demons and shadowy warriors such as Quan Chi and Noob Saibot Outworld a realm of constant strife which Emperor Shao Kahn claims as his own Seido the Realm of Order whose inhabitants prize structure and order above all else the Realm of Chaos whose inhabitants do not abide by any rules whatsoever and where constant turmoil and change are worshiped and Edenia which is known for its beauty artistic expression and the longevity of its inhabitants The Elder Gods decreed that the denizens of one realm could only conquer another realm by defeating the defending realm s greatest warriors in ten consecutive martial arts tournaments called Mortal Kombat br The first Mortal Kombat game takes place in Earthrealm Earth where seven different warriors with their own reasons for entering the tournament with the prize being the continued freedom of their realm under threat of a takeover by Outworld Among the established warriors were Liu Kang Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade With the help of the thunder god Raiden the Earthrealm warriors were victorious and Liu Kang became the new champion of Mortal Kombat In Mortal Kombat II unable to deal with his minion Shang Tsung s failure Outworld Emperor Shao Kahn lures the Earthrealm warriors to Outworld for a do over winner take all tournament where Liu Kang eventually defeats Shao Kahn By the time of Mortal Kombat Shao Kahn merged Edenia with his empire and revived its former queen Sindel in Earthrealm combining it with Outworld as well He attempts to invade Earthrealm but is ultimately defeated by Liu Kang once more After the Kahn s defeat Edenia was freed from his grasp and returned to a peaceful realm ruled by Princess Kitana The following game Mortal Kombat features the fallen elder god Shinnok attempting to conquer the realms and kill Raiden He is defeated by Liu Kang br In Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance the evil sorcerers Quan Chi and Shang Tsung join forces to conquer the realms killing series

The Dragon King Onaga former ruler of Outworld returned to merge all realms back together but was eventually defeated by the game s protagonist Shujinko br In Mortal Kombat Armageddon the titular catastrophe begins Centuries before the first Mortal Kombat Queen Delia foretold the realms would be destroyed because the power of all of the realms warriors would rise to such greatness that it would overwhelm and destabilize the realms triggering a destructive chain of events King Argus had his sons Taven and Daegon put into incubation so one day they can be awakened to save the realms from Armageddon by defeating a firespawn known as Blaze In the end Shao Kahn is the one who defeats Blaze and wins the war causing Armageddon br The crossover Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe does not share continuity with the other games After the simultaneous defeats of both Shao Kahn and the alien warlord Darkseid in the DC Universe causes both villains to fuse into the entity Dark Kahn both the Mortal Kombat and DC Universes begin to merge This brings the warriors and heroes into conflicts after suffering bouts of uncontrollable rage The heroes and villains of both universes repeatedly battle each other believing each other to be responsible for the catastrophe until only Raiden and Superman remain The two confront Dark Kahn and team up to defeat their common foe After Dark Kahn s defeat the two realms defuse with Shao Kahn and Darkseid trapped in each other s universes to face eternal imprisonment br In the Mortal Kombat soft reboot the battle of Armageddon culminated in only two survivors Shao Kahn and Raiden On the verge of death by the former s hand the latter sent visions to his past self in a last ditch attempt to prevent this outcome Upon receiving the visions the past Raiden attempts to alter the timeline to avert Armageddon amidst the tenth Mortal Kombat tournament during the original game His attempts to alter history mean that events play out differently to the original series While he succeeds in preventing Shao Kahn s victory with help from the Elder Gods he accidentally kills Liu Kang in self defense and loses most of his allies to Queen Sindel leaving Earthrealm vulnerable to Shinnok and Quan Chi s machinations br Mortal Kombat X sees Shinnok and Quan Chi enacting their plan leading an army of undead revenants of those that were killed in Shao Kahn s invasion of Earthrealm A team of warriors led by Raiden Johnny Cage Kenshi Takahashi and Sonya Blade oppose them and in the ensuing battle Shinnok is imprisoned within his amulet and

into fighting across multiple timelines as she fears their combined power Despite her interference and attacks by her minions Raiden gives Liu Kang his power turning him into a god of fire and thunder so he can defeat Kronika In the Aftermath expansion it is revealed that Liu Kang inadvertently destroyed Kronika s crown the item needed to restart the timeline Her defeat also revives Shang Tsung who was absent in the base game due to his imprisonment by Kronika To recover the crown Liu Kang sends Shang Tsung and other Earthrealm heroes back in time to obtain it before Kronika though Shang Tsung manipulates events so that he comes into possession of the crown At the end either Liu Kang or Shang Tsung becomes the Keeper of Time depending on the player s choice who they want to fight with in the final battle and the outcome of the battle br Mortal Kombat the second reboot on the series timeline sees Lord Liu Kang has created his New Era and strives to maintain peace between all the realms However his plans begin to unravel when Shang Tsung and Quan Chi despite his attempts to have them de powered and unable to cause trouble ally with General Shao in order to conquer Earthrealm and Outworld Investigating the matter Liu Kang discovers that the Shang Tsung from MK Aftermath is responsible as Liu Kang s attempts to access the Hourglass power resulted in a break where every

Boys and the Joker who was previously in Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe and Peacemaker more specifically the character from the DC Extended Universe and DC Universe both from DC Comics br br br Development br br br Origins br Mortal Kombat started development in with four people Ed Boon programming John Tobias art and story John Vogel graphics and Dan Forden sound design According to Mortal Kombat actors Richard Divizio and Daniel Pesina the first game began as a ninja themed project by John Tobias a young new employee of Midway Games at the time and them as well as Carlos Pesina however their pitch to Tobias boss Ed Boon was rejected by the management of Midway Midway was approached to create a video game adaptation of the then upcoming film Universal Soldier starring Jean Claude Van Damme and Tobias imagined a fighting game featuring a digitized version of Van Damme Intending to make a game a lot more hard edge a little bit more serious a little bit more like Enter the Dragon or Bloodsport than contemporary cartoonish fighting games Tobias and Boon decided to continue their project even after the deal to use the Bloodsport license fell through The first of Mortal Kombat characters Johnny Cage Daniel Pesina became a spoof on the whole Van Damme situation Divizio credits himself with convincing Tobias to go back to the original idea and trying again br It was the success of Capcom s Street Fighter II The World Warrior that convinced Midway Games to let the team produce their own arcade fighting game the genre chosen by Tobias for his game as to let him use as large digitized sprites as possible but there was not much influence by Street Fighter II on the project According to Tobias who cited s Karate Champ as an inspiration they intentionally worked on making a game different from Capcom s title in every way Besides the digitized characters that differentiated it from its contemporaries hand drawn ones one stark difference was in the very high amount of blood and violence Capcom s senior director of communications later compared Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat by asking if the interviewer preferred the precision and depth of Street Fighter or the gore and comedy of Mortal Kombat and also stated that the Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat rivalry was considered similar to the Coke and Pepsi rivalry in the s br br John Tobias said that his inspirations for the game s story and characters came from Chinese mythology and some of the stories and rumored events about the Shaolin monks Regarding the film Big Trouble in Little China Tobias wrote that although the film kind of Americanized my obsession for supernatural kung fu films from China it was not my biggest influence My biggest influences came from Tsui Hark films Zu Warriors The Swordsman We had to get them from bootleggers in Chicago s Chinatown In he said about their general process of designing characters for the series First we figure out the type like she or he and will she he be big or small Then we ll get the theme of the characters like ninja or robot Then we ll design the costume and while doing that we create the storyline and how s he fits into the universe Then we ll find an actor that kinda resembles our character Tobias writing and artistic input on the series ended around following the release of Mortal Kombat In he said I knew exactly what I was going to do with a future story A few years ago I wrote a sort of sequel to the first MK film and an advancement to the game s mythological roots br The title Mortal Kombat was the idea of pinball designer Steve Ritchie following difficulties trademarking the original title of Mortal Combat Since then the series often intentionally misspells various words with the letter K in place of C for the hard C sound According to Boon during the Mortal Kombat games development they usually spell such words correctly only making the substitution when one of the developers suggests it br br br Graphics br The characters of the original Mortal Kombat and its initial sequels were created using digitized sprites mostly based on filmed actors as opposed to hand drawn graphics Mortal Kombat games were known for their extensive use of palette swapping which was used for the ninja characters many of the most popular characters have originated as palette swaps In the first game the male ninja fighters were essentially the same character only the colors of their attire fighting stance and special techniques mark a difference Later games added further ninjas based on the same model as well as several female ninja color swap characters initially also using just one base model All of them gradually became very different characters in the following installments of the series Eventually Mortal Kombat brought the series into D replacing the digitized fighters of previous games with polygon models animated using motion capture technology br br br Hidden content br Most series releases included secret characters secret games and other Easter eggs The original game contained the hidden fighter Reptile who could be fought by players if they fulfilled an exact set of requirements A counter for ERMACS short for error macros on the game s audits screen was additionally interpreted by players as referring to a second hidden character named Ermac Midway denied the character s existence in the series before adding him to Ultimate Mortal Kombat in response to the player rumors and feedback br Some Easter eggs originated from in jokes among the series developers One example is Toasty which was included in Mortal Kombat II in the form of an image of sound designer Dan Forden that randomly appeared in a lower corner of the screen after a player landed an uppercut Hidden games of Pong and Galaga were included in Mortal Kombat II and Mortal Kombat respectively br br br Games br br br Main series br The original Mortal Kombat game was released by Midway in arcades during October and has
