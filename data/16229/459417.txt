title: Head-up display
id: 459417
A head up display or heads up display also known as a HUD or head up guidance system HGS is any transparent display that presents data without requiring users to look away from their usual viewpoints The origin of the name stems from a pilot being able to view information with the head positioned up and looking forward instead of angled down looking at lower instruments A HUD also has the advantage that the pilot s eyes do not need to refocus to view the outside after looking at the optically nearer instruments br Although they were initially developed for military aviation HUDs are now used in commercial aircraft automobiles and other mostly professional applications br Head up displays were a precursor technology to augmented reality AR incorporating a subset of the features needed for the full AR experience but lacking the necessary registration and tracking between the virtual content and the user s real world environment br br br Overview br br A typical HUD contains three primary components a projector unit a combiner and a video generation computer br The projection unit in a typical HUD is an optical collimator setup a convex lens or concave mirror with a cathode ray tube light emitting diode display or liquid crystal display at its focus This setup a design that has been around since the invention of the reflector sight in produces an image where the light is collimated i e the focal point is perceived to be at infinity br The combiner is typically an angled flat piece of glass a beam splitter located directly in front of the viewer that redirects the projected image from projector in such a way as to see the field of view and the projected infinity image at the same time Combiners may have special coatings that reflect the monochromatic light projected onto it from the projector unit while allowing all other wavelengths of light to pass through In some optical layouts combiners may also have a curved surface to refocus the image from the projector br The computer provides the interface between the HUD i e the projection unit and the systems data to be displayed and generates the imagery and symbology to be displayed by the projection unit br br br Types br Other than fixed mounted HUD there are also head mounted displays HMDs These include helmet mounted displays both abbreviated HMD forms of HUD that feature a display element that moves with the orientation of the user s head br Many modern fighters such as the F A F and Eurofighter use both a HUD and HMD concurrently The F Lightning II was designed without a HUD relying solely on the HMD making it the first modern military fighter not to have a fixed HUD br br br Generations br HUDs are split into four generations reflecting the technology used to generate the images br br First Generation Use a CRT to generate an image on a phosphor screen having the disadvantage of the phosphor screen coating degrading over time The majority of HUDs in operation today are of this type br Second Generation Use a solid state light source for example LED which is modulated by an LCD screen to display an image These systems do not fade or require the high voltages of first generation systems These systems are on commercial aircraft br Third Generation Use optical waveguides to produce images directly in the combiner rather than use a projection system br Fourth Generation Use a scanning laser to display images and even video imagery on a clear transparent medium br Newer micro display imaging technologies are being introduced including liquid crystal display LCD liquid crystal on silicon LCoS digital micro mirrors DMD and organic light emitting diode OLED br br br History br br HUDs evolved from the reflector sight a pre World War II parallax free optical sight technology for military fighter aircraft The gyro gunsight added a reticle that moved based on the speed and turn rate to solve for the amount of lead needed to hit a target while maneuvering br During the early s the Telecommunications Research Establishment TRE in charge of UK radar development found that Royal Air Force RAF night fighter pilots were having a hard time reacting to the verbal instruction of the radar operator as they approached their targets They experimented with the addition of a second radar display for the pilot but found they had trouble looking up from the lit screen into the dark sky in order to find the target In October they had successfully combined the image from the radar tube with a projection from their standard GGS Mk II gyro gunsight on a flat area of the windscreen and later in the gunsight itself A key upgrade was the move from the original AI Mk IV radar to the microwave frequency AI Mk VIII radar found on the de Havilland Mosquito night fighter This set produced an artificial horizon that further eased head up flying br In the US Navy s Office of Naval Research and Development did some research with a mockup HUD concept unit along with a sidestick controller in an attempt to ease the pilot s burden flying modern jet aircraft and make the instrumentation less complicated during flight While their research was never incorporated in any aircraft of that time the crude HUD mockup they built had all the features of today s modern HUD units br HUD technology was next advanced by the Royal Navy in the Buccaneer the prototype of which first flew on April The aircraft was designed to fly at very low altitudes at very high speeds and drop bombs in engagements lasting seconds As such there was no time for the pilot to look up from the instruments to a bombsight This led to the concept of a Strike Sight that would combine altitude airspeed and the gun bombsight into a single gunsight like display There was fierce competition between supporters of the new HUD design and supporters of the old electro mechanical gunsight with the HUD being described as a radical even foolhardy option br The Air Arm branch of the UK Ministry of Defence sponsored the development of a Strike Sight The Royal Aircraft Establishment RAE designed the equipment and the earliest usage of the term head up display can be traced to this time Production units were built by Rank Cintel and the system was first integrated in The Cintel HUD business was taken over by Elliott Flight Automation and the Buccaneer HUD was manufactured and further developed continuing up to a Mark III version with a total of systems made it was given a fit and forget title by the Royal Navy and it was still in service nearly years later BAE Systems as the successor to Elliotts via GEC Marconi Avionics thus has a claim to the world s first head up display in operational service A similar version that replaced the bombing modes with missile attack modes was part of the AIRPASS HUD fitted to the English Electric Lightning from br In the United Kingdom it was soon noted that pilots flying with the new gunsights were becoming better at piloting their aircraft At this point the HUD expanded its purpose beyond weapon aiming to general piloting In the s French test pilot Gilbert Klopfstein created the first modern HUD and a standardized system of HUD symbols so that pilots would only have to learn one system and could more easily transition between aircraft The modern HUD used in instrument flight rules approaches to landing was developed in Klopfstein pioneered HUD technology in military fighter jets and helicopters aiming to centralize critical flight data within the pilot s field of vision This approach sought to increase the pilot s scan efficiency and reduce task saturation and information overload br Use of HUDs then expanded beyond military aircraft In the s the HUD was introduced to commercial aviation and in the Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme became the first production car with a head up display br Until a few years ago the Embraer Saab Boeing and Boeing Classic and Next Generation aircraft series were the only commercial passenger aircraft available with HUDs However the technology is becoming more common with aircraft such as the Canadair RJ Airbus A and several business jets featuring the displays HUDs have become standard equipment on the Boeing Furthermore the Airbus A A A and A families are currently undergoing the certification process for a HUD HUDs were also added to the Space Shuttle orbiter br br br Design factors br br There are several factors that interplay in the design of a HUD br br Field of View also FOV indicates the angle s vertically as well as horizontally subtended at the pilot s eye at which the combiner displays symbology in relation to the outside view A narrow FOV means that the view of a runway for example through the combiner might include little additional information beyond the perimeters of the runway environment whereas a wide FOV would allow a broader view For aviation applications the major benefit of a wide FOV is that an aircraft approaching the runway in a crosswind might still have the runway in view through the combiner even though the aircraft is pointed well away from the runway threshold whereas with a narrow FOV the runway would be off the edge of the combiner out of the HUD s view Because human eyes are separated each eye receives a different image The HUD image is viewable by one or both eyes depending on technical and budget limitations in the design process Modern expectations are that both eyes view the same image in other words a binocular Field of View FOV br Collimation The projected image is collimated which makes the light rays parallel Because the light rays are parallel the lens of the human eye focuses on infinity to get a clear image Collimated images on the HUD combiner are perceived as existing at or near optical infinity This means that the pilot s eyes do not need to refocus to view the outside world and the HUD display the image appears to be out there overlaying the outside world This feature is critical for effective HUDs not having to refocus between HUD displayed symbolic information and the outside world onto which that information is overlaid is one of the main advantages of collimated HUDs It gives HUDs special consideration in safety critical and time critical manoeuvres when the few seconds a pilot needs in order to re focus inside the cockpit and then back outside are very critical for example in the final stages of landing Collimation is therefore a primary distinguishing feature of high performance HUDs and differentiates them from consumer quality systems that for example simply reflect uncollimated information off a car s windshield causing drivers to refocus and shift attention from the road ahead br Eyebox The optical collimator produces a cylinder of parallel light so the display can only be viewed while the viewer s eyes are somewhere within that cylinder a three dimensional area called the head motion box or eyebox Modern HUD eyeboxes are usually about lateral by vertical by longitudinal inches x x cm This allows the viewer some freedom of head movement but movement too far up down or left right will cause the display to vanish off the edge of the collimator and movement too far back will cause it to crop off around the edge vignette The pilot is able to view the entire display as long as one eye is inside the eyebox br Luminance contrast Displays have adjustments in luminance and contrast to account for ambient lighting which can vary widely e g from the glare of bright clouds to moonless night approaches to minimally lit fields br Boresight Aircraft HUD components are very accurately aligned with the aircraft s three axes a process called boresighting so that displayed data conforms to reality typically with an accuracy of milliradians minutes of arc and may vary across the HUD s FOV In this case the word conform means when an object is projected on the combiner and the actual object is visible they will be aligned This allows the display to show the pilot exactly where the artificial horizon is as well as the aircraft s projected path with great accuracy When Enhanced Vision is used for example the display of runway lights is aligned with the actual runway lights when the real lights become visible Boresighting is done during the aircraft s building process and can also be performed in the field on many aircraft br Scaling The displayed image flight path pitch and yaw scaling etc is scaled to present to the pilot a picture that overlays the outside world in an exact relationship For example objects such as a runway threshold that are degrees below the horizon as viewed from the cockpit must appear at the degree index on the HUD display br Compatibility HUD components are designed to be compatible with other avionics displays etc br br br Aircraft br br On aircraft avionics systems HUDs typically operate from dual independent redundant computer systems They receive input directly from the sensors pitot static gyroscopic navigation etc aboard the aircraft and perform their own computations rather than receiving previously computed data from the flight computers On other aircraft the Boeing for example the HUD guidance computation for Low Visibility Take off LVTO and low visibility approach comes from the same flight guidance computer that drives the autopilot Computers are integrated with the aircraft s systems and allow connectivity onto several different data buses such as the ARINC ARINC and MIL STD br br br Displayed data br br Typical aircraft HUDs display airspeed altitude a horizon line heading turn bank and slip skid indicators These instruments are the minimum required by CFR Part br Other symbols and data are also available in some HUDs br br boresight or waterline symbol is fixed on the display and shows where the nose of the aircraft is actually pointing br flight path vector FPV or velocity vector symbol shows where the aircraft is actually going as opposed to merely where it is pointed as with the boresight For example if the aircraft is pitched up but descending as may occur in high angle of attack flight or in flight through descending air then the FPV symbol will be below the horizon even though the boresight symbol is above the horizon During approach and landing a pilot can fly the approach by keeping the FPV symbol at the desired descent angle and touchdown point on the runway br acceleration indicator or energy cue typically to the left of the FPV symbol it is above it if the aircraft is accelerating and below the FPV symbol if decelerating br angle of attack indicator shows the wing s angle relative to the airflow often displayed as br navigation data and symbols for approaches and landings the flight guidance systems can provide visual cues based on navigation aids such as an Instrument Landing System or augmented Global Positioning System such as the Wide Area Augmentation System Typically this is a circle which fits inside the flight path vector symbol Pilots can fly along the correct flight path by flying to the guidance cue br Since being introduced on HUDs both the FPV and acceleration symbols are becoming standard on head down displays HDD The actual form of the FPV symbol on an HDD is not standardized but is usually a simple aircraft drawing such as a circle with two short angled lines degrees and wings on the ends of the descending line Keeping the FPV on the horizon allows the pilot to fly level turns in various angles of bank br br br Military aircraft specific applications br br In addition to the generic information described above military applications include weapons system and sensor data such as br br target designation TD indicator places a cue over an air or ground target which is typically derived from radar or inertial navigation system data br Vc closing velocity with target br Range to target waypoint etc br weapon seeker or sensor line of sight shows where a seeker or sensor is pointing br weapon status includes type and number of weapons selected available arming etc br br br VTOL STOL approaches and landings br During the s the United States military tested the use of HUDs in vertical take off and landing VTOL and short take off and landing STOL aircraft A HUD format was developed at NASA Ames Research Center to provide pilots of VTOL and STOL aircraft with complete flight guidance and control information for Category III C terminal area flight operations This includes a large variety of flight operations from STOL flights on land based runways to VTOL operations on aircraft carriers The principal features of this display format are the integration of the flightpath and pursuit guidance information into a narrow field of view easily assimilated by the pilot with a single glance and the superposition of vertical and horizontal situation information The display is a derivative of a successful design developed for conventional transport aircraft br br br Civil aircraft specific applications br br The use of head up displays allows commercial aircraft substantial flexibility in their operations Systems have been approved which allow reduced visibility takeoffs and landings as well as full manual Category III A landings and roll outs Initially expensive and physically large these systems were only installed on larger aircraft able to support them These tended to be the same aircraft that as standard supported autoland with the exception of certain turbo prop types that had HUD as an option making the head up display unnecessary for Cat III landings This delayed the adoption of HUD in commercial aircraft At the same time studies have shown that the use of a HUD during landings decreases the lateral deviation from centerline in all landing conditions although the touchdown point along the centerline is not changed br For general aviation MyGoFlight expects to receive a STC and to retail its SkyDisplay HUD for without installation for a single piston engine as the Cirrus SR s and more for Cessna Caravans or Pilatus PC s single engine turboprops to of a traditional HUD cost albeit it is non conformal not matching exactly the outside terrain br Flight data from a tablet computer can be projected on the Epic Optix Eagle HUD br br br Enhanced flight vision systems br br In more advanced systems such as the US Federal Aviation Administration FAA labeled Enhanced Flight Vision System a real world visual image can be overlaid onto the combiner Typically an infrared camera either single or multi band is installed in the nose of the aircraft to display a conformed image to the pilot EVS Enhanced Vision System is an industry accepted term which the FAA decided not to use because the FAA believes it could be confused with the system definition and operational concept found in l and m In one EVS installation the camera is actually installed at the top of the vertical stabilizer rather than as close as practical to the pilots eye position When used with a HUD however the camera must be mounted as close as possible to the pilots eye point as the image is expected to overlay the real world as the pilot looks through the combiner br Registration or the accurate overlay of the EVS image with the real world image is one feature closely examined by authorities prior to approval of a HUD based EVS This is because of the importance of the HUD matching the real world and therefore being able to provide accurate data rather than misleading information br While the EVS display can greatly help the FAA has only relaxed operating regulations so an aircraft with EVS can perform a CATEGORY I approach to CATEGORY II minimums In all other cases the flight crew must comply with all unaided visual restrictions For example if the runway visibility is restricted because of fog even though EVS may provide a clear visual image it is not appropriate or legal to maneuver the aircraft using only the EVS below feet above ground level br br br Synthetic vision systems br br HUD systems are also being designed to display a synthetic vision system SVS graphic image which uses high precision navigation attitude altitude and terrain databases to create realistic and intuitive views of the outside world br In the st SVS head down image shown on the right immediately visible indicators include the airspeed tape on the left altitude tape on the right and turn bank slip skid displays at the top center The boresight symbol v is in the center and directly below that is the flight path vector FPV symbol the circle with short wings and a vertical stabilizer The horizon line is visible running across the display with a break at the center and directly to the left are numbers at degrees with a short line at degrees the degree line is easier to see which along with the horizon line show the pitch of the aircraft Unlike this color depiction of SVS on a head down primary flight display the SVS displayed on a HUD is monochrome that is typically in shades of green br The image indicates a wings level aircraft i e the flight path vector symbol is flat relative to the horizon line and there is zero roll on the turn bank indicator Airspeed is knots altitude is feet heading is degrees the number below the turn bank indicator Close inspection of the image shows a small purple circle which is displaced from the flight path vector slightly to the lower right This is the guidance cue coming from the Flight Guidance System When stabilized on the approach this purple symbol should be centered within the FPV br The terrain is entirely computer generated from a high resolution terrain database br In some systems the SVS will calculate the aircraft s current flight path or possible flight path based on an aircraft performance model the aircraft s current energy and surrounding terrain and then turn any obstructions red to alert the flight crew Such a system might have helped prevent the crash of American Airlines Flight into a mountain in December br On the left side of the display is an SVS unique symbol with the appearance of a purple diminishing sideways ladder and which continues on the right of the display The two lines define a tunnel in the sky This symbol defines the desired trajectory of the aircraft in three dimensions For example if the pilot had selected an airport to the left then this symbol would curve off to the left and down If the pilot keeps the flight path vector alongside the trajectory symbol the craft will fly the optimum path This path would be based on information stored in the Flight Management System s database and would show the FAA approved approach for that airport br The tunnel in the sky can also greatly assist the pilot when more precise four dimensional flying is required such as the decreased vertical or horizontal clearance requirements of Required Navigation Performance RNP Under such conditions the pilot is given a graphical depiction of where the aircraft should be and where it should be going rather than the pilot having to mentally integrate altitude airspeed heading energy and longitude and latitude to correctly fly the aircraft br br br Tanks br br In mid the Israel Defense Forces will begin trials of Elbit s Iron Vision the world s first helmet mounted head up display for tanks Israel s Elbit which developed the helmet mounted display system for the F plans Iron Vision to use a number of externally mounted cameras to project the view of a tank s surroundings onto the helmet mounted visors of its crew members This allows the crew members to stay inside the tank without having to open the hatches to see outside br br br Automobiles br br These displays are becoming increasingly available in production cars and usually offer speedometer tachometer and navigation system displays Night vision information is also displayed via HUD on certain automobiles In contrast to most HUDs found in aircraft automotive head up displays are not parallax free The display may not be visible to a driver wearing sunglasses with polarised lenses br Add on HUD systems also exist projecting the display onto a glass combiner mounted above or below the windshield or using the windshield itself as the combiner br In Pioneer Corporation introduced a HUD navigation system that replaces the driver side sun visor and visually overlays animations of conditions ahead a form of augmented reality AR Developed by Pioneer Corporation AR HUD became the first aftermarket automotive Head Up Display to use a direct to eye laser beam scanning method also known as virtual retinal display VRD AR HUD s core technology involves a miniature laser beam scanning display developed by MicroVision Inc br Motorcycle helmet HUDs are also commercially available br In recent years it has been argued that conventional HUDs will be replaced by holographic AR technologies such as the ones developed by WayRay that use holographic optical elements HOE The HOE allows for a wider field of view while reducing the size of the device and making the solution customizable for any car model Mercedes Benz introduced an Augmented Reality based Head Up Display while Faurecia invested in an eye gaze and finger controlled head up display br br br Further development and experimental uses br HUDs have been proposed or are being experimentally developed for a number of other applications In military settings a HUD can be used to overlay tactical information such as the output of a laser rangefinder or squadmate locations to infantrymen A prototype HUD has also been developed that displays information on the inside of a swimmer s goggles or of a scuba diver s mask HUD systems that project information directly onto the wearer s retina with a low powered laser virtual retinal display are also being tested br Some head up displays can perform real time language translation br br br See also br Index of
