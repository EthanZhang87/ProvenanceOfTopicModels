protocol developed at NRL is widely used for virtual private network VPN connections worldwide The projects developed by the laboratory often become mainstream applications without public awareness of the developer an example in computer science is onion routing the core principle of the anonymizing Tor software br br br Nuclear research br Nuclear power research was initiated at NRL as early as six years before the first atomic bomb for the purpose of powering submarines Uranium enrichment methods sponsored by NRL over the course of World War II were adopted by the Manhattan Project and guided the design of Oak Ridge National Laboratory s Uranium enrichment plant NRL is currently developing laser focusing techniques aimed at inertial confinement fusion technology br br br Physical sciences br The static discharger seen on trailing edges of virtually all modern aircraft was originally developed by NRL scientists during World War II After the war the laboratory developed modern synthetic lubricants initially for use in the Navy s jet aircraft but subsequently adopted by the commercial jet industry br In the late s NRL researched low temperature physics achieving for the first time a temperature within one millionth of a degree of absolute zero in In two scientists at the laboratory Herbert A Hauptman and Jerome Karle won the Nobel Prize for devising direct methods employing X ray diffraction analysis in the determination of crystal structures Their methods form the basis for the computer packages used in pharmaceutical labs and research institutions worldwide for the analysis of more than new substances each year br NRL has most recently published research on quantum computing quantum dots plasma shockwaves thermodynamics of liquids modeling of oil spills and other topics br NRL operates a small squadron of research aircraft termed Scientific Development Squadron VXS Its missions include for example Rampant Lion which used sophisticated airborne instrumentation gravimeters magnetometers and hyperspectral cameras to collect precise D topography of two thirds of Afghanistan and locate natural resources underground gas and mineral deposits vegetation types etc there and in Iraq and Colombia br br br Plasma science br The Division of Plasma Physics conducts research and development into ionized matter NRL currently holds the world record

architectures human robot interaction and machine learning br br br Organization br As of the laboratory was divided into four research directorates one financial directorate and one executive directorate All the directorates are headquartered in Washington D C Many directorates have other facilities elsewhere primarily at either the Stennis Space Center in Bay St Louis Mississippi or in Monterey California br br br Staff br Most NRL staff are civilians in the civil service with a relatively small number of Navy enlisted personnel or officers Virtually all NRL staff are US citizens and are not dual nationals In addition there are some support contractors that work on site at NRL As of December across all NRL locations NRL had civilian employees i e not including civilian contractors On the same date there were military officers on board NRL and enlisted on board NRL most of whom are with NRL s VXS Scientific Flight Detachment which is located at the Patuxent River Pax River Naval Air Station NAS in southern Maryland br NRL has special authority to use a Pay Band pay system instead of using the traditional General Schedule GS pay system for its civilian employees This gives NRL more ability to pay employees based on performance and merit rather than time in grade or some other seniority metric There are several different pay band groups at NRL each being for different categories of civilian employees As of December NRL had civilian scientists engineers in the NP pay system civilian technicians in the NR pay system civilian administrative specialists professionals in the NO pay system and civilian administrative support staff in the NC pay system br NRL scientists engineers typically are in the NP pay group in NRL s Pay Band system The NP II pay band is equivalent to GS Step through GS Step The NP III pay band is equivalent to GS Step through GS Step NRL s Pay Band IV corresponds to the GS Step to GS Step pay grades inclusive while NRL s Pay Band V can pay above GS Step and corresponds to the Senior Technologist ST pay grade elsewhere in the civil service br For new graduates someone with a Bachelor of Science degree typically is hired at a salary in the GS range someone with a Master of Science degree typically is hired at a salary in the GS range someone with a PhD typically is hired at a salary in the GS range NRL has the flexibility to offer partial student loan repayments for new hires br According to the NRL Fact Book of NRL civilian full time permanent employees had a doctorate had a master s and had a bachelor s as their highest degree br The laboratory also hosts post doctoral researchers and was voted in the Best Places to Work PostDocs survey br br br Research directorates br The four research directorates within NRL were br br The Systems Directorate Code is responsible for performing a range of activities from basic research through engineering development to expand the operational capabilities of the US Navy There are four research divisions Radar Information Technology Optical Sciences and Tactical Electronic Warfare br The Materials Science and Component Technology Directorate Code carries out a

synchrotron radiation beamlines and the Extreme Ultraviolet and X Ray Calibration Facility at the National Synchrotron Light Source at the Brookhaven National Laboratory br br br History br br br Early history br Artifacts found on the NRL campus such as stone tools and ceramic shards show that the site had been inhabited since the Late Archaic Period Cecil Calvert nd Baron Baltimore granted the tract of land which includes the present NRL campus to William Middleton in It became part of the District of Columbia in and was purchased by Thomas Grafton Addison in who named the area Bellevue and built a mansion on the highlands to the east br Zachariah Berry purchased the land in who rented it out for various purposes including a fishery at Blue Plains The mansion was demolished during the Civil War to build Fort Greble In the land was purchased by the federal government as the Bellevue Annex to the Naval Gun Factory and several buildings were constructed including the Commandant s house Quarters A which is still in use today br br br Foundation br br The Naval Research Laboratory came into existence from an idea that originated from Thomas Edison In a May editorial piece in the New York Times Magazine Edison wrote The Government should maintain a great research laboratory In this could be developed all the technique of military and naval progression without any vast expense This statement addressed concerns about World War I in the United States br Edison then agreed to serve as the head of the Naval Consulting Board that consisted of civilians who had achieved expertise The focus of the Naval Consulting Board was as advisor to the U S Navy pertaining to science and technology The board brought forward a plan to create a modern facility for the Navy In Congress allocated million for implementation However construction was delayed until because of the war and internal disagreements within the board br The U S Naval Research Laboratory the first modern research institution created within the United States Navy began operations at on July The Laboratory s two original divisions Radio and Sound performed research in the fields of high frequency radio and underwater sound propagation They produced communications equipment direction finding devices sonar sets and the first practical radar equipment built in the United States They performed basic research participating in the discovery and early exploration of the ionosphere The NRL gradually worked towards its goal of becoming a broadly based research facility By the beginning of World War II five new divisions had been added Physical Optics Chemistry Metallurgy Mechanics and Electricity and Internal Communications br br br World War II years and growth br br Total employment at the NRL jumped from in to in expenditures from million to million the number of buildings from to and the number of projects from to about During World War II scientific activities necessarily were concentrated almost entirely on applied research Advances were made in radio radar and sonar Countermeasures were devised New lubricants were produced as were antifouling paints luminous identification tapes and a marking dye to help locate survivors of disasters at sea A thermal diffusion process was conceived and used to supply some of the U isotope needed for one of the first atomic bombs Also many new devices that developed from booming wartime industry were type tested and then certified as reliable for the Fleet br br br After WWII br As a result of the scientific accomplishments of the WWII the United States emerged into the postwar era determined to consolidate its wartime gains in science and technology and to preserve the working relationship between its armed forces and the scientific community While the Navy was establishing the Office of Naval Research ONR in as a liaison with and supporter of basic and applied scientific research the Navy encouraged NRL to broaden its scope since it was the Navy Department s corporate research laboratory NRL was placed under the administrative oversight of ONR after ONR was created NRL s Commanding Officer reports to the Navy s Chief of Naval Research CNR The Chief of Naval Research leads the Office of Naval Research which primarily is located in the Ballston area of Arlington Virginia The reorganization also caused a parallel shift of the Laboratory s emphasis to one of long range basic and applied research in the full range of the physical sciences br However rapid expansion during the war had left NRL improperly structured to address long term Navy requirements One major task neither easily nor rapidly accomplished was that of reshaping and coordinating research This was achieved by transforming a group of largely autonomous scientific divisions into a unified institution with a clear mission and a fully coordinated research program The first attempt at reorganization vested power in an executive committee composed of all the division superintendents This committee was impracticably large so in a civilian director of research was named and given full authority over the program Positions for associate directors were added in br br br Modern era br br In the previously separate Naval Oceanographic and Atmospheric Research Laboratory NOARL with centers in Bay St Louis Mississippi and Monterey California was merged into NRL Since then NRL is also the lead Navy center for research in Oceanographic and Atmospheric Sciences with special strengths in physical oceanography marine geosciences ocean acoustics marine meteorology and remote oceanic and atmospheric sensing br br br Centennial br Commissioned July as the Naval Experimental and Research Laboratory later shortened to the Naval Research Laboratory c the laboratory began operations seven years after inventor Thomas Edison suggested that the Government establish a great research laboratory br Throughout the past century NRL has changed the way the U S military fights improved its capabilities prevented technological surprise transferred vital technology to industry and tilted the world s balance of power on at least three occasions with the first U S radar world s first intelligence satellite and first operational satellite of the Global Positioning System GPS br July the U S Naval Research Laboratory celebrates years of service as the Navy s corporate laboratory with a rich history of performing advanced scientific research and making significant contributions to U S military forces on under and above the seas br br br Environmental contamination br The Navy s environmental investigations began in NRL was not listed on the National Priorities List as a Superfund and the Maryland Department of the Environment has regulatory oversight Since the early s the Navy and MDE have coordinated their activities at NR In groundwater investigation PFAS were present on base in the shallow aquifer As of there are active IRP sites Photo processing Waste Discharge fire testing area etc and active munition response sites at former small arms ranges with lead contamination in the Chesapeake Bay Detachment An online Restoration Advisory Board RAB meeting in May alarmed residents because of extremely high PFAS levels in the soil at the CBD s fire training facility br br br See
