title: Expansion card
id: 75022
In computing an expansion card also called an expansion board adapter card peripheral card or accessory card is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an electrical connector or expansion slot also referred to as a bus slot on a computer s motherboard see also backplane to add functionality to a computer system Sometimes the design of the computer s case and motherboard involves placing most or all of these slots onto a separate removable card Typically such cards are referred to as a riser card in part because they project upward from the board and allow expansion cards to be placed above and parallel to the motherboard br Expansion cards allow the capabilities and interfaces of a computer system to be extended or supplemented in a way appropriate to the tasks it will perform For example a high speed multi channel data acquisition system would be of no use in a personal computer used for bookkeeping but might be a key part of a system used for industrial process control Expansion cards can often be installed or removed in the field allowing a degree of user customization for particular purposes Some expansion cards take the form of daughterboards that plug into connectors on a supporting system board br In personal computing notable expansion buses and expansion card standards include the S bus from associated with the CP M operating system the pin expansion slots of the original Apple II computer from unique to Apple IBM s Industry Standard Architecture ISA introduced with the IBM PC in Acorn s tube expansion bus on the BBC Micro also from IBM s patented and proprietary Micro Channel architecture MCA from that never won favour in the clone market the vastly improved Peripheral Component Interconnect PCI that displaced ISA in and PCI Express from which abstracts the interconnect into high speed communication lanes and relegates all other functions into software protocol br br br History br br Vacuum tube based computers had modular construction but individual functions for peripheral devices filled a cabinet not just a printed circuit board Processor memory and I O cards became feasible with the development of integrated circuits Expansion cards make processor systems adaptable to the needs of the user by making it possible to connect various types of devices including I O additional memory and optional features such as a floating point unit to the central processor Minicomputers starting with the PDP were made of multiple cards communicating through and powered by a passive backplane br The first commercial microcomputer to feature expansion slots was the Micral N in The first company to establish a de facto standard was Altair with the Altair developed which later became a multi manufacturer standard the S bus Many of these computers were also passive backplane designs where all elements of the computer processor memory and I O plugged into a card cage which passively distributed signals and power between the cards br Proprietary bus implementations for systems such as the Apple II co existed with multi manufacturer standards br br br IBM PC and descendants br IBM introduced what would retroactively be called the Industry Standard Architecture ISA bus with the IBM PC in At that time the technology was called the PC bus The IBM XT introduced in used the same bus with slight exception The bit PC and XT bus was extended with the introduction of the IBM AT in This used a second connector for extending the address and data bus over the XT but was backward compatible bit cards were still usable in the AT bit slots Industry Standard Architecture ISA became the designation for the IBM AT bus after other types were developed Users of the ISA bus had to have in depth knowledge of the hardware they were adding to properly connect the devices since memory addresses I O port addresses and DMA channels had to be configured by switches or jumpers on the card to match the settings in driver software br IBM s MCA bus developed for the PS in was a competitor to ISA also their design but fell out of favor due to the ISA s industry wide acceptance and IBM s licensing of MCA EISA the bit extended version of ISA championed by Compaq was used on some PC motherboards until when Microsoft declared it a legacy subsystem in the PC industry white paper Proprietary local buses q v Compaq and then the VESA Local Bus Standard were late s expansion buses that were tied but not exclusive to the and CPU bus The PC bus is an embedded bus that copies the ISA bus br Intel launched their PCI bus chipsets along with the P based Pentium CPUs in The PCI bus was introduced in as a replacement for ISA The standard now at version is found on PC motherboards to this day The PCI standard supports bus bridging as many as ten daisy chained PCI buses have been tested CardBus using the PCMCIA connector is a PCI format that attaches peripherals to the Host PCI Bus via PCI to PCI Bridge Cardbus is being supplanted by ExpressCard format br Intel introduced the AGP bus in as a dedicated video acceleration solution AGP devices are logically attached to the PCI bus over a PCI to PCI bridge Though termed a bus AGP usually supports only a single card at a time Legacy BIOS support issues From PCI Express has been replacing both PCI and AGP This standard approved in implements the logical PCI protocol over a serial communication interface PC Plus or Mini PCI are often added for expansion on small form factor boards such as Mini ITX br For their EX and HX models Tandy Computer designed the PLUS expansion interface an adaptation of the XT bus supporting cards of a smaller form factor Because it is electrically compatible with the XT bus a k a bit ISA or XT ISA a passive adapter can be made to connect XT cards to a PLUS expansion connector Another feature of PLUS cards is that they are stackable Another bus that offered stackable expansion modules was the sidecar bus used by the IBM PCjr This may have been electrically comparable to the XT bus it most certainly had some similarities since both essentially exposed the CPU s address and data buses with some buffering and latching the addition of interrupts and DMA provided by Intel add on chips and a few system fault detection lines Power Good Memory Check I O Channel Check Again PCjr sidecars are not technically expansion cards but expansion modules with the only difference being that the sidecar is an expansion card enclosed in a plastic box with holes exposing the connectors br br br External expansion buses br Laptops are generally unable to accept most expansion cards intended for desktop computers Consequently several compact expansion standards were developed br The original PC Card expansion card standard is essentially a compact version of the ISA bus The CardBus expansion card standard is an evolution of the PC card standard to make it into a compact version of the PCI bus The original ExpressCard standard acts like it is either a USB peripheral or a PCI Express x x device ExpressCard adds SuperSpeed USB as another type of interface the card can use Unfortunately CardBus and ExpressCard are vulnerable to DMA attack unless the laptop has an IOMMU that is configured to thwart these attacks br One notable exception to the above is the inclusion of a single internal slot for a special reduced size version of the desktop standard The most well known examples are Mini PCI or Mini PCIe Such slots were usually intended for a specific purpose such as offering built in wireless networking or upgrading the system at production with a discrete GPU br br br Other families br Most other computer lines including those from Apple Inc such as the Apple II and Macintosh Tandy Commodore Amiga and Atari offered their own expansion buses The Amiga used Zorro II Apple used a proprietary system with seven pin slots for Apple II peripheral cards then later used both variations on Processor Direct Slot and NuBus for its Macintosh series until when they switched to a PCI Bus br Generally speaking most PCI expansion cards will function on any CPU platform which incorporates PCI bus hardware provided there is a software driver for that type PCI video cards and any other cards that contain their own BIOS or other ROM are problematic although video cards conforming to VESA Standards may be used for secondary monitors DEC Alpha IBM PowerPC and NEC MIPS workstations used PCI bus connectors Both Zorro II and NuBus were plug and play requiring no hardware configuration by the user br Other computer buses were used for industrial control instruments and scientific systems One specific example is HP IB or Hewlett Packard Interface Bus which was ultimately standardized as IEEE aka GPIB Some well known historical standards include VMEbus STD Bus SBus specific to Sun s SPARCStations and numerous others br br br Video game consoles br Many other video game consoles such as the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Genesis included expansion buses in some form In the case of at least the Genesis the expansion bus was proprietary In fact the cartridge slots of many cartridge based consoles not counting the Atari would qualify as expansion buses as they exposed both read and write capabilities of the system s internal bus However the expansion modules attached to these interfaces though functionally the same as expansion cards are not technically expansion cards due to their physical form br br br Applications br The primary purpose of an expansion card is to provide or expand on features not offered by the motherboard For example the original IBM PC did not have on board graphics or hard drive capability In that case a graphics card and an ST hard disk controller card provided graphics capability and hard drive interface respectively Some single board computers made no provision for expansion cards and may only have provided IC sockets on the board for limited changes or customization Since reliable multi pin connectors are relatively costly some mass market systems such as home computers had no expansion slots and instead used a card edge connector at the edge of the main board putting the costly matching socket into the cost of the peripheral device br In the case of expansion of on board capability a motherboard may provide a single serial RS port or Ethernet port An expansion card can be installed to offer multiple RS ports or multiple and higher bandwidth Ethernet ports In this case the motherboard provides basic functionality but the expansion card offers additional or enhanced ports br br br Physical construction br One edge of the expansion card holds the contacts the edge connector or pin header that fit into the slot They establish the electrical contact between the electronics on the card and on the motherboard Peripheral expansion cards generally have connectors for external cables In the PC compatible personal computer these connectors were located in the support bracket at the back of the cabinet Industrial backplane systems had connectors mounted on the top edge of the card opposite to the backplane pins br Depending on the form factor of the motherboard and case around one to seven expansion cards can be added to a computer system or more expansion cards can be installed in backplane systems When many expansion cards are added to a system total power consumption and heat dissipation become limiting factors Some expansion cards take up more than one slot space For example many graphics cards on the market as of are dual slot graphics cards using the second slot as a place to put an active heat sink with a fan br Some cards are low profile cards meaning that they are shorter than standard cards and will fit in a lower height computer chassis such as HTPC and SFF There is a low profile PCI card standard that specifies a much smaller bracket and board area The group of expansion cards that are used for external connectivity such as network SAN or modem cards are commonly referred to as input output cards or I O cards br br br Daughterboard br br A daughterboard daughtercard mezzanine board or piggyback board is an expansion card that attaches to a system directly Daughterboards often have plugs sockets pins or other attachments for other boards Daughterboards often have only internal connections within a computer or other electronic devices and usually access the motherboard directly rather than through a computer bus Such boards are used to either improve various memory capacities of a computer enable the computer to connect to certain kinds of networks that it previously could not connect to or to allow for users to customize their computers for various purposes such as gaming br Daughterboards are sometimes used in computers in order to allow for expansion cards to fit parallel to the motherboard usually to maintain a small form factor This form are also called riser cards or risers Daughterboards are also sometimes used to expand the basic functionality of an electronic device such as when a certain model has features added to it and is released as a new or separate model Rather than redesigning the first model completely a daughterboard may be added to a special connector on the main board These usually fit on top of and parallel to the board separated by spacers or standoffs and are sometimes called mezzanine cards due to being stacked like the mezzanine of a theatre
