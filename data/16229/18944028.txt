The Nintendo Entertainment System NES is an bit home video game console produced by Nintendo It was first released in Japan on July as the Family Computer Famicom It was released in US test markets as the redesigned NES in October and fully launched in the US the following year The NES was distributed in Europe Australia and parts of Asia throughout the s under various names As a third generation console it mainly competed with Sega s Master System br The NES was designed by Masayuki Uemura Nintendo s president Hiroshi Yamauchi called for a simple cheap console that could run arcade games on cartridges The controller design was reused from Nintendo s portable Game Watch hardware The western model was redesigned to resemble a video cassette recorder Nintendo released add ons such as the NES Zapper light gun for several shooting games and R O B a toy robot accessory br The NES is regarded as one of the most influential consoles It helped revitalise the American gaming industry following the video game crash of and pioneered a now standard business model of licensing third party developers to produce and distribute games The NES features several groundbreaking games including Super Mario Bros The Legend of Zelda and Metroid which have become major franchises br The NES dominated Japanese and American markets but sold poorly in Europe where microcomputers were prevalent With million units sold it is one of the best selling consoles of all time It was succeeded in by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System br br br History br br br Background br br The video game industry experienced rapid growth and popularity from the late s to the early s marked by the golden age of arcade games and the second generation of consoles Games like Space Invaders became a phenomenon across arcades worldwide while home consoles such as the Atari and the Intellivision gained footholds in the American market Many companies emerged to capitalise on the growing industry including the playing card manufacturer Nintendo br Hiroshi Yamauchi who had been Nintendo s president since realised that breakthroughs in the electronics industry meant that entertainment products could be produced at lower prices Companies such as Atari and Magnavox were already selling gaming devices for use with television sets to moderate success Yamauchi negotiated a licence with Magnavox to sell its game console the Magnavox Odyssey Since Nintendo s operation was not yet sophisticated enough to design its own hardware Yamauchi forged an alliance with Mitsubishi Electric and hired several Sharp Electronics employees to assist in developing the Color TV Game in Japan This was followed by a more successful sequel the Color TV Game and the handheld Game Watch series The successes of these machines gave Yamauchi the confidence to expand Nintendo s influence in the fledgling video game industry br In Yamauchi split Nintendo into separate research and development divisions He appointed Masayuki Uemura as head of Nintendo Research Development a division that focused solely on hardware Yamauchi through extensive discussions with Uemura and other engineers recognised the potential of the developing console beyond gaming He envisioned a home computer system disguised as a toy which could significantly expand Nintendo s reach if it became popular with children This popularity would drive demand for games with Nintendo as the sole provider Indeed by several systems had already been released in Japan by both American and Japanese companies Yamauchi tasked Uemura with developing a system that would be superior to its competitors and difficult to replicate for at least a year Uemura s main challenge was economic rather than technological Yamauchi wanted the system to be affordable enough for widespread household adoption aiming for a price of less than compared to existing machines priced at to to The new system had to outperform other systems both Japanese and American while being significantly more affordable br br br Inception br As development progressed on the new video game system engineers sought Yamauchi s guidance on its features They questioned whether to include a disk drive keyboard data port as well as the potential for a modem expanded memory and other computer like capabilities Yamauchi ultimately instructed Uemura to prioritise simplicity and affordability omitting these peripherals entirely Game cartridges which Uemura saw as less intimidating to consumers was chosen as the format The team designed the cartridges to store bytes of random access memory RAM significantly more than Atari s bytes This allowed for far more complex games with thirty two times the code capacity of Atari cartridges br The console s hardware was largely based on arcade video games particularly the hardware for Namco s Galaxian and Nintendo s Donkey Kong with the goal of matching their powerful sprite and scrolling capabilities in a home system A test model was constructed in October to verify the functionality of the hardware and work began on programming tools Because xx CPUs had not been manufactured or sold in Japan by that time no cross development software was available and it had to be developed from scratch Early Famicom games were written on a NEC PC computer LEDs on a grid were used with a digitizer to design graphics as no such software design tools existed at that time br The codename for the project was GameCom but Masayuki Uemura s wife proposed the name Famicom arguing that In Japan pasokon is used to mean a personal computer but it is neither a home nor personal computer Perhaps we could say it is a family computer Meanwhile Hiroshi Yamauchi decided that the console should use a red and white theme after seeing a billboard for DX Antenna a Japanese antenna manufacturer which used those colors br br br Development br The Famicom was influenced by the ColecoVision Coleco s competition against the Atari in the United States the ColecoVision s top seller was a port of Nintendo s Donkey Kong The project s chief manager Takao Sawano brought a ColecoVision home to his family impressed by its smooth graphics which contrasts with the flicker and slowdown commonly seen on Atari games Uemura said the ColecoVision set the bar for the Famicom They wanted to surpass it and match the more powerful Donkey Kong arcade hardware they took a Donkey Kong arcade cabinet to chip manufacturer Ricoh for analysis which led to Ricoh producing the Picture Processing Unit PPU chip for the NES br Original plans called for the Famicom s cartridges to be the size of a cassette tape but ultimately they ended up being twice as big Careful design attention was paid to the cartridge connectors because loose and faulty connections often plagued arcade machines As it necessitated connection lines for the memory and expansion Nintendo decided to produce its own connectors br The controllers are hard wired to the console with no connectors for cost reasons The controller designs were reused from the Game Watch machines although the Famicom design team originally wanted to use arcade style joysticks even dismantling some from American game consoles to see how they worked There were concerns regarding the durability of the joystick design and that children might step on joysticks on the floor Katsuya Nakawaka attached a Game Watch D pad to the Famicom prototype and found that it was easy to use and caused no discomfort Ultimately though they installed a pin expansion port on the front of the console so that an optional arcade style joystick could be used br Gunpei Yokoi suggested an eject lever to the cartridge slot which is not necessary but he believed that children could be entertained by pressing it Uemura adopted his idea Uemura added a microphone to the second controller with the idea that it could be used to make players voices sound through the TV speaker br br br Japanese release br The console was released on July as the Home Cassette Type Video Game Family Computer for equivalent to in with three ports of Nintendo s successful arcade games Donkey Kong Donkey Kong Jr and Popeye The Famicom was slow to gather success a bad chip set caused the early revisions to crash Following a product recall and a reissue with a new motherboard the Famicom s popularity soared becoming the bestselling game console in Japan by the end of in what came to be called the Famicom Boom br Nintendo launched the system with only first party games but after being approached by Namco and Hudson Soft in agreed to produce third party games for a fee for console licensing and production costs This rate continued in the industry for consoles and digital storefront into the st Century br br br North American release br br Nintendo targeted the North American market entering distribution negotiations with Atari Inc to release a redesigned Famicom with Atari s name as the Nintendo Advanced Video Gaming System The deal was set to be finalized and signed at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in June However Atari discovered at that show that its competitor Coleco was illegally demonstrating its Coleco Adam computer with Nintendo s Donkey Kong game This violation of Atari s exclusive license with Nintendo to publish the game for its own computer systems delayed the implementation of Nintendo s game console marketing contract with Atari Atari s CEO Ray Kassar was fired the next month so the deal went nowhere and Nintendo decided to market its system on its own br br Subsequent plans for the Nintendo Advanced Video System likewise never materialized It was privately demonstrated as a repackaged Famicom console featuring a keyboard cassette data recorder wireless joystick controller and a special BASIC cartridge By the beginning of more than million Famicom units had been sold in Japan and Nintendo soon announced plans to release it in North America as the Advanced Video Entertainment System AVS that year The American video game press was skeptical that the console could have any success in the region as the industry was still recovering from the video game crash of The March issue of Electronic Games magazine stated that the videogame market in America has virtually disappeared and that this could be a miscalculation on Nintendo s part br br The Famicom hardware first made its North American debut in the arcades in the form of the Nintendo VS System in The system s success in arcades paved the way for the official release of the NES console With US retailers refusing to stock game consoles Yamauchi realized there was still a market for video games in the arcades so he introduced the Famicom to North America through the arcade industry The VS System became a major success in North American arcades becoming the highest grossing arcade machine of in the United States By the time the NES launched nearly VS Systems had been sold to American arcades The success of the VS System gave Nintendo the confidence to release the Famicom in North America as a video game console for which there was growing interest due to Nintendo s positive reputation in the arcades It also gave Nintendo the opportunity to test new games as VS Paks in the arcades to determine which games to release for the NES launch br At the Consumer Electronics Show CES Nintendo unveiled the American version of the Famicom a stripped down and cost reduced redesign of the Advanced Video System AVS having abandoned the home computer approach Nintendo purposefully designed the system to avoid resembling a video game console and avoided terms associated with game consoles Marketing manager Gail Tilden chose the term Game Pak for cartridges Control Deck for the console and Entertainment System for the whole platform Renamed the Nintendo Entertainment System NES the new and cost reduced version lacked most of the upscale features added in the AVS but retained many of its audiophile inspired design elements such as the grey colour scheme and boxy form factor Disappointed with the cosmetically raw prototype part they received from Japan which they nicknamed the lunchbox Nintendo of America designers Lance Barr and Don James added the two tone gray the black stripe and the red lettering To obscure the video game connotation the NES replaced the top loading cartridge slot of the Famicom and AVS with a front loading chamber for software cartridges that kept the inserted cartridge out of view reminiscent of a video cassette recorder The Famicom s pair of hard wired controllers and the AVS s wireless controllers were replaced with two custom pin sockets for detachable wired controllers br At June s Consumer Electronics Show CES Nintendo unveiled the American version of its Famicom with a new case redesigned by Lance Barr and featuring a zero insertion force cartridge slot The change from a top loader in the Famicom to a front loader was to make the new console more like a video cassette recorder which had grown in popularity by and differentiate the unit from past video game consoles Additionally Uemura explained that Nintendo developers had feared that the console s electronics might face electrostatic hazards in dry American states such as Arizona and Texas and a front loading design would be safer if children handled the console carelessly br This was deployed as the Nintendo Entertainment System NES Nintendo seeded these first systems to limited American test markets starting in New York City on October and followed up in Los Angeles in February the American nationwide release came on September Nintendo released launch games Yard Fight Baseball Clu Clu Land Duck Hunt Excitebike Golf Gyromite Hogan s Alley Ice Climber Kung Fu Pinball Soccer Stack Up Super Mario Bros Tennis Wild Gunman and Wrecking Crew br The system s launch represented not only a new product but also a reframing of the severely damaged home video game market in North America The video game crash had occurred in large part due to a lack of consumer and retailer confidence in video games which had been partially due to confusion and misrepresentation in video game marketing Prior to the NES the packaging of many video games presented bombastic artwork which did not represent a game s actual graphics Furthermore a single game such as Pac Man appeared across consoles with substantial variations in graphics sound and general quality In contrast Nintendo s marketing strategy aimed to regain consumer and retailer confidence by delivering a singular platform whose graphics could be represented truthfully and whose qualities were clearly defined br To differentiate Nintendo s new home platform from the perception of a troubled and shallow video game market still reeling from the crash the company freshened its product nomenclature and established a strict product approval and licensing policy The overall platform is referred to as Entertainment System instead of a video game system is centered upon a machine called a Control Deck instead of a console and features software cartridges called Game Paks instead of video games This allowed Nintendo to gain more traction in selling the system in toy stores To deter production of games which had not been licensed by Nintendo and to prevent copying the NES lockout chip system acts as a lock and key coupling of each Game Pak and Control Deck The packaging of the launch lineup of NES games bear pictures of close representations of actual onscreen graphics To reduce consumer confusion symbols on the games packaging clearly indicate the genre of the game A seal of quality is on all licensed game and accessory packaging The initial seal states This seal is your assurance that Nintendo has approved and guaranteed the quality of this product This text was later changed to Official Nintendo Seal of Quality br Unlike with the Famicom Nintendo of America marketed the console primarily to children instituting a strict policy of censoring profanity sexual religious or political content The most famous example is Lucasfilm s attempts to port the comedy horror game Maniac Mansion to the NES which Nintendo insisted be considerably watered down br The optional Robotic Operating Buddy or R O B was part of a marketing plan to portray the NES s technology as being novel and sophisticated when compared to previous game consoles and to portray its position as being within reach of the better established toy market Though at first the American public exhibited limited excitement for the console itself peripherals such as the light gun and R O B attracted extensive attention br br br Other markets br In Europe and Oceania the NES was released in two separate marketing regions The first consisted of mainland Europe excluding Italy where distribution was handled by several different companies with Nintendo responsible for manufacturing The NES saw an early launch in Europe in although most of the European countries received the console in The release in Scandinavia was on September where it was released by Bergsala In the Netherlands it was released in the last quarter of and was distributed by Bandai BV In France it was released in October and in Spain most likely in through distributor Spaco Also in Mattel handled distribution for the second region consisting of the United Kingdom Ireland Italy Australia and New Zealand In other European countries distribution was took over by smaller companies like Bienengr ber in Germany ASD in France Concentra in Portugal Itochu in Greece and Cyprus Stadlbauer in Austria Switzerland and the former Eastern Bloc In November Nintendo signed an agreement with Steepler to permit the continued sale of the Dendy an unauthorized hardware clone of the Famicom in Russia in exchange for also distributing the Super Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo anticipated the NES would have a per cent share in these countries and saw particular potential in the United Kingdom It sold modestly in Europe however br In Brazil the console was released late in by Playtronic even after the SNES But the Brazilian market had been dominated by unlicensed NES clones both locally made and smuggled from Taiwan One of the most successful local clones was the Phantom System manufactured by Gradiente which licensed Nintendo products in the country for the following decade The sales of officially licensed products were low due to the cloning the quite late official launch and the high prices of Nintendo s licensed products br Outside of Japan regions in greater Asia received an Asian Version of the front loader NES though imported Famicom systems were prevalent Due to import restrictions NES consoles in India and South Korea were rebranded and distributed by local licensees The Indian version is called the Samurai Electronic TV Game System and the Korean version is called the Hyundai Comboy The console sold very poorly in India due to affordability and lack of lacking consumer awareness br br br Bundles and redesigns br br For its complete North American release the Nintendo Entertainment System was progressively released over the ensuing years in several different bundles beginning with the Deluxe Set the Basic Set the Action Set and the Power Set The Deluxe Set was launched in the test markets retailing at US equivalent to in including R O B a light gun called the NES Zapper two controllers and the two Game Paks Gyromite and Duck Hunt The Control Deck bundle was first released in at with no game and bundled with the Super Mario Bros cartridge The Action Set released April for has the Control Deck two controllers an NES Zapper and a dual Game Pak containing both Super Mario Bros and Duck Hunt br The Power Set of includes the console two game controllers an NES Zapper a Power Pad and a triple Game Pak containing Super Mario Bros Duck Hunt and World Class Track Meet In a Sports Set bundle was released including the console an NES Satellite infrared wireless multitap adapter four game controllers and a dual Game Pak containing Super Spike V Ball and Nintendo World Cup Two more bundle packages were later released with the original model NES console In the Challenge Set was released for with the console two controllers and a Super Mario Bros Game Pak The Basic Set retailed at US it included only the console and two controllers and no pack in game Instead it contained a book called the Official Nintendo Player s Guide which contained detailed information for every NES game made up to that point br Finally the console was redesigned for the Australian North American and Japanese markets including the New Style NES or NES and one redesigned dogbone game controller In Australia this console revision was released with a cartridge compiling Super Mario Bros Tetris and Nintendo World Cup Released in October in North America and in Australia this final bundle retailed for and A A with the pack in game respectively and was discontinued with the NES in br br br Discontinuation br On August Nintendo discontinued the Nintendo Entertainment System in both North America and Europe In North America replacements for the original front loading NES were available for in exchange for a broken system until at least December under Nintendo s Power Swap program The Game Boy and Super NES were covered for and respectively br On May Nintendo announced the discontinuation of the Famicom in September alongside the Super Famicom and the disk rewriting services for the Famicom Disk System The last Famicom serial number HN was manufactured on September it was kept by Nintendo and subsequently loaned to the organizers of Level X a video game exhibition held from December to February at the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography for a Famicom retrospective in commemoration of the console s th anniversary Nintendo offered repair service for the Famicom in Japan until when it was discontinued due to a shortage of available parts br br br Hardware br br br Configurations br br Although all versions of the Famicom and NES include essentially similar hardware they vary in physical characteristics The original Famicom s design is predominantly white plastic with dark red trim it featured a top loading cartridge slot grooves on both sides of the deck in which the hardwired game controllers could be placed when not in use and a pin expansion port located on the unit s front panel for accessories In contrast the design of the original NES features a more subdued gray black and red color scheme it includes a front loading cartridge slot covered by a small hinged door that can be opened to insert or remove a cartridge and closed at other times and an expansion port on the bottom of the unit The cartridge connector pinout was changed between the Famicom and NES br In late Nintendo introduced a redesigned version of the Famicom and NES officially named the New Famicom in Japan and the New Style NES in the US to complement the Super Famicom and SNES to prolong interest in the console and to reduce costs The redesigned NES has a top loading cartridge slot to avoid reliability issues with the original console the redesign also omitted AV output Conversely the redesigned Famicom has such output and introduced detachable game controllers though the microphone functionality was omitted as a result The redesigned Famicom and NES models are cosmetically similar aside from the presence of a cartridge bump on the NES model which the Famicom model lacks to accommodate its shorter cartridges and as the RAM Adapter for the Famicom Disk System br Sharp Corporation produced three licensed variants of the Famicom in Japan all of which prominently display the shortened moniker rather than the official name Family Computer One variant was a television set with an integrated Famicom originally released in as the My Computer TV in inch cm and inch cm models it was later released in the United States in as a inch model named the Video Game Television Another variant is the Twin Famicom console released in to combine a Famicom with a Famicom Disk System Sharp then produced the Famicom Titler in Intended for video capture and production it features internal RGB video generation and video output via S Video plus inputs for adding subtitles and voice overs br br br Hardware clones br br A thriving market of unlicensed NES hardware clones emerged during the climax of the console s popularity Initially such clones were popular in markets where Nintendo issued a legitimate version of the console long time after unlicensed hardware In particular the Dendy Russian an unlicensed hardware clone produced in Taiwan and sold in the former Soviet Union emerged as the most popular video game console of its time in that setting and it enjoyed a degree of fame roughly equivalent to that experienced by the NES Famicom in North America and Japan A range of Famicom clones was marketed in Argentina during the late s and early s with the name Family Game resembling the original hardware design Thailand got Family FR brand famiclones the Micro Genius Simplified Chinese was marketed in Southeast Asia as an alternative to the Famicom and in Central Europe especially Poland the Pegasus was available Since there were many Brazilian clones of the NES and the very popular Phantom System with hardware superior to the original console caught the attention of Nintendo itself br br The unlicensed clone market has flourished following Nintendo s discontinuation of the NES Some of the more exotic of these resulting systems surpass the functionality of the original hardware such as a portable system with a color LCD PocketFami Others have been produced for certain specialized markets such as a rather primitive personal computer with a keyboard and basic word processing software These unauthorized clones have been helped by the invention of the so called NES on a chip br As was the case with unlicensed games Nintendo has typically gone to the courts to prohibit the manufacture and sale of unlicensed cloned hardware Many of the clone vendors have included built in copies of licensed Nintendo software which constitutes copyright infringement in most countries br br br Design flaws br br Nintendo s design styling for US release was made deliberately different from that of other game consoles Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of One result of this philosophy is to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front loading zero insertion force ZIF cartridge socket designed to resemble the front loading mechanism of a VCR The socket works well when both the connector and the cartridges are clean and the pins on the connector are new However the socket is not truly zero insertion force When a user inserts the cartridge into the NES the force of pressing the cartridge into place bends the contact pins slightly and presses the cartridge s ROM board back into the cartridge Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges wears out the pins and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry standard card edge connector br The design problems were exacerbated by Nintendo s choice of materials The console slot nickel connector springs wear due to design and the game cartridge s brass plated nickel connectors are also prone to tarnishing and oxidation Nintendo sought to fix these problems by redesigning the next generation Super Nintendo Entertainment System SNES as a top loader similar to the Famicom Many players try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges then reinserting them which actually speeds up the tarnishing due to moisture One way to slow down the tarnishing process and extend the life of the cartridges is to use isopropyl alcohol and swabs and as non conductive metal polish such as Brasso or Sheila Shine br Users have attempted to solve these problems by blowing air onto the cartridge connectors inserting the cartridge just far enough to get the ZIF to lower licking the edge connector slapping the side of the system after inserting a cartridge shifting the cartridge from side to side after insertion pushing the ZIF up and down repeatedly holding the ZIF down lower than it should have been and cleaning the connectors with alcohol Many frequently used methods to fix this problem actually risk damaging gaming cartridges or the system In Nintendo released an official NES Cleaning Kit to help users clean malfunctioning cartridges and consoles br In response to these hardware flaws Nintendo Authorized Repair Centers sprang up across the U S According to Nintendo the authorization program was designed to ensure that the machines were properly repaired Nintendo would ship the necessary replacement parts only to shops that had enrolled in the authorization program br With the release of the top loading NES New Style NES in toward the end of the NES s lifespan Nintendo resolved the problems by switching to a standard card edge connector and eliminating the lockout chip All of the Famicom systems use standard card edge connectors as do Nintendo s two subsequent game consoles the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Nintendo br br br Lockout br br The Famicom as released in Japan contains no lockout hardware which led to unlicensed cartridges both legitimate and bootleg becoming extremely common throughout Japan and East Asia Nintendo tried to promote its Seal of Quality in these regions to identify licensed games to combat bootlegs but bootleg Famicom games continued to be produced even after Nintendo moved production onto the Super Famicom effectively extending the lifetime of the Famicom br The original NES released for Western countries in contains the NES lockout chip which prevents it from running cartridges unapproved by Nintendo The inclusion of the NES was a direct influence from the video game crash in North America partially caused by a market flooded with uncontrolled publishing of games of poor quality for the home consoles Nintendo did not want to see that happen with the NES and used the lockout chip to restrict games to only those they licensed and approved for the system This means of protection worked in combination with the Nintendo Seal of Quality which a developer had to acquire before they would be able to have access to the required NES information prior to publication of their game br Initially the NES chip proved a significant barrier to unlicensed developers seeking to develop and sell games for the console However hobbyists in later years discovered that disassembling the NES and cutting the fourth pin of the lockout chip would change the chip s mode of operation from lock to key removing all effects and greatly improving the console s ability to play legal games bootlegs and converted imports br Original NES consoles sold in different regions have different lockout chips thereby enforcing regional lockout regardless of TV signal compatibility Such regions include North America most of continental Europe PAL B Asia and the British Isles Italy and Australasia PAL A br Problems with the NES lockout chip frequently result in one of the console s most common issues the blinking red power light in which the system appears to turn itself on and off repeatedly because the NES would reset the console once per second The lockout chip required constant communication with the chip in the game to work Dirty aging and bent connectors often disrupt the communication resulting in the blink effect In other cases the console turns on but only displays a solid white gray or green screen br br br Technical specifications br br The console s main central processing unit CPU was produced by Ricoh which manufactured different versions between NTSC and PAL regions NTSC consoles have a A clocked at MHzTooltip megahertz and PAL consoles have a A clocked at MHz Both CPUs are unlicensed variants of the MOS Technology an bit microprocessor prevalent in contemporary home computers and consoles Nintendo ostensibly disabled the s binary coded decimal mode on them to avoid patent infringement against or licensing fees towards MOS Technology which was owned by then rival Commodore International The CPU has access to KBTooltip kilobyte of onboard work RAMTooltip random access memory br The console s graphics are handled by a Ricoh C a processor known as the Picture Processing Unit PPU that is clocked at MHz A derivative of the Texas Instruments TMS a video display controller used in the ColecoVision the PPU features KB of video RAM bytes of on die object attribute memory OAM to store sprite display information on up to sprites and bytes of RAM to store information on the YIQ based color palette the console can display up to colors simultaneously out of usable colors br The console s standard display resolution is pixels though video output options vary between models The original Famicom features only radio frequency RF modulator output and the NES additionally supports composite video via RCA connectors The redesigned Famicom omits the RF modulator entirely only outputting composite video via a proprietary multi out connector first introduced on the Super Famicom SNES conversely the redesigned NES features RF modulator output only though a version of the model including the multi out connector was produced in rare quantities br The console produces sound via an audio processing unit APU integrated into the processor It supports a total of five sound channels two pulse wave channels one triangle wave channel one white noise channel and one DPCMTooltip differential pulse code modulation channel for sample playback Audio playback speed is dependent on the CPU clock rate which is set by a crystal oscillator br br br Accessories br br br Controllers br br The game controller for both the NES and the Famicom has an oblong brick like design with a simple four button layout two round buttons labeled A and B a START button and a SELECT button Additionally the controllers use the cross shaped D pad designed by Nintendo employee Gunpei Yokoi for Nintendo Game Watch systems to replace the bulkier joysticks on controllers of earlier gaming consoles br The original model Famicom features two game controllers both of which are hardwired to the back of the console The second controller lacks the START and SELECT button featuring a small microphone instead however few games use this feature The earliest produced Famicom units have square A and B buttons issues with them getting stuck when pressed down led Nintendo to change their shape to a circular design in subsequent units following the console s recall br Instead of the Famicom s hardwired controllers the NES has two proprietary seven pin ports on the front of the console to support detachable controllers and third party peripherals The controllers bundled with the NES are identical and include the START and SELECT buttons lacking the microphone on the original Famicom s second controller The cables for NES controllers are also generally three times longer than their Famicom counterparts br Several special controllers are intended for use with specific games though are not commonly used Such peripherals include the NES Zapper a light gun R O B a toy robot and the Power Pad a dance pad The original Famicom has a deepened DA expansion port on the front of the unit to accommodate them br Two official advanced controllers were produced for the NES the NES Advantage an arcade controller produced by Asciiware and licensed by Nintendo of America and the NES Max a controller with grip handles and a cycloid sliding disc D pad in place of the traditional one Both controllers have a Turbo feature which simulates multiple rapid button presses for the A and B buttons the NES Max has manually pressed Turbo buttons and the NES Advantage offers toggle buttons for Turbo functionality along with knobs that adjust the firing rate of each button The latter also includes a Slow button that rapidly pauses games though this function is not intended for games that invoke a pause menu or screen br The standard game controller was redesigned upon the introduction of the redesigned console Though the original button layout was retained the shape of the redesigned controller nicknamed the dog bone controller resembles that of the Super Famicom and SNES It retained NES style detachable controller ports br The original NES controller has become one of the most recognizable symbols of the console Nintendo has mimicked the look of the controller in several other products from promotional merchandise to limited edition versions of the Game Boy Advance br br br Japanese accessories br br Few of the numerous peripheral devices and software packages for the Famicom were released outside Japan br The Famicom D System an active shutter D headset peripheral released in enabled the ability to play stereoscopic video games It was a commercial failure and never released outside Japan users described the headset as bulky and uncomfortable Seven games are compatible with the glasses with three of them developed by Square two titles received worldwide releases as Rad Racer and The D Battles of WorldRunner br Family BASIC is an implementation of BASIC for the Famicom packaged with a keyboard Similar in concept to the Atari BASIC cartridge it allows the user to write programs especially games which can be saved on an included cassette recorder Nintendo of America rejected releasing Famicom BASIC in the US in favor of its primary marketing demographic of children br The Famicom Modem connected a Famicom to a now defunct proprietary network in Japan which provided content such as financial services A dial up modem was never released for the NES after a partnership with Fidelity Investments br br br Famicom Disk System br br By the cost and size limitations of ROM chips used in the Famicom s ROM cartridges were apparent with no new advancements present to address them With this in mind Nintendo looked at the personal computer PC market where the floppy disk was gaining wide adoption as a computer data storage medium Partnering with Mitsumi to develop a floppy disk add on for the Famicom based on the latter s Quick Disk format Nintendo officially released it as the Family Computer Disk System in Japan on February at a retail price of br The advantages of the format called Disk Card were apparent on launch It has more than triple the data storage capacity of the then largest cartridge used for Super Mario Bros and introduced game save capability and lower production costs compared to cartridges which resulted in lower retail prices for consumers The add on also has a new wavetable synthesis sound channel and more data storage for the Famicom s audio sample channel Taking advantage of the disk s re writability Nintendo set up Disk Writer interactive kiosks at retail stores throughout Japan at each kiosk consumers could buy new games to rewrite onto their old disks or onto new disks Disk Fax kiosks allowed players to submit their high scores on special blue disks for contests and rankings predating the online leaderboard by several years br Although Nintendo committed to exclusively releasing games on the Disk System after its release numerous external issues plagued its long term viability Just four months after launch Capcom released a Famicom port of Makaimura known as Ghosts n Goblins in the U S on a cartridge with more data storage capacity than what was possible on Disk Cards nullifying one of the Disk System s major advantages by using discrete logic chips to perform bank switching Nintendo also demanded half of the copyright ownership for each game it selected for release on the Disk System resulting in developers electing to remain on cartridge instead as the latter gained functionality previously considered unique to the former Developers disliked the lower profit margin of the Disk Writer kiosks and retailers complained of their use of valuable space as demand for the format waned br Usage of a floppy disk based medium brought about further complications Disk Cards were more fragile than cartridges and were prone to data corruption from magnetic exposure Their unreliability was exacerbated by their lack of a shutter which Nintendo substituted with a wax sleeve and clear keep case to reduce costs blue disks and later Disk Cards included shutters The rubber belt based disk drives were also unreliable with cryptic error codes complicating troubleshooting even when fully functional players accustomed to cartridges were annoyed with the introduction of loading times and disk flipping Furthermore the rewritable nature of the format resulted in rampant software piracy with Nintendo s attempts at anti piracy measures quickly defeated br Though selling close to two million units for all of Nintendo only managed to increase the total to million units by falling well short of internal projections By then the Disk System was rendered obsolete due to advancements in ROM cartridge production memory mapping chips for expanded data storage capacity battery backed SRAMTooltip static random access memory for game saving and declining overall production costs Nintendo alluded to a Western release for the Disk System going so far as to successfully file a U S patent for it and having the Famicom s cartridge pins used by its RAM Adapter for enhanced audio rerouted to the NES s little used bottom expansion port However such a release never materialized due to its reception in Japan Most of its games were re released with workarounds on cartridge for both the Famicom and NES without the enhanced audio Although the last game for the Disk System was released in December Nintendo continued repair and rewrite services for it until September br br br NES Test Station br br The NES Test Station diagnostics machine was introduced in It is an NES based unit designed for testing NES hardware components and games It was only provided for use in World of Nintendo boutiques as part of the Nintendo World Class Service program Visitors were to bring items to test with the station and could be assisted by a store technician or employee br The NES Test Station s front has a Game Pak slot and connectors for testing various components AC adapter RF switch Audio Video cable NES Control Deck accessories and games with a centrally located selector knob to choose which component to test The unit itself weighs approximately pounds without a TV It connects to a television via a combined A V and RF Switch cable By actuating the green button a user can toggle between an A V Cable or RF Switch connection The television it is connected to typically to is meant to be placed atop it br In Nintendo provided an add on called the Super NES Counter Tester that tests Super NES components and games The Super NES Counter Tester is a standard Control Deck on a metal fixture with the connection from the back of the unit re routed to the front These connections may be made directly to the test station or to the TV depending on what is to be tested br br br Games br br br Game Pak br br The NES uses a pin design as compared with pins on the Famicom To reduce costs and inventory some early games released in North America are simply Famicom cartridges attached to an adapter to fit inside the NES hardware Early NES cartridges are held together with five small slotted screws Games released after were redesigned slightly to incorporate two plastic clips molded into the plastic itself removing the need for the top two screws br The back of the cartridge bears a label with handling instructions Production and software revision codes were imprinted as stamps on the back label to correspond with the software version and producer All licensed NTSC and PAL cartridges are a standard shade of gray plastic with the exception of The Legend of Zelda and Zelda II The Adventure of Link which were manufactured in gold plastic carts Unlicensed carts were produced in black robin egg blue and gold and are all slightly different shapes than standard NES cartridges Nintendo also produced yellow plastic carts for internal use at Nintendo Service Centers although these test carts were never made available for purchase All licensed US cartridges were made by Nintendo Konami and Acclaim For promotion of DuckTales Remastered Capcom sent limited edition gold NES cartridges with the original game featuring the Remastered art as the sticker to different gaming news agencies The instruction label on the back includes the opening lyric from the show s theme song Life is like a hurricane br Famicom cartridges are shaped slightly differently Unlike NES games official Famicom cartridges were produced in many colors of plastic Adapters similar in design to the popular accessory Game Genie are available that allow Famicom games to be played on an NES In Japan several companies manufactured the cartridges for the Famicom This allowed these companies to develop customized chips designed for specific purposes such as superior sound and graphics br br br Third party licensing br br Nintendo s near monopoly on the home video game market left it with a dominant influence over the industry Unlike Atari which never actively pursued third party developers and even went to court in an attempt to force Activision to cease production of Atari games Nintendo had anticipated and encouraged the involvement of third party software developers though strictly on Nintendo s terms Some of the Nintendo platform control measures were adopted in a less stringent way by later console manufacturers such as Sega Sony and Microsoft br To this end a NES authentication chip is in every console and in every licensed cartridge If the console s chip can not detect a counterpart chip inside the cartridge the game does not load Nintendo portrayed these measures as intended to protect the public against poor quality games and placed a golden seal of approval on all licensed games released for the system br Nintendo found success with Japanese arcade manufacturers such as Konami Capcom Taito and Namco which signed on as third party developers However they found resistance with US game developers including Atari Games Activision Electronic Arts and Epyx refusing Nintendo s one sided terms Acclaim Entertainment a fledgling game publisher founded by former Activision employees was the first major third party licensee in the United States to sign on with Nintendo in late Atari Games through Tengen and Activision signed on soon after br Nintendo was not as restrictive as Sega which did not permit third party publishing until Mediagenic in late summer Nintendo s intention was to reserve a large part of NES game revenue for itself Nintendo required that it be the sole manufacturer of all cartridges and that the publisher had to pay in full before the cartridges for that game be produced Cartridges could not be returned to Nintendo so publishers assumed all the risk As a result some publishers lost more money due to distress sales of remaining inventory at the end of the NES era than they ever earned in profits from sales of the games Because Nintendo controlled the production of all cartridges it was able to enforce strict rules on its third party developers who were required to sign a contract that would obligate them to develop exclusively for the system order at least cartridges and only make five games per year The global shortage of DRAM and ROM chips reportedly caused Nintendo to only permit an average of of publishers requests for cartridges with some receiving much higher amounts and others almost none GameSpy noted that Nintendo s iron clad terms made the company many enemies during the s Some developers tried to circumvent the five game limit by creating additional company brands like Konami s Ultra Games label others tried circumventing the NES chip br br Nintendo was accused of antitrust violations because of the strict licensing requirements The United States Department of Justice and several states began probing Nintendo s business practices leading to the involvement of Congress and the Federal Trade Commission FTC The FTC conducted an extensive investigation which included interviewing hundreds of retailers During the FTC probe Nintendo changed the terms of its publisher licensing agreements to eliminate the two year rule and other restrictive terms Nintendo and the FTC settled the case in April with Nintendo required to send vouchers giving a discount off to a new game to every person that had purchased an NES game between June and December GameSpy remarked that Nintendo s punishment was particularly weak given the case s findings although it has been speculated that the FTC did not want to damage the video game industry in the United States br With the NES near the end of its life many third party publishers such as Electronic Arts supported upstart competing consoles with less strict licensing terms such as the Sega Genesis and then the PlayStation which eroded and then took over Nintendo s dominance in the home console market respectively Consoles from Nintendo s rivals in the post SNES era had always enjoyed much stronger third party support than Nintendo which relied more heavily on first party games br br br Unlicensed games br Companies that refused to pay the licensing fee or were rejected by Nintendo found ways to circumvent the console s authentication system Most of these companies created circuits that use a voltage spike to temporarily disable the NES chip A few unlicensed games released in Europe and Australia are in the form of a dongle to connect to a licensed game to use the licensed game s NES chip for authentication To combat unlicensed games Nintendo of America threatened retailers who sold them with losing their supply of licensed games and multiple revisions were made to the NES PCBs to prevent unlicensed games from working br Atari Games took a different approach with its line of NES products Tengen The company attempted to reverse engineer the lockout chip to develop its own Rabbit chip Tengen also obtained a description of the lockout chip from the United States Patent and Trademark Office by falsely claiming that it was required to defend against present infringement claims Nintendo successfully sued Tengen for copyright infringement Tengen s antitrust claims against Nintendo were never decided br Color Dreams made Christian video games under the subsidiary name Wisdom Tree Historian Steven Kent wrote Wisdom Tree presented Nintendo with a prickly situation The general public did not seem to pay close attention to the court battle with Atari Games and industry analysts were impressed with Nintendo s legal acumen but going after a tiny company that published innocuous religious games was another story br br br Game rentals br As the Nintendo Entertainment System grew in popularity and entered millions of American homes some small video rental shops began buying their own copies of NES games and renting them out to customers for around the same price as a video cassette rental for a few days Nintendo received no profit from the practice beyond the initial cost of their game and unlike movie rentals a newly released game could hit store shelves and be available for rent on the same day Nintendo took steps to stop game rentals but did not take any formal legal action until Blockbuster Video began to make game rentals a large scale service Nintendo claimed that allowing customers to rent games would significantly hurt sales and drive up the cost of games Nintendo lost the lawsuit but did win on a claim of copyright infringement Blockbuster was banned from including photocopies of original copyrighted instruction booklets with its rented games In compliance with the ruling Blockbuster produced original short instructions usually in the form of a small booklet card or label stuck on the back of the rental box that explained the game s basic premise and controls Video rental shops continued the practice of renting video games br br br Reception br By industry observers stated that the NES s popularity had grown so quickly that the market for Nintendo cartridges was larger than that for all home computer software Compute reported in that Nintendo had sold seven million NES systems in alone almost as many as the number of Commodore s sold in its first five years Computer game makers are scared stiff the magazine said stating that Nintendo s popularity caused most competitors to have poor sales during the previous Christmas and resulted in serious financial problems for some br br In June Nintendo of America s vice president of marketing Peter Main said that the Famicom was present in of Japan s households By of American households owned the NES compared to for all personal computers By the NES had outsold all previously released consoles worldwide The slogan for this brand was It can t be beaten The Nintendo Entertainment System was not available in the Soviet Union br In the early s gamers predicted that competition from technologically superior systems such as the bit Sega Genesis would mean the immediate end of the NES s dominance Instead during the first year of Nintendo s successor console the Super Famicom named Super Nintendo Entertainment System outside Japan the Famicom remained the second highest selling video game console in Japan outselling the newer and more powerful NEC PC Engine and Sega Mega Drive by a wide margin The console remained popular in Japan and North America until late when the demand for new NES software abruptly plummeted The final licensed Famicom game released in Japan is Takahashi Meijin no B ken Jima IV Adventure Island IV in North America is Wario s Woods and in Europe is The Lion King in In the wake of ever decreasing sales and the lack of new games Nintendo of America officially discontinued the NES by Nintendo produced new Famicom units in Japan until September and continued to repair Famicom consoles until October attributing the discontinuation of support to insufficient supplies of parts br The NES was initially not as successful in Europe during the late s when it was outsold by the Master System in the United Kingdom By the Master System was the highest selling console in Europe though the NES was beginning to have a fast growing user base in the United Kingdom During the early s NES sales caught up with and narrowly overtook the Master System overall in Western Europe though the Master System maintained its lead in several markets such as the United Kingdom Belgium and Spain br br br Legacy br br The NES was released two years after the video game crash of when many retailers and adult consumers regarded electronic games as a passing fad so many believed at first that the NES would soon fade Before the NES and Famicom Nintendo was known as a moderately successful Japanese toy and playing card manufacturer but the consoles popularity helped the company grow into an internationally recognized name almost synonymous with video games as Atari had been and set the stage for Japanese dominance of the video game industry With the NES Nintendo also changed the relationship between console manufacturers and third party software developers by restricting developers from publishing and distributing software without licensed approval This led to higher quality games which helped change the attitude of a public that had grown weary from poorly produced games for earlier systems br The NES hardware design is also very influential Nintendo chose the name Nintendo Entertainment System for the US market and redesigned the system so it would not give the appearance of a child s toy The front loading cartridge input allowed it to be used more easily in a TV stand with other entertainment devices such as a videocassette recorder br The system s hardware limitations led to design principles that still influence the development of modern video games Many prominent game franchises originated on the NES including Nintendo s own Super Mario Bros The Legend of Zelda and Metroid Capcom s Mega Man franchise Konami s Castlevania franchise Square s Final Fantasy and Enix s Dragon Quest franchises br NES imagery especially its controller has become a popular motif for a variety of products including Nintendo s Game Boy Advance br At the Tokyo Game Show in the Famicom was bestowed The Minister of Economy Trade and Industry Award in honour of the console s influence and laying down the foundations for the games industry br The NES library includes some influential games Super Mario Bros is the forerunner of side scrolling games while The Legend of Zelda had mostly influenced action adventure games and helped popularizing the save data in video games Other two influential games are Metroid and Castlevania which had established the Metroidvania genre br In IGN named the NES the greatest video game console of all time br br br Emulation br br The NES can be emulated on many other systems The first emulator was the Japanese only Pasofami It was soon followed by iNES which is available in English and is cross platform in It was described as being the first NES emulation software that could be used by a non expert The first version of NESticle an unofficial MS DOS based emulator was released on April Nintendo offers licensed emulation of some NES games via its Virtual Console service for the Wii Nintendo DS and Wii U and via its Nintendo Switch Online service br br br Re release br br On July Nintendo announced the November launch of a miniature replica of the NES named the Nintendo Entertainment System NES Classic Edition in the United States and Nintendo Classic Mini Nintendo Entertainment System in Europe and Australia The emulation based console includes permanently bundled games from the vintage NES library including the Super Mario Bros series and The Legend of Zelda series The system has HDMI display output and a new replica controller which can also connect to the Wii Remote for use with Virtual Console games It was discontinued in North America on April and worldwide on April However Nintendo announced in September that the NES Classic Mini would return to production on June only to be discontinued again permanently by December of that year br br br See also br History of Nintendo br Nintendo hard br Nintendo World Championships br br br Notes br br br
