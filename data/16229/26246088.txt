IEEE is an interface standard for a serial bus for high speed communications and isochronous real time data transfer It was developed in the late s and early s by Apple in cooperation with a number of companies primarily Sony and Panasonic It is most commonly known by the name FireWire Apple though other brand names exist such as i LINK Sony and Lynx Texas Instruments br The copper cable used in its most common implementation can be up to metres ft long Power and data is carried over this cable allowing devices with moderate power requirements to operate without a separate power supply FireWire is also available in Cat and optical fiber versions br The interface is comparable to USB USB was developed subsequently and gained much greater market share USB requires a host controller whereas IEEE is cooperatively managed by the connected devices br br br History and development br br FireWire is Apple s name for the IEEE High Speed Serial Bus Its development was initiated by Apple in and developed by the IEEE P Working Group largely driven by contributions from Sony patents Apple patents Panasonic patents and Philips patents in addition to contributions made by engineers from LG Electronics Toshiba Hitachi Canon INMOS SGS Thomson now STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments br IEEE is a serial bus architecture for high speed data transfer serial meaning that information is transferred one bit at a time Parallel buses utilize a number of different physical connections and as such are usually more costly and typically heavier IEEE fully supports both isochronous and asynchronous applications br Apple intended FireWire to be a serial replacement for the parallel SCSI bus while providing connectivity for digital audio and video equipment Apple s development began in the late s later presented to the IEEE and was completed in January In IEEE was a composite of four documents the original IEEE Std the IEEE Std a amendment the IEEE Std b amendment and the IEEE Std c amendment On June all these amendments as well as errata and some technical updates were incorporated into a superseding standard IEEE Std br Apple first included onboard FireWire in some of its Macintosh models though it had been a build to order option on some models since and most Apple Macintosh computers manufactured in the years through included FireWire ports However in February Apple introduced the first commercially available computer with Thunderbolt Apple released its last computers with FireWire in By Thunderbolt had become a standard feature across Apple s entire line of computers later with the exception of the inch MacBook introduced in which featured only a sole USB C port effectively becoming the spiritual successor to FireWire in the Apple ecosystem Apple s last products with FireWire the Thunderbolt Display and inch MacBook Pro were discontinued in Apple previously sold a Thunderbolt to FireWire Adapter which provided one FireWire port A separate adapter was required to use it with Thunderbolt br Sony s implementation of the system i LINK used a smaller connector with only four signal conductors omitting the two conductors that provide power for devices in favor of a separate power connector This style was later added into the a amendment This port is sometimes labeled S or S to indicate speed in Mbit s br The system was commonly used to connect data storage devices and DV digital video cameras but was also popular in industrial systems for machine vision and professional audio systems Many users preferred it over the more common USB for its then greater effective speed and power distribution capabilities Benchmarks show that the sustained data transfer rates are higher for FireWire than for USB but lower than USB Results are marked on Apple Mac OS X but more varied on Microsoft Windows br br br Patent considerations br Implementation of IEEE is said to require use of issued international patents held by ten corporations Use of these patents requires licensing use without license generally constitutes patent infringement Companies holding IEEE IP formed a patent pool with MPEG LA LLC as the license administrator to whom they licensed patents MPEG LA sublicenses these patents to providers of equipment implementing IEEE Under the typical patent pool license a royalty of US per unit is payable by the manufacturer upon the manufacture of each finished product no royalties are payable by users br The last of the patents MY by Sony expired on November As of November the following are patent holders of the IEEE standard as listed in the patent pool managed by MPEG LA br br A person or company may review the actual Patent Portfolio License upon request to MPEG LA MPEG LA does not provide assurance of protection to licensees beyond its own patents At least one formerly licensed patent is known to have been removed from the pool and other hardware patents exist that reference IEEE br The High Performance Serial Bus Trade Association the TA was formed to aid the marketing of IEEE Its bylaws prohibit dealing with intellectual property issues The Trade Association operates on an individual no cost membership basis to further enhancements to standards The Trade Association also is the library source for all documentation and standards available br br br Technical specifications br FireWire can connect up to peripherals in a tree or daisy chain topology as opposed to Parallel SCSI s electrical bus topology It allows peer to peer device communication such as communication between a scanner and a printer to take place without using system memory or the CPU FireWire also supports multiple host controllers per bus It is designed to support plug and play and hot swapping The copper cable it uses in its most common implementation can be up to metres ft long and is more flexible than most parallel SCSI cables In its six conductor or nine conductor variations it can supply up to watts of power per port at up to volts allowing moderate consumption devices to operate without a separate power supply br FireWire devices implement the ISO IEC configuration ROM model for device configuration and identification to provide plug and play capability All FireWire devices are identified by an IEEE EUI unique identifier in addition to well known codes indicating the type of device and the protocols it supports br FireWire devices are organized at the bus in a tree topology Each device has a unique self ID One of the nodes is elected root node and always has the highest ID The self IDs are assigned during the self ID process which happens after each bus resets The order in which the self IDs are assigned is equivalent to traversing the tree depth first post order br FireWire is capable of safely operating critical systems due to the way multiple devices interact with the bus and how the bus allocates bandwidth to the devices FireWire is capable of both asynchronous and isochronous transfer methods at once Isochronous data transfers are transfers for devices that require continuous guaranteed bandwidth In an aircraft for instance isochronous devices include control of the rudder mouse operations and data from pressure sensors outside the aircraft All these elements require constant uninterrupted bandwidth To support both elements FireWire dedicates a certain percentage to isochronous data and the rest to asynchronous data In IEEE of the bus is reserved for isochronous cycles leaving asynchronous data with a minimum of of the bus br br br Encoding scheme br FireWire uses Data Strobe encoding D S encoding In D S encoding two non return to zero NRZ signals are used to transmit the data with high reliability The NRZ signal sent is fed with the clock signal through an XOR gate creating a strobe signal This strobe is then put through another XOR gate along with the data signal to reconstruct the clock This in turn acts as the bus s phase locked loop for synchronization purposes br br br Arbitration br The process of the bus deciding which node gets to transmit data at what time is known as arbitration Each arbitration round lasts about microseconds During the round the root node device nearest the processor sends a cycle start packet All nodes requiring data transfer respond with the closest node winning After the node is finished the remaining nodes take turns in order This repeats until all the devices have used their portion of the microseconds with isochronous transfers having priority br br br Standards and versions br The previous standards and its three published amendments are now incorporated into a superseding standard IEEE The features individually added give a good history on the development path br br br FireWire IEEE br The original release of IEEE specified what is now known as FireWire It can transfer data between devices at or Mbit s half duplex data rates the actual transfer rates are and Mbit s i e and MB s respectively These different transfer modes are commonly referred to as S S and S br Cable length is limited to metres ft although up to cables can be daisy chained using active repeaters external hubs or internal hubs are often present in FireWire equipment The S standard limits any configuration s maximum cable length to metres ft The conductor connector is commonly found on desktop computers and can supply the connected device with power br The conductor powered connector now referred to as an alpha connector adds power output to support external devices Typically a device can pull about to watts from the port however the voltage varies significantly from different devices Voltage is specified as unregulated and should nominally be about volts range to Apple s implementation on laptops is typically related to battery power and can be as low as V br br br Improvements IEEE a br An amendment IEEE a was released in which clarified and improved the original specification It added support for asynchronous streaming quicker bus reconfiguration packet concatenation and a power saving suspend mode br IEEE a offers a couple of advantages over the original IEEE a is capable of arbitration accelerations allowing the bus to accelerate arbitration cycles to improve efficiency It also allows for arbitrated short bus reset in which a node can be added or dropped without causing a big drop in isochronous transmission br a also standardized the conductor alpha connector developed by Sony and trademarked as i LINK already widely in use on consumer devices such as camcorders most PC laptops a number of PC desktops and other small FireWire devices The conductor connector is fully data compatible with conductor alpha interfaces but lacks power connectors br br br FireWire IEEE b br br IEEE b introduced FireWire Apple s name for the conductor S bilingual version of the IEEE b standard This specification and corresponding products allow a transfer rate of Mbit s full duplex via a new encoding scheme termed beta mode It is backwards compatible with the slower rates and conductor alpha connectors of FireWire However while the IEEE a and IEEE b standards are compatible FireWire s connector referred to as a beta connector is different from FireWire s alpha connectors making legacy cables incompatible A bilingual cable allows the connection of older devices to the newer port In Apple was the first to introduce commercial products with the new connector including a new model of the Power Mac G and a PowerBook G br The full IEEE b specification supports data rates up to Mbit s i e MB s over beta mode or optical connections up to metres ft in length Standard Category e unshielded twisted pair supports metres ft at S The original and a standards used data strobe D S encoding renamed to alpha mode with the cables while b added a data encoding scheme called b b referred to as beta mode br Beta mode is based on b b from Gigabit Ethernet also used for many other protocols b b encoding involves expanding an bit data word into bits with the extra bits after the th and th data bits The partitioned data is sent through a Running Disparity calculator function The Running Disparity calculator attempts to keep the number of s transmitted equal to s thereby assuring a DC balanced signal Then the different partitions are sent through a b b encoder for the bit partition and a b b encoder for the bit partition This gives the packet the ability to have at least two s ensuring synchronization of the PLL at the receiving end to the correct bit boundaries for reliable transfer An additional function of the coding scheme is to support the arbitration for bus access and general bus control This is possible due to the surplus symbols afforded by the b b expansion While bit symbols can encode a maximum of values bit symbols permit the encoding of up to Symbols invalid for the current state of the receiving PHY indicate data errors br br br FireWire S T IEEE c br IEEE c was published on June It provided a major technical improvement namely new port specification that provides Mbit s over the same P C Ethernet connectors with Category e cable which is specified in IEEE clause gigabit Ethernet over copper twisted pair along with a corresponding automatic negotiation that allows the same port to connect to either IEEE Std or IEEE Ethernet devices br br br FireWire S and S br In December the Trade Association announced that products would be available before the end of using the S and S modes that for the most part had already been defined in b and were further clarified in IEEE Std The Gbit s and Gbit s devices use the same conductor beta connectors as the existing FireWire and are fully compatible with existing S and S devices It competes with USB br S Symwave and S Dap Technology development units have been made however because of FPGA technology DapTechnology targeted S implementations first with S not becoming commercially available until br Steve Jobs declared FireWire dead in As of there were few S devices released with a Sony camera being the only notable user br br br Future enhancements including P d br A project named IEEE P d was formed by the IEEE on March to add single mode fiber as an additional transport medium to FireWire The project was withdrawn in br Other future iterations of FireWire were expected to increase speed to Gbit s and additional connectors such as the small multimedia interface br br br Operating system support br Full support for IEEE a and b is available for Microsoft Windows FreeBSD Linux Apple Mac OS through macOS Sonoma and NetBSD br In Windows XP a degradation in performance of devices may have occurred with installation of Service Pack This was resolved in Hotfix and in SP Some FireWire hardware manufacturers also provide custom device drivers that replace the Microsoft OHCI host adapter driver stack enabling S capable devices to run at full Mbit s transfer rates on older versions of Windows XP SP w o Hotfix and Windows Vista At the time of its release Microsoft Windows Vista supported only a with assurances that b support would come in the next service pack Service Pack for Microsoft Windows Vista has since been released however the addition of b support is not mentioned anywhere in the release documentation The bus driver was rewritten for Windows to provide support for higher speeds and alternative media br In Linux support was originally provided by libraw making direct communication between user space and IEEE buses Subsequently a new kernel driver stack nicknamed JuJu has been implemented br br br Cable TV system support br Under FCC Code CFR section subsections and Cable TV providers in the US with digital systems must upon request of a customer have provided a high definition capable cable box with a functional FireWire interface This applied only to customers leasing high definition capable cable boxes from their cable provider after April br The interface can be used to display or record Cable TV including HDTV programming In June the FCC issued an order that permitted set top boxes to include IP based interfaces in place of FireWire br br br Comparison with USB br While both technologies provide similar end results there are fundamental differences between USB and FireWire USB requires the presence of a host controller typically a PC which connects point to point with the USB device This allows for simpler and lower cost peripherals at the cost of lowered functionality of the bus Intelligent hubs are required to connect multiple USB devices to a single USB host controller By contrast FireWire is essentially a peer to peer network where any device may serve as the host or client allowing multiple devices to be connected on one bus br The FireWire host interface supports DMA and memory mapped devices allowing data transfers to happen without loading the host CPU with interrupts and buffer copy operations Additionally FireWire features two data buses for each segment of the bus network whereas until USB USB featured only one This means that FireWire can have communication in both directions at the same time full duplex whereas USB communication prior to can only occur in one direction at any one time half duplex br While USB expanded into the fully backwards compatible USB and using the same main connector type FireWire used a different connector between and implementations br br br Common applications br br br Consumer automobiles br IDB Customer Convenience Port CCP was the automotive version of the standard br br br Consumer audio and video br IEEE was the High Definition Audio Video Network Alliance HANA standard connection interface for A V audio visual component communication and control HANA was dissolved in September and the Trade Association assumed control of all HANA generated intellectual property br br br Military and aerospace vehicles br SAE Aerospace standard AS originally released in and reaffirmed in establishes IEEE standards as a military and aerospace databus network in those vehicles AS is utilized by several large programs including the F Lightning II the X B UCAV aircraft AGM weapon and JPSS polar satellite for NOAA AS combines existing features like looped topology with additional features like transformer isolation and time synchronization to create deterministic double and triple fault tolerant data bus networks br br br General networking br FireWire can be used for ad hoc terminals only no routers except where a FireWire hub is used computer networks Specifically RFC specifies how to run IPv over the FireWire interface and RFC specifies how to run IPv br Mac OS X Linux and FreeBSD include support for networking over FireWire Windows Windows Windows Me Windows XP and Windows Server include native support for IEEE networking Windows does not have native support but may work with third party drivers A network can be set up between two computers using a single standard FireWire cable or by multiple computers through use of a hub This is similar to Ethernet networks with the major differences being transfer speed conductor length and the fact that standard FireWire cables can be used for point to point communication br On December Microsoft announced that it would discontinue support for IP networking over the FireWire interface in all future versions of Microsoft Windows Consequently support for this feature is absent from Windows Vista and later Windows releases br Microsoft rewrote their driver in Windows but networking support for FireWire is not present Unibrain offers free FireWire networking drivers for Windows called ubCore which support Windows Vista and later versions br Earlier models of the PlayStation console SCPH x to x series had an i LINK branded connector This was used for networking until the release of an Ethernet adapter later in the console s lifespan but very few software titles supported the feature The connector was removed from the SCPH x series onward br br br IIDC br IIDC Instrumentation Industrial Digital Camera is the FireWire data format standard for live video and is used by Apple s iSight A V camera The system was designed for machine vision systems but is also used for other computer vision applications and for some webcams Although they are easily confused since they both run over FireWire IIDC is different from and incompatible with the ubiquitous AV C Audio Video Control used to control camcorders and other consumer video devices br br br DV br Digital Video DV is a standard protocol used by some digital camcorders All DV cameras that recorded to tape media had a FireWire interface usually a conductor All DV ports on camcorders only operate at the slower Mbit s speed of FireWire This presents operational issues if the camcorder is daisy chained from a faster S device or via a common hub because any segment of a FireWire network cannot support multiple speed communication br Labeling of the port varied by manufacturer with Sony using either its i LINK trademark or the letters DV Many digital video recorders have a DV input FireWire connector usually an alpha connector that can be used to record video directly from a DV camcorder computer free The protocol also accommodates remote control play rewind etc of connected devices and can stream time code from a camera br USB is unsuitable for the transfer of the video data from tape because tape by its very nature does not support variable data rates USB relies heavily on processor support and this was not guaranteed to service the USB port in time The later move away from tape towards solid state memory or disc media e g SD Cards optical disks or hard drives has facilitated moving to USB transfer because file based data can be moved in segments as required br br br Frame grabbers br IEEE interface is commonly found in frame grabbers devices that capture and digitize an analog video signal however IEEE is facing competition from the Gigabit Ethernet interface citing speed and availability issues br br br iPod and iPhone synchronization and charging br iPods released prior to the iPod with Dock Connector used IEEE a ports for transferring music files and charging but in the FireWire port in iPods was succeeded by Apple s dock connector and IEEE to pin connector cables were made Apple began removing backwards compatibility with FireWire cables starting with the first generation iPod nano and fifth generation iPod both of which could only sync via USB but retained the ability to charge through FireWire This was also carried over to the second and third generation nanos as well as the iPod Classic Backwards compatibility was removed completely beginning with the iPhone G second generation iPod touch and the fourth generation iPod nano all of which could only charge and sync via USB br br br Security issues br Devices on a FireWire bus can communicate by direct memory access DMA where a device can use hardware to map internal memory to FireWire s physical memory space The SBP Serial Bus Protocol used by FireWire disk drives uses this capability to minimize interrupts and buffer copies In SBP the initiator controlling device sends a request by remotely writing a command into a specified area of the target s FireWire address space This command usually includes buffer addresses in the initiator s FireWire Physical Address Space which the target is supposed to use for moving I O data to and from the initiator br On many implementations particularly those like PCs and Macs using the popular OHCI the mapping between the FireWire physical memory space and device physical memory is done in hardware without operating system intervention While this enables high speed and low latency communication between data sources and sinks without unnecessary copying such as between a video camera and a software video recording application or between a disk drive and the application buffers this can also be a security or media rights restriction risk if untrustworthy devices are attached to the bus and initiate a DMA attack One of the applications known to exploit this to gain unauthorized access to running Windows Mac OS and Linux computers is the spyware FinFireWire For this reason high security installations typically either use newer machines that map a virtual memory space to the FireWire physical memory space such as a Power Mac G or any Sun workstation disable relevant drivers at operating system level disable the OHCI hardware mapping between FireWire and device memory physically disable the entire FireWire interface or opt to not use FireWire or other hardware like PCMCIA PC Card ExpressCard or Thunderbolt which expose DMA to external components br An unsecured FireWire interface can be used to debug a machine whose operating system has crashed and in some systems for remote console operations Windows natively supports this scenario of kernel debugging although newer Windows Insider Preview builds no longer include the ability out of the box On FreeBSD the dcons driver provides both using gdb as debugger Under Linux firescope and fireproxy exist br br br See also br DMA attack br HAVi br Linux IEEE target br List of interface bit rates br Pin control attack
