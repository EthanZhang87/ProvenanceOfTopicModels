An analog stick analogue stick in British English also known as control stick joystick or thumbstick is an input device for a controller often a game controller that is used for two dimensional input An analog stick is a variation of a joystick consisting of a protrusion from the controller input is based on the position of this protrusion in relation to the default center position While digital sticks rely on single electrical connections for movement using internal digital electrical contacts for up down left and right analog sticks use continuous electrical activity running through potentiometers to measure the exact position of the stick within its full range of motion The analog stick has greatly overtaken the D pad in both prominence and usage in console video games br br br Usage in video games br The initial prevalence of analog sticks was as peripherals for flight simulator games to better reflect the subtleties of control required for such titles It was during the fifth console generation that Nintendo announced it would integrate an analog stick into its iconic Nintendo controller a step which would pave the way for subsequent leading console manufacturers to follow suit br An analog stick is often used to move some game object usually the playable character It may also be used to rotate the camera usually around the character The analog stick can serve a great variety of other functions depending on the game Today many analog sticks can also be pushed in like conventional face buttons of a controller to allow for more functions With the prevalence of analog sticks the aforementioned limitations of the D pad ceased to be an issue br br br Dual analog sticks br br Two analog sticks offer greater functionality than a single stick On some modern game controllers the analog sticks are staggered such that the left stick is positioned to the upper left of the D pad while the right stick is positioned to the lower left of the face buttons The controllers of all of Microsoft s Xbox consoles Xbox controller Xbox controller and Xbox Wireless Controller as well as controllers for Nintendo s GameCube and Switch GameCube controller the dual Joy Con Comfort Grip and the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller utilize a staggered analog stick layout br Other controllers instead have the two analog sticks in a symmetrical configuration with a D pad on the left thumb position and face buttons at the right thumb position with analog sticks below and closer to the center on both sides Sony s PlayStation series analog controllers the Dual Analog Controller DualShock DualShock Sixaxis DualShock DualShock and DualSense all use this configuration with the remainder of the controller layout closely resembling the original digital PlayStation controller The Classic Controller for the Wii also uses this configuration The original configuration of the Wii U GamePad controller had twin analog Circle Pads positioned symmetrically above the D pad and face buttons but was reconfigured to have twin clickable analog sticks several months ahead of the system s planned launch This setup also carried over to the Wii U Pro Controller br With genres such as action adventure games platforming and shooting the left stick normally controls the character s movement while the second stick controls the camera The use of a second analog stick alleviated problems in many earlier platform games in which the camera was notorious for bad positioning The right stick not only allows for camera control in third person games but is almost essential for most modern first person shooters such as Halo where it controls the player s gaze and aim as opposed to the left stick which controls where the player moves In Namco s Katamari Damacy and its sequels both analog sticks are used at once to control the player s character br In spite of widespread adoption of dual analog sticks a few modern video game systems are designed without a second analog stick namely the Wii s standard controller whose lone analog stick is implemented in the Wii Remote s Nunchuk attachment Sony s PSP and Nintendo s DS While the Wii s abovementioned supplemental Classic Controller accessory and its initial backwards compatibility support of the GameCube controller allow for dual stick control schemes in certain games the PSP s complete lack of a second analog stick and later the DS initial lack of such feature have been criticized Nintendo has since released an add on for the DS that adds among other things a second analog circle pad The follow up to the PSP the PlayStation Vita features dual analog sticks It is the first handheld game console to do so The New Nintendo DS line of systems added a second analog controller known as the C Stick to the right side of the device br br br Neutral position and drifting br To operate properly an analog stick must establish a neutral position a special unique position which the stick must maintain that the controller would interpret as an intentional cessation or absence of in game movement Ideally this would be the stick s very center when it is not touched or moved Whenever the controller is activated or the system it is connected to is powered on the current position of its analog stick s become the established neutral position If the analog stick is moved away from its center during a time while it is established the neutral position would shift to some place away from the center of the stick causing the controller to interpret the center motionless position of the stick as in game movement since it is not the neutral position as it should be This phenomenon commonly called drifting causes undesired gameplay effects depending on the current game s controls such as constant movement of the player character in a single direction or the game camera being skewed towards one particular angle while the affected stick is unmoved and can only be corrected by performing particular actions that would restore the affected analog stick s neutral position back to the center of the analog stick For Nintendo controllers with analog sticks this would involve holding down a certain combination of buttons while the affected analog sticks are untouched br br br History br br br Analog joysticks br br Shortly after the introduction of the first microcomputers Cromemco introduced a S bus card containing an analog to digital converter and shortly after a card with two of these and an associated analog joystick the JS This is the first known example of such a device for personal use br The first consumer games console which had analog joysticks was the Prinztronic Acetronic Interton series launched in This system was widely cloned throughout Europe and available under several brand names The sticks each used a pair of potentiometers they were not self centering in most models but some such as those of the Interton VC models did self center br When the Apple II was released it shipped with an analog paddle controller as a standard input but these failed to meet FCC emissions guidelines and Apple Inc was forced to stop selling them This left hundreds of games unable to be used and this problem was quickly rectified by rd party suppliers Not long after these same companies began producing analog joysticks for the system but these took some time to become popular br In Atari released a controller with a potentiometer based analog joystick for their Atari home console However its non centering joystick design proved to be ungainly and unreliable due to the filing alienating many consumers at the time During that same year General Consumer Electronics introduced the Vectrex a vector graphics based system which used a self centering analog thumbstick br In Sega s third person rail shooter game Space Harrier released for the arcades introduced an analog flight stick for movement It could register movement in any direction as well as measure the degree of push which could move the player character at different speeds depending on how far the joystick is pushed in a certain direction br Sega s analog Mission Stick was released for the Saturn console on September On April Sony released a potentiometer based analog joystick for use in Flight Simulation games The Sony Dual Analog FlightStick featured twin analog sticks and was used in games such as Descent to provide a much greater degree of freedom than the typical digital joysticks of the day br br br Analog thumbsticks br The NES Max released in is the first instance of a thumb pad based joystick controller The Quickshot Chimera is another example of an early thumbstick controller available to the NES br In the Japanese company Dempa released an analog thumbstick controller called the XE AP for the Sega Genesis console and several Japanese computers It was intended to replicate the HOTAS controls found in Sega s arcade games at the time such as After Burner II This controller included a thumb operated control stick which allowed for varying levels of movement and near degree control translating into far more precise movements than what is possible with a D pad It was released twice with a price drop upon its re release in A few games on the Genesis as well as the Sega CD and X add ons supported the controller s analog stick functions including some of Sega s first party games for the system br br Initially announced in late Nintendo released their Nintendo controller on June in Japan The new controller included a thumb operated control stick which while a digital stick the analog stick operated on the same principles as a mechanical ball type computer mouse still allowed for varying levels of movement and near degree control translating into far more precise movements than were possible with a D pad For three generations Nintendo s control stick was distinguished from analog sticks used in other major consoles by its surrounding octagonal area of freedom that only allowed it to be moved in any of eight different directions with each one assigned to each of the octagon s eight vertices where the control stick could be pushed towards Nintendo would eventually change this octagonal area to the circle widely used in other console controllers during the eighth generation starting with the Nintendo DS and Wii U to allow for many more different movement directions beyond these eight br On July Sega released Nights into Dreams for their Saturn console in Japan bundled with it was the Saturn D control pad which featured an analog pad intended to give the player more fluid control over that game s flight based gameplay The analog pad used magnet based Hall effect sensors which was a unique implementation of the technology that was carried forward into the design of the Dreamcast controller as well The Saturn s analog controller was previously mentioned in the June issue of Computer and Video Games magazine br On April Sony introduced the world s first dual stick controller for its game console PlayStation Based on the same potentiometer technology that was used in the larger Dual Analog Flightstick the Sony Dual Analog Controller featured rumble removed in overseas versions three modes of analog Flightstick Full Analog and Analog Off and dual plastic concave thumbsticks It also added two new buttons L and R under the thumbsticks which could be used by pressing down on the sticks br On November Sony released their third analog controller to the market the DualShock The controller featured similar twin analog sticks to the Dual Analog although they featured convex rubber tips rather than concave plastic ones It also removed the third analog Flightstick mode and added two rumble motors br In Sony s Ape Escape became the first video game in history to require the use of two analog sticks br In the console generations that followed many video game console controllers have included two analog sticks with the exception of the Sega Dreamcast controller and Nintendo s Wii Remote controller Other exceptions to this dual stick rule are Sony s PlayStation Portable and Nintendo s DS handheld game consoles aside from the New DS although the latter may be upgraded to dual stick functionality through the use of an accessory which both feature only a single small flat sliding analog nub However Sony s PlayStation Vita does have a dual analog stick configuration br br br See also br D pad br Wired glove br br br br br br External links br How Stuff Works articles on br br Nintendo control pad
