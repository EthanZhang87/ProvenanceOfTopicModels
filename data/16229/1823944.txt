A yoke alternatively known as a control wheel or a control column is a device used for piloting some fixed wing aircraft br The pilot uses the yoke to control the attitude of the plane usually in both pitch and roll Rotating the control wheel controls the ailerons and the roll axis Fore and aft movement of the control column controls the elevator and the pitch axis When the yoke is pulled back the nose of the aircraft rises When the yoke is pushed forward the nose is lowered When the yoke is turned left the plane rolls to the left and when it is turned to the right the plane rolls to the right br Small to medium size aircraft usually limited to propeller driven feature a mechanical system whereby the yoke is connected directly to the control surfaces with cables and rods Human muscle power alone is not enough for larger and more powerful aircraft so hydraulic systems are used in which yoke movements control hydraulic valves and actuators In more modern aircraft inputs may first be sent to a fly by wire system which then sends a corresponding signal to actuators attached to the aileron booster systems and control surfaces Yokes may feature a stick shaker which is designed to help indicate the onset of stall or even a stick pusher which physically pushes the yoke to prevent a stall br br br Styles br Yokes come in a variety of shapes and sizes the most common being of a U or W design Some aircraft use a ram s horn style yoke shaped like an M such as Embraer aircraft and the Concorde There are some rarer exotic or archaic styles such as circular or semi circular designs much like a steering wheel br In larger aircraft they are usually on a post protruding vertically from the floor referred to as a control column In most other planes they are pivot point mounted on a horizontal tube that comes out of the instrument panel br In the case of the Cirrus SR and Cirrus SR although the control looks like a side stick it works like a yoke handle referred to in the industry as a side yoke The Cessna uses a similar device br br br Advantages and disadvantages br Side sticks and centre sticks are better for making rapid control inputs and dealing with high g forces hence their use in military sport and aerobatic aircraft However yokes are less sensitive i e more precise due to a larger range of motion and provide more visual feedback to the pilot br Most yokes are connected and will both move together thus providing instant indication to the other pilot when one makes a control input This is in contrast to some fly by wire control sticks that allow each pilot to send different and sometimes greatly conflicting inputs Competing inputs are signaled on Airbus craft br Yokes take up more room than side sticks in the cockpit and may even obscure some instruments by comparison side sticks have minimal cockpit intrusion allowing the inclusion of retractable tray tables and making it easier to enter leave small cockpits br A yoke unlike a side stick may be used comfortably with either hand This can be useful if one needs to write or manipulate other controls in the cockpit This advantage is shared with the center stick br br br Ancillary functions br The yoke often incorporates other key functions such as housing thumb or finger buttons to enable the radio microphone disengage the autopilot and trim the aircraft In addition there may be a clipboard checklist or chronometer located in the yoke s center br br br Alternative control systems br Yokes are not used on all aircraft Helicopters use a cyclic and the majority of military fighter aircraft use a center or side stick Some light aircraft use a stick due to pilot preference The latest Airbus family of passenger jets use a side stick similar to a joystick to actuate control surfaces br There are also computer input devices designed to simulate a yoke intended for flight simulators br br br See also br Index of aviation articles br Aircraft flight control system br HOTAS an acronym for hands on throttle and stick br Rudder pedals br br br
