Third person shooter TPS is a subgenre of D shooter games in which the gameplay consists primarily of shooting It is closely related to first person shooters but with the player character visible on screen during play While D shoot em up games also employ a third person perspective the TPS genre is distinguished by having the game presented with the player s avatar as a primary focus of the camera s view br br br Definition br br A third person shooter is a game structured around shooting and in which the player can see the avatar on screen in a third person view Third person shooters are distinguished from other shooter games that may present the game from a third person view such as shoot em ups as the game is presented with the player s avatar as a primary focus of the camera s view Third person shooters are analogous to first person shooters in terms of immersion but simply displace the camera from being at the eyes of the character to a point slightly above and behind them in most cases br br br Design br It is a D genre that grew to prominence during the s especially on game consoles It features shooter game elements sometimes combining these with the jumping and climbing elements of puzzle based games and brawlers Third person shooter games sometimes incorporate an aim assist feature to compensate for the difficulty of aiming from a third person camera Many include some form of first person view which allows precise shooting and looking around at environment features that are otherwise hidden from the default camera In early examples of the genre the player would often be required to stand still to use first person view but newer titles allow the player to play like a FPS br br br Relationship to first person shooters br These games are closely related to first person shooters which also tie the perspective of the player to an avatar distinguished only in a minor change of position of the player camera While the first person perspective allows players to aim and shoot without their avatar blocking their view the third person shooter shows the protagonist from an over the shoulder shot or behind the back perspective Thus the third person perspective allows the game designer to create a more strongly characterized avatar and directs the player s attention as in watching a film In contrast a first person perspective provides the player with greater immersion into the game universe br Third person shooters allow players to see the area surrounding the avatar more clearly This viewpoint facilitates more interaction between the character and their surrounding environment such as the use of a tactical system in Gears of War or navigating tight quarters As such the third person perspective is better for interacting with objects in the game world such as jumping on platforms engaging in close combat or driving a vehicle However the third person perspective can interfere with tasks that require fine aiming br Third person shooters sometimes compensate for their distinct perspective by designing larger more spacious environments than first person shooters br The boundaries between third person and first person shooters are not always clear For example many third person shooters allow the player to use a first person viewpoint for challenges that require precise aiming while others simply allow a player to freely switch between first and third person perspectives at will The first person shooter Halo Combat Evolved was actually designed as a third person shooter but added a first person perspective to improve the interface for aiming and shooting The game switches to a third person viewpoint when the avatar is piloting a vehicle and this combination of first person for aiming and third person for driving has since been used in other games Metroid Prime is another first person shooter that switches to a third person perspective when rolling around the environment using the morph ball Many games in the genre such as the ARMA series and its descendants including the popular battle royale shooter PUBG allow players to freely transition between first and third person perspectives at will br Alexander R Galloway writes that the real time over the shoulder tracking shots of Gus Van Sant s Elephant evoke third person shooter games like Max Payne a close cousin of the FPS br br br History br br br D and pseudo D shooters br D third person shooters have existed since the earliest days of video games dating back to Spacewar third person perspective shooting is also featured in its clones Galaxy Game and Computer Space Arcade shooters with a D third person perspective include Nintendo s Radar Scope Atari s Tempest Nihon Bussan s Tube Panic Sega s Space Harrier Atari s Xybots and Square s D WorldRunner and JJ Third person shooters for home computers include Dan Gorlin s Airheart and Paul Norman s Beyond Forbidden Forest br Konami s run gun shooter Contra featured several third person shooter levels where the player trudges through indoor enemy bases Konami s Devastators is a third person shooter where rather than moving forward automatically the player walks forward by holding the Up direction as the background slowly scales toward the screen Devastators also featured various obstacles that could be used to take cover from enemy fire as well as two player cooperative gameplay A similar shooter released that same year was Cabal which inspired many of its own Cabal clones such as NAM and Wild Guns Kurt Kalata of Hardcore Gaming cites Sega s Last Survivor released for arcades and then ported to the FM Towns and FM Towns Marty featuring eight player deathmatch He notes that it has a perspective and split screen similar to Xybots but with entirely different gameplay and controls br br br D polygon shooters br In Namco released a two player competitive D third person shooter vehicle combat game Cyber Sled A year later Elite Systems Ltd released Virtuoso on the DO This was an early example of a home console third person shooter which featured a human protagonist on foot as opposed to controlling a vehicle and made use of polygonal D graphics along with sprites in a D environment Fade to Black was also a fully D third person shooter released around this time but as well as featuring an on foot protagonist rather than a vehicle utilised entirely polygonal D graphics br Tomb Raider by Eidos Interactive now Square Enix Europe is claimed by some commentators as a third person shooter and Jonathan S Harbour of the University of Advancing Technology argues that it s largely responsible for the popularity of this genre Other commentators have considered it influential on later third person shooters such as BloodRayne The Contra Adventure MDK Duke Nukem Time To Kill Burning Rangers and Heavy Metal F A K K The game eschewed the popular first person perspective of games such as Doom instead making use of third person viewpoints wide D environments and a control system inspired by Prince of Persia Mega Man Legends by Capcom is another early D third person shooter which took a different approach to the genre mixing this with a role playing game influence Around the same time Deathtrap Dungeon by Eidos Interactive and MediEvil by SCE Studio Cambridge then Millennium Interactive were some of the first D games in the genre to include third person shooter influences in a fantasy setting with fictional or alternative weapons achieving the same effect as a gun for the player Die Hard Trilogy by Fox Interactive was met with critical acclaim at the time of its release and the section of the game based around the first Die Hard film in the trilogy was another early take on a D third person shooter br br Syphon Filter by Eidetic now Bend Studio combined the perspective of Tomb Raider with action elements of games such as GoldenEye and Metal Gear Solid Richard Rouse III wrote in Game Developer that the game was the most popular third person shooter for the PlayStation The Nintendo version of Army Men Sarge s Heroes by The DO Company was released the same year as Syphon Filter and is an early example of a popular third person shooter which introduced the player being allowed to control aiming of their weapon themselves by means of two control sticks In Tomb Raider and Syphon Filter on the other hand the protagonists automatically aimed at antagonists Forcing or allowing the player to control aiming themselves either using control sticks or a mouse would go on to become commonplace in later games in the genre such as Oni Max Payne and SOCOM Max Payne was acclaimed as a superlative third person shooter inspired by Hong Kong action cinema Several platform games with third person shooter elements were also released during that time examples included Ratchet Clank and most of the games in the Jak and Daxter series both of which were designed for younger audiences than most third person shooters br Resident Evil was influential in helping to redefine the third person shooter genre with its use of over the shoulder offset camera angles where the camera is placed directly over the right shoulder and therefore doesn t obscure the action An important gameplay mechanic that helped revolutionize third person shooters in the past decade was the cover system Koei s WinBack has a cover system Kill Switch features the cover system as its core game mechanic along with a blind fire mechanic Gears of War employed tactical elements such as taking cover influenced by Kill Switch using off center viewpoints inspired by Resident Evil The game also employed grittier themes than other titles and used a unique feature which rewarded the player for correctly reloading weapons Gears of War as well as games such as Army of Two place a greater emphasis on two player cooperative play as does Resident Evil As of the third person shooter genre has a large audience outside Japan particularly in North America Vanquish by PlatinumGames featured a gameplay style reminiscent of bullet hell shooters with bullets and missiles coming from all directions br The third person shooter genre is still quite popular in contemporary gaming circles In Rockstar Games released Max Payne which was praised for its refined gameplay In Nintendo published multiplayer third person shooter game Splatoon for the Wii U which was followed by two sequels for Nintendo Switch in and respectively with Splatoon being one of the console s highest selling games and Splatoon becoming one of the fastest selling Switch games
