Thrustmaster in in Hillsboro Oregon By early the company began advertising the Thrustmaster Weapons Control System in computer magazines It worked mainly on developing flight control for simulation on IBM Compatible Computers The company has utilized the HOTAS system for use in computer flight simulation and has modeled some controllers after flight controls of real aircraft The company made its name in making expensive but high quality HOTAS controllers in the mid s By its sales grew to million and then to million by br In July the gaming peripherals operations and brand name was acquired from Thrustmaster for million by the Guillemot Corporation Group of France which also bought Hercules Computer Technology that same year and merged the two companies in a company called Hercules Thrustmaster with headquarters in Carentoir France while keeping the brands separate br The new Thrustmaster company gradually extended the product portfolio beyond flight simulation to other

A T Wireless Dual Analog eSwap DualShock controller br gaming headphones as Y C CPX T Assault Six T Racing Scuderia Ferrari Edition and T Flight U S Air Force Edition headset br In Thrustmaster turnover is million US million br br br HOTAS Cougar br Formerly one of their most expensive joysticks is the HOTAS Cougar a close but not exact reproduction of both the throttle and stick that is used in the real F block fighter aircraft The product features all metal construction and numerous programming possibilities but is hampered by low quality potentiometers leading to a thriving replacement industry Some of the devices have had reported quality problems including play in the centering springs and the tendency of the speedbrake switch to break due to a manufacturing defect this has been fixed on later serial numbers br Many independent companies have produced replacement components for the Cougar to address these issues These include redesigned gimbals that center more firmly contactless potentiometers to replace worn originals and even several force controlled mods that make the stick sense pressure without moving similar to an F stick Besides fixing complaints with the original product these aftermarket parts have the potential to extend the life of the Cougar well past the time when Thrustmaster stops supporting it but usually at double even triple the price of the original purchase However the market for such mods tends to be limited and many customers keep their Cougars as they came from the factory br The HOTAS Cougar was replaced by the HOTAS Warthog in which replicates the flight controls used in the A Thunderbolt II using Hall effect sensors for the joystick and throttle axes instead of potentiometers br br br Ferrari partnership br In Thrustmaster made their first ever replica wheel of the Ferrari Modena This is then followed in when a wheel was inspired by seven time World Champion Michael Schumacher After three years Thrustmaster came out with the Enzo racing wheel br The next wheel to come out was in May when the concept of the Ferrari Wireless GT Cockpit Scuderia Edition racing wheel comes out In July of that same year the

Edition which is a replica of the yoke on a Boeing and a three axis quadrant which can be configured with flaps throttle and spoilers which were eventually available separately br br br Hybrid racing wheels br The company is well known for its racing steering wheel controllers using hybrid gear and belt driven mechanics This type of controllers is a golden mean between the two competing technologies br saw the release of the T RS racing wheel with a degree angle of rotation and potentiometer sensors br saw the release of the T racing wheel with a degree angle of rotation and magnetic sensors a pedal T PM pedal unit was included with the T wheel kit The T PM unit features an adjustable brake pedal br saw the release of the T racing wheel with a degree angle of rotation and magnetic sensors an entry level pedal T PM pedal unit was included This was created as the budget version of the T racing wheel The T PM unit is not adjustable has a small size but it also has two holes for hex bolts making the mounting possible br saw the release of the T direct drive wheel base This is just the base with no pedals or wheel br br br Products br br br Flying br br br Driving br br br
