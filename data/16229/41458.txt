id: 41458
An optical disc is a flat usually disc shaped object that stores information in the form of physical variations on its surface that can be read with the aid of a beam of light Optical discs can be reflective where the light source and detector are on the same side of the disc or transmissive where light shines through the disc to be detected on the other side br Optical discs can store analog information e g Laserdisc digital information e g DVD or store both on the same disc e g CD Video br Their main uses are the distribution of media and data and long term archival br br br Design and technology br The encoding material sits atop a thicker substrate usually polycarbonate that makes up the bulk of the disc and forms a dust defocusing layer The encoding pattern follows a continuous spiral path covering the entire disc surface and extending from the innermost track to the outermost track br The data are stored on the disc with a laser or stamping machine and can be accessed when the data path is illuminated with a laser diode in an optical disc drive that spins the disc at speeds of about to RPM or more depending on the drive type disc format and the distance of the read head from the center of the disc outer tracks are read at a higher data speed due to higher linear velocities at the same angular velocities br Most optical discs exhibit a characteristic iridescence as a result of the diffraction grating formed by their grooves This side of the disc contains the actual data and is typically coated with a transparent material usually lacquer br The reverse side of an optical disc usually has a printed label sometimes made of paper but often printed or stamped onto the disc itself Unlike the inch floppy disk most optical discs do not have an integrated protective casing and are therefore susceptible to data transfer problems due to scratches fingerprints and other environmental problems Blu rays have a coating called durabis that mitigates these problems br Optical discs are usually between and cm and in in diameter with cm in being the most common size The so called program area that contains the data commonly starts millimetres away from the center point A typical disc is about mm in thick while the track pitch distance from the center of one track to the center of the next ranges from m for CDs to nm for Blu ray discs br br br Recording types br An optical disc is designed to support one of three recording types read only e g CD and CD ROM recordable write once e g CD R or re recordable rewritable e g CD RW Write once optical discs commonly have an organic dye may also be a Phthalocyanine Azo dye mainly used by Verbatim or an oxonol dye used by Fujifilm recording layer between the substrate and the reflective layer Rewritable discs typically contain an alloy recording layer composed of a phase change material most often AgInSbTe an alloy of silver indium antimony and tellurium Azo dyes were introduced in and phthalocyanine only began to see wide use in The type of dye and the material used on the reflective layer on an optical disc may be determined by shining a light through the disc as different dye and material combinations have different colors br Blu ray Disc recordable discs do not usually use an organic dye recording layer instead using an inorganic recording layer Those that do are known as low to high LTH discs and can be made in existing CD and DVD production lines but are of lower quality than traditional Blu ray recordable discs br br br Usage br Optical discs are often stored in special cases sometimes called jewel cases and are most commonly used for digital preservation storing music e g for use in a CD player video e g for use in a Blu ray player or data and programs for personal computers PC as well as offline hard copy data distribution due to lower per unit prices than other types of media The Optical Storage Technology Association OSTA promoted standardized optical storage formats br Libraries and archives enact optical media preservation procedures to ensure continued usability in the computer s optical disc drive or corresponding disc player br File operations of traditional mass storage devices such as flash drives memory cards and hard drives can be simulated using a UDF live file system br For computer data backup and physical data transfer optical discs such as CDs and DVDs are gradually being replaced with faster smaller solid state devices especially the USB flash drive This trend is expected to continue as USB flash drives continue to increase in capacity and drop in price br Additionally music movies games software and TV shows purchased shared or streamed over the Internet has significantly reduced the number of audio CDs video DVDs and Blu ray discs sold annually However audio CDs and Blu rays are still preferred and bought by some as a way of supporting their favorite works while getting something tangible in return and also since audio CDs alongside vinyl records and cassette tapes contain uncompressed audio without the artifacts introduced by lossy compression algorithms like MP and Blu rays offer better image and sound quality than streaming media without visible compression artifacts due to higher bitrates and more available storage space However Blu rays may sometimes be torrented over the internet but torrenting may not be an option for some due to restrictions put in place by ISPs on legal or copyright grounds low download speeds or not having enough available storage space since the content may weigh up to several dozen gigabytes Blu rays may be the only option for those looking to play large games without having to download them over an unreliable or slow internet connection which is the reason why they are still as of widely used by gaming consoles like the PlayStation and Xbox One X As of it is unusual for PC games to be available in a physical format like Blu ray br Discs should not have any stickers and should not be stored together with paper papers must be removed from the jewel case before storage Discs should be handled by the edges to prevent scratching with the thumb on the inner edge of the disc The ISO Standard is about best optical disc handling techniques Optical disc cleaning should never be done in a circular pattern to avoid concentric cirles from forming on the disc Improper cleaning can scratch the disc Recordable discs should not be exposed to light for extended periods of time Optical discs should be stored in dry and cool conditions to increase longevity with temperatures between and C never exceeding C and with humidity never falling below with recommended storage at to of humidity without fluctuations of more than br br br Durability br br Although optical discs are more durable than earlier audio visual and data storage formats they are susceptible to environmental and daily use damage if handled improperly br Optical discs are not prone to uncontrollable catastrophic failures such as head crashes power surges or exposure to water like hard disk drives and flash storage since optical drives storage controllers are not tied to optical discs themselves like with hard disk drives and flash memory controllers and a disc is usually recoverable from a defective optical drive by pushing an unsharp needle into the emergency ejection pinhole and has no point of immediate water ingress and no integrated circuitry br br br Safety br As the media itself only is accessed through a laser beam no internal control circuitry it can not contain malicious hardware such as so called rubber duckies or USB killers br Malware is unable to spread over factory pressed media finalized media or ROM read only memory drive types whose lasers lack the strength to write data Malware is conventionally programmed to detect and spread over traditional mass storage devices such as flash drives external solid state drives and hard disk drives br br br History br br br The first recorded historical use of an optical disc was in when Alexander Graham Bell Chichester Bell and Charles Sumner Tainter recorded sound on a glass disc using a beam of light br Optophonie is a very early example of a recording device using light for both recording and playing back sound signals on a transparent photograph br An early analogue optical disc system existed in used on Welte s Lichttonorgel sampling organ br An early analog optical disc used for video recording was invented by David Paul Gregg in and patented in the US in and This form of optical disc was a very early form of the DVD U S patent It is of special interest that U S patent filed issued generated royalty income for Pioneer Corporation s DVA until then encompassing the CD DVD and Blu ray systems In the early s the Music Corporation of America bought Gregg s patents and his company Gauss Electrophysics br American inventor James T Russell has been credited with inventing the first system to record a digital signal on an optical transparent foil that is lit from behind by a high power halogen lamp Russell s patent application was first filed in and he was granted a patent in Following litigation Sony and Philips licensed Russell s patents then held by a Canadian company Optical Recording Corp in the s br Both Gregg s and Russell s disc are floppy media read in transparent mode which imposes serious drawbacks In the Netherlands in Philips Research physicist Pieter Kramer invented an optical videodisc in reflective mode with a protective layer read by a focused laser beam U S patent filed issued Kramer s physical format is used in all optical discs In Philips and MCA began to work together and in commercially much too late they presented their long awaited Laserdisc in Atlanta MCA delivered the discs and Philips the players However the presentation was a commercial failure and the cooperation ended br In Japan and the U S Pioneer succeeded with the Laserdisc until the advent of the DVD In Philips and Sony in consortium successfully developed the audio compact disc br In Exxon STAR Systems in Pasadena CA built a computer controlled WORM drive that utilized thin film coatings of Tellurium and Selenium on a diameter glass disk The recording system utilized blue light at nm to record and red light at nm to read STAR Systems was bought by Storage Technology Corporation STC in and moved to Boulder CO Development of the WORM technology was continued using diameter aluminum substrates Beta testing of the disk drives originally labeled the Laser Storage Drive LSD was only moderately successful Many of the disks were shipped to RCA Laboratories now David Sarnoff Research Center to be used in the Library of Congress archiving efforts The STC disks utilized a sealed cartridge with an optical window for protection U S patent br The CD ROM format was developed by Sony and Philips introduced in as an extension of Compact Disc Digital Audio and adapted to hold any form of digital data The same year Sony demonstrated a LaserDisc data storage format with a larger data capacity of GB br In the late s and early s Optex Inc of Rockville MD built an erasable optical digital video disc system U S patent using Electron Trapping Optical Media ETOM U S patent Although this technology was written up in Video Pro Magazine s December issue promising the death of the tape it was never marketed br In the mid s a consortium of manufacturers Sony Philips Toshiba Panasonic developed the second generation of the optical disc the DVD br Magnetic disks found limited applications in storing the data in large amount So there was the need of finding some more data storing techniques As a result it was found that by using optical means large data storing devices can be made that in turn gave rise to the optical discs The very first application of this kind was the compact disc CD which was used in audio systems br Sony and Philips developed the first generation of the CDs in the mid s with the complete specifications for these devices With the help of this kind of technology the possibility of representing the analog signal into digital signal was exploited to a great level For this purpose the bit samples of the analog signal were taken at the rate of samples per second This sample rate was based on the Nyquist rate of samples per second required to capture the audible frequency range to kHz without aliasing with an additional tolerance to allow the use of less than perfect analog audio pre filters to remove any higher frequencies The first version of the standard allowed up to minutes of music which required MB of storage br The DVD disc appeared after the CD ROM had become widespread in society br The third generation optical disc was developed in and was introduced as Blu ray Disc First movies on Blu ray Discs were released in June Blu ray eventually prevailed in a high definition optical disc format war over a competing format the HD DVD A standard Blu ray disc can hold about GB of data a DVD about GB and a CD about MB br br br First generation br From the start optical discs were used to store broadcast quality analog video and later digital media such as music or computer software The LaserDisc format stored analog video signals for the distribution of home video but commercially lost to the VHS videocassette format due mainly to its high cost and non re recordability other first generation disc formats were designed only to store digital data and were not initially capable of use as a digital video medium br Most first generation disc devices had an infrared laser reading head The minimum size of the laser spot is proportional to the wavelength of the laser so wavelength is a limiting factor upon the amount of information that can be stored in a given physical area on the disc The infrared range is beyond the long wavelength end of the visible light spectrum so it supports less density than shorter wavelength visible light One example of high density data storage capacity achieved with an infrared laser is MB of net user data for a cm compact disc br Other factors that affect data storage density include the existence of multiple layers of data on the disc the method of rotation Constant linear velocity CLV Constant angular velocity CAV or zoned CAV the composition of lands and pits and how much margin is unused is at the center and the edge of the disc br Types of Optical Discs br br Compact disc CD and derivatives br Audio CD br Video CD VCD br Super Video CD

Second generation br Second generation optical discs were for storing great amounts of data including broadcast quality digital video Such discs usually are read with a visible light laser usually red the shorter wavelength and greater numerical aperture allow a narrower light beam permitting smaller pits and lands in the disc In the DVD format this allows GB storage on a standard cm single sided single layer disc alternatively smaller media such as the DataPlay format can have capacity comparable to that of the larger standard compact cm disc br br DVD and derivatives br DVD Audio br DualDisc

greater data storage capacities accomplished with short wavelength visible light lasers and greater numerical apertures Blu ray Disc and HD DVD uses blue violet lasers and focusing optics of greater aperture for use with discs with smaller pits and lands thereby greater data storage capacity per layer br In practice the effective multimedia presentation capacity is improved with enhanced video

development of the Holographic Versatile Disc HVD commenced which promised the storage of several terabytes of data per disc However development stagnated towards the late s due to lack of funding br In it was reported that Japanese researchers developed ultraviolet ray lasers with a wavelength of nanometers which would enable a higher bit density than Blu ray discs As of no updates on that project have been reported br Folio Photonics is planning to release high capacity discs in with the cost of per TB with a roadmap to per TB using less power than HDD br br br Overview of optical types br br Notes br br br Recordable and writable optical discs br br There are numerous formats of optical direct to disk recording devices on the market all of which are based on using a laser to change the reflectivity of the digital recording medium in order to duplicate the effects of the pits and lands created when a commercial optical disc is pressed Formats such as CD R and DVD R are Write once read many or write once while CD RW and DVD RW are rewritable more like a magnetic recording hard disk drive HDD br Media technologies vary for example M DISC media uses a rock like layer to retain data for longer than conventional recordable media While being read only compatible with existing DVD and Blu ray drives M DISC media can only be written to using a stronger laser specifically made for this purpose which is built into fewer optical drive models br br br Surface error scanning br br Optical media can predictively be scanned for errors and media deterioration well before any data becomes unreadable Optical formats include some redundancy for error correction which works until the amount of error exceeds a threshold A higher rate of errors may indicate deteriorating and or low quality media physical damage an unclean surface and or media written using a defective optical drive br Precise error scanning requires access to the raw uncorrected readout of a disc which is not always provided by a drive As a result support of this functionality varies per optical drive manufacturer and model On ordinary drives without this functionality it is possible to still look for unexpected reduction in read speed as an indirect much less reliable measure br Error scanning software includes Nero DiscSpeed k probe Opti Drive Control formerly CD speed and DVD info Pro for Windows and QPxTool for cross platform br br br Error types br There are different types of error measurements including so called C C and CU errors on CDs and PI PO parity inner outer errors and the more critical PI PO failures on DVDs Finer grain error measurements on CDs supported by very few optical drives are called E E E E E E br CU and POF represent uncorrectable errors on data CDs and DVDs respectively thus data loss and can be a result of too many consecutive smaller errors br Due to the weaker error correction used on Audio CDs Red Book standard and Video CDs White Book standard C errors already lead to data loss However even with C errors the damage is inaudible to some extent br Blu ray discs use so called LDC Long Distance Codes and BIS Burst Indication Subcodes error parameters According to the developer of the Opti Drive Control software a disc can be considered healthy at an LDC error rate below and BIS error rate below br br br Optical disc manufacturing br br Optical discs are made using replication This process can be used with all disc types Recordable discs have pre recorded vital information like manufacturer disc type maximum read and write speeds etc In replication a cleanroom with yellow light is necessary to protect the light sensitive photoresist and to prevent dust from corrupting the data on the disc br A glass master is used in replication The master is placed in a machine that cleans it as much as possible using a rotating brush and deionized water preparing it for the next step In the next step a surface analyzer inspects the cleanliness of the master before photoresist is applied on the master br The photoresist is then baked in an oven to solidify it Then in the exposure process the master is placed in a turntable where a laser selectively exposes the resist to light At the same time a developer and deionized water are applied to the disc to remove the exposed resist This process forms the pits and lands that represent the data on the disc br A thin coating of metal is then applied to the master making a negative of the master with the pits and lands in it The negative is then peeled off the master and coated in a thin layer of plastic The plastic protects the coating while a punching press punches a hole into the center of the disc and punches excess material br The negative is now a stamper a part of the mold that will be used for replication It is placed on one side of the mold with the data side containing the pits and lands facing out This is done inside an injection molding machine The machine then closes the mold and injects polycarbonate in the cavity formed by the walls of the mold which forms or molds the disc with the data on it br The molten polycarbonate fills the pits or spaces between the lands on the negative acquiring their shape when it solidifies This step is somewhat similar to record pressing br The polycarbonate disc cools quickly and is promptly removed from the machine before forming another disc The disc is then metallized covered with a thin reflective layer of aluminum The aluminum fills the space once occupied by the negative br A layer of varnish is then applied to protect the aluminum coating and provide a surface suitable for printing The varnish is applied near the center of the disc and the disc is spun evenly distributing the varnish on the surface of the disc The varnish is hardened using UV light The discs are then silkscreened or a label is otherwise applied br Recordable discs add a dye layer and rewritable discs add a phase change alloy layer instead which is protected by upper and lower dielectric electrically insulating layers The layers may be sputtered The additional layer is between the grooves and the reflective layer of the disc Grooves are made in recordable discs in place of the traditional pits and lands found in replicated discs and the two can be made in the same exposure process In DVDs the same processes as in CDs are carried out but in a thinner disc The thinner disc is then bonded to a second equally thin but blank disc using UV curable Liquid optically clear adhesive forming a DVD disc This leaves the data in the middle of the disc which is necessary for DVDs to achieve their storage capacity In multi layer discs semi reflective instead of reflective coatings are used for all layers except the last layer which is the deepest one and uses a traditional reflective coating br Dual layer DVDs are made slightly differently After metallization with a thinner metal layer to allow some light to pass through base and pit transfer resins are applied and pre cured in the center of the disc Then the disc is pressed again using a different stamper and the resins are completely cured using UV light before being separated from the stamper Then the disc receives another thicker metallization layer and is then bonded to the blank disc using LOCA glue DVD R DL and DVD R DL discs receive a dye layer after curing but before metallization CD R DVD R and DVD R discs receive the dye layer after pressing but before metallization CD RW DVD RW and DVD RW receive a metal alloy layer sandwiched between dielectric layers HD DVD is made in the same way as DVD In recordable and rewritable media most of the stamper is composed of grooves not pits and lands The grooves contain a wobble frequency that is used to locate the position of the reading or writing laser on the disc DVDs use pre pits instead with a constant frequency wobble br br br Blu ray br HTL high to low type Blu ray discs are made differently First a silicon wafer is used instead of a glass master The wafer is processed in the same way a glass master would br The wafer is then electroplated to form a micron thick nickel stamper which is peeled off from the wafer The stamper is mounted onto a mold inside a press or embosser br The polycarbonate discs are molded in a similar fashion to DVD and CD discs If the discs being produced are BD Rs or BD REs the mold is fitted with a stamper that stamps a groove pattern onto the discs in lieu of the pits and lands found on BD ROM discs br After cooling a nanometre thick layer of silver alloy is applied to the disc using sputtering Then the second layer is made by applying base and pit transfer resins to the disc and are pre cured in its center br After application and pre curing the disc is pressed or embossed using a stamper and the resins are immediately cured using intense UV light before the disc is separated from the stamper The stamper contains the data that will be transferred to the disc This process is known as embossing and is the step that engraves the data onto the disc replacing the pressing process used in the first layer and it is also used for multi layer DVD discs br Then a nanometre thick layer of silver alloy is then sputtered onto the disc and the process is repeated as many times as required Each repetition creates a new data layer The resins are applied again pre cured stamped with data or grooves and cured silver alloy is sputtered and so on br BD R and BD RE discs receive through sputtering a metal recording layer alloy that is sandwiched between two dielectric layers also sputtered in BD RE before receiving the nanometre metallization silver alloy aluminum or gold layer which is sputtered Alternatively the silver alloy may be applied before the recording layer is applied Silver alloys are usually used in Blu rays and aluminum is usually used on CDs and DVDs Gold is used in some Archival CDs and DVDs since it is more chemically inert and resistant to corrosion than aluminum which corrodes into aluminum oxide which can be seen in disc rot as transparent patches or dots in the disc that prevent the disc from being read since the laser light passes through the disc instead of being reflected back into the laser pickup assembly to be read Normally aluminum does not corrode since it has a thin oxide layer that forms on contact with oxygen In this case it can corrode due to its thinness br Then the micron thick cover layer is applied using UV curable liquid optically clear adhesive and a micron thick hard coat such as Durabis is also applied and cured using UV light In the last step a nanometre thick silicon nitride barrier layer is applied to the label side of the disc to protect against humidity Blu rays have their data very close to the read surface of the disc which is necessary for Blu rays to achieve their capacity br Discs in large quantities can either be replicated or duplicated In replication the process explained above is used to make the discs while in duplication CD R DVD R or BD R discs are recorded and finalized to prevent further recording and allow for wider compatibility See Optical disc authoring The equipment is also different replication is carried out by fully automated purpose built machinery whose cost is in the hundreds of thousands of US dollars in the used market while duplication can be automated using what s known as an autoloader or be done by hand and only requires a small tabletop duplicator br br br
