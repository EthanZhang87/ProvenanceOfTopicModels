title: Telephone keypad
id: 275222
A telephone keypad is a keypad installed on a push button telephone or similar telecommunication device for dialing a telephone number It was standardized when the dual tone multi frequency signaling DTMF system was developed in the Bell System in the United States in the s that replaced rotary dialing originally developed in electromechanical switching systems Because of the installed abundance of rotary dial equipment well into the s many telephone keypads were also designed to produce loop disconnect pulses electronically and some could be optionally switched to produce either DTMF or pulses br The development of the modern telephone keypad is attributed to research in the s by Richard Deininger under the directorship of John Karlin at the Human Factors Engineering Department of Bell Labs The modern keypad is laid out in a rectangular array of twelve push buttons arranged as four rows and three columns of keys For military applications a fourth right most column of keys was added for priority signaling in the Autovon system in the s Initially between and the keypads for civilian subscriber service omitting the lower left and lower right keys that commonly are assigned to the star and number sign signals respectively These keys were added to provide signals for anticipated data entry purposes in business applications but found use in Custom Calling Services CLASS features installed in electronic switching systems br br br Layout br br The layout of the digit keys is different from that commonly appearing on calculators and numeric keypads This layout was chosen after extensive human factors testing at Bell Labs At the time late s mechanical calculators were not widespread and few people had experience with them Indeed calculators were only just starting to settle on a common layout a paper states Of the several calculating devices we have been able to look at Two other calculators have keysets resembling the layout that would become the most common layout Most other calculators have their keys reading upward in vertical rows of ten while a paper just five years later refers to today s common calculator layout as the arrangement frequently found in ten key adding machines In any case Bell Labs testing found that the telephone layout with and in the top row was slightly faster than the calculator layout with them in the bottom row br br The key labeled was officially named the star key The key labeled is officially called the number sign key but other names such as pound hash hex octothorpe gate lattice and square are common depending on national or personal preference The Greek symbols alpha and omega had been planned originally br These can be used for special functions For example in the UK users can order a am alarm call from a BT telephone exchange by dialing br Most of the keys also bear letters according to the following system br br These letters have been used for multiple purposes Originally they referred to the leading letters of telephone exchange names In the mid th century United States before the switch to All Number Calling telephone numbers had seven digits including a two digit prefix which was expressed in letters rather than digits e g KL The UK telephone numbering system used a similar two letter code after the initial zero to form the first part of the subscriber trunk dialling code for a region For example Aylesbury was assigned AY which translated into br br The letters have also been used mainly in the United States as a technique for remembering telephone numbers easily For example an interior decorator might license the telephone number but advertise it as the more memorable phoneword PAINTER Sometimes businesses advertise a number with a mnemonic word having more letters than there are digits in the phone number Usually this means that the caller just stops dialing at seven digits after the area code or that the extra digits are ignored by the central office br In feature phones the letters on the keys are used for text entry tasks such as text messaging entering names in the phone book and browsing the web To compensate for the smaller number of keys phones used multi tap and later predictive text processing to speed up the process Touchscreen phones have made these input methods obsolete as screens are typically large enough to show as many virtual buttons as necessary for full text entry br br br Key tones br Pressing a single key of a traditional analog telephone keypad produces a telephony signaling event to the remote switching system For touchtone service the signal is a dual tone multi frequency signaling tone consisting of two simultaneous pure tone sinusoidal frequencies The row in which the key appears determines the low frequency component and the column determines the high frequency component For example pressing key results in a signal composed of tones with frequencies hertz Hz and Hz br br br Letter mapping br br In the course of telephone history the positions of telephone dials as well as keypads have been associated with various patterns of mapping letters and characters to numbers keyboard layout br The system used in Denmark was different from that used in the U K which was different from the U S and Australia The use of alphanumeric codes for exchanges was abandoned in Europe when international direct dialing was introduced in the s because for example dialing VIC on a Danish telephone would result in a different number to dialling it on a British telephone At the same time letters were no longer placed on the dials of new telephones br Letters did not re appear on phones in Europe until the introduction of mobile phones and the layout followed the new international standard ITU E ISO The ITU established an international standard ITU E in the mid s and that should be the layout used for any new devices There is a standard ETSI ES that covers European languages and other languages used in Europe published by the independent ETSI organisation in and updated in Work describing some principles of the standard is available br Since many newer smartphones such as the Palm Treo and BlackBerry have full alphanumeric keyboards instead of the traditional telephone keypads the user must execute additional steps to dial a number containing convenience letters On certain BlackBerry devices a user can press the Alt key followed by the desired letter and the device will generate the appropriate DTMF tone br br br See also br br E br Rotary dial br T br br br
