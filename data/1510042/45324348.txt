A Force is a comic book series published by Marvel Comics that debuted in May as a part of Marvel s Secret Wars crossover storyline It was created by writers G Willow Wilson Marguerite Bennett and artist Jorge Molina It features Marvel s first all female Avengers team called the A Force The team first appeared as part of an alternate universe during Secret Wars but later reemerged in Marvel s primary continuity br The comic book series generally received positive reviews from critics It has been described as decidedly feminist br br In February Marvel Comics announced that they would launch A Force in May The series written by G Willow Wilson Ms Marvel and Marguerite Bennett Angela Asgard s Assassin and drawn by Jorge Molina X Men features Marvel s first all female team of Avengers The team led by She Hulk initially consists of Dazzler Medusa Nico Minoru and Singularity a new cosmic powered hero but features many more characters Wilson stated that Marvel editor Daniel Ketchum mandated that the team be composed entirely of female characters but gave the writers total discretion when it came to which women to choose Ketchum also brought in Bennett whom he worked with on Nightcrawler to co write the series with Wilson The series takes place within Marvel s Secret Wars crossover storyline which finds the entire Marvel Universe including the Avengers disbanded What is left is a patchwork of different environments and on one such environment called Arcadia which Wilson describes as a feminist paradise a familiar threat arises that forces A Force to come together Bennett elaborated br br It s this world where the Marvel heroines are leaders in their own civilization I really didn t want to have some kind of validating reason So I didn t want to do anything like all the men disappeared years ago or ever since all the menfolk were killed in that war or something like that There are men there are heroes there You ll see familiar faces and favorites but the heroines are in charge by majority It s just this is how their world evolved They were competent They were clever and they were the ones in charge because of their skills and they were the best fit for these roles and demands of their world br About the roster Wilson said We ve purposefully assembled a team composed of very different characters from disparate parts of the Marvel U with very different power sets identities and ideologies They ll all have to come together to answer some big questions What would you sacrifice to succeed What is being a hero worth Wilson elaborated br br This an opportunity to put people who would normally have no reason to interact with each other on one team I want people whose power sets really build on each other so that there are specific limitations that can only become overcome by working together Nobody s so overpowered that it gets boring and nobody s so underpowered that they have to be saved all the time I wanted a balance visually and practically What s also going to be interesting is working out the power structure of the group You have several people on it who are used to being either their own bosses or in a leadership position and all of a sudden they re together br Bennett explained that although the team features a broader roster Dazzler Medusa She Hulk Singularity and Nico Minoru make up the core members Bennett stated that she found Dazzler s optimism to be the most interesting explaining It s really hard to write a dark and dire book if you ve got Dazzler there beside you Regarding the dynamic between Medusa and She Hulk Bennett said br br They re both leaders and there s a lot of conflict between them They are very supportive of one another when operating against a third party but they also disagree with how things should be handled when it comes to crises Medusa is monarchy She Hulk is democracy Medusa is the right of queens and She Hulk is the rule of law She Hulk is much more balanced than Medusa It s the two of them playing off of their strengths and sometime playing off of each other for both necessary good and necessary evil br The series also introduces a new character named Singularity a pocket universe that gains self consciousness during Secret Wars Wilson likened Singularity to Q from Star Trek The Next Generation and said Her entire existence is so unlike that of ours that she really has to learn about what we think of as being an individual and having an identity from the ground up with no point of access except those she meets Wilson also stated that Singularity can act as a whole world within herself and she can also move between different worlds and dimensions like taking a walk so she has access to all corners of the Marvel U in a way that other characters do not Nico Minoru is one of the first people we have encounter Singularity Bennett revealed So Nico is put in charge of acclimating this character and showing her their civilization and world while trying to save it Nico is sort of like the grounding human force and the anchor that begins to show Singularity the capacity of human beings both for good and for evil so Nico becomes even more invested when she starts to see her homeland through the eyes of this stranger br At the Chicago Comic Entertainment Expo Marvel announced that A Force would continue into All New All Different Marvel the next phase of Marvel Universe after the end of Secret Wars with a second volume Wilson said After Secret Wars things don t go back to status quo There are long term repercussions for what has happened in Battleworld What the aftermath of Secret Wars is for all of those characters who were together in Arcadia who are now waking up in the Marvel Universe I m not going to say But they re going to have to deal probably more directly with those repercussions than any of the other teams in the aftermath of Secret Wars br In January Marvel announced that writer Kelly Thompson who co wrote A Force vol will take over the series with artist Ben Caldwell starting with issue Thompson stated that while she respects the way Wilson built the team in a world where women are the primary heroes she does not intend on making stories that are unique to women Thompson explained It s a comic about super heroes saving the day plain and simple and I approach writing them like I would writing anyone These ladies are heroes just like any of their male colleagues br In August A Force tied into the Civil War II storyline beginning with issue About the crossover Thompson said There s no way with our cast that we weren t going to get drawn into it Carol is obviously the big co star of Civil War II and both Medusa and She Hulk are poised to play big roles too But I think we ve got a really great A Force story that ties directly to the event but will also stand on its own nicely Because of the intricacies of Civil War II the ideas behind the event really pull our team apart so what we re doing is a very personal and emotional gut punch of a story for these ladies who were sort of just getting started as friends and as a team br In October a day before the release of issue it was reported that A Force was effectively cancelled after no new issues were listed among Marvel s November December or January solicitations The report came despite Thompson s intentions to continue the series after Civil War II with a storyline that involved an unspecified A lister Sales of A Force had fallen by since its debut with issue selling copies and issue selling copies However in a letter written to the fans in the back pages of A Force Thompson described it as short hiatus followed by an editorial note claiming that A Force would be back and that fans could speed up its return by emailing Marvel br The series was cancelled in October due to the sales of A Force Vol declining br br A Force the defenders of the matriarchal Battleworld nation of Arcadia responds to a megalodon attack while on routine patrol During the attack America Chavez throws the shark across the Shield the wall that separates their borders thus breaking the laws of God Emperor Doom and is subsequently arrested by Doom s enforcers the Thor Corps Despite appeals from Arcadia s baroness She Hulk Chavez is sentenced to spend the rest of her life on the wall In response She Hulk tasks the Sub Mariners Namor Namorita and Namora to find the source of the megalodon attack Meanwhile Nico Minoru lamenting the loss of Chavez comes across a mysterious figure that fell out of the sky br The Sub Mariners discover a strange portal in the ocean s depths but it implodes as they draw near Later at the behest of female Loki Minoru introduces her new friend to She Hulk When Medusa accuses the stranger a sentient pocket universe of creating the portal a Sentinel falls from another portal and attacks the team During the fight the newcomer saves Dazzler and convinces She Hulk that she is not the cause After destroying the Sentinel She Hulk decides to travel through the still open portal and investigate the source herself br She Hulk arrives in the Sentinel Territories and after a brief encounter with more Sentinels she is chased back to Arcadia by the Thor Corps The Thor Corps follow in pursuit but Medusa manages to repel them back into the portal and is killed in the process When the Thor Corps return She Hulk alerts the citizens of Arcadia that there is a traitor in their midst that is spreading discontent and vows to bring them to justice as she and other A Forcers go into hiding inside the newcomer br The newcomer smuggles A Force outside the city There She Hulk realizes that the portals energy is of Asgardian origin and they deduce that the traitor is Loki With A Force outlawed Loki is set to be crowned the new baroness of Arcadia but is preemptively attacked by A Force After Loki is defeated she releases a final blast of energy that breaches the Shield thus allowing the zombie horde on the other side to enter br As the horde approaches She Hulk rallies A Force the Thor Corps and other heroes of Arcadia in defense of Arcadia During the fight the zombies begin to overwhelm the city but the newcomer now named Singularity absorbs the entire horde sacrificing herself in the process In the aftermath of the battle the Thor Corps arrests Loki as A Force begins reconstruction of Arcadia Meanwhile She Hulk comforts Minoru who is still mourning the loss of her friends telling her that she believes Singularity lives on br br Following the conclusion of Secret Wars Singularity awakes in the primary Earth universe and quickly spots Carol Danvers but Danvers does not recognize her Unbeknownst to Singularity she is being pursued by a similar being named Antimatter While Danvers confronts Antimatter Singularity flees to New York City With Antimatter still in pursuit Singularity locates She Hulk who does not remember her either and asks for help As the pair fight Antimatter Medusa arrives with reinforcements and takes Singularity into custody br After Antimatter kills one of Medusa s soldiers she releases Singularity and teleports Antimatter to the moon Realizing that physical attacks are having little effect on Antimatter Singularity transports She Hulk Medusa and herself to Japan to seek the help of Minoru When Antimatter returns Minoru casts a spell that causes him to be temporarily unmade The spell buys the women some time during which Danvers suggests that Antimatter maybe susceptible to intense levels of light particles They then travel to Miami to recruit Dazzler just as Antimatter remerges br Dazzler hits Antimatter with everything she has to no avail but it gives Danvers time to activate a containment device that she designed When Antimatter overloads the device Singularity has Minoru remove Antimatter s tracking ability and transports the team to The Peak As Antimatter eventually reaches The Peak She Hulk orders Singularity to stay behind while the rest of the team leaves to parley with Antimatter After talks fail Antimatter fatally wounds Dazzler and in turn She Hulk decapitates Antimatter Angered by Dazzler s death Singularity leaves to confront a recovered Antimatter one on one br As Singularity fights Antimatter Dr Tempest Bell The Peak s lead scientist

Force was the th best selling comic book in May br br Greg McElhatton of Comic Book Resources gave A Force a grade of out of stars writing A Force is a triumph taking a concept that could have simply been dashed off and then ignored and turning it into a book that I d cheerfully read every month Even if Secret Wars itself is unappealing this book muscles its way into your heart through sheer quality If there are any books that somehow survive the end of Secret Wars I d love for this to be one A Force is an A Plus Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave A Force a grade of out of saying While certain details regarding the nature of this team and their connection to the old marvel Universe remain unclear A Force marks a worthy debut for Marvel s newest team book It s fun and fast paced but also features great characterization and clear ties to the larger framework of Secret Wars Marvel picked a solid creative team for this series and it s already paying off Lan Pitts of Newsarama gave A Force a grade of out of praising the artwork of Jorge Molina Laura Martin and Matt Milla Tony Guerrero of Comic Vine gave A Force a grade of out of stars stating This book was pretty much exactly what I wanted and hoped for Too many times the female heroes in the Marvel Universe get overlooked Marguerite Bennett and G Willow Wilson have created a natural feeling world It s easy to cry out that having just female heroes is a gimmick but it all simply works here And it works in a great way You ll find yourself wanting to know more of the region and the relationship and connections each character has with one another There s just a wonderful vibe going on Jorge Molina s art and Laura Martin and Matt Milla s colors add to that With actual ties to the main SECRET WARS book this doesn t feel like an isolated story done just for the heck of it You get a sense that it is part of the bigger story This is our chance to explore the specific region closely and you ll be glad you got the chance I m so ready for the next issue now Eric Diaz of The Nerdist gave A Force a grade of out of asserting Overall the issue was fine and I m curious to see where it all goes but I m far more eager to see what can be done with this grouping of awesome female heroes once the wacky conceit of Secret Wars is over and they return to the Marvel Universe proper Diaz also noted that Marvel is making a decidedly feminist statement by taking nearly all of their major female heroes and putting them together in their own Avengers title called A Force br br According to Diamond Comic Distributors A Force was the th best selling comic book in July br Doug Zawisza of Comic Book Resources gave A Force a grade of out of stars asserting A Force appears to be a straightforward superheroine adventure on the surface but as the pages turn Bennett Wilson Molina Yeung Wong Martin and Petit make it quite clear this isn t a straightforward anything The mystery of the new arrival and whether or not the portals are hers would be enough but embedded in the policies of Battleworld and the surrounding bureaucracy of it all this story gets more personal Easily dismissed as a gimmick A Force is anything but packing in strong characters smart characterization and wonderful artwork Jeff Lake of IGN gave A Force a grade of out of saying The first issue of A Force provided a fine mix of boisterous action and engaging character work all of which effectively tied into the larger Battleworld picture Issue offers much of the same C Willow Wilson and Marguerite Bennett both focusing the direction of the main narrative as they expand their characters place within it The writers toss in magic portals and robot showdowns aplenty but the real fun comes with their introduction of a mysterious new character This unnamed entrant is interesting enough on her own but becomes more so as we see how each A Force member reacts around her This new layer adds a welcome intrigue to Battleworld as a whole as the team sets to unravel a mystery outside of their normal universe Jorge Molina has a great time with the aforementioned newbie his take silent but mischievous His gift for nuanced expression again carries the book through its more emotional confrontations not to mention he draws a pretty sweet battle sequence Jeff Richard Gray of Newsarama gave A Force a grade of out of writing With the introduction of a new heroine and a new threat the issue skillfully plays to the strengths of the ensemble from She Hulk s natural leadership Medusa s ruthless decision making and former Runaway Nico Minoru s compassion br br According to Diamond Comic Distributors A Force was the th best selling comic book in August br C K Stewart of Newsarama gave A Force a grade of out of saying A Force gets stronger with each passing issue and the dramatic turns at the end of A Force make it the best issue yet Jeff Lake of IGN gave A Force a grade of saying A Force finds itself in an interesting predicament here in issue The inclusion of a mysterious traitor lends a needed sense of conflict to the book s events but the lack of substantive development leaves that same reveal feeling slightly underserved Perhaps it s partly because of the book s Secret Wars restraints but as of yet the book s level of investment and development doesn t quite match its escalation Thankfully this is one example where the book s art is able to mask any narrative quibbles Jorge Molina turns in another dynamite installment his clean lines and powerful poses giving added life to C Willow Wilson and Marguerite Bennett s script The issue contains a number of standout moments from dynamic splash pages to more contained emotional beats and it s through Molina s whimsical impish quality that the team s still unnamed friend remains so intriguing There s still a lot of potential here we just need a bit more event book freedom to see it realized Marykate Jasper of Comic Book Resources gave A Force a grade of out of stars asserting Altogether A Force still has a lot going for it but the pacing is compounding the problems of its large cast Luckily issue takes many of the necessary steps for ramping the pace back up and I m optimistic for issue br br According to Diamond Comic Distributors A Force was the th best selling comic book in September br David Pepose of Newsarama gave A Force a grade of out of saying It s a good thing this book looks so good because the plot definitely feels flat with the reveal of A Force s traitor and her endgame after being easily overcome feels particularly undercooked Levi Hunt of IGN gave A Force a out of asserting Jorge Molina s art is once again the best thing about A Force as the series hits its least narratively satisfying issue The underserved nature of the book s development has led to a conflict that has few real emotional stakes Greg McElhatton of Comic Book Resources gave A Force a grade of out of stars stating While A Force is not a bad comic Marguerite Bennett G Willow Wilson Jorge Molina Craig Yeung and Walden Wong s latest installment clearly tries to get a lot of the exposition onto the table as the plot gears up for next month s conclusion and that original sense of wonder and newness is greatly diminished as a result br br According to Diamond Comic Distributors A Force was the th best selling comic book in January br br David Pepose of Newsarama gave A Force a grade of out of stating While this book starts off with a shaky foundation namely that you have to have read a Secret Wars tie in to understand where Singularity came from Wilson does a great job at firming things up with her new heroine proving to be a fun addition to the Marvel Universe Greg McElhatton of Comic Book Resources gave A Force a grade of out of stars writing Ultimately I wish the narration from Singularity had been dropped entirely from A Force You can still understand what s going on without it and the disparate clash of her thoughts and dialogue would have never happened Hopefully they will get smoothed out a bit in future issues but for now this issue is only alright Jeff Lake of IGN gave A Force a grade of out of asserting Overall A Force is a solid if unspectacular debut It s great to see this cast together again especially in the hands of Wilson Molina and Martin but as of now this new direction feels hamstrung by its need to square peg its way into a round hole br br According to Diamond Comic Distributors A Force was the th best selling comic book in February br Justin Partridge of Newsarama gave A Force a grade of out of saying A Force reads like a Sleater Kinney song sounds all confident bravado and a relentless pace While the original series was inescapably tied to a company wide Kelly Thompson G Willow Wilson Jorge Molina and Laura Martin quickly cast off those ropes of continuity to let these ladies stand on their own and get down to the important work of punching weird stuff and giving each other sass Jeff Lake of IGN gave A Force a grade of out of writing That s more like it Following a passable but limited debut A Force takes a welcome leap courtesy of Kelly Thompson G Willow Wilson and Jorge Molina At its core the issue is little more than an extension of the book s initial premise with the universe addled Singularity continuing to search for her long lost friends The difference here is that with the cast growing in size Singularity is able to simply join the story without needing to drive it This results in come excellent character play as writers Thompson and Wilson jet set their heroines around from misadventure to misadventure There s such a great mix of personality here from Medusa s regal above it all air to Nico s rebellious indignation and artist Molina captures each individual voice wonderfully His physicality and expression is excellently nuanced ensuring that no character looks or feels the same When combined with another round of action packed visuals and pitch perfect humor you get an issue much closer to the original series spirit br br According to Diamond Comic Distributors A Force was the rd best selling comic book in March br Justin Partridge of Newsarama gave A Force a grade of out of asserting Writers Kelly Thompson and G Willow Wilson continue the dazzling chemistry and tension between the team while at the same time keeping each woman s voice on point and selling Antimatter as a real threat to the team Jeff Lake of IGN gave A Force a grade of out of saying Bucking the usual slow roll out most super team books enjoy A Force s latest is again a high energy affair Where last issue saw Kelly Thompson and G Willow Wilson provide a welcome jump in character development and explored relationship dynamics issue offers a more action oriented focus Greg McElhatton of Comic Book Resources gave A Force a grade of out of stars stating A Force feels like a turning point for this ongoing series With the team fully solidified Kelly Thompson G Willow Wilson and Jorge Molina begin to show readers just how these established characters will work together even as the relatively new Singularity continues to establish herself Bit by bit that early potential we saw in the Secret Wars tie in starts to bear fruit in A Force br br According to Diamond Comic Distributors A Force was the th best selling comic book in April br Marykate Jasper of Comic Book Resources gave A Force a grade of out of stars saying A Force gives readers the camaraderie compassion and quips that they ve come to love and expect from this series Jeff Lake of IGN gave A Force a grade of out of stating In just four short issues Kelly Thompson and G Willow Wilson have crafted a team rife with unique personalities in turn creating an undeniable chemistry between them that makes their unfolding adventures ones worth investing in Issue only solidifies that fact the conclusion to the Antimatter arc resulting in plenty of great moments both joint and character specific br br According to Diamond Comic Distributors A Force was the th best selling comic book in May br Greg McElhattan gave of Comic Book Resources gave A Force a

plot hooks to keep readers coming back for more br br According to Diamond Comic Distributors A Force was the th best selling comic book in June br Jeff Lake of IGN gave A Force a grade of out of saying When it comes to A Force the team s chemistry goes hand in hand with its success Case in point issue is a solid if unspectacular affair with a familiar villain and a by the numbers plot What makes the issue click is its fantastic characterization writer Kelly Thompson continuing to build off of the great chemistry generated in the book s first arc br br According to Diamond Comic Distributors A Force was the th best selling comic book in July br Matthew Aguilar of ComicBook com gave A Force a grade of out of stars asserting A Force continues to be a joy amongst my pull list every month and I can t recommend it highly enough It has hard hitting fights snappy dialogue and above all substantial character development for the entire cast Sure it has some cheesy sentimentality every now and then but it never feels dated or ham fisted and the book always seems to be in on the joke You can t really do a team book any better br br According to Diamond Comic Distributors A Force was the st best selling comic book in August br br Jeff Lake of IGN gave A Force a grade of out of writing With a team consisting of Captain Marvel and Medusa it was only a matter of time before the events of Civil War II made its way into A Force The ensuing tie in has its share of hits and misses Kelly Thompson s strong characterization remains intact the rift of Civil War having its own unique effects on A Force s tight knit members Thompson mines some great stuff from her cast as they argue their positions with Dazzler really er dazzling as an opponent to Carol and Medusa s unwavering conviction Unfortunately the same quite can t be said of Nico who gets the bulk of the issue s focus While she does get some strong moments her warm conversation with Misty Knight is an issue highlight the way in which her story deviates feels entirely too manufactured with an end that doesn t take a pre cog to guess Paulo Siqueira makes his mark as the new series artist but
