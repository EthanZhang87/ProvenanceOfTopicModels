Street Five Points When asked in about the future of the little village Stephen Harriman Long the railroad s chief engineer said the place would be good for one tavern a blacksmith shop a grocery

public schools by nearly years after the US Supreme Court ruled that segregated public schools were unconstitutional br In Whites comprised of the city s population During the s s suburbanization and White flight from urban areas led to a significant demographic shift By African Americans were the majority of the city s population and exercised their recently enforced voting rights and political influence by electing Atlanta s first Black mayor Maynard Jackson in Under Mayor Jackson s tenure Atlanta s airport was modernized strengthening the city s role as a transportation center The opening

Lewis Glover the Atlanta Housing Authority demolished nearly all of its public housing a total of units and about of all housing units in the city After reserving units mostly for elderly the AHA allowed redevelopment of the sites for mixed use and mixed income higher density developments with of the units to be reserved for affordable housing Two fifths of previous public housing residents attained new housing in such units the remainder received vouchers to be used at other units including in suburbs At the same time in an effort to change the culture of those receiving subsidized housing the AHA imposed a requirement for such residents to work or be enrolled in a genuine limited time training program It is virtually the only housing authority to have created this requirement To prevent problems the AHA also gave authority to management of the mixed income or voucher units to evict tenants who did not comply with the work requirement or who caused behavior problems br In the city approved the billion BeltLine project It was intended to convert a disused mile freight railroad loop that surrounds the central city into an art filled multi use trail and light rail transit

coverage of any major city in the United States and is often called City of Trees or The City in a Forest br br br Cityscape br br Most of Atlanta was burned during the American Civil War depleting the city of a large stock of its historic architecture Yet architecturally the city had never been traditionally southern because Atlanta originated as a railroad town rather than a southern seaport dominated by the planter class such as Savannah or Charleston Because of its later development many of the city s landmarks share architectural characteristics with buildings in the Northeast or Midwest as they were designed at a time of shared national architectural styles br br During the late th century Atlanta embraced the global trend of modern architecture especially for commercial and institutional structures Examples include the State of Georgia Building built in and the Georgia Pacific Tower in Many of the most notable examples from this period were designed by world renowned Atlanta architect John Portman Most of the buildings that define the downtown skyline were designed by Portman during this period including the Westin Peachtree Plaza and the Atlanta Marriott Marquis In the latter half of the s Atlanta became one of the early homes of postmodern buildings that reintroduced classical elements to their designs Many of Atlanta s tallest skyscrapers were built in this period and style displaying tapering spires or otherwise ornamented crowns such as One Atlantic Center Peachtree Tower and the Four Seasons Hotel Atlanta Also completed during the era is the Portman designed Bank of America Plaza built in At feet m it is the tallest building in the city and the th tallest in the United States br br The city s embrace of modern architecture has often translated into an ambivalent approach toward historic preservation leading to the destruction of many notable architectural landmarks These include the Equitable Building Terminal Station and the Carnegie Library In the mid s the Fox Theatre now a cultural icon of the city would have met the same fate if not for a grassroots effort to save it More recently preservationists may have made some inroads For example in activists convinced the Atlanta City Council not to demolish the Atlanta Fulton Central Library the last building designed by noted architect Marcel Breuer br Atlanta is divided into officially defined neighborhoods The city contains three major high rise districts which form a north south axis along Peachtree Downtown Midtown and Buckhead Surrounding these high density districts

Surrounding Atlanta s three high rise districts are the city s low and medium density neighborhoods where the craftsman bungalow single family home is dominant The eastside is marked by historic streetcar suburbs built from the s s as havens for the upper middle class These neighborhoods many of which contain their own villages encircled by shaded architecturally distinct residential streets include the Victorian Inman Park Bohemian East Atlanta and eclectic Old Fourth Ward On the westside and along the BeltLine on the eastside former warehouses and factories have been converted into housing retail space and art galleries transforming the once industrial areas such as West Midtown into model neighborhoods for smart growth historic rehabilitation and infill construction br In southwest Atlanta neighborhoods closer to downtown originated as streetcar suburbs including the historic West End while those farther from downtown retain a postwar suburban layout These include Collier Heights and Cascade Heights historically home to much of the city s affluent African American population Northwest Atlanta contains the areas of the city to west of Marietta Boulevard and to the north of Martin Luther King Jr Drive including those neighborhoods remote to downtown such as Riverside Bolton and Whittier Mill The latter is one of Atlanta s designated Landmark Historical Neighborhoods Vine City though technically Northwest adjoins the city s Downtown area and has recently been the target of community outreach programs and economic development initiatives br Gentrification of the city s neighborhoods is one of the more controversial and transformative forces shaping contemporary Atlanta The gentrification of Atlanta has its origins in the s after many of Atlanta s neighborhoods had declined and suffered the urban decay that affected other major American cities in the mid th century When neighborhood opposition successfully prevented two freeways from being built through the city s east side in the area became the starting point for Atlanta s gentrification After Atlanta was awarded the Olympic games in gentrification expanded into other parts of the city stimulated by infrastructure improvements undertaken in preparation for the games New development post has been aided by the Atlanta Housing Authority s eradication of the city s public housing As noted above it allowed development of these sites for mixed income housing requiring developers to reserve a considerable portion for affordable housing units It has also provided for other former residents to be given vouchers to gain housing in other areas Construction of the Beltline has stimulated new and related development along its path br br br Climate br br Under the K ppen
