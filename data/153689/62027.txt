including its first two owned and operated and affiliated stations founding O O WABC TV and inaugural affiliate WPVI TV As of ABC has eight owned and operated stations and current and pending affiliation agreements with additional television stations encompassing states the District of Columbia four U S possessions Bermuda and Saba This makes ABC the largest U S broadcast television network by total number of affiliates The network has an estimated national reach of of all households in the United States or Americans with at least one television set br Currently New Jersey Rhode Island and Delaware are the only U S states where ABC does not have a locally licensed affiliate New Jersey is served by New York City O O WABC TV in the north half of the state and Philadelphia O O WPVI TV in the south Rhode Island is served by New Bedford Massachusetts licensed WLNE though outside of the transmitter all other operations for the station are based in Providence and Delaware is served by WPVI in the northern two thirds and Salisbury Maryland affiliate WMDT in the southern third of the state ABC maintains affiliations with low power stations broadcasting either in analog or digital in a few markets such as Birmingham Alabama WBMA LD Lima Ohio WPNM LD and South Bend Indiana WBND LD In some markets including the former two mentioned these stations also maintain digital simulcasts on a subchannel of a co owned co managed full power television station br The network has the unusual distinction of having separately owned and operated affiliates which serve the same market in Tampa Florida WFTS TV and WWSB Boston Massachusetts WCVB TV and WMUR TV Lincoln Nebraska KLKN and KHGI TV and Grand Rapids Michigan WZZM and WOTV with an analogous situation arising in Kansas City Missouri KMBC TV and KQTV KQTV is licensed to St Joseph which Nielsen designates as a separate market from Kansas City despite a mere mile km distance between the two cities and the Kansas City based stations including KMBC providing better city grade to Grade B coverage to the area compared to the signals of the primary ABC affiliates in the other aforementioned dual affiliate markets KQTV was St Joseph s lone major network affiliate until when locally based News Press Gazette Company began establishing low power affiliates of ABC s four English language competitors and Telemundo on three low power stations to end St Joseph s dependence on Kansas City WWSB KHGI and WOTV meanwhile serve areas that do not receive an adequate signal from their market s primary ABC affiliate Of note ABC initially affiliated with WWSB to cover southern portions of the Tampa St Petersburg market including WWSB s city of license Sarasota as the transmitters of WTSP the market s former primary ABC affiliate from to and Miami affiliate WPLG had been short spaced to avoid interference between their respective analog VHF channel signals WWSB remained an ABC affiliate after its Tampa affiliation moved from WTSP to WFTS in December even though WFTS s signal reaches Sarasota and some surrounding areas WCVB TV is licensed to Boston while WMUR TV is licensed to Manchester New Hampshire which is officially part of the Boston market WCVB is easily receivable in Manchester with a good antenna as well as having its own news department that covers New Hampshire it is the only station licensed to the state that does such Both WCVB and WMUR are owned by Hearst Television br The Sinclair Broadcast Group is the largest operator of ABC stations by numerical total owning or providing services to full primary ABC affiliates and two subchannel only affiliates Sinclair owns the largest ABC subchannel affiliate by market size WABM DT WDBB DT in the Birmingham market which serve as repeaters of WBMA LD which itself is also simulcast on a subchannel of former WBMA satellite WGWW owned by Sinclair partner company Howard Stirk Holdings The E W Scripps Company is the largest operator of ABC stations in terms of overall market reach owning ABC affiliated stations including affiliates in larger markets such as Cleveland Phoenix Detroit and Denver and through its

with the ABC owned stations in Los Angeles Fresno and San Francisco the affiliations from the News Press Gazette Company in Santa Barbara Palm Springs Yuma El Centro and Colorado Springs Pueblo and Sinclair s affiliations in Seattle and Portland Oregon these four entities control the access of ABC network programming in most of the Western United States particularly in terms of audience reach br br br Facilities and studios br All of ABC s owned and operated stations and affiliates have had their own facilities and studios but transverse entities have been created to produce national programming As a result television series were produced by ABC Circle Films beginning in and by Touchstone Television beginning in before Touchstone was reorganized as ABC Studios in February and later renamed to its current name ABC Signature in August Since the s ABC has had two main production facilities the ABC Television Center now The Prospect Studios on Prospect Avenue in Hollywood California shared with the operations of KABC TV until and the ABC Television Center East a set of studios located throughout New York City br In addition to the headquarters building on Riverside

Manhattan to build a new New York based broadcast center br br br Related services br br br Video on demand services br br ABC maintains several video on demand VOD services for delayed viewing of the network s programming including a traditional VOD service called ABC on Demand which is carried on most traditional cable and IPTV providers The Walt Disney Company is also a part owner of Hulu and has offered full length episodes of most of ABC s programming through this streaming service since July br In May ABC launched WatchABC a revamp of its traditional multi platform streaming services encompassing the network s existing streaming portal at ABC com and a mobile app for smartphones and tablet computers This service provides full length episodes of ABC programs and live streams of local affiliates in select markets this was the first such offering by a U S broadcast network Live streams are only available to authenticated subscribers of participating pay television providers WABC TV New York and WPVI TV Philadelphia were the first stations to offer streams of their programming on the service with the six remaining ABC O Os offering streams by the start of the season Hearst Television also reached a deal to offer streams of its ABC affiliates on the service though as of these stations are only available for live streaming for DirecTV subscribers br In November it was reported that ABC had been developing a slate of original digital series for the WatchABC service internally codenamed ABC In July ABC re launched its streaming platforms dropping the WatchABC brand adding a streaming library of classic ABC series and introducing original short form series under the blanket branding ABCd br The most recent episodes of the network s shows are usually made available on the ABC app Hulu and ABC on Demand the day after their original broadcast In addition ABC on Demand disallows fast forwarding of accessed content br In ABC updated the app to allow app users to watch shows from ABC s sister networks Freeform FX and National Geographic br br br ABC HD br br ABC s master feed is transmitted in p high definition the native resolution format for the Walt Disney Company s American television properties However most of Hearst Television s ABC affiliated stations and some of Tegna s ABC affiliates transmit the network s programming in i while other affiliates owned by various companies carry the network feed in i standard definition either due to technical considerations for affiliates of other major networks that carry ABC programming on a digital subchannel or because a primary feed ABC affiliate has not yet upgraded their transmission equipment to allow content to be presented in HD Although ABC has not fully transitioned to p or ultra HD some stations such as ABC affiliate station KNXV TV in Phoenix Arizona transmit the network s programming at p via an ATSC multiplex stations such as KASW with KNXV TV br ABC began its conversion to high definition with the launch of its simulcast feed ABC HD on September at the start of the season with its scripted prime time series becoming the first shows to upgrade to the format the simulcast feed was launched first on ABC s owned television stations that same date with many major affiliates following after that Both new and returning scripted series were broadcast in high definition In Extreme Makeover Home Edition was the last program on the network s schedule that was broadcast in standard definition All of the network s new programming has been presented in HD since January The affiliate syndicated Saturday morning educational and informative E I block Litton s Weekend Adventure was the first children s program block on U S network television to feature programs available in HD upon its September debut The HD programming is broadcast in surround sound br On September ABC began to use framing for its most graphical imaging primarily the network s bug in program promotions and generic closing credit sequences as well as sports telecasts where the BottomLine and scoreboard elements now extend outside the frame requiring its stations and pay television providers to display its programming in a compulsory widescreen format either in high definition or standard definition With this change some programs also began positioning their main on screen credits outside the aspect ratio br br br Visual identity br br The ABC logo has evolved many times since the network s creation in The network s first logo introduced in consisted of a television screen containing the letters T and V with a vertical ABC microphone in the center referencing the network s roots in radio When the ABC UPT merger was finalized in the network introduced a new logo based on the FCC seal with the letters ABC enclosed in a circular shield surmounted by a bald eagle In just before the television network began its first color broadcasts the ABC logo consisted of a tiny lowercase abc in the center of a large lowercase letter a a design known as the ABC Circle A br In graphic designer Paul Rand redesigned the ABC logo into its current and best known form with the lowercase letters abc enclosed in a single black circle The new logo debuted on air on October of the same year but it was not until the following spring that it was fully adopted The letters are strongly reminiscent of the Bauhaus typeface designed by Herbert Bayer in the s but also share similarities with several other fonts such as ITC Avant Garde and Horatio and most closely resembling Chalet The logo s simplicity made it easier to redesign and duplicate which was beneficial before the advent of computer graphics A color version of the logo was also developed around and animated as a brief second intro to be shown before the then small handful of network programs broadcast in color similar to the NBC Laramie peacock intro used during that era The a was rendered in red the b in blue and the c in green against the same single black circle A variant of this color logo with the colored letters against a white circle was also commonly used throughout the s br The s and s saw the emergence of many graphical imaging packages for the network which based the logo s setting mainly on special lighting effects then under development including white blue pink rainbow neon and glittering dotted lines Among the ABC Circle logo s many variants was a ID sequence that featured a bubble on a black background representing the circle with glossy gold letters and was the first ABC identification card to simulate a three dimensional appearance br In for the th anniversary of the network s founding ID sequences had the logo appear in a gold CGI design on a blue background accompanied by the slogan That Special Feeling in a script font Ten years later in the ABC Circle logo reverted to its classic white on black color scheme but with gloss effects on both the circle and the letters and a bronze border surrounding the circle The ABC logo first appeared as an on screen bug in the season appearing initially only for seconds at the beginning of an act or segment then appearing throughout programs beginning in the season the respective iterations of the translucent logo bug were also incorporated within program promotions until the season br During the season the network began using a minimalist graphical identity with a yellow and black motif designed by Pittard Sullivan featuring a small black and white ABC Circle logo on a yellow background promotions during this time also featured a sequence of still photos of the stars of its programs during the timeslot card as well as the schedule sequence that began each night s prime time lineup A new four note theme tune composed by Mad Bus Music was introduced alongside the package based around the network s then new We Love TV image campaign from the season creating an audio signature in comparative parlance to the NBC chimes CBS s various sound marks including the current five note version introduced in and the Fox fanfare which was phased out by the Fox network in The four note signature has been updated with every television season thereafter until season br In ABC launched a web based promotional campaign focused around its circle logo also called the dot in which comic book character Little Dot prompted visitors to download the dot a program which would cause the ABC logo to fly around the screen and settle in the bottom right corner The network hired the Troika Design Group to design and produce its identity which continued using the black and yellow coloring of the logo and featured dots and stripes in various promotional and identification spots br On June ABC began to phase in a new imaging campaign for the upcoming season Start Here accompanied by a glassy version of the ABC logo Also developed by Troika marketing used a series of icons intended to emphasize the availability of ABC content across multiple platforms and sought to simplify and bring a lot more consistency and continuity to the visual representation of ABC On air the logo was accompanied by animated water and ribbon effects Red ribbons were used to represent the entertainment division while blue ribbons were used for ABC News br br ABC introduced a revision to its logo and branding by Loyalkaspar for the season the logo carried a simpler gloss design than the version and had lettering closer resembling Paul Rand s original version of the circle logo A custom typeface inspired by the ABC logotype ABC Modern was also created for use in advertising and other promotional elements The logo was used in various color schemes with a gold version used primarily for ABC s entertainment divisions a red version used primarily for ESPN on ABC steel blue and dark grey versions used primarily by ABC News and all four colors used interchangeably in promotions br Upon a reimaging by The New Blank for the season the blue red and yellow variants were dropped with the dark grey version becoming ABC s main logo Surrounding promotional elements adopted a circular echo motif and the new slogan America s Network br br Another revision to the logo was introduced on August ahead of the season Designed by Trollb ck Company it is designed to adhere to flat design trends and returns to a solid two dimensional design with smaller and bolder lettering The main logo is rendered in a dark blue gray color outlined and black on red variations are also used such as for the on screen bug and promotional usage respectively The rebrand also introduced a sonic logo that retains three out of the four notes of ABC s prior audio logo and was composed by YouTooCanWoo br The Circle logo designed in is also commonly associated with ABC affiliates who broadcast on channel including its flagship local stations WABC TV New York City KABC TV Los Angeles KGO TV San Francisco and WLS TV Chicago This logo was intended to be used somewhat interchangeably by these stations with the main circular network logo and has itself also become an iconic symbol of the ABC network KGO was the first of the ABC owned stations to use the Circle logo starting on August by the end of the year the other ABC owned stations began using the logo and have continued to do so since br br br International development br The first attempts to internationalize the ABC television network dates to the s when Goldenson tried to use the same strategies he had in expanding UPT s theater operation to the international market Goldenson said that ABC s first international activity was broadcasting the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June CBS and NBC were delayed in covering the coronation due to flight delays Goldenson tried international investing having ABC invest in stations in the Latin American market acquiring a interest in a network covering Central America and in established program distributor Worldvision Enterprises Goldenson also cited interest in Japan in the early s acquiring a stake in two new domestic networks the Mainichi Broadcasting System in and TV Asahi in Goldenson also invested in broadcasting properties in Beirut in the mid s br The goal was to create a network of wholly and partially owned channels and affiliates to rebroadcast the network s programs In this rerun activity was completed with program syndication with ABC Films selling programs to networks not owned by ABC The arrival of satellite television ended the need for ABC to hold interests in other countries many governments also wanted to increase their independence and strengthen legislation to limit foreign ownership of broadcasting properties As a result ABC was forced to sell all of its interests in international networks mainly in Japan and Latin America in the s a partial stake in ABS CBN in the Philippines was forcibly removed in with the declaration of martial law under Ferdinand Marcos br The second period of international expansion is linked to that of the ESPN network in the s and policies enacted in the s by Disney Media Networks These policies included the expansion of several of the company s U S based cable networks including Disney Channel and its spinoffs Toon Disney Playhouse Disney and Jetix although Disney also sold its stake in European sports channel Eurosport for million in June In contrast to Disney s other channels ABC broadcasts in the United States with programming syndicated in other countries The policy regarding wholly owned international networks was revived and on September ABC announced the launch of ABC a free to air channel in the United Kingdom owned by the ABC Group However ABC could not attain sustainable viewership and was shut down in October br Prior to the ABC closure on October Disney ABC Television Group entered into an agreement with satellite provider Dish TV to carry its ABC News Now channel in India However this operation was not put into effect br br br Australia br In Australia the Nine Network maintained close ties with ABC and has used a majority of the U S network s image campaigns and slogans since the s in particular Still the One ABC s slogan it adopted for the television season and again for the television season was adopted by Nine for the Australian television season before Nine also used ABC s Let Us Be the One slogan and lasted longer ever since it was re adopted in it was Nine s main slogan until it was replaced in December only to be reintroduced in November ABC s other slogans were also adopted by Nine during the period as secondary slogans complementing the Still the One slogan br br br Canada br Most Canadians have access to at least one U S based ABC affiliate either over the air in areas located within proximity of the Canada United States border or through a cable satellite or IPTV provider Most ABC programs are subject to simultaneous substitution regulations imposed by the CRTC which require television service providers to replace an American station s signal with the feed of a Canadian broadcaster carrying the same syndicated program to protect domestic programming rights and advertising revenue br br br Mexico br Like Canada ABC programming is available in Mexico through free to air affiliates in markets located within proximity to the Mexico United States border whose signals are readily receivable over the air in border areas of northern Mexico br br br Film production br br br See also br br ABC Family Worldwide br ABC Kids br ABC Productions br
