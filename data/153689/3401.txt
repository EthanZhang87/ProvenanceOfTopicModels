Board games are tabletop games that typically use pieces These pieces are moved or placed on a pre marked game board playing surface and often include elements of table card role playing and miniatures games as well br Many board games feature a competition between two or more players To show a few examples in checkers British English name draughts a player wins by capturing all opposing pieces while Eurogames often end with a calculation of final scores Pandemic is a cooperative game where players all win or lose as a team and peg solitaire is a puzzle for one person br There are many varieties of board games Their representation of real life situations can range from having no inherent theme such as checkers to having a specific theme and narrative such as Cluedo Rules can range from the very simple such as in snakes and ladders to deeply complex as in Advanced Squad Leader Play components now often include custom figures or shaped counters and distinctively shaped player pieces commonly known as meeples as well as traditional cards and dice br The time required to learn or master gameplay varies greatly from game to game but is not necessarily related to the number or complexity of rules for example chess or Go possess relatively simple rulesets but have great strategic depth br br br History br br br Ancient br Classical board games are divided into four categories race games such as pachisi space games such as noughts and crosses chase games such as hnefatafl and games of displacement such as chess br Board games have been played traveled and evolved in most cultures and societies throughout history Several important historical sites artifacts and documents shed light on early board games such as Jiroft civilization game boards in Iran Senet found in Predynastic and First Dynasty burials of Egypt c BC and BC respectively is the oldest board game known to have existed Senet was pictured in a fresco painting found in Merknera s tomb BC Also from predynastic Egypt is mehen br Hounds and jackals another ancient Egyptian board game appeared around BC The first complete set of this game was discovered from a Theban tomb that dates to the th dynasty This game was also popular in Mesopotamia and the Caucasus br Backgammon originated in ancient Mesopotamia about years ago Ashtapada chess pachisi and chaupar originated in India Go and liubo originated in China Patolli originated in Mesoamerica played by the ancient Aztecs and the royal game of Ur was found in the royal tombs of Ur dating to Mesopotamia years ago br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br European br br Board games have a long tradition in Europe The oldest records of board gaming in Europe date back to Homer s Iliad written in the th century BC in which he mentions the Ancient Greek game of petteia This game of petteia would later evolve into the Roman ludus latrunculorum Board gaming in ancient Europe was not unique to the Greco Roman world with records estimating that the ancient Norse game of hnefatafl was developed sometime before AD In ancient Ireland the game of fidchell or ficheall is said to date back to at least AD though this is likely an anachronism A fidchell board dating from the th century has been uncovered in Co Westmeath Ireland br The association of dice and cards with gambling led to all dice games except backgammon being treated as lotteries by dice in the gaming acts of and Early board game producers in the second half of the eighteenth century were mapmakers The global popularization of Board Games with special themes and branding coincided with the formation of the global dominance of the British Empire John Wallis was an English board game publisher bookseller map chart seller printseller music seller and cartographer With his sons John Wallis Jr and Edward Wallis he was one of the most prolific publishers of board games of the late th and early th centuries John Betts A Tour of the British Colonies and Foreign Possessions and William Spooner s A Voyage of Discovery were popular in the British empire Kriegsspiel is a genre of wargaming developed in th century Prussia to teach battle tactics to officers br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br American br br The board game Travellers Tour Through the United States and its sister game Traveller s Tour Through Europe were published by New York City bookseller F R Lockwood in and claim the distinction of being the first board games published in the United States br Margaret Hofer described the period of the s s as The Golden Age of board gaming in America Board game popularity was boosted like that of many items through mass production which made them cheaper and more easily available br br br Chinese Arabic and Indian br Outside of Europe and the U S many traditional board games are popular In China Go and many variations of chess are popular In Africa and the Middle East mancala is a popular board game archetype with many regional variations In India a community game called Carrom is popular br br br Modern br br In the late s companies began producing more new games to serve a growing worldwide market In the s several publications said board games were amid a new Golden Age or renaissance Board game venues also grew in popularity in alone more than board game caf s opened in the U S and they were reported to be very popular in China as well br Board games have been used as a mechanism for science communication br br br Luck strategy and diplomacy br Some games such as chess depend completely on player skill while many children s games such as Candy Land and snakes and ladders require no decisions by the players and are decided purely by luck br br Many games require some level of both skill and luck A player may be hampered by bad luck in backgammon Monopoly or Risk but over many games a skilled player will win more often The elements of luck can also make for more excitement at times and allow for more diverse and multifaceted strategies as concepts such as expected value and risk management must be considered br Luck may be introduced into a game by several methods The use of dice of various sorts goes back to the earliest board games These can decide everything from how many steps a player moves their token as in Monopoly to how their forces fare in battle as in Risk or which resources a player gains as in Catan Other games such as Sorry use a deck of special cards that when shuffled create randomness Scrabble does something similar with randomly picked letters Other games use spinners timers of random length or other sources of randomness German style board games are notable for often having fewer elements of luck than many North American board games Luck may be reduced in favour of skill by introducing symmetry between players For example in a dice game such as Ludo by giving each player the choice of rolling the dice or using the previous player s roll br Another important aspect of some games is diplomacy that is players making deals with one another Negotiation generally features only in games with three or more players cooperative games being the exception An important facet of Catan for example is convincing players to trade with you rather than with opponents In Risk two or more players may team up against others Easy diplomacy involves convincing other players that someone else is winning and should therefore be teamed up against Advanced diplomacy e g in the aptly named game Diplomacy consists of making elaborate plans together with the possibility of betrayal br In perfect information games such as chess each player has complete information on the state of the game but in other games such as Tigris and Euphrates or Stratego some information is hidden from players This makes finding the best move more difficult and may involve estimating probabilities by the opponents br br br Software br br Many board games are now available as video games These are aptly termed digital board games and their distinguishing characteristic compared to traditional board games is they can now be played online against a computer or other players Some websites such as boardgamearena com yucata de etc allow play in real time and immediately show the opponents moves while others use email to notify the players after each move The Internet and cheaper home printing has also influenced board games via print and play games that may be purchased and printed Some games use external media such as audio cassettes or DVDs in accompaniment to the game br br There are also virtual tabletop programs that allow online players to play a variety of existing and new board games through tools needed to manipulate the game board but do not necessarily enforce the game s rules leaving this up to the players There are generalized programs such as Vassal Tabletop Simulator and Tabletopia that can be used to play any board or card game while programs like Roll and Fantasy Grounds that are more specialized for role playing games Some of these virtual tabletops have worked with the license holders to allow for use of their game s assets within the program for example Fantasy Grounds has licenses for both Dungeons Dragons and Pathfinder materials while Tabletop Simulator allows game publishers to provide paid downloadable content for their games However as these games offer the ability to add in the content through user modifications there are also unlicensed uses of board game assets available through these programs br br br Market br br While the board gaming market is estimated to be smaller than that for video games it has also experienced significant growth from the late s A article in The Guardian described board games as making a comeback Other expert sources suggest that board games never went away and that board games have remained a popular leisure activity which has only grown over time Another from gave an estimate that put the growth of the board game market at between and annually since and described the current time as the golden era for board games The rise in board game popularity has been attributed to quality improvement more elegant mechanics components artwork and graphics as well as increased availability thanks to sales through the Internet Crowd sourcing for board games is a large facet of the market with million raised on Kickstarter in br A estimate for the global board game market was over billion A estimate for the United States board games and puzzle market gave a value of under million and for United Kingdom of about million A estimate for the Korean market was put at million won and another estimate for the American board game market for the same year was at about million A estimate for the Chinese board game market was at over billion yuan A estimate put the size of the German toy market at billion euros out of which the board games and puzzle market is worth about million euros and Polish markets at billion and million zlotys respectively In Germany was considered to be the best market per capita with the highest number of games sold per individual br br br Hobby board games br Some academics such as Erica Price and Marco Arnaudo have differentiated hobby board games and gamers from other board games and gamers A estimate placed the U S and Canada market for hobby board games games produced for a gamer market at only million with the total size of what it defined as the hobby game market the market for those games regardless of whether they re sold in the hobby channel or other channels at over million A similar estimate suggested a hobby game market value of almost million br br br Research br br A dedicated field of research into gaming exists known as game studies or ludology br While there has been a fair amount of scientific research on the psychology of older board games e g chess Go mancala less has been done on contemporary board games such as Monopoly Scrabble and Risk and especially modern board games such as Catan Agricola and Pandemic Much research has been carried out on chess partly because many tournament players are publicly ranked in national and international lists which makes it possible to compare their levels of expertise The works of Adriaan de Groot William Chase Herbert A Simon and Fernand Gobet have established that knowledge more than the ability to anticipate moves plays an essential role in chess playing ability br Linearly arranged board games have improved children s spatial numerical understanding This is because the game is similar to a number line in that they promote a linear understanding of numbers rather than the innate logarithmic one br Research studies show that board games such as Snakes and Ladders result in children showing significant improvements in aspects of basic number skills such as counting recognizing numbers numerical estimation and number comprehension They also practice fine motor skills each time they grasp a game piece Playing board games has also been tied to improving children s executive functions and help reduce risks of dementia for the elderly Related to this is a growing academic interest in the topic of game accessibility culminating in the development of guidelines for assessing the accessibility of modern tabletop games and the extent to which they are playable for people with disabilities br br Additionally board games can be therapeutic Bruce Halpenny a games inventor said when interviewed about his game The Great Train Robbery With crime you deal with every basic human emotion and also have enough elements to combine action with melodrama The player s imagination is fired as they plan to rob the train Because of the gamble they take in the early stage of the game there is a build up of tension which is immediately released once the train is robbed Release of tension is therapeutic and useful in our society because most jobs are boring and repetitive br Playing games has been suggested as a viable addition to the traditional educational curriculum if the content is appropriate and the gameplay informs students on the curriculum content br br br Categories br There are several ways in which board games can be classified and considerable overlap may exist so that a game belongs to several categories br The namesake of the board game gameboards would seem to be a necessary and sufficient condition of the genre though card games that do not use a standard deck of cards as well as games that use neither cards nor a gameboard are often colloquially included with some scholars therefore referring to said genre as that of table and board games or tabletop games or seeing board games as a subgenre of tabletop games br H J R Murray s A History of Board Games Other Than Chess has been called the first attempt to develop a scheme for the classification of board games David Parlett s Oxford History of Board Games defines four primary categories race games where the goal is to be the first to move all one s pieces to the final destination space games in which the object is to arrange the pieces into some special configuration chase games asymmetrical games where players start the game with different sets of pieces and objectives and displace games where the main objective is the capture the opponents pieces Parlett also distinguishes between abstract and thematic games the latter having a specific theme or frame narrative ex regular chess versus for example Star Wars themed chess br br The following is a list of some of the most common game categories br br br Glossary br br Although many board games have a jargon all their own there is a generalized terminology to describe concepts applicable to basic game mechanics and attributes common to nearly all board games br br br See also br br br br br br
