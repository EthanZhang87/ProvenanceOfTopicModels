to NBC then to CBS and once again to NBC through Procter Gamble When Procter Gamble was unable to make room for the show in its lineup Nixon put All My Children on hold br Nixon became head writer for Another World in and decided to use a few ideas from her All My Children bible In particular she used the model of the Erica Kane character to create a brand new Another World character named Rachel Davis Nixon said Rachel was Erica s precursor to the public What Erica and Rachel have in common is they thought if they could get their dream they d be satisfied But that dream has been elusive Nixon said br br br Creation br ABC later approached Nixon to create a show that would reflect a more contemporary tone That program One Life to Live debuted in After the show became a success the network asked Nixon for another program and she revived her All My Children bible and the Erica Kane character br Nixon wrote a poem to include in the photo album shown in the series title credits br The

herself or by her prot g Wisner Washam He was groomed by Nixon to eventually take over the reins in the s while she focused on other endeavors which included creating and launching Loving in br Nixon strove to create a soap opera that was topical and could illustrate social issues for the audience She wanted this and a combination of regular humor for the series To keep the action more real she allowed the audience to locate her fictional Pine Valley on a map situated a mere hour long train ride from New York City Many believed Pine Valley was in New York because of a town called Pine Valley in western New York However it was not until the s that it was finally revealed that Pine Valley is actually in Pennsylvania near Philadelphia and also near One Life to Live s Llanview Nixon reportedly modeled the town on Rosemont an actual suburb of Philadelphia br The show s first action takes place around several families and characters Phoebe Tyler Ruth Warrick who fashions herself as

fatal infection after having the abortion and the switchboards at ABC lit up with calls from doctors and nurses offering their medical opinions on how best to treat the character s case The storyline
