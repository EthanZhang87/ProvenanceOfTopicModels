id: 191601
As the World Turns often abbreviated as ATWT is an American television soap opera that aired on CBS for years from April to September Irna Phillips created As the World Turns as a sister show to her other soap opera Guiding Light With hours of cumulative narrative As the World Turns has the longest total running time of any television show In terms of continuous run of production As the World Turns at years holds the fourth longest run of any daytime network soap opera on American television surpassed only by General Hospital Guiding Light and Days of Our Lives As the World Turns was produced for its first years in Manhattan and in Brooklyn from until br Set in the fictional town of Oakdale Illinois the show debuted on April at p m EST airing as a minute serial Prior to that date all serials had been minutes in length As the World Turns and The Edge of Night which premiered on the same day at p m EST were the first two to be minutes in length from their premieres At first viewers were indifferent to the new half hour serial but ratings picked up in its second year eventually reaching the top spot in the daytime Nielsen ratings by fall In the show started a streak of weekly ratings wins that was not interrupted for over years The show switched to color on August and expanded from a half hour in length to one hour daily starting on December when The Edge of Night moved to ABC In the year to date ratings As the World Turns was the most watched daytime drama from until with some ten million viewers tuning in each day At its height core actors such as Helen Wagner Don MacLaughlin Don Hastings and Eileen Fulton became nationally known Wagner Hastings and Fulton are also three of longest serving actors in the history of American soap operas br The show passed its th episode on May and celebrated its th anniversary on April On September As the World Turns became the last remaining Procter Gamble produced soap opera for CBS after Guiding Light aired its final episode on the network br On December CBS announced it was canceling As the World Turns after a run of almost years due to low ratings The show taped its final scenes on June and with a dramatic storyline finale its final episode aired on September Reruns of The Price Is Right Let s Make a Deal and The Young and the Restless took over the As the World Turns time slot between September and October for four weeks On October CBS replaced As the World Turns with a new talk show called The Talk br br br Premise br br As the World Turns was the creation of Irna Phillips who beginning in the s had been one of the foremost creators and writers of radio soap operas As a writer Phillips favored character development and psychological realism over melodrama and her previous creations which included Guiding Light were especially notable for placing professionals doctors lawyers and clergy at the center of their storylines Phillips wrote As the world turns we know the bleakness of winter the promise of spring the fullness of summer and the harvest of autumn the cycle of life is complete br And so it was with As the World Turns with its slow moving psychological character studies of families headed by legal and medical professionals The personal and professional lives of doctors and lawyers remained central to As the World Turns throughout its run and eventually became standard fare on many soap operas Whereas the minute radio soaps often focused on one central heroic character for example Dr Jim Brent in Phillips Road of Life the expanded minute format of As the World Turns enabled Phillips to introduce a handful of professionals within the framework of a family saga br Phillips style favored gradual evolution over radical change Slow conversational and emotionally intense the show moved at the pace of life itself and sometimes even more slowly than that Each new addition to the cast was done in a gradual manner and was usually a key contact to one of the members of the Hughes family As such the show earned a reputation as being quite conservative though the show did showcase a gay male character in During the show s early decades the content related policies of its sponsor Procter Gamble Productions may have contributed to the perception of conservatism The household products manufacturing giant typically frowned on storylines in which adultery and other immoral behavior went unpunished and as late as the s characters from the primary families were still generally not allowed to go through with abortions br br br Notable history and accomplishments br As the World Turns premiered on April It was the first television daytime drama with a minute running time all daytime dramas until then had minute running times br The series was also CBS s first to expand to a minute running time in By the program was the number one daytime drama in the United States where it remained until As the World Turns won the Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series four times in and br br br Cast and characters br br br Helen Wagner br The first words spoken in As the World Turns in the first episode aired on April were Good morning dear said by the character Nancy Hughes played by actress Helen Wagner br Wagner was acknowledged by the Guinness Book of Records for having the longest run in a single role on television a position she held until She did not play the role without interruption she was temporarily dropped from the series after the first six months due to conflicts with creator Irna Phillips Wagner also left the series in when she felt that writers were not interested in the veteran players and returned as a regular character in br On the episode broadcast on Monday August it was revealed that Nancy had died in her sleep the next day s episode dealt with Nancy s memorial service Nancy Hughes s memorial aired just two weeks before the series finale The show s producers stated in interviews that they had to revise their plans for the final episode because of Wagner s death they had hoped that Wagner would say the final lines of the last episode just as she had said the first words of the first episode br br br Crossovers br Several crossovers have been made between As the World Turns and other serials br br br The character Mitchell Dru Geoffrey Lumb was brought to Oakdale after the cancellation of the Procter and Gamble soap The Brighter Day The same character and actor was then transferred to a new P G soap Another World shortly after its premiere in Another World was originally conceived by Irna Phillips to be a spin off series of As the World Turns Like several other characters from Another World Mitchell Dru crossed over for one or more performances on the first Another World spin off Somerset which premiered in March br br The character Lisa Miller Hughes Eileen Fulton was used as the basis to create a primetime spinoff soap Our Private World CBS s attempt to duplicate the success of rival network ABC s Peyton Place with Lisa leaving Oakdale and moving to Chicago where she married wealthy John Eldridge but had an affair with his brother Thomas Though Our Private World only lasted a few months and Fulton returned to As the World Turns in early after taking a few months off remnants of Lisa s time on Our Private World were resurrected years later when it was revealed in that Lisa had had a son off camera hitherto unknown to viewers before returning to As the World Turns in Her son Scott Eldridge tracked her down as an adult and remained on As the World Turns for several years br br Shortly after NBC canceled Another World on April with the series finale that aired on June of the same year the characters of Cass and Lila Winthrop Stephen Schnetzer and Lisa Peluso and Jake and Victoria McKinnon Tom Eplin and Jensen Buchanan crossed over to As the World Turns briefly Jake and Vicky intended to move to Oakdale but Vicky was soon killed off in September then appeared as a ghost to Jake and Molly from November to February Cass only appeared on a recurring basis through usually whenever anyone in Oakdale needed an attorney other than resident lawyer Tom Hughes and Jake Tom Eplin remained as a regular on the series until his character was killed off in Cindy Brooke Harrison Kim Rhodes also had minor appearances in and Vicky s mother and twin sister Donna Anna Stuart and Marley Ellen Wheeler who at the time also directed episodes of As the World Turns made recurring appearances from to and left the show when they gained custody of Jake and Vicky s twin daughters after Jake s death There were also plans to have a now teenage Steven Frame Vicky s son with Jamie Frame come to Oakdale and live with Jake but the character was reconceived as teenage Bryant Montgomery the son of As the World Turns couple Craig and Sierra br Since a number of characters have crossed back and forth between As the World Turns and The Young and the Restless br br br As the World Turns At the request of Oakdale Illinois District Attorney Jessica Griffin Michael Baldwin Christian LeBlanc traveled there to serve as the attorney for Jack Snyder Michael Park in a custody hearing involving his late wife Julia Larabee s son JJ April br The irony in his appearance in the above mentioned episodes is that years before LeBlanc left the role of Kirk McColl the youngest son of Lisa s fifth husband Whit McColl played by Wagon Train star Robert Horton who was killed off shortly before Fulton s return to the show So to many long time fans of both As the World Turns and The Young and the Restless seeing LeBlanc as the character from the latter show was weird History was also made during LeBlanc s appearance on As the World Turns since both shows are made by different production companies Bell Dramatic Serial Company for The Young and the Restless Procter and Gamble for As the World Turns although they are on the same network br br br The Young and the Restless Amber Moore Adrienne Frantz called on her friend Alison Stewart Marnie Schulenburg to help trick Cane Ashby Daniel Goddard into marriage After Amber drugged Cane Alison dressed up as him for the wedding service February br The Young and the Restless Emily Stewart Kelley Menighan Hensley traveled from Oakdale Illinois to Genoa City Wisconsin in search of information on her sister Alison Stewart Marnie Schulenburg Emily met with Amber Moore Adrienne Frantz at the Crimson Lights Coffeehouse but Amber denied knowing Alison s whereabouts After Emily was gone Amber placed a call to Alison as a heads up br br On December CBS canceled As the World Turns after almost years with the series finale airing on September making it the last Procter Gamble soap opera to end br br br President Kennedy s assassination br br On November the live CBS broadcast of As the World Turns began as always at EST In this episode the Hughes family was discussing plans for Thanksgiving Ten minutes later a CBS News Bulletin slide suddenly appeared on the screen and Walter Cronkite gave the first report of shots being fired at the motorcade in which President Kennedy was travelling br br Here is a bulletin from CBS News in Dallas Texas three shots were fired at President Kennedy s motorcade in downtown Dallas The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting More details just arrived These details about the same as previously President Kennedy shot today just as his motorcade left downtown Dallas Mrs Kennedy jumped up and grabbed Mr Kennedy she called Oh no The motorcade sped on United Press says that the wounds for President Kennedy perhaps could be fatal Repeating a bulletin from CBS News President Kennedy has been shot by a would be assassin in Dallas Texas Stay tuned to CBS News for further details br At the end of this bulletin CBS rejoined As the World Turns which was still in progress The cast performing the episode live was not yet aware of the rapidly developing situation However just before Don Hastings and Henderson Forsythe began the third scene of the show Hastings overheard cameraman Phil Polansky talking to the control room through a headset Don t tell the actors what The President s been shot The actors received their cues and began the scene while Walter Cronkite was in the midst of reporting further information from Dallas CBS then returned to the show in the middle of the third scene which would be the last regular program viewed by the television audience that day During the commercial break that followed the CBS News Bulletin slide appeared again and Cronkite resumed with audio only reports of the developments in Dallas until the top of the hour when CBS News was ready to go on the air with video Once the episode came to a close with Eileen Fulton in the final scene the cast was finally informed of the news br As NBC and ABC the other two major U S TV networks were not programming in that timeslot then the ET period belonging to their local affiliates As the World Turns has the distinction of being the last regular U S network program broadcast for the next four days as the assassination and funeral of JFK and the transition of power to President Lyndon B Johnson took center stage br br br Broadcast history br br As the World Turns enjoyed a virtually uninterrupted reign as the highest rated soap from to tying for first place with NBC Daytime s Another World and Days of Our Lives By the mid s it was so firmly entrenched that its strongest competition Let s Make a Deal despite developing a devoted fan base in its own right and becoming one of daytime s most popular game shows could not come close to matching it in the Nielsens br Its strength was such that ABC ran hour long drama reruns in the pm noon Central slot in the mid s and NBC after losing Deal to ABC in ran a total of eight shows all short lived with the exception of Three on a Match which lasted three years against As the World Turns and Let s Make a Deal from that point until br As that year began Another World was expanded to minutes with its first hour long episode airing on January Although this did not directly affect As the World Turns as the two shows were not in competition for anything other than the overall ratings win CBS afternoon lineup suffered some ratings damage as the popular soap put a dent in the ratings of two popular afternoon game shows The Price Is Right and Match Game NBC pleased by the success that the expansion of Another World had brought to the network elected to do the same thing with Days of Our Lives beginning on April this put Days of Our Lives and As the World Turns in direct competition for ratings Incidentally the expansions were occurring six and a half years after the last two minute serials Search for Tomorrow and The Guiding Light expanded to minutes br CBS considered expanding As the World Turns and Search for Tomorrow to minutes eliminating the timeslot during which stations broadcast local or syndicated programs but eventually decided to expand As the World Turns its front runner in the ratings battle to a full hour length Initially in order to free up the necessary minutes to do so CBS returned The Price Is Right which had been paired with Match Game for the previous two years as part of the network s successful p m game show block to the morning However CBS changed course and decided that it would also attempt an expansion of Price to minutes this meant that if the plans to expand As the World Turns were to go as anticipated CBS would need to cancel a program to free up that minutes of airtime it needed br At the time CBS was having ratings trouble with The Edge of Night Procter Gamble had demanded that CBS give the serial the p m slot following The Guiding Light in moving it from the p m slot it had held since This decision proved to be a grave mistake The Edge of Night which had a much younger and more male centric audience than almost any other serial on television when the move was made lost a large portion of its audience especially to NBC s The Doctors at the height of its popularity at the time In addition the rest of CBS drama lineup was performing well in the ratings and the network could not move the long running serial to another timeslot without risking preemption from local affiliates which would almost certainly have driven ratings even lower br At the same time ABC expressed interest in picking up The Edge of Night for its own lineup as it had been interested in carrying a P G produced serial for some time supplementing its in house productions An agreement was struck between CBS Procter Gamble and ABC to get the necessary minutes for the As the World Turns expansion CBS would not renew The Edge of Night once its contract was up Procter Gamble would move the serial to ABC and thus As the World Turns could go ahead with its expansion br A major issue arose that halted the planned shuffle however CBS was contracted to air The Edge of Night until December and ABC had no place in its schedule to put it at the time This forced CBS to temporarily postpone expanding As the World Turns and keep The Edge of Night until ABC could find a timeslot for it Finally in November ABC agreed that The Edge of Night would join its lineup on December replacing the game show You Don t Say at p m closer to its pre timeslots and keeping the serial s continuity intact And thus As the World Turns became CBS first minute daytime serial br The first half of the newly expanded show continued to perform well against Let s Make a Deal on ABC which the network moved to the noon a m timeslot within four weeks of the expansion The second half put As the World Turns in competition with ABC s most popular game show The Pyramid which had done well against Guiding Light since the network moved it to p m in December and kept doing so against As the World Turns Although the expansion was not a complete success at the end of the season the serial was again at the top of the daytime Nielsens despite a point drop from the year before br Although the eventual hit game show Family Feud ran against As The World Turns from July until April it did not become a hit for ABC until its move to the mornings Only when ABC made its first move to a one hour soap with All My Children did trouble really begin for As the World Turns and NBC s Days of Our Lives since ABC kept that serial s starting time at noon meaning that fans of that serial who tuned to NBC or CBS would miss the last half of that day s storyline or contrariwise would not if they watched until the mid program commercial break and then changed channels pick up the As the World Turns or Days of Our Lives activities from the episode s beginning since ABC strategically placed its break several minutes after rather than exactly at the bottom of the hour Further All My Children s emphasis on youth oriented sexier storylines provided a sharp contrast to the domestic almost quaint tone of As the World Turns and to a lesser degree the melodramatic somewhat topical Days On January ABC ballooned its decade old One Life to Live to the PM p m starting time compounding the other networks headaches These factors helped contribute to the fall of As the World Turns from the top spot in the ratings at the end of the season After finishing the previous season tied with Another World for number one in the Nielsens As the World Turns fell to fourth behind All My Children General Hospital and The Young and the Restless br On February CBS moved and expanded The Young and the Restless to a full hour after the cancellation of the long tenured Love of Life The Young and the Restless moved from noon a m to p m noon the former affiliate break timeslot and As the World Turns was bumped up to p m and Guiding Light to p m On June As the World Turns returned to its traditional p m start time with Search for Tomorrow following at p m and The Young and the Restless leading off the serial lineup at either noon a m or p m a m depending on affiliate preference br As the World Turns remained at p m until March when CBS cancelled the five year old Capitol in favor of The Bold and the Beautiful CBS scheduled it at p m and finally settled As the World Turns at p m where it remained until its final network episode in September Although facing the full length of Another World and One Life to Live once again the Douglas Marland era of to had a resurgence in ratings and by it was back in its once habitual top four placing As the World Turns survived NBC s cancellation of its sister series Another World in br br br Cancellation and final episode br On December CBS confirmed that it would not renew As the World Turns The final CBS episode was taped on June at JC Studios in Brooklyn and aired on September The final scene included Kim Hughes Kathryn Hays telling Bob Hughes Don Hastings to take as much time as he needed After he put his nameplate in his briefcase Bob said the show s final line Good night and left Oakdale Memorial Hospital for the last time at which point the globe started spinning before the final fade out br br br Ratings br Series ratings br One example of the drastic change in daytime television can be found in the
