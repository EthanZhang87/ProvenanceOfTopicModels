All Star Blitz is an American game show that aired on ABC from April to December with reruns airing on the USA Network from March to December Peter Marshall was the host and John Harlan was the announcer for the series which was produced by Merrill Heatter Productions in association with Peter Marshall Enterprises br Like Heatter s productions Hollywood Squares and Battlestars before it All Star Blitz was a celebrity panel show where contestants had to correctly determine whether the celebrities were giving a correct answer or bluffing Like Hollywood Squares a secondary gameplay element was attached in this particular instance the element involved the contestants trying to solve puzzles br br br Main game br Two contestants one usually a returning champion competed to uncover and solve hidden word puzzles with the help of a four celebrity panel The puzzles which varied in length from two to six words were concealed behind a grid of six monitors above the panel and a star was positioned at the corner of each monitor There were stars in all arranged in four columns of three with one column above each celebrity s seat Each monitor contained all or part of only one word and the last word on the top row did not continue onto the bottom one br The object for the contestants was to light the stars around the monitors To begin play the home audience was shown how many words were in the puzzle and a certain number of stars originally two later four were lit at random The contestant in control usually the challenger chose a celebrity and a position top middle bottom The star in that position was lit and Marshall then asked a question to the chosen celebrity The contestant either had to correctly agree or disagree with the given answer in much the same manner as Hollywood Squares and Battlestars Choosing correctly allowed the contestant to keep control and pick again but making a wrong decision passed control to the opposing player br Once all four stars around a monitor were lit the part of the puzzle it was concealing required a correct agree disagree choice from one of the contestants to reveal and the celebrity underneath the star would remain in play until one was given Once the puzzle piece was uncovered the contestant that revealed it was given a chance to guess the puzzle or continue playing as an incorrect guess passed control to his her opponent br Play continued on a puzzle until one player solved it or all six monitors were uncovered with the player who uncovered the last monitor winning the game by default br The first contestant to solve two puzzles won the match and a prize package and went on to play the Blitz Bonanza Rather than featuring models celebrity guests often modeled and demonstrated prizes while being described by the announcer which would be preceded by a message on the game board monitors describing the prize s br Each episode of All Star Blitz was played to a time limit If time was called during a puzzle the contestant in control was given the option of whether or not to guess the puzzle Choosing not to guess ended the game and the solution to the puzzle was revealed Guessing incorrectly gave the option to the opponent Regardless of the decision and its outcome play resumed on the next episode with either a new puzzle or the Blitz Bonanza as dictated by the rules br br br Blitz Bonanza br In the Blitz Bonanza round the champion was given one final puzzle to solve Initially the champion was told how many words the puzzle contained but this would change in favor of revealing the information to the home audience and panel only In order to reveal the puzzle pieces the champion spun a large wheel that controlled a randomizer light on the board If the light stopped on a covered space it was revealed if it stopped on a revealed space that spin was wasted br The champion spun the wheel four times If fewer than four spaces were uncovered after the last spin the champion was given the option to leave the board as it was or give up the prize package he she had won in the main game in exchange for one more spin After taking or declining this fifth spin the champion was given seconds to study the puzzle and each celebrity secretly wrote down a guess The champion won a cash jackpot for solving the puzzle or per celebrity who had the correct answer in case of a miss br The jackpot had a starting value of Initially it increased by for each time the Blitz Bonanza was not won and was capped at a maximum value of Later the cap was reduced to and the increase for every unsuccessful attempt was reduced to br Champions remained on the show until they were defeated in the main game or had played the Blitz Bonanza four times br br br Broadcast history br All Star Blitz originally aired on ABC at AM EST replacing Trivia Trap and followed by the long running Family Feud However the series found itself facing strong competition from the first half of the powerhouse The Price Is Right on CBS and Wheel of Fortune on NBC br In June two months after All Star Blitz premiered Family Feud was cancelled and All Star Blitz moved up a half hour to the AM EST slot formerly occupied by Feud However now competing against the second half of Price as well as Scrabble on NBC ratings did not improve and All Star Blitz ended its run on December br br br br br br External links br All Star
