the graphical elements in their programs for Dream Team within a frame due to them being positioned for future syndicated sales though all of its programming has been in high definition br br br Branding br br br Logos br br The CBS television network s initial logo used from the s to consisted of an oval spotlight which shone on the block letters CBS The present day Eye device was conceived by William Golden based on a Pennsylvania Dutch hex sign and a Shaker drawing While the logo is commonly attributed to Golden some design work may have been done by CBS staff designer Georg Olden one of the first African Americans to attract some attention in the postwar graphic design field The Eye device made its broadcast debut on October The following season as Golden prepared a new ident CBS President Frank Stanton insisted on keeping the Eye device and using it as much as possible Golden died unexpectedly in and was replaced by Lou Dorfsman one of his top assistants who would go on to oversee all print and on air graphics for CBS for the next years br The CBS eye has since become a widely recognized symbol While the logo has been used in different ways the Eye device itself has not been redesigned in its history As part of a new graphical identity created by Trollb ck Company that was introduced by the network in the eye was placed in a trademark position on show titles days of the week and descriptive words an approach highly respecting the value of the design The logo is alternately known as the Eyemark a branding used for CBS domestic television syndication division under the Eyemark Entertainment name in the mid to late s after Westinghouse Electric bought CBS but before the King World acquisition which Eyemark was folded into and subsequent merger with Viacom Eyemark Entertainment was the result of the merger of MaXaM Entertainment an independent television syndication firm which Westinghouse acquired shortly after its merger with CBS in Group W Productions

several notable image campaigns and several of the network s most well known slogans were introduced in the s The Reach for the Stars campaign used during the season features a space theme to capitalize on both CBS s stellar improvement in the ratings and the historic launch of the space shuttle Columbia s Great Moments juxtaposed scenes from classic CBS programs such as I Love Lucy with scenes from the network s then current classics such as Dallas and M A S H From to CBS by now firmly atop the ratings featured a campaign based on the slogan We ve Got the Touch Vocals for the campaign s jingle were contributed by Richie Havens one occasion in and Kenny Rogers br The season ushered in the Share the Spirit of CBS campaign the network s first to completely use computer graphics and digital video effects Unlike most network campaign promos the full length version of Share the Spirit not only showed a brief clip preview of each new fall series but also utilized CGI effects to map out the entire fall schedule by night The success of that campaign led to the CBS Spirit or CBSPIRIT campaign Like its predecessor most CBSpirit promos utilized a procession of clips from the network s programs However the new graphic motif was a swirling or swishing blue line that was used to represent the spirit The full length promo like the previous year had a special portion that identified new fall shows but the mapped out fall schedule shot was abandoned br For the season CBS unveiled a new image campaign officially known as Television You Can Feel but more commonly identified as You Can Feel It On CBS The goal was to convey a more sensual new age image through distinguished advanced looking computer graphics and soothing music backgrounding images and clips of emotionally powerful scenes and characters However it was this season in which CBS saw its ratings freefall the deepest in the network s history CBS ended the decade with Get Ready for CBS introduced with the season The initial version was an ambitious campaign that attempted to elevate CBS out of last place among the major networks the motif centered around network stars interacting with each other in a remote studio set getting ready for photo and television shoots as well as for the new season on CBS The high energy promo song and the campaign s practices saw many customized variations by all of CBS s owned and operated stations and affiliates which participated in the campaign per a network mandate In addition for the first time in history CBS became the first broadcast network to partner with a national retailer in this case Kmart to encourage viewership with the CBS Kmart Get Ready Giveaway br br br s br For the season the campaign featured a new jingle performed by the Temptations which featured an altered version of their hit Get Ready The early s featured less than memorable campaigns with simplified taglines such as This is CBS and You re on CBS Eventually the promotions department gained momentum again late in the decade with Welcome Home to a CBS Night simplified to Welcome Home and succeeded by the spin off campaign The Address is CBS whose history can be traced back to a CBS slogan from the radio era of the s The Stars Address is CBS During the season for the end of show network identification sequence a four note sound mark was introduced which was eventually adapted into the network s IDs and production company vanity cards following the closing credits of most of its programs during the Welcome Home era br br br s br Throughout the s CBS rating resurgence was backed by the network s It s All Here campaign which introduced updated versions of the sound mark used during certain promotions and production company vanity cards during the closing credits of programs in campaign introduced the slogan Everybody s Watching the network s strategy led to the proclamation that it was America s Most Watched Network The network s campaign introduced the slogan We Are CBS with Don LaFontaine providing the voiceover for the IDs as well as certain network promos during this period In the network introduced a campaign entitled Only CBS in which network promotions proclaim several unique qualities it has the slogan was also used in program promotions following the announcement of the timeslot of a particular program The America s Most Watched Network was re introduced by CBS in used alongside the Only CBS slogan br br br s br In October CBS announced that it would begin to employ a more unified branding between the network and its divisions to strengthen brand awareness across platforms The two main components of the rebranding are a deconstructed eye motif using the individual shapes of the eyemark such as an animated station ID and a five note sonic branding developed by the audio design agency Antfood phonetically resembling the This is CBS slogan br Alongside the rebranding CBS Television Studios was renamed CBS Studios and CBS Television Distribution was renamed CBS Media Ventures The network also dropped the America s Most Watched Network and Only CBS taglines with chief marketing officer Michael Benson explaining that they aimed to be something where people feel like they are part of the family It s tough to unify if you re bragging about yourself br As part of the rebranding CBS News and CBS Sports also introduced new logos and imaging incorporating the deconstructed eye motif and sonic branding with CBS News initially using it for coverage of the presidential election and CBS Sports launching its rebrand ahead of Super Bowl LV in In December CBS News and Stations began to deploy the rebranding on the local news operations of CBS s owned and operated stations with most now being branded as CBS
