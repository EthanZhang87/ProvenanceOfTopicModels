The DO Interactive Multiplayer also referred to as simply DO is a home video game console developed by The DO Company Conceived by entrepreneur and Electronic Arts founder Trip Hawkins the DO was not a console manufactured by the company itself but a set of specifications originally designed by Dave Needle and RJ Mical of New Technologies Group that could be licensed by third parties Panasonic produced the first models in and further renditions of the hardware were released afterwards by GoldStar Sanyo Creative Labs and Samsung Electronics in br Despite having a highly promoted launch including being named Time magazine s Product of the Year the oversaturated console market and the system s mixed reviews prevented it from achieving success comparable to competing consoles from Sega and Sony rendering its discontinuation by In The DO Company sold its Opera hardware to Samsung br br br History br The DO Interactive Multiplayer was originally conceived by The DO Company founded on September by Electronic Arts founder Trip Hawkins The company s objective was to create a next generation CD based video game entertainment standard which would be manufactured by various partners and licensees DO would collect a royalty on each console sold and on each game manufactured To game publishers the low US royalty rate per game was a better deal than the higher royalties paid to Nintendo and Sega when making games for their consoles The DO hardware itself was designed by Dave Needle and RJ Mical designers of the Amiga and Atari Lynx starting from an outline on a restaurant napkin in Trip Hawkins was a long time acquaintance of Needle and Mical and found that their design very closely fit his philosophy for architecture and approach so he decided that Rather than me start a brand new team and starting from scratch it just made a lot of sense to join forces with them and shape what they were doing into what I wanted it to be br The DO Company lacked the resources to manufacture consoles and instead licensed the hardware to other companies for manufacturing Trip Hawkins recounted that they approached every electronics manufacturer but that their chief targets were Sony and Panasonic the two largest consumer electronics companies in the world However Sony had already begun development on their own console the PlayStation and ultimately decided to continue work on it rather than sign with DO According to former Sega CEO Tom Kalinske The DO Company was engaged in very serious talks for Sega to become involved with the DO However it was passed on by Sega due to concerns over cost Panasonic launched the DO with its FZ model in though Goldstar and Sanyo would later manufacture the DO as well Companies who obtained the hardware license but never actually sold DO units include Samsung Toshiba and AT T who went so far as to build prototype AT T DO units and display them at the January Consumer Electronics Show br Licensing to independent manufacturers made the system extremely expensive The manufacturers had to make a profit on the hardware itself whereas most major game console manufacturers such as Sega and Sony sold their systems at a loss with expectations of making up for the loss with software sales The DO was priced at US far above competing game systems and aimed at high end users and early adopters Hawkins has argued that DO was launched at and not higher myths that are often reported In a later interview Hawkins clarified that while the suggested retail price was not all retailers sold the system at that price Goldstar Sanyo and Panasonic s later models were less expensive to manufacture than the FZ and were sold for considerably lower prices For example the Goldstar model launched at In addition after six months on the market the price of the FZ had dropped to leading some to contend that the DO s cost was not as big a factor in its market failure as is usually claimed br Hawkins belief was that the DO system could become a dominant standard in a similar way to that achieved by the VHS video cassette format with several companies being able to promote the standard effectively against individual competitors with their own technologies such as Sony and Betamax in the context of VHS It was also believed that companies would be able to more effectively compete by being able to leverage a common standard as opposed to having to attract developers to individual formats with Hawkins noting that this would be tough for Atari and Sony Indeed Hawkins believed that the failure of NEC to establish its TurboGrafx system and yet being much bigger than Sony illustrated the difficulties faced by new entrants to the console market and thought that Sony in following the business model of Sega and Nintendo would have had a better chance if it had partnered with some of the others Meanwhile other products were not regarded as competitive threats the Atari Jaguar was perceived as primitive and slightly better than a bit system and the Philips CD i was regarded as really obsolete by today s standards Both DO and Philips seeking to pioneer the broader concept of interactive entertainment aimed to sell in the order of one million units during and into br Hawkins claimed that the console was HDTV capable and that the company could use its technology for a set top box It was believed the platform would appeal to cable companies seeking to provide digital interactive services with broadcasts being accompanied by digital information eventually leading to the development of video on demand services on what was described as a client server interactive network with an interactive networking trial having been announced in collaboration with US West in Omaha Nebraska for the autumn of Computer Gaming World reported in January that DO is poised for an avalanche of software support to appear in the next months unlike the Atari Jaguar and Pioneer LaserActive The magazine predicted that If DO s licensees can get enough machines and software out in the market this could very well become the interactive gamer s entry level machine and possibly the ideal plug and play solution for those of us who are tired of playing circuit board roulette with our personal computers Electronic Arts promoted the console in two page advertisements describing it as a technological leap and promising twenty new titles over the next twelve months br The launch of the platform in October received a great deal of attention in the press as part of the multimedia wave in the computer world at the time Return Fire Road Rash FIFA International Soccer and Jurassic Park Interactive had been slated for launch releases but were pushed to mid due to the developers struggles with the then cutting edge hardware Moreover the DO Company made continued updates to the console hardware almost up to the system s release which resulted in a number of third party titles missing the launch date in some cases by less than a month because the developers weren t left enough time to fully test them on the finalized hardware The only DO software available at launch was the third party game Crash n Burn Panasonic also failed to manufacture an ample supply of the console in time for launch day and as a result most retail stores only received one or two units By mid November the DO had sold units br The system was released in Japan in March with an initial lineup of six games The Japanese launch was moderately successful with units shipping to stores However sales soon dropped and by the system was known in Japan as a host for pornographic releases br The DO s claim to the title of most advanced console on the market was lost with the Japanese launches of the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn The DO Company responded by emphasizing their console s large existing software library lower price both the Panasonic and Goldstar models were by this time and promised successor the M To assure consumers that the DO would still be supported the M was initially announced as an add on for the DO It was later revealed that the M would be an entirely separate console albeit one with DO backward compatibility Eventually the M project was cancelled br Unlike Panasonic Goldstar initially produced only DO hardware not software This made it difficult to manage competitive price drops and when the price of the Goldstar DO dropped to in December the company took a loss of more than on each sale Goldstar tried switching to the usual industry model of selling hardware at a loss and profiting on software but though a handful of Goldstar games were published for the DO Goldstar s software development operation arrived too late to allow them to turn a profit on the DO This lack of a profitable business model combined with Panasonic acquiring exclusive rights to the M technology were cited as the two chief reasons for Goldstar dropping support for the DO in early During the second quarter of several of the DO s most loyal software supporters including the software division of The DO Company themselves announced they were no longer making games for the system leaving Panasonic as the only company supporting active software development for the DO br The DO system was eventually discontinued towards the end of with a complete shutdown of all internal hardware development and divestment of the M technology The DO Company restructured themselves around this same time selling off their hardware division to become a multi platform company focused on software development and online gaming After selling the Opera hardware to Samsung in the hardware was revived in South Korea for another years then discontinued again at some point in late or early The amount of systems produced after the Samsung buyout is unknown br The initial high price is considered to be one of the many issues that led to the DO s failure along with lack of significant funding that larger companies such as Sony took advantage of In an interview shortly after The DO Company dropped support for the system Trip Hawkins attributed its failure to the model of licensing all hardware manufacturing and software to third parties He reasoned that for a console to be a success it needed a single strong company to take the lead in marketing hardware and software and pointed out that it was essentially a lack of coordination between The DO Company Panasonic and the DO s software developers which had led to the console launching with only one game ready br br br Licensed systems br br A number of

speed CD ROM drive for main CD Gs or Photo CDs and Video CDs with an add on MPEG video module The DO included the first light synthesizer in a game console converting CD music to a mesmerizing color pattern br The DO is one of few CD based units that feature neither regional lockout nor copy protection making it easy to use illegal copies or homebrew software Although there is no regional lockout for DO systems a few Japanese games cannot be played on non Japanese DO consoles due to a special kanji font which was not present in the English language console firmware Games that have

controllers were unusual in that the system base unit contained only one controller port and the controllers could be physically daisy chained together via a port on the back of each controller Up to eight controllers could be linked together in this fashion All controllers for each DO console are compatible with one another br In addition standard DO controllers released with the Panasonic FZ also contained a headphone jack and volume control for silent play The GoldStar LG model also included a controller with this feature br Third party controllers were produced by a number of companies including Logitech World International Trading Corporation also released an adapter that allows Super NES controllers to be used with the DO br br br Light gun br The only light gun released for the DO was the Gamegun a product of third party developer American Laser Games Despite this no fewer than games with light gun support were produced for the system Most of these were arcade ports from American Laser Games including Mad Dog McCree but Virgin Interactive and Digital Pictures also released DO light gun games br The DO Gamegun uses the same design as the Gamegun released for the Sega CD an orange Old West revolver Select Gameguns house a controller port so that another Gamegun may be daisy chained for two player gameplay which is supported in most of American Laser Games s DO titles br Though no light gun was released for the DO in Japan the Japanese localizations of Demolition Man and Corpse Killer retain light gun support and could be played by Japanese gamers using imported Gameguns br br br Mouse br Panasonic and Logitech both released the DO mouse The Panasonic FZ JM and Logitech DO mouse are identical aside from their markings Fewer than games supported its use some of which were optimized for the standard controller or light gun rather than the mouse Of the DO games which were optimized for use with the mouse the best known are Myst and Lemmings The

was released in limited markets br br br Games br br Some of the best received titles were ports of arcade or PC games that other systems of the time were not capable of playing such as Alone in the Dark Myst and Star Control II Other popular titles included Total Eclipse Jurassic Park Interactive Gex Crash n Burn Slayer Killing Time The Need for Speed Road Rash and Immercenary The DO version of arcade title Samurai Shodown was the only port with faithful graphics for some time and the DO Super Street Fighter II Turbo was the first port with its CD quality audio br Since its release coincided with the arrival of the modern first person shooter the DO also had some of the earliest members of the genre as exclusives such as Escape from Monster Manor the previously mentioned Killing Time and PO ed as well as ports of Wolfenstein D and Doom br However the DO library also exhibited less successful traits of home consoles at the time The DO was one of the first CD ROM consoles and some early titles on the DO frequently attempted to use interactive movie style gameplay Such titles rendered all or nearly all of their graphics in full motion video which necessitated that any interactive influence from the player be limited to a greater extent than other games of the time Some games followed a single unfolding of events simply by correctly timed prompts executed by the player Night Trap D Mad Dog McCree and The Daedalus Encounter are among the more famous examples of full motion video driven games br br br Reception br Reviewing the DO GamePro gave it a thumbs sideways They commented that The DO is the first CD ROM system to make a real jump forward in graphics sound and game design However they questioned whether it would soon be rendered obsolete by the upcoming Jaguar CD and Project Reality later released as the Nintendo and felt there were not yet enough games to justify a purchase recommending that gamers wait several months to see if the system would get a worthwhile library of games The DO was awarded Worst Console Launch of by Electronic Gaming Monthly In a special Game Machine Cross Review in May Famicom Ts shin would score the DO Real console a out of Next Generation reviewed the DO in late They noted that due chiefly to its early launch it had a larger installed base and more high quality games than the newly launched Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation making it a viable alternative to those systems However they debated whether it could remain a serious contender in the long run in light of the successor M s imminent release and the Saturn and PlayStation s superior hardware They deemed the DO hardware overhyped but still very good for its time especially praising the DMA engine They gave it out of stars concluding that it has settled out as a solid system with some good titles in its library and more on the way The question that must be answered though is this Is having a good system enough br Citing a lack of decent exclusives and an astronomical asking price in video game website IGN chose the DO as its nd greatest video game console of all time slightly higher than the Atari Jaguar but lower than its four other major competitors the SNES th best the Sega Genesis th the PlayStation th and the Sega Saturn th On Yahoo Games the DO was placed among the top five worst console launches due to its one game launch lineup and high launch price br Gaming retrospectives have also accused the DO of having an abundance of poor quality interactive movies Trip Hawkins business model for selling the DO was widely derided by industry figures br br br Legacy br The DO Company designed a next generation console that was never released due to various business and technological issues The M project which began as an accelerator add on for the DO was to use dual PowerPC processors in addition to newer D and video rendering technologies Late during development the company abandoned the console hardware business and sold the M technology to Matsushita br br br See also br br in video games br DO Rating System br List of commercial failures in video games br List of DO Interactive Multiplayer games br
