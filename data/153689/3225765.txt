s team played from a red desk br The object of the game was to solve word puzzles that consisted of a sentence or short paragraph with four blank spaces usually incorporating a pun or play on words Each blank represented a word and the object of the game was for one of the players to guess the word based on clues provided by their partner then use the words to complete the puzzle A typical example The wasn t he just had a in his With the words sick code spy and nose the solution would be The spy wasn t sick he just had a code in his nose br Play in the first round began with the red team The celebrity was shown one of the four missing words and had seconds to describe it while the contestant donned a pair of headphones and his her seat was moved forward to prevent him her from seeing or hearing anything The celebrity s description was recorded and was played back for the contestant after time expired br Both members of the opposing team were able to hear the entire description The celebrity of that team had control of a plunger known as a blackout button which he she could press to silence black out portions of the recording as it was played back The blackout button could be used for a maximum of seven seconds plus one extra second for every word duplicated in the description br If the contestant correctly guessed the word he she won an incorrect response allowed the opposing team to attempt it The team that guessed the word was then given a chance to solve the puzzle and successfully doing so scored one point If neither team guessed a word it was put up on the board and play continued with the next word Teams alternated describing the four words in the puzzle Saying the word or any form of it or making a sound similar to the word in the description immediately awarded and a free guess at the puzzle to the opposing team If both teams missed the fourth word Goen read a definition of it as a toss up and the first team to buzz in with the answer received the and a guess at the puzzle If the team that guessed the fourth word failed to solve the puzzle their opponents were given a chance to solve it br For the second round the contestants described words for their celebrity partners and operated the blackout buttons and the yellow team played first with the per word still awarded to the contestant br The first team to score two points won the game and advanced to the Clue Screen bonus round If the score was tied after two puzzles a sudden death tiebreaker was played using one final word with the contestants again in control of giving clues and blacking out The team that had correctly guessed more words during the first two rounds or the winner of a backstage coin toss if there was a tie chose to either play the word or pass to the opponents The contestant giving clues had seconds to describe the word for his her partner and the opposing contestant had three seconds of blackout time with the same repetition penalty as in the first two rounds A correct guess won the game while a miss gave the win to the opposing team br br br Clue Screen br In the Clue Screen round the object was for one team member to guess five subjects within seconds based on the other deciding how many clues to give to him her The giver faced a screen on which the clues were shown while the guesser faced away from it br The clock started when the category for the first subject Place Thing etc was displayed on the screen and the subject was shown to the giver Up to six clues would be shown one every two seconds Once the giver felt that there was enough information on the screen for his her partner to guess he she would say Solve it The guesser then turned to face the screen read all the displayed clues and could offer one guess The host announced whether the guess was correct or incorrect and the guesser turned away from the screen as a new subject was played The contestant won if the team solved five
