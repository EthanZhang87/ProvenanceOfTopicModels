Family Feud is an American television game show created by Mark Goodson Two families compete on each episode to name the most popular answers to survey questions in order to win cash and prizes br The show has had three separate runs the first of which started in Its original run from to aired on ABC and in syndication with Richard Dawson as host In the series was revived as a pilot and later in aired on CBS and in syndication with Ray Combs hosting until with Dawson returning until the latter version ended in In the series was revived through its first run syndication with four different hosts Louie Anderson Richard Karn John O Hurley and Steve Harvey present The show has had four announcers Gene Wood Burton Richardson Joey Fatone and Rubin Ervin present br Within a year of its debut the original version became the number one game show in daytime television however as viewing habits changed the ratings declined Harvey becoming host in increased Nielsen ratings significantly and eventually placed the program among the top three most popular syndicated television shows in the United States Harvey has also surpassed every previous host in tenure br The program has produced multiple regional adaptations in over international markets outside the United States Reruns of episodes hosted by Steve Harvey air on Game Show Network as well as in syndication while reruns of earlier versions air on BUZZR and Pluto TV Aside from television shows there have been also many home editions produced in board game interactive film and video game formats br br br Gameplay br The game features two competing families each represented by five members reduced to four contestants for the season who compete to determine the answers to survey questions The original version of the show began with the families being introduced seated opposite each other as if posing for family portraits after which the host interviewed them br While there is no minimum age to participate in Family Feud as long as at least one member of the family is years of age or older producers recommend that contestants are years of age or older due to the nature of some questions Each round begins with a face off question that serves as a toss up between two opposing contestants The host asks a survey question that was previously posed to a group of people such as Name the hour that you get up on Sunday mornings A certain number of answers are concealed on the board ranked by popularity of the survey s responses Only answers said by at least two people can appear on the board br The first contestant to buzz in gives an answer if it is the most popular his her family immediately wins the face off Otherwise the opponent responds and the family member providing the higher ranked answer wins Ties are broken in favor of the contestant who buzzes in first If neither contestant s answer is on the board the other eight contestants have a chance to respond one at a time from alternating sides until an answer is revealed The family that wins the face off may choose to play the question or pass control to their opponents except on the versions when the family who won the face off automatically gained control of the question br The family with control of the question then tries to win the round by guessing all of the remaining concealed answers with each member giving one answer in sequence Giving an incorrect answer or failing to respond within three seconds earns a strike Three strikes gives their opponents one chance to steal the points for the round by guessing any of the remaining answers Otherwise the points are awarded to the family that originally had control From to the value of the stealing answer was credited to the stealing family If the opponents are given the opportunity to steal the points then only their team s captain is required to answer the question For most of the series this is done after the family confers with each other the only exception was on the series where each family member was polled for an answer with the team captain having the option to either select one of the family s answers or give a different answer Any remaining concealed answers on the board that were not guessed are then revealed br Answers are worth one point for every person in the member survey who gave them The winning family in each round scores the total points for all revealed answers to that question including those given during the face off but excluding the one used to steal The number of answers on the board decreases from round to round and as the game progresses certain rounds are played for double or triple point value br For most of the show s existence the first team to reach or surpass a certain point total won the game The most common goal has been points but there have been exceptions When the original series first premiered the goal was points and for its final year it was increased to points From the debut of the original series until families were awarded per point scored br From to the family with the highest point total after four rounds of play won the game regardless of their score The first three rounds were played as normal rounds In the fourth round the point values were tripled but the families were only allowed one strike if they had control In the rare instance that the family in control was trailing and could not accumulate enough points to potentially overtake the leaders before striking out the game ended without the other family attempting to steal br On the first two series a match continued until a family reached the goal The current series reinstated the point goal in but kept the four round format If neither family has reached points after four rounds one more triple value question is played as a sudden death face off Only the top answer is displayed on the board and the first contestant to buzz in with it wins the points and the game for their team br In the original periodic primetime specials three games were played with the first two ending when a team reaches points For the third game only one question round was played with the winning two celebrity teams from the previous rounds playing br br br Fast Money br At the end of the main game the winning family selects two members to play the show s bonus round known as Fast Money One contestant is onstage with the host while the other is sequestered backstage with headphones so as not to hear or see the first portion of the round The first contestant is asked five rapid fire survey questions and has a set time limit in which to answer them originally seconds extended to in time begins to run only after the first question is asked and the first contestant may pass on a question and return to it after all five have been asked if time remains br After the first contestant has finished answering or run out of time he or she is awarded a point for each person in the survey who gave the same response Once these points are tallied the board is cleared except for the total score and the second contestant is then brought out to answer the same five questions The same rules are followed but the time limit is extended by five seconds originally then extended to in addition if the second contestant duplicates an answer given by the first a buzzer sounds the host says to them Try again and he or she must give another answer If the two contestants manage to reach a combined total of points or more the family wins a cash prize otherwise the family is awarded for each point br The cash prize for winning Fast Money has varied During the ABC and CBS incarnations of the show the top prize was In the original periodic primetime specials each game was followed by a Fast Money round The first two were each worth and the final one was worth The prize money was increased to on the syndicated version until September br In September the prize money was doubled to This initially lasted until September when the Bullseye round returned at the start of the show meaning the total for Fast Money was an adjustable amount between and depending on how much each family won during Bullseye In July however Bullseye was removed and the prize money reverted back to which has remained ever since br br br Returning champions br When Family Feud premiered on ABC network rules dictated how much a family could win Once any family reached they were retired as champions The accompanying syndicated series that premiered in featured two new families each episode because of a then common television syndication practice known as bicycling wherein individual stations sent an episode of a series they had already aired to another station reducing the number of tapes a syndicator had to send out but also ensuring that stations did not air the same episode of a show the same day nor were they assured of airing in a proper sequence br The CBS daytime and syndicated versions which began airing in also featured returning champions who could appear for a maximum of five days For a brief period in the season which aired in syndication there were no returning champions For these episodes two new families competed in this first half of each episode The second half featured former champion families who appeared on Family Feud between and with the winner of the first half of the show playing one of these families in the second half When the champion rule was reinstated the winner of the first half faced the champion family in the second Occasionally two families from the version would play the first half and celebrities would play for charity in the second half br In some cases from to the returning champions continued until they were defeated From to two new families appeared on each episode In returning champions again appeared with the same five day limit In a new car was announced for a family who wins five games in a row This was changed to an additional cash bonus in May br br br Bullseye Bankroll game br In June the CBS daytime edition of Feud expanded from to minutes and became known as the Family Feud Challenge As part of the change a new round was added at the start of each game called Bullseye This round determined the potential Fast Money stake for each team Each team was given a starting value for their bank and attempted to come up with the top answer to a survey question to add to it The Bullseye round was added to the syndicated edition in September which remained minutes and was retitled as the New Family Feud br The first two members of each family appeared at the face off podium and were asked a question to which only the number one answer was available Giving the top answer added the value for that question to the family s bank The process then repeated with the four remaining members from each family On the first half of the daytime version families were staked with The first question was worth with each succeeding question worth more than the previous with the final question worth This allowed for a potential maximum bank of For the second half of the daytime version and also on the syndicated version all values were doubled making the maximum potential bank The team that eventually won the game played for their bank in Fast Money br In with Richard Dawson returning as host the round s name was changed to the Bankroll round Although the goal remained of giving only the number one answer the format was modified to three questions from five with only one member of each family participating for all three questions The initial stake for each family remained the same in the first half of the hour and in the second However the value for each question was and in the first half with values doubling for the second half This meant a potential maximum bank of in the first half and in the second br The Bullseye round returned for the season and was played similarly to the format used from to on the syndicated version Five questions were asked worth from to However each family was given a starting stake which meant a potential maximum of a bank br When Harvey took over as host the Bullseye round was removed and the Fast Money jackpot reverted back to br br br Hosts and announcers br When Family Feud was conceived in Richard Dawson then a regular panelist on the Goodson Todman game show Match Game had a standing agreement with Mark Goodson that when the next Goodson Todman game show was in the planning stages Dawson would be given an audition to host it Dawson had read in trade publications that a pilot for a new show named Family Feud was in the works and it was originally to be hosted by Star Trek actor William Shatner although since they were involved in the run throughs Geoff Edwards and Jack Narz the latter of whom reputedly was Goodson s initial choice to host were under consideration Incensed Dawson sent his agent to Goodson to threaten to present an un funny silent and bland persona on future Match Game episodes if he was not given an audition for Feud br Dawson was then selected as host of the original ABC and first syndicated versions of Family Feud As writer David Marc put it Dawson s on air personality fell somewhere between the brainless sincerity of Wink Martindale and the raunchy cynicism of Chuck Barris Writers Tim Brooks Jon Ellowitz and Earle F Marsh attributed Family Feud s popularity to Dawson s glib familiarity he had previously played Newkirk on Hogan s Heroes and ready wit from his tenure as a panelist on Match Game The show s original announcer was Gene Wood with Johnny Gilbert and Rod Roddy serving as occasional substitutes br In comedian Ray Combs took over Dawson s role as host on CBS and in syndication with Wood returning as announcer and Roddy and Art James serving in that role when Wood was not available Combs hosted the program until the daytime version s cancellation in and the syndicated version until the end of the season Dawson returned to the show at the request of Mark Goodson Productions for the season br When Feud returned to syndication in it was initially hosted by comedian Louie Anderson with Burton Richardson as the new announcer In Richard Karn was selected to take over for Anderson until he was replaced by John O Hurley in In both O Hurley and Richardson departed from the show O Hurley later stated that he left because he was resistant toward the show s decision to emphasize ribald humor and wanted to keep the show family friendly Steve Harvey was later named the new host and began hosting on July Harvey has been hosting the show ever since Announcements were made using a pre recorded track of Joey Fatone s voice which was used on the show until the end of the season Rubin Ervin who has been a member of the production staff as the warmup man for the audience since Harvey took over became the announcer at the start of the season and has retained the role since br In Harvey signed with ABC for the primetime reboot of Celebrity Family Feud with Burton Richardson returning as announcer Harvey has hosted Celebrity Family Feud since while Richardson has announced for Celebrity Family Feud since it began in Richardson was involved with the NBC version of Celebrity Family Feud in and has been announcing for the reboot since its inception br The first four versions of the show were directed by Paul Alter and produced by Howard Felsher and Cathy Dawson For the versions Gary Dawson worked with the show as a third producer and Alter was joined by two other directors Marc Breslow and Andy Felsher The version s main staff include executive producer Gabrielle Johnston co executive producers Kristin Bjorklund Brian Hawley and Sara Dansby and director Ken Fuchs Johnston and Bjorklund previously worked as associate producers of the s version The show s classic theme tune was written by an uncredited Walt Levinsky for Score Productions The theme and cues for the version was written by Edd Kalehoff and are based on the Walt Levinsky composition The themes used from to were written by John Lewis Parker The production rights to the show were originally owned by the production company Goodson shared with his partner Bill Todman but were sold to their current holder Fremantle when it acquired all of Goodson and Todman s format catalog in br br br Broadcast history br br br br br Mark Goodson created Family Feud during the increasing popularity of his earlier game show Match Game which had set daytime ratings records between and and on which Dawson appeared daily as one of its most popular panelists Match Game aired on CBS and by CBS vice president Fred Silverman who had originally commissioned Match Game had moved to a new position as president of ABC The show along with a revised daytime schedule for the summer was first announced by ABC at an annual meeting in May The show premiered on ABC s daytime lineup at p m ET p m CT MT PT on July Because it faced the first halves of two long running and popular soap operas CBS As the World Turns and NBC s Days of Our Lives Feud was not an immediate hit But a timeslot change several months later made it a ratings winner for ABC and it eventually surpassed Match Game to become the highest rated game show on daytime TV br Due to the expansion of All My Children to one hour in April the show was moved to a m as the second part of an hour that had daytime reruns of Happy Days later Laverne Shirley as its lead in When the Dick Clark hosted Pyramid was canceled in June Feud moved a half hour back to noon a m It remained the most popular daytime game show until Merv Griffin s game show Wheel of Fortune propelled by a new highly popular concurrent syndicated evening version surpassed it in From May until May ABC periodically broadcast hour long primetime All Star Specials in which celebrity casts from various primetime TV series mostly ABC ones competed instead of ordinary families The popularity of the program inspired Goodson to consider producing a nighttime edition which launched in syndication on September with Viacom Enterprises as distributor Like many other game shows at the time the nighttime Feud aired once a week it expanded to twice a week in January and finally to five nights a week Monday through Friday in the fall of representing the first time that a weekday network game ran concurrently with a nightly syndicated edition Dawson and Feud coasted for several years at the top seen twice a day in much of the country However the viewing habits of both daytime and syndicated audiences began changing around When Griffin launched Wheel s syndicated version starring Pat Sajak and Vanna White in that show climbed the ratings to the point where it unseated Feud as the highest rated syndicated show even replacing it on some stations the syndicated premiere of Wheel s sister show Jeopardy with Alex Trebek as host also siphoned ratings from Feud with its early and surprising given an unstable first few months success With declining ratings probably due mainly to its overexposure and viewers subsequently tiring of the show and as part of a scheduling reshuffle with two of ABC s half hour soaps the show moved back to the timeslot in October as the second part of a one hour game show block with Trivia Trap later All Star Blitz as its lead in hoping to make a dent in the ratings of The Price Is Right coincidentally another Goodson packaged show br Despite the ratings decline there was some interest in keeping the show in production In a interview with the Archive of American Television Dawson said that Viacom contacted him toward the end of to gauge his interest in continuing his role for the season Although Dawson was still enjoying his work he said that with the grueling taping schedule and having to record two separate daily editions of Family Feud from onward he had spent the equivalent of eleven years working on the show and was growing tired of the grind He said that he was willing to finish whatever commitment he still had to ABC for the daytime series then record thirty nine weeks of episodes of the syndicated series for the season and be done with it br As Dawson recalled he did not hear from anyone for approximately one week He then received a call that Viacom had made the decision not to renew the syndicated series beyond the season Viacom made this official in January ahead of that year s NATPE convention and within a few weeks ABC probably prompted by Viacom s decision decided that it too would not renew Feud for the season The daytime version came to an end on June The final week was taped a month prior on May Newspapers via Associated Press reported that this version was slated to end on June However for reasons undisclosed it ended two weeks prior to that instead The syndicated version aired its last new episode on May with reruns of the final season continuing until September of that year Although first run episodes were no longer airing Viacom offered a best of package of reruns to stations for the season the package was withdrawn from syndication at the end of the season br br br br br Family Feud moved to CBS with Ray Combs hosting the show on July at a m ET a m CT MT PT replacing The Pyramid which had aired continuously in that time slot since September except between January and April when Blackout took its place CBS began development on Family Feud shortly after Blackout was canceled Like its predecessor this version had an accompanying syndicated edition which premiered September and both editions started off well in the ratings br However the landscape in both daytime and first run syndication was changing significantly during this time Networks were starting to move away from game shows in their daytime lineups by the time the Feud revival launched in by the fall of only the daytime Feud and The Price Is Right both airing on CBS were left standing Feud like some others before it was also prone to being preempted by CBS stations who wanted to air more profitable and successful syndicated offerings in the morning br With the ratings for the daytime series at a low point in the producers of Feud instituted the afore mentioned format changes expanded it to an hour and renamed it Family Feud Challenge which saw two families compete in the first half of the hour to face the returning champion family in the second half The changes did not do enough for CBS which publicly announced in November that it would return the AM hour to its affiliates the following fall effectively canceling Feud the Daytime version ended March with reruns continuing to air until September br The syndicated series however remained in production and entered its sixth season in September However the series had also been struggling in the ratings for several years While initially receiving desirable time slots such as the Prime Access slots it had previously enjoyed in some markets it began to lose ground as stations looked elsewhere for programming for example tabloid newsmagazines like A Current Affair Inside Edition Hard Copy and American Journal tended to draw better ratings especially among younger demographics The syndicated series found itself disappearing from some markets while others saw the show relocated to much less desirable time slots such as the overnight hours Ratings had virtually bottomed out during the season and prior to the start of the sixth season All American Television which had acquired the assets of Feud s former syndicator LBS Communications met with the production staff of Feud and told them that the upcoming season would be their last as distributor unless significant changes were made to the production br Meanwhile during the previous season a shakeup had occurred at Mark Goodson Productions Towards the end of company namesake Mark Goodson died of pancreatic cancer His son Jonathan had taken over control of the production company and was now tasked with finding a solution to the ratings decline One of the options considered was a host change with original Feud host Richard Dawson s name being repeatedly mentioned as an option Dawson had largely kept out of the spotlight since the original edition of Feud had left the air in with his only role of note being his turn as Damon Killian in the film The Running Man In the intervening years outside of a failed pilot for a revival of You Bet Your Life Dawson had been living with his most recent wife a former contestant on the series and was raising a child with her He did show some interest in returning however and began talking with Goodson about a return br The decision to attempt to bring back Dawson was a reversal from the decision made when the revival was first proposed Mark Goodson himself had steadfastly refused to consider Dawson for the hosting position due in large part to his behavior and clashes with the production staff when he hosted the original series Many of those same staff members were working on the current series including Felsher with whom Dawson s relationship was particularly acrimonious The elder Goodson also showed significant loyalty toward Combs as host sticking with him despite the show s struggles but with him deceased Dawson signed on to come back to his former position and All American Television renewed the syndicated Feud for the following season Combs was allowed to finish the season and with his final episode he tersely addressed how being displaced made him feel like a loser and brusquely left the studio as the credits rolled Combs committed suicide two years later in part because of the career collapse brought on by the hosting change and the financial ramifications of unemployment br A revamped Family Feud returned for a seventh season in September with a significant number of changes made In addition to Dawson s return and a modernizing of the show s set the Family Feud Challenge format was reinstated as the show expanded to a full hour However the stations that were airing the show had the option to not air the first half of the program and instead simply carry the second half as a standalone half hour Dawson s return brought an initial surge in ratings but it was not sustainable long term and Dawson s and the run s last episode as host aired on May The show continued in reruns until September of that year br br br present br br Family Feud returned in syndication on September with comedian Louie Anderson as the next host Three years later Richard Karn took over the series at which point the format was changed to reintroduce returning champions allowing them to appear for up to five days At the time Anderson hosted episodes continued in reruns that aired on PAX TV Ion Television following his departure Karn hosted the show for four years until he was replaced by John O Hurley in By the show s Nielsen ratings were at putting it in danger of cancellation once again as countless affiliates that carried the show from to aired it in daytime graveyard or other low rated time slots That same year O Hurley left the show after four years and was replaced by Steve Harvey who has hosted the show ever since br Since Harvey took over the show ratings increased by as much as and within two short years the show was rated at and had become the fifth most popular syndicated program Fox News Paulette Cohn argued that Harvey s relatability or understanding of what the people at home want to know was what saved the show from cancellation Harvey himself debated If someone said an answer that was so ridiculous I knew that the people at home behind the camera had to be going What did they just say They gave this answer that doesn t have a shot in hell of being up there The fact that I recognize that that s comedic genius to me I think that s what made the difference br Steve Harvey s Family Feud has regularly ranked among the top highest rated programs in all of daytime television programming and third among game shows behind Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy in February the show achieved a share in the Nielsen ratings with approximately million viewers In June Family Feud eclipsed Wheel of Fortune which had been on top for over years as the most watched syndicated game show on television and consistently began ranking among the top three shows in all of syndication The show has had improved syndication clearances and better timeslots It has been airing in early fringe and prime access slots nationwide br Production of Family

us classic Feud every time citing both Dawson and Combs as hosts Additionally they called Anderson an alleged sexual harasser and full time sphere br Since Harvey became host the show has become notorious for pushing the envelope with questions and responses that are sexual in nature with content frequently referring to certain anatomy or acts of intercourse This type of material has drawn criticism from viewers including former NCIS actress Pauley Perrette who in sent a series of tweets to Family Feud producers questioning why the show had to be so filthy Dan Gainor of the Media Research Center a politically conservative content analysis organization suggested that the responses are in line with sexual content becoming more commonplace on television br The popularity of
