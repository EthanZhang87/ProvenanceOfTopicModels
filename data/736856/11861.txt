In the early modern period the configuration of Sweden s borders made Gothenburg strategically critical as the only Swedish gateway to Skagerrak the North Sea and Atlantic situated on the west coast in a very narrow strip of Swedish territory between Danish Halland in the south and Norwegian Bohusl n in the north After several failed attempts Gothenburg was successfully founded in by King Gustavus Adolphus Gustaf II Adolf br The site of the first church built in Gothenburg subsequently destroyed by Danish invaders is marked by a stone near the north end of the lvsborg Bridge in the F rjen s Park The church was built in and destroyed in The city was heavily influenced by the Dutch Germans and Scots and Dutch planners and engineers were contracted to construct the city as they had the skills needed to drain and build in the marshy areas chosen for the city The town was designed like Dutch cities such as Amsterdam Batavia Jakarta and New Amsterdam Manhattan The planning of the streets and canals of Gothenburg closely resembled that of Jakarta which was built by the Dutch around the same time The Dutchmen initially won political power and it was not until when the last Dutch politician in the city s council died that Swedes acquired political power over Gothenburg During the Dutch period the town followed Dutch town laws and Dutch was proposed as the official language in the town Robust city walls were built during the th century In a decision was made to tear down most of the city s wall The work started in and was carried out by soldiers from the Bohus regiment br

fortunes to set up what later became the Chalmers University of Technology In the Scotsman Alexander Keiller founded the G taverken shipbuilding company that was in business until His son James Keiller donated Keiller Park to the city in br The Gothenburg coat of arms was based on the lion of the coat of arms of Sweden symbolically holding a shield with the national emblem the Three Crowns to defend the city against its enemies br In the Treaty of Roskilde Denmark Norway ceded the Danish province of Halland in the south and the Norwegian province of Bohus County or Bohusl n in the north which left Gothenburg less exposed Gothenburg grew into a significant port and trade centre on the west coast because it was the only city on the west coast that along with Marstrand was granted the
