Marine automobile engines are types of automobile petrol or diesel engines that have been specifically modified for use in the marine environment The differences include changes made for the operating in a marine environment safety performance and for regulatory requirements The act of modifying is called marinisation br br br Background br All of the Big American auto companies have had engines marinised at some point Chrysler is notable because the company marinised engines in house through Chrysler Marine as well as selling engines to third parties such as Indmar or Pleasurecraft Marine br General Motors marine automobile engines are based on a gasoline truck engine That means four bolt main bearing caps instead of just two sometimes the crankshaft is forged steel and the pistons an upgraded aluminum alloy Most importantly the camshaft profile is different with the overlap ground to degrees instead of Expansion plugs are bronze to better fight corrosion The head gasket s metal O ring is also more corrosion resistant br br Examples of the opposite of a marinised car engine also exist e g the or liter Detroit Diesel V engine found in Chevrolet and GMC utility vehicles was originally a marine engine adapted for automotive use br br br Safety modifications br br br Electrical systems br Starter motors and alternators have internal screens to minimize spark egress br br br Fuel systems petrol gasoline engines br Fuel pumps are constructed such that if their diaphragm ruptures the excess fuel will be directed into the carburettor br Carburetors do not allow overflow into the boat engine compartment br Spark arrestor are installed on the engine s air intake carburetor or electronic fuel injector The arrestor is a wire mesh screen that cools any internal flame or spark created by back fire preventing it from igniting fuel vapours inside the engine compartment br br br Fuel systems diesel engines br br br Cooling systems br Engines are water cooled drawing raw water through a pickup at the bottom of the boat In an open cooling configuration the raw water is circulated directly through the engine and exits after passing through jackets around the exhaust manifolds while in a closed cooling configuration anti freeze circulates through the engine and raw water is pumped into a heat exchanger In both cases hot water is released into the exhaust system and blown out with the engine exhaust gasses br The transmission oil cooler is cooled by raw water br br br Performance modifications br br br Distribution br The distributor does not have a vacuum advance Vacuum advances are normally actuated at high rpm low load situations which rarely occur in the marine environment under normal operation a high rpm generally means a high engine load br br br Lubrication br Lubricating oil is cooled in a shell and tube type heat exchanger by raw water br The oil sump is bigger and often has a different shape so as not to affect the boat s stability br br br br br br External links br https trincamarine com marine transmission br from the U S Coast Guard br br Marine Diesel Engines from Volkswagen Marine
