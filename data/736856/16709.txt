The krona Swedish kr na plural kronor sign kr code SEK is the currency of the Kingdom of Sweden It is one of the currencies of the European Union Both the ISO code SEK and currency sign kr are in common use for the krona the former precedes or follows the value the latter usually follows it but especially in the past it sometimes preceded the value In English the currency is sometimes referred to as the Swedish crown as krona means crown in Swedish The Swedish krona was the ninth most traded currency in the world by value in April br One krona is subdivided into re singular plural re or ren where the former is always used after a cardinal number hence re but otherwise the latter is often preferred in contemporary speech Coins as small as re were formerly in use but the last coin smaller than krona was discontinued in Goods can still be priced in re but all sums are rounded to the nearest krona when paying with cash The word re is ultimately derived from the Latin word for gold aurum br br br History br The introduction of the krona which replaced the riksdaler at par was a result of the Scandinavian Monetary Union which came into effect in and lasted until the beginning of World War I The parties to the union were the Scandinavian countries where the name was krona in Sweden and krone in Denmark and Norway which in English literally means crown The three currencies were on the gold standard with the krona krone defined as of a kilogram of pure gold br The mutual equivalence of all three currencies ended in World War I when their convertibility to gold was suspended While their gold parities remained during most of the interwar period these currencies were generally quoted at varying market rates br br br Coins br br br Contemporary br On September the Riksbank announced a new series of coins with new sizes to replace the krona and kronor coins the new coins arrived in October The design of the coins follows the theme of singer songwriter Ted G rdestad s song Sol vind och vatten English Sun wind and water with the designs depicting the elements on the reverse side of the coins This also included the reintroduction of the kronor coin while the current kronor coin remained the same The new coins also have a new portrait of the king in their design One of the reasons for a new series of coins was to end the use of nickel for allergy reasons Vending machines and parking meters have to a fairly high degree stopped accepting coins and accept only bank cards or mobile phone payments br br br History br br Between and coins in denominations of and re and and kronor were introduced The and re were in bronze the re and krona and kronor were in silver and the and kronor were in gold Gold kronor coins were added in br In the Scandinavian Monetary Union currency was fixed so that kronor purchased kg of gold In the price of gold is kronor per kg So one re in bought as much gold as kronor in So if it is reasonable to have the smallest denomination coin krona today in a reasonable smallest denomination coin was re A kr gold coin weighed grams with fineness so that the fine weight was grams or exactly th of a kilogram br In production of gold coins ceased and was briefly restarted in and before ceasing entirely Due to metal shortages during World War I iron replaced bronze between and Nickel bronze replaced silver in the and re in with silver returning in br Metal shortages due to World War II again led to changes in the Swedish coinage Between and the nickel bronze and re were again issued In iron again replaced bronze until and the silver content of the other coins was reduced In cupronickel replaced silver in the re re and re coins br In the kronor switched to cupronickel and the krona switched to cupronickel clad copper it was replaced entirely by cupronickel in Nonetheless all previous mintages of the krona since and kronor since were still legal tender until though kronor coins were extremely rarely seen in circulation as they have not been issued since The kronor coins contained silver until which meant they had been for several years worth much more than face value so most have been bought and melted down by arbitrageurs and the rest are kept by collectors br br In and kronor silver coins were produced with designs similar to contemporary krona and kronor coins In a new smaller kronor coin was introduced struck in cupronickel clad nickel The current design has been produced since kronor coins minted since are legal tender but tend to be kept by collectors for their silver content br The royal motto of the monarch is also inscribed on many of the coins A new kronor coin was designed in at a time when there were political efforts to abandon the monarchy and the young inexperienced king The monarchy remained but the kronor was not given a portrait Coins minted before have the same size but contain the portrait of King Gustav VI Adolf and his royal motto br Cash rounding Swedish resavrundning commonly called Swedish rounding is a legally enforced method of rounding off change up or down to the nearest unit of physical currency while retaining the re as pricing and accounting unit It was required in conjunction with the phaseout of smaller coins as follows br br and re phased out change rounded to nearest re br and re phased out change rounded to nearest re br re phased out change rounded to nearest re br re phased out change rounded to nearest krona br In the kronor coin ceased production In the sizes of the re and kronor coins were reduced br In aluminium brass Nordic gold kronor coins were introduced previous kronor coins are not legal tender In the same year bronze coloured re coins were introduced br On December the Riksbank announced a proposal to phase out the re the final re coin by The re would still remain a subdivision unit for electronic payments The reasons may have included low purchasing power higher production and distribution cost than the value and the coins cannot be used in most parking machines and vending machines On March the Riksdag formally decided to enact the law to abolish re coins as legal tender Under that law the final date payments could be made with re coins was September Remaining re coins could be exchanged at banks until the end of March br After the launch of the current coin series in all the old kronor coins have been invalid since They cannot be used for payments nor can they be exchanged for legal tender at any bank and are instead instructed to be recycled as metal br Jubilee and commemorative coins have been minted and those since are also legal tender br br br Banknotes br br br Contemporary br br br History br br In notes were introduced by the Riksbank in denominations of krona and and kronor The krona was only initially issued for two years although it reappeared between and In and kronor notes were issued br Production of the kronor note ceased in although a coin had been issued since With the introduction of a krona coin in production of kronor notes ceased and a kronor note was introduced br All remaining one krona banknotes became invalid after December All remaining five krona and ten krona banknotes became invalid after December br An exhaustive list of every banknote design since is not included but the following five designs were or will be retired in The oldest design began to be printed in br A kronor banknote a new denomination was printed with a portrait of the writer Selma Lagerl f and on the reverse was an engraved interpretation of a passage from the book The Wonderful Adventures of Nils The banknote became invalid after December A more secure version with the same portrait was printed from to and became

Swedish engineering These banknotes became invalid on December A kronor banknote red but without foil strips with the same portrait was printed This banknote became invalid after December A more secure version with the same portrait was introduced in and became invalid after June The banknote had some controversy in because of the executions of Snapphane guerrilla warriors that King Charles XI ordered br The first two designs of kronor banknotes printed from to and became invalid on December The third design with portrait of King Charles XIV John and J ns Jacob Berzelius printed and declared invalid on December In preparation for retirement of the kronor banknotes a new kronor banknotes of the th design without foil strips was printed from to with a portrait of Gustav Vasa and on the reverse a harvest picture from Olaus Magnus s Description of the Northern Peoples from Circulation peaked at over million in br On March the Riksbank introduced a new more secure kronor banknote with the same portrait and the Riksbank became the first central bank in the world to use the security feature of MOTION a moving image in the striped band on the new kronor banknote When the banknote is tilted the picture in the striped band appears to move The Vasa banknote without security thread became invalid after December at which time there was only million in circulation The Vasa banknotes with the security thread became invalid after June at which time there was under million in circulation Replacement banknotes featuring Dag Hammarskj ld became valid on October but were circulated in considerably fewer quantities less than million thus reducing the supply of cash in Sweden br The krona banknote was always printed in small quantities as it was one of the most valuable banknotes in the world The first design featuring the Head of Mercury was printed in and became invalid after December The second design was printed and featured a portrait of Gustav VI Adolf and became invalid after December br Invalid banknotes can be redeemed via the Riksbank with an administration fee of kronor br br br series br On April the Riksbank announced the names of the persons whose portraits

brown br On April the Riksbank announced the base for the new designs of the banknotes based on G ran sterlund s entry titled Cultural Journey br The first banknotes the and krona were issued on October with the other two notes the and krona to follow on October br br br kr banknote controversy br Opera singer Malena Ernman has criticized the Riksbank for choosing a design where Birgit Nilsson has been depicted performing Die Walk re by Richard Wagner She pointed out that it was very inappropriate to include something by Wagner whose works were associated with Nazi Germany in a time of increasing problems with antisemitism in Sweden Wagner died long before the Nazi era and the association is that Hitler liked his music The Riksbank replied saying that it is unfortunate that the choice of design is seen as negative and stated that it is not going to be changed br Dagens Nyheter journalist Bj rn Wiman went further in his criticism condemning the Riksbank for selecting Nilsson at all for the kronor banknote He brings up an example from Nilsson s autobiography where she described Mauritz Rosengarten from Decca using antisemitic jokes about greed br br br Exchange rate br br To see where Swedish krona ranks in most traded currencies read the article on the Foreign exchange market br The exchange rate of the Swedish krona against other currencies has historically been dependent on the monetary policy pursued by Sweden at the time Since the Swedish banking rescue a managed float regimen has been upheld br The weakest the krona has been relative to the euro was March when one euro bought SEK The strongest the krona has been relative to the euro was on August when one euro bought SEK The weakness in the euro was due to the crisis in Greece which began in July and fear of further spreading to Italy and Spain The average exchange rate since the beginning of when the euro banknote and coins were issued and March was SEK EUR br br br Relationship to the euro br br According to the accession treaty effective January Sweden is required to join the eurozone and therefore must convert to the euro once the convergence criteria are met Notwithstanding this on September a consultative Swedish referendum was held on the euro in which of voters were opposed to the adoption of the currency out of an overall turnout of The Swedish government has argued such a course of action is possible since one of the requirements for eurozone membership is a prior two year membership of the ERM II By simply not joining the exchange rate mechanism the Swedish government is provided a formal loophole avoiding the theoretical requirement of adopting the euro br Some of Sweden s major parties continue to believe it would be in the national interest to join but all parties have pledged to abide by the results of the referendum and none have shown any interest in raising the issue again There was an agreement among the parties not to discuss the issue before the general election In a poll from May were in favour while were against and were uncertain br In February Fredrik Reinfeldt the prime minister of Sweden stated that a new referendum on the euro issue will not be held until support is gained from the people and all the major parties Therefore the timing is now at the discretion of the Social Democrats He added the request of Mona Sahlin former leader of the Social Democratic Party for deferral of a new referendum until after the mandate period should be respected br As of support for Swedish membership of the euro among the general population is low In September support fell as low as The only party in the Riksdag that supports Swedish entry in the euro as of is the Liberal Party br br br Banknotes and coins per capita in circulation br Sweden is a wealthy country and in the s and s the value of banknotes and coins per capita was one of the highest in the world In the largest banknote worth kr that was in circulation since was declared invalid and no longer was legal tender For a discussion of the financial and banking crisis that hit Sweden in the early s see the article History of Sweden present and Swedish banking rescue br Unlike the United States which by policy never declares issued money invalid Sweden and most other European countries have a date when older series of banknotes or older coin designs are invalid and are no longer legal tender Invalid old banknotes of any age can however be deposited in the Riksbank and the value be sent to a bank account br From the years to banknotes and coins were circulated at a near constant level of around krona per capita but in a modified krona banknote with a motion security strip was produced Within seven years the banknotes without the strip were declared invalid leaving only a radically reduced number of banknotes with foil valid The Vasa krona banknote without the foil strip became invalid after December and the pieces with the foil strip are invalid after June Also the Swish mobile payment system was established in Sweden in and become a popular alternative to cash payments br Although many countries are performing larger and larger share of transactions by electronic means Sweden is unique in that it is also reducing its cash in circulation by a significant percentage According to Bank for International Settlements the last year Sweden was surpassed in cash on a per capita basis converted to United States dollars by the US in the Euro Area in Australia in Canada in United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia in South Korea in Russia in and Mexico in As of Sweden was still circulating more cash per person converted to USD than Argentina Brazil Turkey India Indonesia and South Africa br The tables show the value of the banknotes and coins per capita for participating countries on Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures CPMI Local currency is converted to US dollars using end of the year rates br br The circulation levels in the table above were reported to the Bank for International Settlements Possible discrepancies with these statistics and other sources may be because some sources exclude commemorative banknotes and coins of total for Sweden in and other sources exclude banknotes and coin held by banks of total for Sweden in as opposed banknotes and coin in circulation outside banks br Circulation levels of cash on a per capita basis are reduced by from the high in compared to Speculation about Sweden declaring all banknotes and coins invalid at some future date is widespread in the media with Bj rn Ulvaeus as a celebrity advocate of a cashless Sweden which he believes will result in a safer society because simple robbery will involve stealing goods that must be fenced br The value of the payments between households companies and authorities in Sweden amounts to about kronor annual per capita in cash In shops almost one in seven payments is made in cash More than half of the adult population has the Swish payment app Annual withdrawals from Swedish ATMs in amount to kronor per capita According to Skingsley what some consumers smaller companies and local clubs often see as a problem is not so much getting hold of cash but being able to deposit it in a bank account br To see how circulation of the Swedish krona ranks compared to other currencies see Bank for International Settlements Red Books br br br The e krona br The e krona electronic krona is a proposed electronic currency to be issued directly by the Riksbank It is different from the electronic transfers using commercial bank money as central bank money has no nominal credit risk as it stands for a claim on the central bank which cannot go bankrupt at least not for debts in Swedish krona br The declining use of cash in Sweden is going to be reinforced cyclically As more businesses find that they can function without accepting cash the number of businesses refusing to accept cash will increase That will re enforce the need for more and more citizens to get the Swish app which is already used by half the population Cash machines which are controlled by a Swedish bank consortium are being dismantled by the hundreds especially in rural areas br The Riksbank has not taken a decision on issuing e krona First the Riksbank needs to investigate a number of technical legal and practical issues The declining use of cash in Sweden means that this is more of a burning issue for us than for most other central banks Although it may appear simple at first glance to issue e krona this is something entirely new for a central bank and there is no precedent to follow If the Riksbank chooses to issue e krona it is not to replace cash but to act as a complement to it The Riksbank will continue issuing banknotes and coins as long as there is demand for them in society It is our statutory duty and we will of course continue to live up to it concluded Deputy Governor Cecilia Skingsley br In December Sweden s Minister for Financial Markets Per Bolund announced a government review to explore the feasibility of moving to a digital currency that was expected to be completed by the end of November in Anna Kinberg Batra a former chairwoman of the Riksbank s finance committee was announced as the leader of the review As of no decision has been made br br br See also br br br br br br
