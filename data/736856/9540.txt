Electricity generation is the process of generating electric power from sources of primary energy For utilities in the electric power industry it is the stage prior to its delivery transmission distribution etc to end users or its storage using for example the pumped storage method br Usable electricity is not freely available in nature so it must be produced transforming other forms of energy to electricity Production is carried out in power stations also called power plants Electricity is most often generated at a power plant by electromechanical generators primarily driven by heat engines fueled by combustion or nuclear fission but also by other means such as the kinetic energy of flowing water and wind Other energy sources include solar photovoltaics and geothermal power There are exotic and speculative methods to recover energy such as proposed fusion reactor designs which aim to directly extract energy from intense magnetic fields generated by fast moving charged particles generated by the fusion reaction see magnetohydrodynamics br Phasing out coal fired power stations and eventually gas fired power stations or if practical capturing their greenhouse gas emissions is an important part of the energy transformation required to limit climate change Vastly more solar power and wind power is forecast to be required with electricity demand increasing strongly with further electrification of transport homes and industry However in it was reported that the global electricity supply was approaching peak CO emissions thanks to the growth of solar and wind power br br br History br br The fundamental principles of electricity generation were discovered in the s and early s by British scientist Michael Faraday His method still used today is for electricity to be generated by the movement of a loop of wire or Faraday disc between the poles of a magnet Central power stations became economically practical with the development of alternating current AC power transmission using power transformers to transmit power at high voltage and with low loss br Commercial electricity production started with the coupling of the dynamo to the hydraulic turbine The mechanical production of electric power began the Second Industrial Revolution and made possible several inventions using electricity with the major contributors being Thomas Alva Edison and Nikola Tesla Previously the only way to produce electricity was by chemical reactions or using battery cells and the only practical use of electricity was for the telegraph br Electricity generation at central power stations started in when a steam engine driving a dynamo at Pearl Street Station produced a DC current that powered public lighting on Pearl Street New York The new technology was quickly adopted by many cities around the world which adapted their gas fueled street lights to electric power Soon after electric lights would be used in public buildings in businesses and to power public transport such as trams and trains br The first power plants used water power or coal Today a variety of energy sources are used such as coal nuclear natural gas hydroelectric wind and oil as well as solar energy tidal power and geothermal sources br In the s the popularity of electricity grew massively with the introduction of the Incandescent light bulb Although there are recognised inventors of the light bulb prior to Joseph Swan and Thomas Edison Edison and Swan s invention became by far the most successful and popular of all During the early years of the th century massive jumps in electrical sciences were made And by the later th century the advancement of electrical technology and engineering led to electricity being part of everyday life With the introduction of many electrical inventions and their implementation into everyday life the demand for electricity within homes grew dramatically With this increase in demand the potential for profit was seen by many entrepreneurs who began investing into electrical systems to eventually create the first electricity public utilities This process in history is often described as electrification br The earliest distribution of electricity came from companies operating independently of one another A consumer would purchase electricity from a producer and the producer would distribute it through their own power grid As technology improved so did the productivity and efficiency of its generation Inventions such as the steam turbine had a massive impact on the efficiency of electrical generation but also the economics of generation as well This conversion of heat energy into mechanical work was similar to that of steam engines however at a significantly larger scale and far more productively The improvements of these large scale generation plants were critical to the process of centralised generation as they would become vital to the entire power system that we now use today br Throughout the middle of the th century many utilities began merging their distribution networks due to economic and efficiency benefits Along with the invention of long distance power transmission the coordination of power plants began to form This system was then secured by regional system operators to ensure stability and reliability The electrification of homes began in Northern Europe and in the Northern America in the s in large cities and urban areas It was not until the s that rural areas saw the large scale establishment of electrification br br br Methods of generation br br Several fundamental methods exist to convert other forms of energy into electrical energy Utility scale generation is achieved by rotating electric generators or by photovoltaic systems A small proportion of electric power distributed by utilities is provided by batteries Other forms of electricity generation used in niche applications include the triboelectric effect the piezoelectric effect the thermoelectric effect and betavoltaics br br br Generators br br Electric generators transform kinetic energy into electricity This is the most used form for generating electricity and is based on Faraday s law It can be seen experimentally by rotating a magnet within closed loops of conducting material e g copper wire Almost all commercial electrical generation is done using electromagnetic induction in which mechanical energy forces a generator to rotate br br br Electrochemistry br br Electrochemistry is the direct transformation of chemical energy into electricity as in a battery Electrochemical electricity generation is important in portable and mobile applications Currently most electrochemical power comes from batteries Primary cells such as the common zinc carbon batteries act as power sources directly but secondary cells i e rechargeable batteries are used for storage systems rather than primary generation systems Open electrochemical systems known as fuel cells can be used to extract power either from natural fuels or from synthesized fuels Osmotic power is a possibility at places where salt and fresh water merge br br br Photovoltaic effect br The photovoltaic effect is the transformation of light into electrical energy as in solar cells Photovoltaic panels convert sunlight directly to DC electricity Power inverters can then convert that to AC electricity if needed Although sunlight is free and abundant solar power electricity is still usually more expensive to produce than large scale mechanically generated power due to the cost of the panels Low efficiency silicon solar cells have been decreasing in cost and multijunction cells with close to conversion efficiency are now commercially available Over efficiency has been demonstrated in experimental systems br Until recently photovoltaics were most commonly used in remote sites where there is no access to a commercial power grid or as a supplemental electricity source for individual homes and businesses Recent advances in manufacturing efficiency and photovoltaic technology combined with subsidies driven by environmental concerns have dramatically accelerated the deployment of solar panels Installed capacity is growing by around per year led by increases in Germany Japan United States China and India br br br Economics br br The selection of electricity production modes and their economic viability varies in accordance with demand and region The economics vary considerably around the world resulting in widespread residential selling prices Hydroelectric plants nuclear power plants thermal power plants and renewable sources have their own pros and cons and selection is based upon the local power requirement and the fluctuations in demand br All power grids have varying loads on them The daily minimum is the base load often supplied by plants which run continuously Nuclear coal oil gas and some hydro plants can supply base load If well construction costs for natural gas are below per MWh generating electricity from natural gas is cheaper than generating power by burning coal br Nuclear power plants can produce a huge amount of power from a single unit However nuclear disasters have raised concerns over the safety of nuclear power and the capital cost of nuclear plants is very high br Hydroelectric power plants are located in areas where the potential energy from falling water can be harnessed for moving turbines and the generation of power It may not be an economically viable single source of production where the ability to store the flow of water is limited and the load varies too much during the annual production cycle br br br Generating equipment br br Electric generators were known in simple forms from the discovery of electromagnetic induction in the s In general some form of prime mover such as an engine or the turbines described above drives a rotating magnetic field past stationary coils of wire thereby turning mechanical energy into electricity The only commercial scale forms of electricity production that do not employ a generator are photovoltaic solar and fuel cells br br br Turbines br br Almost all commercial electrical power on Earth is generated with a turbine driven by wind water steam or burning gas The turbine drives a generator thus transforming its mechanical energy into electrical energy by electromagnetic induction There are many different methods of developing mechanical energy including heat engines hydro wind and tidal power Most electric generation is driven by heat engines br The combustion of fossil fuels supplies most of the energy to these engines with a significant fraction from nuclear fission and some from renewable sources The modern steam turbine invented by Sir Charles Parsons in currently generates about of the electric power in the world using a variety of heat sources Turbine types include br br Steam br Water is boiled by coal burned in a thermal power plant About of all electricity is generated this way br Nuclear fission heat created in a nuclear reactor creates steam Less than of electricity is generated this way br Renewable energy The steam is generated by biomass solar thermal energy or geothermal power br Natural gas turbines are driven directly by gases produced by combustion Combined cycle are driven by both steam and natural gas They generate power by burning natural gas in a gas turbine and use residual heat to generate steam At least of the world s electricity is generated by natural gas br Water Energy is captured by a water turbine from the movement of water from falling water the rise and fall of tides or ocean thermal currents see ocean thermal energy conversion Currently hydroelectric plants provide approximately of the world s electricity br The windmill was a very early wind turbine In around of the world s electricity was produced from wind br Turbines can also use other heat transfer liquids than steam Supercritical carbon dioxide based cycles can provide higher conversion efficiency due to faster heat exchange higher energy density and simpler power cycle infrastructure Supercritical carbon dioxide blends that are currently in development can further increase efficiency by optimizing its critical pressure and temperature points br Although turbines are most common in commercial power generation smaller generators can be powered by gasoline or diesel engines These may used for backup generation or as a prime source of power within isolated villages br br br World production br br Total world generation in was TWh including coal gas hydro nuclear wind solar oil and other fossil fuels biomass and geothermal and other renewables br br br Production by country br br China produced a third of the world s electricity in largely from coal The United States produces half as much as China but uses far more natural gas and nuclear br br br Environmental concerns br br Variations between countries generating electrical power affect concerns about the environment In France only of electricity is generated from fossil fuels the US is higher at and China is at The cleanliness of electricity depends on its source Methane leaks from natural gas to fuel gas fired power plants and carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel based electricity generation account for a significant portion of world greenhouse gas emissions In the United States fossil fuel combustion for electric power generation is responsible for of all emissions of sulfur dioxide the main component of acid rain Electricity generation is the fourth highest combined source of NOx carbon monoxide and particulate matter in the US br According to the International Energy Agency IEA low carbon electricity generation needs to account for of global electrical output by in order to ward off the worst effects of climate change Like other organizations including the Energy Impact Center EIC and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe UNECE the IEA has called for the expansion of nuclear and renewable energy to meet that objective Some like EIC founder Bret Kugelmass believe that nuclear power is the primary method for decarbonizing electricity generation because it can also power direct air capture that removes existing carbon emissions from the atmosphere Nuclear power plants can also create district heating and desalination projects limiting carbon emissions and the need for expanded electrical output br A fundamental issue regarding centralised generation and the current electrical generation methods in use today is the significant negative environmental effects that many of the generation processes have Processes such as coal and gas not only release carbon dioxide as they combust but their extraction from the ground also impacts the environment Open pit coal mines use large areas of land to extract coal and limit the potential for productive land use after the excavation Natural gas extraction releases large amounts of methane into the atmosphere when extracted from the ground greatly increase global greenhouse gases Although nuclear power plants do not release carbon dioxide through electricity generation there are risks associated with nuclear waste and safety concerns associated with the use of nuclear sources br Per unit of electricity generated coal and gas fired power life cycle greenhouse gas emissions are almost always at least ten times that of other generation methods br br br Centralised and distributed generation br Centralised generation is electricity generation by large scale centralised facilities sent through transmission lines to consumers These facilities are usually located far away from consumers and distribute the electricity through high voltage transmission lines to a substation where it is then distributed to consumers the basic concept being that multi megawatt or gigawatt scale large stations create electricity for a large number of people The vast majority of electricity used is created from centralised generation Most centralised power generation comes from large power plants run by fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas though nuclear or large hydroelectricity plants are also commonly used br Centralised generation is fundamentally the opposite of distributed generation Distributed generation is the small scale generation of electricity to smaller groups of consumers This can also include independently producing electricity by either solar or wind power In recent years distributed generation as has seen a spark in popularity due to its propensity to use renewable energy generation methods such as rooftop solar br br br Technologies br Centralised energy sources are large power plants that produce huge amounts of electricity to a large number of consumers Most power plants used in centralised generation are thermal power plants meaning that they use a fuel to heat steam to produce a pressurised gas which in turn spins a turbine and generates electricity This is the traditional way of producing energy This process relies on several forms of technology to produce widespread electricity these being natural coal gas and nuclear forms of thermal generation More recently solar and wind have become large scale br br br Solar br br br Wind br br br Coal br br br Natural gas br Natural gas is ignited to create pressurised gas which is used to spin turbines to generate electricity Natural gas plants use a gas turbine where natural gas is added along with oxygen which in turn combusts and expands through the turbine to force a generator to spin br Natural gas power plants are more efficient than coal power generation they however contribute to climate change but not as highly as coal generation Not only do they produce carbon dioxide from the ignition of natural gas the extraction of gas when mined releases a significant amount of methane into the atmosphere br br br Nuclear br Nuclear power plants create electricity through steam turbines where the heat input is from the process of nuclear fission Currently nuclear power produces of all electricity in the world Most nuclear reactors use uranium as a source of fuel In a process called nuclear fission energy in the form of heat is released when nuclear atoms are split Electricity is created through the use of a nuclear reactor where heat produced by nuclear fission is used to produce steam which in turn spins turbines and powers the generators Although there are several types of nuclear reactors all fundamentally use this process br Normal emissions due to nuclear power plants are primarily waste heat and radioactive spent fuel In a reactor accident significant amounts of radioisotopes can be released to the environment posing a long term hazard to life This hazard has been a continuing concern of environmentalists Accidents such as the Three Mile Island accident Chernobyl disaster and the Fukushima nuclear disaster illustrate this problem br br br Electricity generation capacity by country br br The table lists countries with their total electricity capacities The data is from br According to the Energy Information Administration the total global electricity capacity in was nearly terawatt TW more than four times the total global electricity capacity in The global average per capita electricity capacity was about watts in nearly two and a half times the global average per capita electricity capacity in br Iceland has the highest installed capacity per capita in the world at about watts All developed countries have an average per capita electricity capacity above the global average per capita electricity capacity with the United Kingdom
