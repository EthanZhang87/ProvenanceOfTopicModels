An engine generator is the combination of an electrical generator and an engine prime mover mounted together to form a single piece of equipment This combination is also called an engine generator set or a gen set In many contexts the engine is taken for granted and the combined unit is simply called a generator An engine generator may be a fixed installation part of a vehicle or made small enough to be portable br br br Components br In addition to the engine and generator engine generators generally include a fuel supply a constant engine speed regulator governor in diesel and a generator voltage regulator cooling and exhaust systems and lubrication system Units larger than about kW rating often have a battery and electric starter motor very large units may start with compressed air supplied either to an air driven starter motor or introduced directly to the engine cylinders to initiate engine rotation Standby power generating units often include an automatic starting system and a transfer switch to disconnect the load from the utility power source when there is a power failure and connect it to the generator br br br Types br Engine generators are available in a wide range of power ratings These include small hand portable units that can supply several hundred watts of power hand cart mounted units that can supply several thousand watts and stationary or trailer mounted units that can supply over a million watts Regardless of the size generators may run on gasoline diesel natural gas propane bio diesel water sewage gas or hydrogen Most of the smaller units are built to use gasoline petrol as a fuel and the larger ones have various fuel types including diesel natural gas and propane liquid or gas Some engines may also operate on diesel and gas simultaneously bi fuel operation br br br Engines br Many engine generators use a reciprocating engine with fuels mentioned above This can be a steam engine such as most coal powered fossil fuel power plants use Some engine generators use a turbine as the engine such as the industrial gas turbines used in peaking power plants and the microturbines used in some hybrid electric buses br The generator voltage volts frequency Hz and power watts ratings are selected to suit the load that will be connected Portable engine generators may require an external power conditioner to safely operate some types of electronic equipment br Engine driven generators fueled on natural gas fuel often form the heart of small scale less than kW combined heat and power installations br br br Three phase br There are only a few portable three phase generator models available in the US Most of the portable units available are single phase generators and most of the three phase generators manufactured are large industrial type generators In other countries where three phase power is more common in households portable generators are available from a few kW and upwards br br br Inverter generator br Small portable generators may use an inverter Inverter models can run at slower RPMs to generate the power that is necessary thus reducing the noise of the engine and making it more fuel efficient Inverter generators are best to power sensitive electronic devices such as computers and lights that use a ballast as they have a low total harmonic distortion br Since the load on the electric generator causes the speed of the engine to fall this has an adverse effect on the frequency and voltage of the electrical output By using an electronic inverter to produce the required AC output its voltage and frequency can be stable over the power range of the generator br Another advantage is that the generated electric power from the engine driven generator can be a polyphase output at a higher frequency and at a waveform more suitable for rectification to produce the DC to feed the inverter This reduces the weight and size of the unit br A typical modern inverter generator produces kVA and weighs kg making it convenient for handling by one person br br br Mid size stationary engine generator br br The mid size stationary engine generator pictured here is a kVA set which produces V at around A It is powered by a liter turbocharged Perkins Phaser Series engine and consumes approximately liters of fuel an hour on a liter tank Diesel engines in the UK can run on red diesel and rotate at or rpm This produces power at Hz which is the frequency used in Europe In regions where the frequency is Hz such as in North America generators rotate at rpm or another divisor of Diesel engine generator sets operated at their peak efficiency point can produce between and kilowatt hours of electrical energy for each liter of diesel fuel consumed with lower efficiency at partial loads br br br Large scale generator sets br Many generators produce enough kilowatts to power anything from a business to a full sized hospital These units are particularly useful in providing backup power solutions for companies which have serious economic costs associated with a shutdown caused by an unplanned power outage For example a hospital is in constant need of electricity because several life preserving medical devices run on electricity like ventilators br A very common use is a railway diesel electric locomotive some units having over hp kW br Large generators are also used on board ships that utilize a diesel electric powertrain Voltages and frequencies may vary in different installations br br br Applications br br Engine generators are used to provide electrical power in areas where utility central station electricity is unavailable or where electricity is only needed temporarily Small generators are sometimes used to provide electricity to power tools at construction sites br Trailer mounted generators supply temporary installations of lighting sound amplification systems amusement rides etc A wattage chart can be used to calculate the estimated power usage for different types of equipment to determine how many watts are necessary for a portable generator br Trailer mounted generators or mobile generators diesel generators are also used for emergencies or backup where either a redundant system is required or no generator is on site To make the hookup faster and safer a tie in panel is frequently installed near the building switchgear that contains connectors such as camlocks The tie in panel may also contain a phase rotation indicator for phase systems and a circuit breaker Camlock connectors are rated for amps up to volt systems and used with type W cable connecting to the generator Tie in panel designs are common between and amp applications br Standby electrical generators are permanently installed and used to immediately provide electricity to critical loads during temporary interruptions of the utility power supply Hospitals communications service installations data processing centers sewage pumping stations and many other important facilities are equipped with standby power generators Some standby power generators can automatically detect the loss of grid power start the motor run using fuel from a natural gas line detect when grid power is restored and then turn itself off with no human interaction br Privately owned generators are especially popular in areas where grid power is undependable or unavailable Trailer mounted generators can be towed to disaster areas where grid power has been temporarily disrupted br br br Safety br br Every year incorrectly used portable generators result in deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning A kW portable generator will generate the same amount of carbon monoxide as six cars which can quickly build up to fatal levels if the generator has been placed indoors Using portable generators in garages or near open windows or air conditioning vents can also result in carbon monoxide poisoning br Additionally it is important to prevent backfeeding when using a portable engine generator which can harm utility workers or people in other buildings Before turning on a diesel or gasoline powered generator users should make sure that the main breaker is in the off position to ensure that the electric current does not reverse br Exhausting extremely hot flue gases from gen sets can be done by factory built positive pressure chimneys certified to UL test standard or general utility schedule black iron pipe It is recommended to use insulation to reduce pipe skin temperature and reduce excessive heat gain into the mechanical room There are also excessive pressure relief valves available to relieve the pressure from potential backfires and to maintain the integrity of the exhaust pipe br br br See also br br br br br br External links br br CDC
