Petroleum or crude oil also referred to as simply oil is a naturally occurring yellowish black liquid mixture of mainly hydrocarbons and is found in geological formations The name petroleum covers both naturally occurring unprocessed crude oil and petroleum products that consist of refined crude oil br Petroleum is primarily recovered by oil drilling Drilling is carried out after studies of structural geology sedimentary basin analysis and reservoir characterisation Unconventional reserves such as oil sands and oil shale exist br Once extracted oil is refined and separated most easily by distillation into innumerable products for direct use or use in manufacturing Products include fuels such as petrol gasoline diesel kerosene and jet fuel asphalt and lubricants chemical reagents used to make plastics solvents textiles refrigerants paint synthetic rubber fertilizers pesticides pharmaceuticals and thousands of others Petroleum is used in manufacturing a vast variety of materials essential for modern life and it is estimated that the world consumes about million barrels million cubic metres each day Petroleum production can be extremely profitable and was critical to global economic development in the th century with some countries so called oil states gaining significant economic and international power because of their control of oil production br Petroleum exploitation can be damaging to the environment and human health Extraction refining and burning of petroleum fuels all release large quantities of greenhouse gases so petroleum is one of the major contributors to climate change Other negative environmental effects include direct releases such as oil spills and as well as air and water pollution at almost all stages of use These environmental effects have direct and indirect health consequences for humans Oil has also been a source of internal and inter state conflict leading to both state led wars and other resource conflicts Production of petroleum is estimated to reach peak oil before as global economies lower dependencies on petroleum as part of climate change mitigation and a transition towards renewable energy and electrification Oil has played a key role in industrialization and economic development br br br Etymology br br The word petroleum comes from Medieval Latin petroleum literally rock oil which comes from Latin petra rock from Greek p tra and oleum oil from Greek laion br The origin of the term stems from monasteries in southern Italy where it was in use by the end of the first millennium as an alternative for the older term naphtha After that the term was used in numerous manuscripts and books such as in the treatise De Natura Fossilium published in by the German mineralogist Georg Bauer also known as Georgius Agricola After the advent of the oil industry during the second half of the th century the term became commonly known for the liquid form of hydrocarbons br br br History br br br Early br br Petroleum in one form or another has been used since ancient times More than years ago bitumen was mentioned when the Sumerians used it to make boats A tablet of the legend of the birth of Sargon of Akkad mentions a basket which was closed by straw and bitumen More than years ago according to Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus asphalt was used in the construction of the walls and towers of Babylon there were oil pits near Ardericca and Babylon and a pitch spring on Zakynthos Great quantities of it were found on the banks of the river Issus one of the tributaries of the Euphrates Ancient Persian tablets indicate the medicinal and lighting uses of petroleum in the upper levels of their society br The use of petroleum in ancient China dates back to more than years ago The I Ching one of the earliest Chinese writings cites that oil in its raw state without refining was first discovered extracted and used in China in the first century BCE In addition the Chinese were the first to record the use of petroleum as fuel as early as the fourth century BCE By CE oil was produced from bamboo drilled wells in China br In the th century petroleum was among the essential ingredients for Greek fire an incendiary projectile weapon that was used by Byzantine Greeks against Arab ships which were then attacking Constantinople Crude oil was also distilled by Persian chemists with clear descriptions given in Arabic handbooks such as those of Abu Bakr al Razi Rhazes The streets of Baghdad were paved with tar derived from petroleum that became accessible from natural fields in the region br In the th century oil fields were exploited in the area around modern Baku Azerbaijan These fields were described by the Arab geographer Abu Bakr al Razi in the th century and by Marco Polo in the th century who described the output of those wells as hundreds of shiploads Arab and Persian chemists also distilled crude oil to produce flammable products for military purposes Through Islamic Spain distillation became available in Western Europe by the th century It has also been present in Romania since the th century being recorded as p cur br Sophisticated oil pits to metres to ft deep were dug by the Seneca people and other Iroquois in Western Pennsylvania as early as The French General Louis Joseph de Montcalm encountered Seneca using petroleum for ceremonial fires and as a healing lotion during a visit to Fort Duquesne in br Early British explorers to Myanmar documented a flourishing oil extraction industry based in Yenangyaung that in had hundreds of hand dug wells under production br Merkwiller Pechelbronn is said to be the first European site where petroleum has been explored and used The still active Erdpechquelle a spring where petroleum appears mixed with water has been used since notably for medical purposes br br br th century br br There was activity in various parts of the world in the mid th century A group directed by Major Alexeyev of the Bakinskii Corps of Mining Engineers hand drilled a well in the Baku region of Bibi Heybat in There were engine drilled wells in West Virginia in the same year as Drake s well An early commercial well was hand dug in Poland in and another in nearby Romania in At around the same time the world s first small oil refinery was opened at Jas o in Poland with a larger one opened at Ploie ti in Romania shortly after Romania is the first country in the world to have had its annual crude oil output officially recorded in international statistics tonnes for br In Georg Christian Konrad Hun us found a significant amount of petroleum while drilling for lignite in Wietze Germany Wietze later provided about of German consumption in the Wilhelminian Era The production stopped in but Wietze has hosted a Petroleum Museum since br Oil sands have been mined since the th century In Wietze in lower Saxony natural asphalt bitumen has been explored since the th century Both in Pechelbronn as in Wietze the coal industry dominated the petroleum technologies br Chemist James Young in noticed a natural petroleum seepage in the coal mine at riddings Alfreton Derbyshire from which he distilled a light thin oil suitable for use as lamp oil at the same time obtaining a more viscous oil suitable for lubricating machinery In Young set up a small business refining crude oil br Young eventually succeeded by distilling cannel coal at low heat in creating a fluid resembling petroleum which when treated in the same way as the seep oil gave similar products Young found that by slow distillation he could obtain several useful liquids from it one of which he named paraffine oil because at low temperatures it congealed into a substance resembling paraffin wax br The production of these oils and solid paraffin wax from coal formed the subject of his patent dated October In Young Meldrum and Edward William Binney entered into partnership under the title of E W Binney Co at Bathgate in West Lothian and E Meldrum Co at Glasgow their works at Bathgate were completed in and became the first truly commercial oil works in the world with the first modern oil refinery br The world s first oil refinery was built in by Ignacy ukasiewicz His achievements also included the discovery of how to distill kerosene from seep oil the invention of the modern kerosene lamp the introduction of the first modern street lamp in Europe and the construction of the world s first modern oil mine at B brka near Krosno still operational as of br The demand for petroleum as a fuel for lighting in North America and around the world quickly grew br The first oil well in the Americas was drilled in by Edwin Drake at what is now called the Drake Well in Cherrytree Township Pennsylvania There also was a company associated with it and it sparked a major oil drilling boom br The first commercial oil well in Canada became operational in at Oil Springs Ontario then Canada West Businessman James Miller Williams dug several wells between and before discovering a rich reserve of oil four metres below ground Williams extracted million litres of crude oil by refining much of it into kerosene lamp oil Williams s well became commercially viable a year before Drake s Pennsylvania operation and could be argued to be the first commercial oil well in North America The discovery at Oil Springs touched off an oil boom which brought hundreds of speculators and workers to the area Advances in drilling continued into when local driller Shaw reached a depth of metres using the spring pole drilling method On January after an explosion of natural gas Canada s first oil gusher came into production shooting into the air at a recorded rate of cubic metres bbl per day By the end of the th century the Russian Empire particularly the Branobel company in Azerbaijan had taken the lead in production br br br th century br Access to oil was and still is a major factor in several military conflicts of the th century including World War II during which oil facilities were a major strategic asset and were extensively bombed The German invasion of the Soviet Union included the goal to capture the Baku oilfields as it would provide much needed oil supplies for the German military which was suffering from blockades br Oil exploration in North America during the early th century later led to the U S becoming the leading producer by mid century As petroleum production in the U S peaked during the s the United States was surpassed by Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union in total output br In Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations imposed an oil embargo against the United States United Kingdom Japan and other Western nations which supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War of October The embargo caused an oil crisis This was followed by the oil crisis which was caused by a drop in oil production in the wake of the Iranian Revolution and caused oil prices to more than double br br br st century br The two oil price shocks had many short and long term effects on global politics and the global economy They led to sustained reductions in demand as a result of substitution to other fuels especially coal and nuclear and improvements in energy efficiency facilitated by government policies High oil prices also induced investment in oil production by non OPEC countries including Prudhoe Bay in Alaska the North Sea offshore fields of the United Kingdom and Norway the Cantarell offshore field of Mexico and oil sands in Canada br About percent of vehicular fuel needs are met by oil Petroleum also makes up percent of total energy consumption in the United States but is responsible for only one percent of electricity generation Petroleum s worth as a portable dense energy source powering the vast majority of vehicles and as the base of many industrial chemicals makes it one of the world s most important commodities br The top three oil producing countries as of are the United States Russia and Saudi Arabia In due in part to developments in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling the United States became the world s largest producer br About percent of the world s readily accessible reserves are located in the Middle East with percent coming from the Arab five Saudi Arabia United Arab Emirates Iraq Qatar and Kuwait A large portion of the world s total oil exists as unconventional sources such as bitumen in Athabasca oil sands and extra heavy oil in the Orinoco Belt While significant volumes of oil are extracted from oil sands particularly in Canada logistical and technical hurdles remain as oil extraction requires large amounts of heat and water making its net energy content quite low relative to conventional crude oil Thus Canada s oil sands are not expected to provide more than a few million barrels per day in the foreseeable future br br br Composition br Petroleum consists of a variety of liquid gaseous and solids Lighter hydrocarbons are the gases methane ethane propane and butane Otherwise the bulk of the liquid and solids are largely heavier organic compounds often hydrocarbons C and H only The proportion of light hydrocarbons in the petroleum mixture varies among oil fields br An oil well produces predominantly crude oil Because the pressure is lower at the surface than underground some of the gas will come out of solution and be recovered or burned as associated gas or solution gas A gas well produces predominantly natural gas However because the underground temperature is higher than at the surface the gas may contain heavier hydrocarbons such as pentane hexane and heptane natural gas condensate often shortened to condensate Condensate resembles gasoline in appearance and is similar in composition to some volatile light crude oils br The hydrocarbons in crude oil are mostly alkanes cycloalkanes and various aromatic hydrocarbons while the other organic compounds contain nitrogen oxygen and sulfur and traces of metals such as iron nickel copper and vanadium Many oil reservoirs contain live bacteria The exact molecular composition of crude oil varies widely from formation to formation but the proportion of chemical elements varies over fairly narrow limits as follows br br Four different types of hydrocarbon appear in crude oil The relative percentage of each varies from oil to oil determining the properties of each oil br br The alkanes from pentane C H to octane C H are refined into gasoline the ones from nonane C H to hexadecane C H into diesel fuel kerosene and jet fuel Alkanes with more than carbon atoms can be refined into fuel oil and lubricating oil At the heavier end of the range paraffin wax is an alkane with approximately carbon atoms while asphalt has and up although these are usually cracked in modern refineries into more valuable products The lightest fraction they so called petroleum gases are subjected to diverse processing depending on cost These gases are either flared off sold as liquefied petroleum gas or used to power the refinery s own burners During the winter butane C H is blended into the gasoline pool at high rates because its high vapour pressure assists with cold starts br The aromatic hydrocarbons are unsaturated hydrocarbons that have one or more benzene rings They tend to burn with a sooty flame and many have a sweet aroma Some are carcinogenic br These different components are separated by fractional distillation at an oil refinery to produce gasoline jet fuel kerosene and other hydrocarbon fractions br The components in an oil sample can be determined by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry Due to the large number of co eluted hydrocarbons within oil many cannot be resolved by traditional gas chromatography This unresolved complex mixture UCM of hydrocarbons is particularly apparent when analysing weathered oils and extracts from tissues of organisms exposed to oil br Crude oil varies greatly in appearance depending on its composition It is usually black or dark brown although it may be yellowish reddish or even greenish In the reservoir it is usually found in association with natural gas which being lighter forms a gas cap over the petroleum and saline water which being heavier than most forms of crude oil generally sinks beneath it Crude oil may also be found in a semi solid form mixed with sand and water as in the Athabasca oil sands in Canada where it is usually referred to as crude bitumen In Canada bitumen is considered a sticky black tar like form of crude oil which is so thick and heavy that it must be heated or diluted before it will flow Venezuela also has large amounts of oil in the Orinoco oil sands although the hydrocarbons trapped in them are more fluid than in Canada and are usually called extra heavy oil These oil sands resources are called unconventional oil to distinguish them from oil which can be extracted using traditional oil well methods Between them Canada and Venezuela contain an estimated trillion barrels m of bitumen and extra heavy oil about twice the volume of the world s reserves of conventional oil br br br Formation br br br Fossil petroleum br br Petroleum is a fossil fuel derived from fossilized organic materials such as zooplankton and algae Vast amounts of these remains settled to sea or lake bottoms where they were covered in stagnant water water with no dissolved oxygen or sediments such as mud and silt faster than they could decompose aerobically Approximately m below this sediment water oxygen concentration was low below mg L and anoxic conditions existed Temperatures also remained constant br As further layers settled into the sea or lake bed intense heat and pressure built up in the lower regions This process caused the organic matter to change first into a waxy material known as kerogen found in various oil shales around the world and then with more heat into liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons via a process known as catagenesis Formation of petroleum occurs from hydrocarbon pyrolysis in a variety of mainly endothermic reactions at high temperatures or pressures or both These phases are described in detail below br br br Anaerobic decay br In the absence of plentiful oxygen aerobic bacteria were prevented from decaying the organic matter after it was buried under a layer of sediment or water However anaerobic bacteria were able to reduce sulfates and nitrates among the matter to H S and N respectively by using the matter as a source for other reactants Due to such anaerobic bacteria at first this matter began to break apart mostly via hydrolysis polysaccharides and proteins were hydrolyzed to simple sugars and amino acids respectively These were further anaerobically oxidized at an accelerated rate by the enzymes of the bacteria e g amino acids went through oxidative deamination to imino acids which in turn reacted further to ammonia and keto acids Monosaccharides in turn ultimately decayed to CO and methane The anaerobic decay products of amino acids monosaccharides phenols and aldehydes combined into fulvic acids Fats and waxes were not extensively hydrolyzed under these mild conditions br br br Kerogen formation br Some phenolic compounds produced from previous reactions worked as bactericides and the actinomycetales order of bacteria also produced antibiotic compounds e g streptomycin Thus the action of anaerobic bacteria ceased at about m below the water or sediment The mixture at this depth contained fulvic acids unreacted and partially reacted fats and waxes slightly modified lignin resins and other hydrocarbons As more layers of organic matter settled into the sea or lake bed intense heat and pressure built up in the lower regions As a consequence compounds of this mixture began to combine in poorly understood ways to kerogen Combination happened in a similar fashion as phenol and formaldehyde molecules react to urea formaldehyde resins but kerogen formation occurred in a more complex manner due to a bigger variety of reactants The total process of kerogen formation from the beginning of anaerobic decay is called diagenesis a word that means a transformation of materials by dissolution and recombination of their constituents br br br Transformation of kerogen into fossil fuels br Kerogen formation continued to a depth of about km from the Earth s surface where temperatures may reach around C Kerogen formation represents a halfway point between organic matter and fossil fuels kerogen can be exposed to oxygen oxidize and thus be lost or it could be buried deeper inside the Earth s crust and be subjected to conditions which allow it to slowly transform into fossil fuels like petroleum The latter happened through catagenesis in which the reactions were mostly radical rearrangements of kerogen These reactions took thousands to millions of years and no external reactants were involved Due to the radical nature of these reactions kerogen reacted towards two classes of products those with low H C ratio anthracene or products similar to it and those with high H C ratio methane or products similar to it i e carbon rich or hydrogen rich products Because catagenesis was closed off from external reactants the resulting composition of the fuel mixture was dependent on the composition of the kerogen via reaction stoichiometry Three types of kerogen exist type I algal II liptinic and III humic which were formed mainly from algae plankton and woody plants this term includes trees shrubs and lianas respectively br Catagenesis was pyrolytic despite the fact that it happened at relatively low temperatures when compared to commercial pyrolysis plants of to several hundred C Pyrolysis was possible because of the long reaction times involved Heat for catagenesis came from the decomposition of radioactive materials of the crust especially K Th U and U The heat varied with geothermal gradient and was typically C per km of depth from the Earth s surface Unusual magma intrusions however could have created greater localized heating br br br Oil window temperature range br Geologists often refer to the temperature range in which oil forms as an oil window Below the minimum temperature oil remains trapped in the form of kerogen Above the maximum temperature the oil is converted to natural gas through the process of thermal cracking Sometimes oil formed at extreme depths may migrate and become trapped at a much shallower level The Athabasca oil sands are one example of this br br br Abiogenic petroleum br br An alternative mechanism to the one described above was proposed by Russian scientists in the mid s the hypothesis of abiogenic petroleum origin petroleum formed by inorganic means but this is contradicted by geological and geochemical evidence Abiogenic sources of oil have been found but never in commercially profitable amounts The controversy isn t over whether abiogenic oil reserves exist said Larry Nation of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists The controversy is over how much they contribute to Earth s overall reserves and how much time and effort geologists should devote to seeking them out br br br Reservoirs br br Three conditions must be present for oil reservoirs to form br br A source rock rich in hydrocarbon material buried deeply enough for subterranean heat to cook it into oil br A porous and permeable reservoir rock where it can accumulate br A caprock seal or other mechanism to prevent the oil from escaping to the surface Within these reservoirs fluids will typically organize themselves like a three layer cake with a layer of water below the oil layer and a layer of gas above it although the different layers vary in size between reservoirs Because most hydrocarbons are less dense than rock or water they often migrate upward through adjacent rock layers until either reaching the surface or becoming trapped within porous rocks known as reservoirs by impermeable rocks above However the process is influenced by underground water flows causing oil to migrate hundreds of kilometres horizontally or even short distances downward before becoming trapped in a reservoir When hydrocarbons are concentrated in a trap an oil field forms from which the liquid can be extracted by drilling and pumping br The reactions that produce oil and natural gas are often modeled as first order breakdown reactions where hydrocarbons are broken down to oil and natural gas by a set of parallel reactions and oil eventually breaks down to natural gas by another set of reactions The latter set is regularly used in petrochemical plants and oil refineries br Petroleum has mostly been recovered by oil drilling natural petroleum springs are rare Drilling is carried out after studies of structural geology at the reservoir scale sedimentary basin analysis and reservoir characterisation mainly in terms of the porosity and permeability of geologic reservoir structures Wells are drilled into oil reservoirs to extract the crude oil Natural lift production methods that rely on the natural reservoir pressure to force the oil to the surface are usually sufficient for a while after reservoirs are first tapped In some reservoirs such as in the Middle East the natural pressure is sufficient over a long time The natural pressure in most reservoirs however eventually dissipates Then the oil must be extracted using artificial lift means Over time these primary methods become less effective and secondary production methods may be used A common secondary method is waterflood or injection of water into the reservoir to increase pressure and force the oil to the drilled shaft or wellbore Eventually tertiary or enhanced oil recovery methods may be used to increase the oil s flow characteristics by injecting steam carbon dioxide and other gases or chemicals into the reservoir In the United States primary production methods account for less than percent of the oil produced on a daily basis secondary methods account for about half and tertiary recovery the remaining percent Extracting oil or bitumen from oil tar sand and oil shale deposits requires mining the sand or shale and heating it in a vessel or retort or using in situ methods of injecting heated liquids into the deposit and then pumping the liquid back out saturated with oil br br br Unconventional oil reservoirs br br Oil eating bacteria biodegrade oil that has escaped to the surface Oil sands are reservoirs of partially biodegraded oil still in the process of escaping and being biodegraded but they contain so much migrating oil that although most of it has escaped vast amounts are still present more than can be found in conventional oil reservoirs The lighter fractions of the crude oil are destroyed first resulting in reservoirs containing an extremely heavy form of crude oil called crude bitumen in Canada or extra heavy crude oil in Venezuela These two countries have the world s largest deposits of oil sands br On the other hand oil shales are source rocks that have not been exposed to heat or pressure long enough to convert their trapped hydrocarbons into crude oil Technically speaking oil shales are not always shales and do not contain oil but are fined grain sedimentary rocks containing an insoluble organic solid called kerogen The kerogen in the rock can be converted into crude oil using heat and pressure to simulate natural processes The method has been known for centuries and was patented in under British Crown Patent No covering A way to extract and make great quantities of pitch tar and oil out of a sort of stone Although oil shales are found in many countries the United States has the world s largest deposits br br br Classification br br The petroleum industry generally classifies crude oil by the geographic location it is produced in e g West Texas Intermediate Brent or Oman its API gravity an oil industry measure of density and its sulfur content Crude oil may be considered light if it has low density heavy if it has high density or medium if it has a density between that of light and heavy Additionally it may be referred to as sweet if it contains relatively little sulfur or sour if it contains substantial amounts of sulfur br The geographic location is important because it affects transportation costs to the refinery Light crude oil is more desirable than heavy oil since it produces a higher yield of gasoline while sweet oil commands a higher price than sour oil because it has fewer environmental problems and requires less refining to meet sulfur standards imposed on fuels in consuming countries Each crude oil has unique molecular characteristics which are revealed by the use of crude oil assay analysis in petroleum laboratories br Barrels from an area in which the crude oil s molecular characteristics have been determined and the oil has been classified are used as pricing references throughout the world Some of the common reference crudes are br br West Texas Intermediate WTI a very high quality sweet light oil delivered at Cushing Oklahoma for North American oil br Brent Blend consisting of oils from fields in the Brent and Ninian systems in the East Shetland Basin of the North Sea The oil landed at Sullom Voe terminal in Shetland Oil production from Europe Africa and Middle Eastern oil flowing West tends to be priced off this oil which forms a benchmark br Dubai Oman used as a benchmark for the Middle East sour crude oil flowing to the Asia Pacific region br Tapis from Malaysia used as a reference for light Far East oil br Minas from Indonesia used as a reference for heavy Far East oil br The OPEC Reference Basket a weighted average of oil blends from various OPEC Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries countries br Midway Sunset Heavy by which heavy oil in California is priced br Western Canadian Select the benchmark crude oil for emerging heavy high TAN acidic crudes br There are declining amounts of these benchmark oils being produced each year so other oils are more commonly what is actually delivered While the reference price may be for West Texas Intermediate delivered at Cushing the actual oil being traded may be a discounted Canadian heavy oil Western Canadian Select delivered at Hardisty Alberta and for a Brent Blend delivered at Shetland it may be a discounted Russian Export Blend delivered at the port of Primorsk br Once extracted oil is refined and separated most easily by distillation into numerous products for direct use or use in manufacturing such as petrol gasoline diesel and kerosene to asphalt and chemical reagents ethylene propylene butene acrylic acid para xylene used to make plastics pesticides and pharmaceuticals br br br Use br In terms of volume most petroleum is converted into fuels for combustion engines In terms of value petroleum underpins the petrochemical industry which includes many high value products such as pharmaceuticals and plastics br br br Fuels and lubricants br Petroleum is used mostly by volume for refining into fuel oil and gasoline both important primary energy sources by volume of the hydrocarbons present in petroleum is converted into fuels including gasoline diesel jet heating and other fuel oils and liquefied petroleum gas br Due to its high energy density easy transportability and relative abundance oil has become the world s most important source of energy since the mid s Petroleum is also the raw material for many chemical products including pharmaceuticals solvents fertilizers pesticides and plastics the percent not used for energy production is converted into these other materials Petroleum is found in porous rock formations in the upper strata of some areas of the Earth s crust There is also petroleum in oil sands tar sands Known oil reserves are typically estimated at km trillion short scale barrels without oil sands or km trillion barrels with oil sands Consumption is currently around million barrels m per day or km per year yielding a remaining oil supply of only about years if current demand remains static More recent studies however put the number at around years br Closely related to fuels for combustion engines are Lubricants greases and viscosity stabilizers All are derived from petroleum br br br Chemicals br br All pharmaceuticals are derived from petroleum albeit via multistep processes Modern medicine depends on petroleum as a source of building blocks reagents and solvents Similarly virtually all pesticides insecticides herbicides etc are derived from petroleum Pesticides have profoundly affected life expectancies by controlling disease vectors and by increasing yields of crops Like pharmaceuticals pesticides are in essence petrochemicals Virtually all plastics and synthetic polymers are derived from petroleum which is the source of monomers Alkenes olefins are one important class of these precursor molecules br br br Other derivatives br br Wax used in the packaging of frozen foods among others Paraffin wax derived from petroleum oil br Sulfur and its derivative sulfuric acid Hydrogen sulfide is a product of sulfur removal from petroleum fraction It is oxidized to elemental sulfur and then to sulfuric acid br Bulk tar and Asphalt br Petroleum coke used in speciality carbon products or as solid fuel br br br Industry br br br Transport br br In the s shipping costs made up percent of the price of oil transported from the Persian Gulf to the United States but due to the development of supertankers in the s the cost of shipping dropped to only percent of the price of Persian oil in the US Due to the increase in the value of crude oil during the last years the share of the shipping cost on the final cost of the delivered commodity was less than in br br br Price br br br Trade br br Crude oil is traded as a future on both the NYMEX and ICE exchanges Futures contracts are agreements in which buyers and sellers agree to purchase and deliver specific amounts of physical crude oil on a given date in the future A contract covers any multiple of barrels and can be purchased up to nine years into the future br br br Use by country br br br Consumption statistics br br br br br br br

burning petroleum plus methane leaks from the industry Along with the burning of coal petroleum combustion is the largest contributor to the increase in atmospheric CO Atmospheric CO has risen over the last years to current levels of over ppmv from the ppmv of the prior thousand years The rise in Arctic temperature has reduced the minimum Arctic ice pack to km sq mi a loss of almost half since satellite measurements started in br Ocean acidification is the increase in the acidity of the Earth s oceans caused by the uptake of carbon dioxide CO from the atmosphere The saturation state of calcium carbonate decreases with the uptake of carbon dioxide in the ocean This increase in acidity inhibits all marine life having a greater effect on smaller organisms as well as shelled organisms see scallops br br br Extraction br Oil extraction is simply the removal of oil from the reservoir oil pool There are many methods on extracting the oil from the reservoirs for example mechanical shaking water in oil emulsion and specialty chemicals called demulsifiers that separate the oil from water Oil extraction is costly and often environmentally damaging Offshore exploration and extraction of oil disturb the surrounding marine environment br br br Oil spills br br Crude oil and refined fuel spills from tanker ship accidents have damaged natural ecosystems and human livelihoods in Alaska the Gulf of Mexico the Gal pagos Islands France and many other places br The quantity of oil spilled during accidents has ranged from a few hundred tons to several hundred thousand tons e g Deepwater Horizon oil spill SS Atlantic Empress Amoco Cadiz Smaller spills have already proven to have a great impact on ecosystems such as the Exxon Valdez oil spill br Oil spills at sea are generally much more damaging than those on land since they can spread for hundreds of nautical miles in a thin oil slick which can cover beaches with a thin coating of oil This can kill sea birds mammals shellfish and other organisms it coats Oil spills on land are more readily containable if a makeshift earth dam can be rapidly bulldozed around the spill site before most of the oil escapes and land animals can avoid the oil more easily br Control of oil spills is difficult requires ad hoc methods and often a large amount of manpower The dropping of bombs and incendiary devices from aircraft on the SS Torrey Canyon wreck produced poor results modern techniques would include pumping the oil from the wreck like in the Prestige oil spill or the Erika oil spill br Though crude oil is predominantly composed of various hydrocarbons certain nitrogen heterocyclic compounds such as pyridine picoline and quinoline are reported as contaminants associated with crude oil as well as facilities processing oil shale or coal and have also been found at legacy wood treatment sites These compounds have a very high water solubility and thus tend to dissolve and move with water Certain naturally occurring bacteria such as Micrococcus Arthrobacter and Rhodococcus have been shown to degrade these contaminants br Because petroleum is a naturally occurring substance its presence in the environment does not need to be the result of human causes such as accidents and routine activities seismic exploration drilling extraction refining and combustion Phenomena such as seeps and tar pits are examples of areas that petroleum affects without man s involvement br br br Tarballs br A tarball is a blob of crude oil not to be confused with tar which is a human made product derived from pine trees or refined from petroleum which has been weathered after floating in the ocean Tarballs are an aquatic pollutant in most environments although they can occur naturally for example in the Santa Barbara Channel of California or in the Gulf of Mexico off Texas Their concentration and features have been used to assess the extent of oil spills Their composition can be used to identify their sources of origin and tarballs themselves may be dispersed over long distances by deep sea currents They are slowly decomposed by bacteria including Chromobacterium violaceum Cladosporium resinae Bacillus submarinus Micrococcus varians Pseudomonas aeruginosa Candida marina and Saccharomyces estuari br br br Whales br br James S Robbins has argued that the advent of petroleum refined kerosene saved some species of great whales from extinction by providing an inexpensive substitute for whale oil thus eliminating the economic imperative for open boat whaling but others say that fossil fuels increased whaling with most whales being killed in the th century br br br Alternatives br In road transport used of petroleum aviation and uses other than energy Electric vehicles are the main alternative for road transport and biojet for aviation Single use plastics have a high carbon footprint and may pollute the sea but as of the best alternatives are unclear br br br International relations br br Control of petroleum production has been a significant driver of international relations during much of the th and st centuries Organizations like OPEC have played an outsized role in international politics Some historians and commentators have called this the Age of Oil With the rise of renewable energy and addressing climate change some commentators expect a realignment of international power away from petrostates br br br Corruption br Oil rents have been described as connected with corruption in political literature A study suggested that increases in oil rents increased corruption in countries with heavy government involvement in the production of oil The study found that increases in oil rents significantly deteriorates political rights The investigators say that oil exploitation gave politicians an incentive to extend civil liberties but reduce political rights in the presence of oil windfalls to evade redistribution and conflict br br br Conflict br br Petroleum production has been linked with conflict for many years leading to thousands of deaths due to these wars conflicts Petroleum deposits are in hardly any countries around the world mainly in Russia and some parts of the middle east Conflicts may start when countries refuse to cut oil production in which other countries respond to such actions by increasing their production causing a trade war as experienced during the Russia Saudi Arabia oil price war Other conflicts start due to countries wanting petroleum resources or other reasons on oil resource territory experienced in the Iran Iraq War br br br OPEC br br br Future production br br Consumption in the twentieth and twenty first centuries has been abundantly pushed by automobile sector growth The oil glut even fueled the sales of low fuel economy vehicles in OECD countries The economic crisis seems to have had some impact on the sales of such vehicles still in oil consumption showed a small increase br In Goldman Sachs predicted lower demand for oil due to emerging economies concerns especially China The BRICS Brasil Russia India China South Africa countries might also kick in as China briefly had the largest automobile market in December In the long term uncertainties linger the OPEC believes that the OECD countries will push low consumption policies at some point in the future when that happens it will definitely curb oil sales and both OPEC and the Energy Information Administration EIA kept lowering their consumption estimates during the past five years A detailed review of International Energy Agency oil projections have revealed that revisions of world oil production price and investments have been motivated by a combination of demand and supply factors All together Non OPEC conventional projections have been fairly stable the last years while downward revisions were mainly allocated to OPEC Upward revisions are primarily a result of US tight oil br Production will also face an increasingly complex situation while OPEC countries still have large reserves at low production prices newly found reservoirs often lead to higher prices offshore giants such as Tupi Guara and Tiber demand high investments and ever increasing technological abilities Subsalt reservoirs such as Tupi were unknown in the twentieth century mainly because the industry was unable to probe them Enhanced Oil Recovery EOR techniques example DaQing China will continue to play a major role in increasing the world s recoverable oil br The expected availability of petroleum resources has always been around years or even less since the start of the modern exploration The oil constant an insider pun in the German industry refers to that effect br A growing number of divestment campaigns from major funds pushed by newer generations who question the sustainability of petroleum may hinder the financing of future oil prospection and production br br br Peak oil br br Peak oil is a term applied to the projection that future petroleum production whether for individual oil wells entire oil fields whole countries or worldwide production will eventually peak and then decline at a similar rate to the rate of increase before the peak as these reserves are exhausted The peak of oil discoveries was in and oil production per year has surpassed oil discoveries every year since However this does not mean that potential oil production has surpassed oil demand br It is difficult to predict the oil peak in any given region due to the lack of knowledge and or transparency in the accounting of global oil reserves Based on available production data proponents have previously predicted the peak for the world to be in the years or Some of these predictions date from before the recession of the early s and the consequent lowering in global consumption the effect of which was to delay the date of any peak by several years Just as the U S peak in oil production was only clearly recognized after the fact a peak in world production will be difficult to discern until production clearly drops off br In according to BP s Energy Outlook peak oil had been reached due to the changing energy landscape coupled with the economic toll of the COVID pandemic br While there has been much focus historically on peak oil supply the focus is increasingly shifting to peak demand as more countries seek to transition to renewable energy The GeGaLo index of geopolitical gains and losses assesses how the geopolitical position of countries may change if the world fully transitions to renewable energy resources Former oil exporters are expected to lose power while the positions of former oil importers and countries rich in renewable energy resources is expected to strengthen br br br Unconventional oil br br Unconventional oil is petroleum produced or extracted using techniques other than the conventional methods The calculus for peak oil has changed with the introduction of unconventional production methods In particular the combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing has resulted in a significant increase in production from previously uneconomic plays Certain rock strata contain hydrocarbons but have low permeability and are not thick from a vertical perspective Conventional vertical wells would be unable to economically retrieve these hydrocarbons Horizontal drilling extending horizontally through the strata permits the well to access a much greater volume of the strata Hydraulic fracturing creates greater permeability and increases hydrocarbon flow to the wellbore br br br Hydrocarbons on other worlds br On Saturn s largest moon Titan lakes of liquid hydrocarbons comprising methane ethane propane and other constituents occur naturally Data collected by the space probe Cassini Huygens yield an estimate that the visible lakes and seas of Titan contain about times the volume of Earth s proven oil reserves Drilled samples from the surface of Mars taken in by the Curiosity rover s Mars Science Laboratory have found organic molecules of benzene and propane in billion year old rock samples in Gale Crater br br br In fiction br br br See
