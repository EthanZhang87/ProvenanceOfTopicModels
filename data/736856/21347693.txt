The watt symbol W is the unit of power or radiant flux in the International System of Units SI equal to joule per second or kg m s It is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer The watt is named in honor of James Watt an th century Scottish inventor mechanical engineer and chemist who improved the Newcomen engine with his own steam engine in Watt s invention was fundamental for the Industrial Revolution br br br Overview br When an object s velocity is held constant at one meter per second against a constant opposing force of one newton the rate at which work is done is one watt br br br

about watts Mass times acceleration due to gravity times height divided by the time it takes to lift the object to the given height gives the rate of doing work or power br A laborer over the course of an eight hour day can sustain an average output of about watts higher power levels can be achieved for short intervals and by athletes br br br Origin and adoption as an SI unit br The watt is named after the Scottish inventor James Watt The unit name was proposed by C William Siemens in August in his President s Address to the Fifty Second Congress of the British Association for the Advancement of Science Noting that units in the practical system of units were named after leading physicists Siemens proposed that watt might be an appropriate name for a unit of power Siemens defined the unit within the existing system of practical units as the power conveyed by a current of an Amp re through the difference of potential of a Volt br In October at the International Conference on Electric Units and Standards in London so called international definitions were established for practical electrical units Siemens definition was adopted as the international watt Also used A The watt was defined as equal to units of power in the practical system of units The international units were dominant from until After the th General Conference on Weights and Measures in the international watt was redefined from practical units to absolute units i e using only length mass and time Concretely this meant that watt was defined as the quantity of energy transferred in a unit of time namely J s In this new definition absolute watt international watts Texts written before are likely to be using the international watt which implies caution when comparing numerical values from this period with the post watt In the th General Conference on Weights and Measures adopted the absolute watt into the International System of Units SI as the unit of power br br br Multiples br br Attowatt br The sound intensity in water corresponding to the international standard reference sound pressure of Pa is approximately aW m br Femtowatt br Powers measured in femtowatts are typically found in references to radio and radar receivers For example meaningful FM tuner performance figures for sensitivity quieting and signal to noise require that the RF energy applied to the antenna input be specified These input levels are often stated in dBf decibels referenced to femtowatt This is microvolts across a ohm load or microvolt across a ohm load the specification takes into account the RF input impedance of the tuner br Picowatt br Powers measured in picowatts are typically used in reference to radio and radar receivers acoustics and in the science of radio astronomy One picowatt is the international standard reference value of sound power when this quantity is expressed in decibels br Nanowatt br Powers measured in nanowatts are also typically used in reference to radio and radar receivers br Microwatt br Powers measured in microwatts are typically stated in medical instrumentation systems such as the electroencephalograph EEG and the electrocardiograph ECG in a wide variety of scientific and engineering instruments and also in reference to radio and radar receivers Compact solar cells for devices such as calculators and watches are typically measured in microwatts br Milliwatt br A typical laser pointer outputs about five milliwatts of light power whereas a typical hearing aid uses less than one milliwatt Audio signals and other electronic signal levels are often measured in dBm referenced to one milliwatt br Kilowatt br br The kilowatt is typically used to express the output power of engines and the power of electric motors tools machines and heaters It is also a common unit used to express the electromagnetic power output of broadcast radio and television transmitters One kilowatt is approximately equal to horsepower A small electric heater with one heating element can use kilowatt The average electric power consumption of a household in the United States is about kilowatt A surface area of square meter on Earth receives typically about one kilowatt of sunlight from the Sun the solar irradiance on a clear day at midday close to the equator br Megawatt br Many events or machines produce or sustain the conversion of energy on this scale including large electric motors large warships such as aircraft carriers cruisers and submarines large server farms or data centers and some scientific research equipment such as supercolliders and the output pulses of very large lasers A large residential or commercial building may use several megawatts in electric power and heat On railways modern high powered electric locomotives typically have a peak power output of or MW while some produce much more The Eurostar e for example uses more than MW while heavy diesel electric locomotives typically produce and use and MW U S nuclear power plants have net summer capacities between about and MW The earliest citing of the megawatt in the Oxford English Dictionary OED is a reference in the Webster s International Dictionary of the English Language The OED also states that megawatt appeared in a November article in the journal Science br br Gigawatt br A gigawatt is typical average power for an industrial city of one million habitants and also the output of a large power station The GW unit is thus used for large power plants and power grids For example by the end of power shortages in China s Shanxi province were expected to increase to GW and the installation capacity of wind power in Germany was GW The largest unit out of four of the Belgian Doel Nuclear Power Station has a peak output of GW HVDC converters have been built with power ratings of up to GW br Terawatt br The primary energy used by humans worldwide was about terawatt hours in corresponding to an average continuous power consumption of TW that year The most powerful lasers from the mid s to the mid s produced power in terawatts but only for nanosecond intervals The average lightning strike peaks at TW but these strikes only last for microseconds br Petawatt br A petawatt can be produced by the current generation of lasers for time scales on the order of picoseconds One such laser is Lawrence Livermore s Nova laser which achieved a power output of PW by a process called chirped pulse amplification The duration of the pulse was roughly ps giving a total energy of J Another example is the Laser for Fast Ignition Experiments LFEX at the Institute of Laser Engineering ILE Osaka University which achieved a power output of PW for a duration of approximately ps Based on the average total solar irradiance of kW m the total power of sunlight striking Earth s atmosphere is estimated at PW The planet s average rate of global warming measured as Earth s energy imbalance reached about PW of incident solar power by br Yottawatt br The power output of the Sun is YW about billion times the power estimated to reach Earth s atmosphere br br br Conventions in the electric power industry br In the electric power industry megawatt electrical MWe or MWe refers by convention to the electric power produced by a generator while megawatt thermal or thermal megawatt MWt MWt or MWth MWth refers to thermal power produced by the plant For example the Embalse nuclear power plant in Argentina uses a fission reactor to generate MWt i e heat which creates steam to drive a turbine which generates MWe i e electricity Other SI prefixes are sometimes used for example gigawatt electrical GWe The International Bureau of Weights and Measures which maintains the SI standard states that further information about a quantity should not be attached to the unit symbol but instead to the quantity symbol e g Pth W rather than P Wth and so these unit symbols are non SI In compliance with SI the energy company rsted A S uses the unit megawatt for produced electrical power and the equivalent unit megajoule per second for delivered heating power in a combined heat and power station such as Aved re Power Station br When describing alternating current AC electricity another distinction is made between the watt and the volt ampere While these units are equivalent for simple resistive circuits they differ when loads exhibit electrical reactance br br br Radio transmission br br Radio stations usually report the power of their transmitters in units of watts referring to the effective radiated power This refers to the power that a half wave dipole antenna would need to radiate to match the intensity of the transmitter s main lobe br br br Distinction between watts and watt hours br The terms power and energy are closely related but distinct physical quantities Power is the rate at which energy is generated or consumed and hence is measured in units e g watts that represent energy per unit time br For example when a light bulb with a power rating of W is turned on for one hour the energy used is watt hours W h kilowatt hour or kJ This same amount of energy would light a watt bulb for hours or a watt bulb for hours br Power stations are rated using units of power typically megawatts or gigawatts for example the Three Gorges Dam in China is rated at approximately gigawatts This reflects the maximum power output it can achieve at any point in time A power station s annual energy output however would be recorded using units of energy not power typically gigawatt hours Major energy production or consumption is often expressed as terawatt hours for a given period often a calendar year or financial year One terawatt hour of energy is equal to a sustained power delivery of one terawatt for one hour or approximately megawatts for a period of one year br br Power output energy time br terawatt hour per year W h days hours per day million watts br equivalent to approximately megawatts of constant power output br The watt second is a unit of energy equal to the joule One kilowatt hour is watt seconds br While a watt per hour is a unit of rate of change of power with time it is not correct to refer to a watt or watt hour as a watt per hour br br br See also br br Kibble balance formerly known as a watt balance br Nominal power photovoltaic br Power
