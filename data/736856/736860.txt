Volvo Aero was a Swedish aircraft guided missiles and rocket engine manufacturer It became GKN Aerospace Engine Systems following the company s acquisition by British engineering conglomerate GKN during br It was originally established as Nohab Flygmotorfabriker AB in to produce aero engines The firm became a part of SAAB during Volvo later purchased most of the stock thus it was renamed Svenska Flygmotor AB SFA and later Volvo Flygmotor It became the major engine supplier of the Swedish Air Force during the post war period During the s Volvo Flygmotor branched into the commercial aerospace sector offering overhauls and subcomponent production for several international engine manufacturers as well as into the European space sector br During the s Volvo Aero focused on cooperative ventures with various partner companies around the globe As a result of the Great Recession Volvo Aero experienced a sustained downturn in business resulting in layoffs and contributing to the firm s sale Parent company Volvo decided to sell their aerospace division amid the economic downturn GKN emerged amongst several bidders as the frontrunner finalising its purchase of Volvo Aero during br br br History br Nohab Flygmotorfabriker AB was founded in Trollh ttan Sweden in to produce aircraft engines for the Swedish Board of Aviation As reflected in the name of the company it was a subsidiary of the Swedish manufacturing and railway locomotive specialist NOHAB In the firm became a part of the newly founded SAAB however during Volvo acquired a majority of the stock Accordingly the company s name was changed to Svenska Flygmotor AB SFA and later on Volvo Flygmotor br During the s the company leveraged partnerships with foreign engine manufacturers helping it to acquire expertise in the recently developed turbojet engine It undertook the licensed manufacture of several engines such as the Rolls Royce Avon referred to in Swedish Air Force service as the RM and RM and the Pratt Whitney JT D RM Throughout the post war period the company has served as the major engine supplier of the Swedish Air Force br During the s the firm decided to apply the experience it had gathered on the production and service of military aircraft engines towards the commercial aerospace sector The first overhaul services it offered were for the JT engine Volvo Flygmotor soon expanded its activities into the manufacture of subcomponents for several international engine manufacturers including General Electric Pratt Whitney and Rolls Royce Plc br Seeking to further growth of its commercial operations Volvo Flygmotor became involved in the European Space Program producing a number of components for the rocket engines that power the Ariane of heavy launch vehicles The firm successfully expanded significantly beyond its domestic market Recognised that that its name needed to be easily recognised internationally the company changed its name to the Volvo Aero Corporation during the early s br By the late s Volvo Aero s component range included fan cases fan compressor structures compressor rotors shafts combustor structures vanes low pressure turbine LPT cases turbine structures rocket nozzles combustion chambers and rocket engine turbines for both civilian and military purposes By the firm s workforce comprised employees it also recorded total sales of billion euros during that year Presently Volvo Aero is a partner in more than ten commercial engine programmes and components produced by the company are installed in more than of all large commercial aircraft engines sold br During the s further efforts were made by Volvo Aero towards close cooperation with various industrial partners During July Volvo Aero and Rolls Royce signed a risk and revenue sharing agreement for the Rolls Royce Trent XWB turbofan engine under which Volvo Aero developed and manufactured the intermediate compressor case a key engine component the firm estimated this contract s value to be SEK billion over years In November Pratt Whitney and Volvo Aero Norge agreed for the latter to produce diffuser case components for the Pratt Whitney F engine that same year Volvo Aero secured work on the Pratt Whitney PW G engine as well In June SNECMA and Volvo Aero agreed on the principles of a five year partnership between the two companies in the space propulsion sector br Following the start of the Great Recession in Volvo Aero shared in the general downturn in business activity In January Volvo Aero announced the redundancy of blue collar and white collar employees a further cut of positions was announced as a result of the economic downturn in June A year on year downwards trend in its sales activity was observed in the years surrounding this time stimulating parent company Volvo to examine the company s future prospects In September Volvo announced the sale of its US subsidiary Volvo Aero Services to a private equity firm br By Volvo was seeking to dispose of its aero engine division to focus on its production of trucks and construction equipment In March British engineering group GKN was reportedly being regarded as the frontrunner to acquire the company as several other bidders including German engine specialist MTU Aero Engines as well as private equity firms The Carlyle Group and Nordic Capital decided to withdraw from their own acquisition ambitions On July Volvo Aero was acquired by the GKN in a SEK billion deal The sale was viewed as one step in a wider trend in the aerospace industry towards consolidation br Following the Volvo Aero acquisition GKN entered into a month period of restructuring During Volvo Aero declared that it intended to expand its engine component production range over the coming years br br br Test facility br In the s the Swedish Air Board constructed an unusual test facility at Flygmotor This was an engine test facility a form of wind tunnel which could operate at high inlet pressures thus high Reynolds numbers This tunnel was unique in being water powered A sealed underground chamber was blasted out of the granite beneath the G ta Canal When the canal was allowed to flood the chamber air was driven from it at high pressure and through the test chamber A supersonic test of an engine could be carried out for around minutes after which it took hours to pump the chamber dry again Use of this test facility was shared with Rolls Royce who used it in to develop the afterburners of the Avon RA engine for the Supermarine Swift F and Saab Lansen The Avon RA afterburner would also be tested here produced as the Flygmotor RM B for the Saab Draken br br br Products br br br Aircraft engines and components br Volvo Aero is a supplier of single engine systems for military aircraft These have largely been in partnership with other engine manufacturers such as the RM de Havilland Goblin for the Saab R RM de Havilland Ghost for the Saab J RM and RM Rolls Royce Avon for the Saab Lansen the RM B for the Saab Draken and the RM Pratt Whitney JT D for the Saab Viggen The Saab JAS Gripen s RM engine is a derivative of the General Electric F br Svenska Flygmotor also designed the B a horizontally opposed four cylinder engine intended for the SAAB Safir However SAAB decided to use engines from de Havilland and Lycoming instead In the end the B came to power the Infanterikanonvagn assault gun A follow up called the B powered the Pansarbandvagn armoured personnel carrier br Volvo Aero delivers engine components mainly complex engine structures like turbine exhaust casings turbine mid frames LPT cases compressor housings LPT shafts vanes and large rotating parts br br br Engine maintenance and service br Volvo Aero also has a facility in Trollh ttan where they did maintenance on aircraft engines and stationary gas turbines The aircraft engines are Pratt Whitney Canada PW and TFE engines The Stationary gas turbines is General Electric LM engine and the DR which Volvo bought the OEM responsibility from Dresser Rand br Formed in US aftermarket aircraft parts seller AGES Group was sold to Volvo Aero in to form Volvo Aero Services In VAS Aero Services was sold to HIG Capital and returned to being privately held in It employs over worldwide br br br Space propulsion br Volvo Aero manufactures combustion chambers nozzles and turbines for commercial launch vehicles br br br Hydraulic Motors br The company have produced the F series hydraulic motors under the Volvo Flygmotor Volvo Hydraulics and VOAC brands The main feature of these products are the spherical pistons each with a laminated segment This technology permits a large angle between the shaft and the cylinder barrel br br br Locations br Volvo Aero subsidiaries are located in the United States and Norway in addition to Volvo s home country Sweden The Norwegian plant in Kongsberg is the former Norsk Jetmotor itself formerly a part of Kongsberg V penfabrikk br
