id: 1055001
Aircraft equipped with contra rotating propellers CRP coaxial contra rotating propellers or high speed propellers apply the maximum power of usually a single piston engine or turboprop engine to drive a pair of coaxial propellers in contra rotation Two propellers are arranged one behind the other and power is transferred from the engine via a planetary gear or spur gear transmission Contra rotating propellers are also known as counter rotating propellers although the term counter rotating propellers is much more widely used when referring to airscrews on separate non coaxial shafts turning in opposite directions br br br Operation br When airspeed is low the mass of the air flowing through the propeller disk thrust causes a significant amount of tangential or rotational air flow to be created by the spinning blades The energy of this tangential air flow is wasted in a single propeller design and causes handling problems at low speed as the air strikes the vertical stabilizer causing the aircraft to yaw left or right depending on the direction of propeller rotation To use this wasted effort the placement of a second propeller behind the first takes advantage of the disturbed airflow br A well designed contra rotating propeller will have no rotational air flow pushing a maximum amount of air uniformly through the propeller disk resulting in high performance and low induced energy loss It also serves to counter the asymmetrical torque effect of a conventional propeller see P factor Some contra rotating systems were designed to be used at takeoff for maximum power and efficiency under such conditions and allowing one of the propellers to be disabled during cruise to extend flight time br br br Advantages and disadvantages br The torque on the aircraft from a pair of contra rotating propellers effectively cancels out br Contra rotating propellers have been found to be between and more efficient than normal propellers br However they can be very noisy with increases in noise in the axial forward and aft direction of up to dB and tangentially dB Most of this extra noise can be found in the higher frequencies These substantial noise problems limit commercial applications One possibility is to enclose the contra rotating propellers in a shroud It is also helpful if the tip speed or the loading of the blades is reduced if the aft propeller has fewer blades or a smaller diameter than the fore propeller or if the spacing between the aft and fore propellers is increased br The efficiency of a contra rotating propeller is somewhat offset by its mechanical complexity and the added weight of this gearing that makes the aircraft heavier thus some performance is sacrificed to carry it Nonetheless coaxial contra rotating propellers and rotors have been used in several military aircraft such as the Tupolev Tu Bear br They are also being examined for use in airliners br br br Use in aircraft br While several nations experimented with contra rotating propellers in aircraft only the United Kingdom and Soviet Union produced them in large numbers The first aircraft to be fitted with a contra rotating propeller to fly was in the US when two inventors from Ft Worth Texas tested the concept on an aircraft br br br United Kingdom br br A contra rotating propeller was patented by F W Lanchester in br Some of the more successful British aircraft with contra rotating propellers are the Avro Shackleton powered by the Rolls Royce Griffon engine and the Fairey Gannet which used the Double Mamba Mk engine In the Double Mamba two separate power sections drove one propeller each allowing one power section engine to be shut down in flight increasing endurance br Another naval aircraft the Westland Wyvern had contra rotating propellers The Martin Baker MB test aircraft also used this propeller type br Later variants of the Supermarine Spitfire and Seafire used the Griffon with contra rotating props In the Spitfire Seafire and Shackleton s case the primary reason for using contra rotating propellers was to increase the propeller blade area and hence absorb greater engine power within a propeller diameter limited by the height of the aircraft s undercarriage The Short Sturgeon used two Merlin s with contra rotating propellers br The Bristol Brabazon prototype airliner used eight Bristol Centaurus engines driving four pairs of contra rotating propellers each engine driving a single propeller br The post war SARO Princess prototype flying boat airliner also had eight of its ten engines driving contra rotating propellers br br br USSR Russia and Ukraine br br In the s the Soviet Union s Kuznetsov Design Bureau developed the NK turboprop It drives an eight blade contra rotating propeller and at shaft horsepower kilowatts it is the most powerful turboprop in service Four NK engines power the Tupolev Tu Bear the only turboprop bomber to enter service as well as one of the fastest propeller driven aircraft The Tu an airliner derivative of the Tu holds the world speed record for propeller aircraft The Tu was also the first Soviet bomber to have intercontinental range The Tu AEW aircraft and Tu maritime patrol aircraft are two more NK powered designs derived from the Tu br The NK engine powers another well known Soviet aircraft the Antonov An Antheus a heavy lift cargo aircraft At the time of its introduction the An was the largest aircraft in the world and is still by far the world s largest turboprop powered aircraft From the s through the s it set several world records in the categories of maximum payload to height ratio and maximum payload lifted to altitude br Of lesser note is the use of the NK engine in the A Orlyonok a mid size Soviet ekranoplan The A uses one NK engine mounted at the top of its T tail along with two turbofans installed in the nose br In the s Kuznetsov continued to develop powerful contra rotating engines The NK which was tested in the late s had a contra rotating propeller configuration with four blades in front and four in back like the NK Its inch propeller diameter metre was smaller than the NK s in m diameter but it produced a power output of hp kW delivering a takeoff thrust of pounds force kilonewtons Even more powerful was the NK which was in development throughout most of the decade The NK had an identical propeller diameter and blade configuration to the NK but it offered a higher takeoff thrust of lbf kN The associated NK M had a takeoff thrust of lbf kN and it could deliver lbf kN of emergency thrust Unlike the NK however these later engines were not adopted by any of the aircraft design bureaus br In Antonov produced the An a heavy transport aircraft It is powered by four Progress D propfan engines driving contra rotating propellers The characteristics of the D engine and its propeller make it a propfan a hybrid between a turbofan engine and a turboprop engine br br br United States br br The United States worked with several prototypes including the Northrop XB XB Mixmaster the Douglas XTB D Skypirate the Curtiss XBTC the A J Super Savage the Boeing XF B the XP Black Bullet the Fisher P Eagle and the tail sitting Convair XFY Pogo and Lockheed XFV Salmon VTOL fighters and the Hughes XF reconnaissance plane The Convair R Y Tradewind flying boat entered service with contra rotating propellers However both piston engined and turboprop powered propeller driven aircraft were reaching their zenith and new technological developments such as the advent of the pure turbojet and turbofan engines both without propellers meant that the designs were quickly eclipsed br The US propeller manufacturer Hamilton Standard bought a Fairey Gannet in to study the effects of counter rotation on propeller noise and blade vibratory stresses The Gannet was particularly suitable because the independently driven propellers provided a comparison between counter and single rotation br br br Ultralight applications br An Austrian company Sun Flightcraft distributes a contra rotating gearbox for use on Rotax and engines on ultralight and microlight aircraft The Coax P was developed by Hans Neudorfer of NeuraJet and allows powered hang gliders and parachutes to develop to percent more power while reducing torque moments The manufacturer also reports reduced noise levels from dual contra rotating props using the Coax P gearbox br br br Use in water br Torpedoes such as the Bliss Leavitt torpedo have commonly used contra rotating propellers to give the maximum possible speed within a limited diameter as well as counteracting the torque that would otherwise tend to cause the torpedo to rotate around its own longitudinal axis br Recreational Boating in Volvo Penta introduced a contra rotating boat propeller branded DuoProp The patented device has been marketed since br After the Volvo Penta patents ran out Mercury has also produced a corresponding product MerCruiser Bravo br Commercial ships In traditional machinery arrangement contra rotating propellers are rare due to cost and complexity br In ABB produced a product for large power installations the forward propeller is on a traditional shaft line while the aft propeller is in an ABB Azipod br At lower power levels contra rotating mechanical azimuth thrusters are one possibility convenient for CRP due to their inherent bevel gear construction Rolls Royce and Steerprop have offered CRP versions of their products br br br See also br Contra rotating marine propellers br Toroidal propeller looped propeller br
