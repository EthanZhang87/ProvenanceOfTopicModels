DAF Trucks is a Dutch truck manufacturing company and a division of Paccar DAF originally stood for van Doorne s Aanhangwagen Fabriek Its headquarters and main plant are in Eindhoven Cabs and axle assemblies are produced at its Westerlo plant in Belgium Some of the truck models sold with the DAF brand are designed and built by Leyland Trucks at its Leyland plant in the United Kingdom br br br History br br In Hubert Hub van Doorne founded the company Commanditaire Vennootschap Hub van Doorne s Machinefabriek His co founder and investor was A H Huenges managing director of a brewery Van Doorne had repaired Huenges car several times and Huenges pleased with his work offered to finance him in business Hub started to work in a small workshop on the grounds of the brewery br In the company by then run by Hub and his brother Wim van Doorne changed its name to Van Doorne s Aanhangwagen Fabriek Van Doorne s Trailer Factory abbreviated to DAF Huenges left the company in and the DAF company was then completely in the hands of the van Doorne brothers br DAF developed the Trado conversions to convert Ford trucks to an off road drive One of DAF s few armoured vehicles the M Pantserwagen used developments of this Trado drivetrain M production came too late for World War II in the invasion of the Netherlands only three saw combat br After World War II luxury cars and trucks were very scarce This meant a big opportunity for DAF In the company started making trucks trailers and buses changing its name to Van Doorne s Automobiel Fabriek Van Doorne s Automobile Factory The first lorry model was the DAF A br Through the s DAF was a major supplier to the re equipping of the Dutch Army s softskin vehicles with models such as the DAF YA and DAF YA Dikke Daf These used the all wheel drive H drive developed from the Trado conversions br In late Hub van Doorne had the idea to use belt driven continuously variable transmissions like so many belt driven machines in factories to drive road vehicles In DAF produced its first draft of a car belt drive system Over the next few years the design was developed and refined In February DAF demonstrated a small belt driven four seater car at the Dutch car show the AutoRAI br The public reaction was very positive and cars were ordered In DAF started selling the world s first car with a continuously variable transmission the small four seater DAF This was the first of a series of models to be released in subsequent years including the DAF DAF DAF and DAF all using the innovative Variomatic transmission system br In DAF opened a new plant in Born for car production The was the first model to be produced there br In International Harvester of Chicago bought a stake in DAF with the Dutch government holding and the Van Doorne family holding the remaining forming a joint venture This agreement lasted until DAF sold its passenger car division along with what is now the Nedcar factory in Born in to the Swedish company Volvo Cars leaving DAF to concentrate on its successful line of trucks br In DAF merged with the Leyland Trucks division of Rover Group which included Freight Rover and in June was floated on the Dutch and London Stock Exchanges as DAF NV The new company traded as Leyland DAF in the United Kingdom and as DAF elsewhere br DAF Bus was split off in to become a part of United Bus Following difficulties in the British market After DAF NV was placed under administration in February the Dutch operations were sold in a management buyout with the business branded DAF Trucks br In October Paccar acquired DAF Trucks DAF Trucks and Leyland Trucks were rejoined in June when Paccar also acquired Leyland Trucks br On January Paccar installed the cornerstone of the new plant in the city of Ponta Grossa in the state of Paran Brazil br DAF now has a net worth of billion dollars br br br Car business br br The first passenger car the DAF was presented to the public in February It featured unitary steel construction with a front mounted air cooled two cylinder boxer engine driving the rear wheels through a centrifugal clutch and the Variomatic CVT transmission The way this was constructed eliminated the need for a differential with the drivebelts taking up the difference of speed in turns br This acted as a limited slip differential The car had independent suspension all around with MacPherson struts and a transverse leaf spring at the front and a coil sprung semi trailing arm design at the rear The first s rolled off the production line in the following year The next model was the featuring a larger cc cu in twin br Later DAF produced a more luxurious type called the Daffodil divided into three models assigned the numbers DAF DAF and DAF The designation was changed to upon the release of the a larger middle class vehicle designed by Giovanni Michelotti br The featured a completely new design aesthetically as well as mechanically but was of the same layout as the A types the and with the main difference being its cc cu in two cylinder engine and its full swingaxle rear axle design as opposed to the A type semi trailing arms br The DAF carried a bigger water cooled cc cu in OHV four cylinder engine derived from the Renault Cleon engine Its body design was altered from the by a new front which accommodated the longer engine and radiator bigger taillights and a more plush interior The front suspension was changed from a transverse leaf spring to MacPherson struts with torsion springs and an antiroll bar br The DAF was introduced as a successor to the It featured new boxy styling of the front and a new rear axle design The two drive belts now powered a differential and the axle was changed from a swingaxle design to a leaf sprung de Dion axle It was a major improvement over the tricky handling of the swing axles of the earlier and models br Volvo purchased a percent stake in DAF in December with the intent of taking a larger interest They increased their holdings to on January taking over the company and the Nedcar plant Volvo dropped the and models and later rebadged the DAF as the Volvo with bigger bumpers and a safety steering wheel br The DAF was developed with Volvo s assistance and was basically a with the rear axle of a and a single belt Variomatic half the s transmission A big weakness of this system is that a failed drive belt would cripple the car The last DAF design codenamed P initially intended to be the DAF was developed during the transition to Volvo ownership and was ultimately launched as the Volvo series in firstly as the Volvo three door hatchback with the Variomatic transmission br After initial slow sales the range was expanded into the with a five door variant and the availability of manual transmission and the range became a sales success eventually surpassing million units by the time production ceased in The subsequent Volvo and the first generation S V models were also made at the Nedcar plant until Volvo sold its interest to Mitsubishi Motors in marking the end of Volvo s involvement with the former DAF plant after almost thirty years Today the plant is now owned by VDL Nedcar and contract manufactures certain Mini models for BMW br br br Prototypes and special cars br For a small company DAF made a huge number of prototypes Also famous coachbuilders like Giovanni Michelotti and OSI made cars based on DAF mechanicals For instance the OSI City Car which turned into a miniature There was also Michelotti s Shellette beach car which was later modified to use Fiat underpinnings The Dutch Royal Family used one of these at their Porto Ercole summer residence br br br Truck business br br DAF produced its first truck the A in This truck was upgraded in the following years Their first attempt into the international market was a failure the DO Their next truck was the which became a big seller with its well equipped but practical cabin They also produced a so called torpedo front tractor br In the s a new modular tilting cab called the F was introduced on the F F range of vehicles Three years later the wider F which featured DAF s characteristic three wiper windscreen was introduced as the DAF This design lasted until the introduction of the style cab in There was also a lighter narrower version called the F which was introduced in on the F and F but this short lived model was replaced after only three years In DAF truck production was this increased to in calendar year br DAF was also one of the first to introduce an intercooled turbocharged diesel engine into their trucks which in these years became very evident with their Their largest litre cu in six cylinder turbodiesel was based on the old Leyland O motor It was to be DAF s standard large engine long into the nineties br DAF s series was launched in and quickly gained the coveted Truck of The Year award The featured an all new cab developed jointly with ENASA of Spain called Cabtec a revised version of the litre ATI engine rated at or hp metric and speed ZF Friedrichshafen gearbox On the Continent Eaton s Twinsplitter gearbox was an option A full range of axle configurations were offered to suit every operating requirement br Much attention was paid to soundproofing the gearlinkage for example was telescopic whilst in cab noise levels on the put many luxury saloons to shame An update in saw new power ratings of and hp a hp variant along with low deck tractor unit models and revised interior trim were introduced in the spring of br Two years later after an intensive study of the ultra long haul market sector DAF unveiled the Super Spacecab at the RAI show The series cabin had gained height and length and sat atop Cummins litre N rated at bhp ZF s new Aluminium cased S gearbox was fitted with optional Intarder An innovation was the hydraulic gearshift developed with Konsberg of Norway br Within an overall height of m the Super

tractor or drawbar rigid with LHD only though the Super Spacecab was available on litre engined models The is now a very rare truck which is surprising given the original list price of br The basic
