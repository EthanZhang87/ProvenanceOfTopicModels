A petrol engine gasoline engine in American and Canadian English is an internal combustion engine designed to run on petrol gasoline Petrol engines can often be adapted to also run on fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas and ethanol blends such as E and E br Most petrol engines use spark ignition unlike diesel engines which typically use compression ignition Another key difference to diesel engines is that petrol engines typically have a lower compression ratio br br br History br br The first practical petrol engine was built in in Germany by Nicolaus August Otto and Eugen Langen although there had been earlier attempts by tienne Lenoir in Siegfried Marcus in and George Brayton in br br br Design br br br Thermodynamic cycle br br Most petrol engines use either the four stroke Otto cycle or the two stroke cycle Petrol engines have also been produced using the Miller cycle and Atkinson cycle br br br Layout br Most petrol powered piston engines are straight engines or V engines However flat engines W engines and other layouts are sometimes used br Wankel engines are classified by the number of rotors used br br br Compression ratio br br br Cooling br br Petrol engines are either air cooled or water cooled br br br Ignition br br Petrol engines use spark ignition High voltage for the spark this may be provided by a magneto or an ignition coil In modern car engines the ignition timing is managed by an electronic Engine Control Unit Ignition modules can also function as a rev limiter in some cases to prevent overrevving and the consequences of it such as valve float and connecting rod failure br br br Primer br Primers may be used to help start the engine They can draw fuel from fuel tanks and vaporize fuel directly into piston cylinders Engines are difficult to start during cold weather and the fuel primer helps because otherwise there will not be enough heat available to vaporize the fuel in the carburetor br br br Power output and efficiency br br The power output of small and medium sized petrol engines along with equivalent engines using other fuels is usually measured in kilowatts or horsepower br Typically petrol engines have a thermodynamic efficiency of about approximately half that of some diesel engines br br br Applications br Applications of petrol engines include automobiles motorcycles aircraft motorboats and small engines such as lawn mowers chainsaws and portable generators Petrol engines have also been used as pony engines a type of engine used to start a larger stationary diesel engine br br br See also br Diesel engine br Electric motor br Hydrogen engine br Jet engine br br br
