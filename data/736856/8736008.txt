Assar Thorvald Nathanael Gabrielsson August May was a Swedish industrialist and co founder of Volvo br br br Early life br Gabrielsson was born on August in Korsberga Skaraborg County Sweden the son of Gabriel Nathanael Gabrielsson and Anna Helmina Larsson who married on April The father was a manager at Korsberga brickworks and later became a leaseholder of Sp nnefalla farm near the dairy in Tibro where he started an egg shop Assar Gabrielsson was the first child of three He had a brother five years younger B rje Gabrielsson who in parallel with Assar was the managing director of Astra for thirty years He passed studentexamen in and graduated from Stockholm School of Economics in br br br Career br Assar Gabrielsson held a bachelor s degree in economics and worked as a sales manager with bearing manufacturer SKF in Gothenburg in the early s He was employed in by Bj rn Prytz at the sales department and was appointed sales manager for the entire SKF company group on June He held that position until the new automobile company AB Volvo was founded as a subsidiary company within the SKF company group br br br Volvo the automobile project br In June when Assar Gabrielsson met his old friend Gustaf Larson in Stockholm he unveiled his plans to establish the manufacturing of a new Swedish automobile Gustaf Larson had worked for SKF between and but now worked for the company AB Galco in Stockholm They made an agreement in August at the Sturehof restaurant in Stockholm signed in a written contract more than one year later on December In this contract Gustav was supposed to carry out the engineering work for a new car as well as an investment plan for a new manufacturing plant with the stipulation that he would only be rewarded for his work in the event that the project succeeds at least cars were produced in this new plant and that this was to be achieved before January This famous contract shows that Assar Gabrielsson owned the project and that it was a high risk project without any guarantees Assar took the economic risks himself and Gustav in the worst case would have worked on the project without being rewarded but would still have his salary from AB Galco in Stockholm Most of the startup capital Assar intended to use for the project was extra sales commissions that he had saved from his time as managing director for the SKF subsidiary in Paris from to br br br Back to br The original idea presented by Assar to SKF consisted of a few main points the central idea was to start an automobile manufacturing business within SKF to gain advantages over competitors when developing new bearings for the automobile industry which would also lead to increased sales of bearings and in turn lead to positive effects on Swedish industry as a whole He developed these ideas during the time he worked as managing director for the SKF subsidiary company in Paris when he discovered that competing bearing companies in Europe had started to invest a large amount in automobile companies in order to secure their sales to key customers However Gabrielsson failed to convince the board of SKF about his ideas as SKF s core business model was the manufacturing of bearings with no room for the incorporation of an automobile company Assar then decided to build a test series of ten vehicles with his own financing to later present the vehicles and an entire investment plan to SKF The idea to build a pre series of ten vehicles was most certainly related to the fact that no company would have given them an offer for the components engines gearboxes chassis components etc with a lesser quantity and because Assar was certain that SKF would approve his plans in due time Engineering documentation and investment planning was carried out exactly in the same way as if it had been carried out by SKF in order to prepare for the set up of a new automobile company Assar had the full support from the managing director of SKF Mr Bj rn Prytz as long as his private project did not interfere with his work as sales manager at SKF br The first ten pre series vehicles model V were designed and assembled in Stockholm at AB Galco under the supervision of Gustav Larson at that time still having his other work at AB Galco to attend to A design office often called Volvo s first design office was established in one room of Gustav Larson s private apartment at R dmansgatan in Stockholm The design work started in the autumn of and a number of engineers were involved among them engineer Jan G Smith that had returned from America in and later engineer Henry Westerberg All the invoices related to the project was sent to Assar s private address at Kungsportsavenyn in Gothenburg In a lot of orders that Gustav Larsson made himself he referred to Assar Gabrielsson as a guarantee that the deliveries would be paid by him personally These details shows that the Volvo automobile project in the beginning was a true private project not sponsored by SKF from an economic point of view br The first prototype car was ready in June Assar and Gustav took that first car and drove themselves on bumpy roads down to SKF in Gothenburg to show the SKF board and now present the final investment plan br br br The automobile company AB Volvo is founded br At a board meeting held in Hofors Sweden on August SKF decided to use the old subsidiary company Volvo AB for the automobile project AB Volvo that was first registered in on the initiative of Bj rn Prytz was originally set up to be used for a special series of ball bearings for the American market but it was never really used for this purpose A small series of ball bearings stamped with Volvo was manufactured but it was never introduced on a larger scale A contract was signed on August between SKF and Assar stipulating that all ten prototype cars engineering drawings calculations etc should be handed over to Volvo AB and Assar in return would be refunded most of his private investments for the prototype cars In other words Assar Gabrielsson sold his project to AB Volvo The contract was signed by Bj rn Prytz managing director of SKF and Assar Gabrielsson In the original contract from December Assar stated that he might sell the automobile project to any company that would be interested but of course hoped that SKF would be the company to stand first in line Larsson also finally got paid for the initial engineering work with the V according to the private contract he and Assar had signed on December br Assar Gabrielsson left his position as sales manager for SKF and was appointed president and managing director for the new Volvo AB on January Gustav Larson was at the same time appointed vice president and technical manager and left his employment at AB Galco in Stockholm br br br The first series produced Volvo V br On April at about p m the first series produced V left the new established factory on Hisingen in Gothenburg br The ten prototype cars that had been assembled in Stockholm were never sold except for one that was sold to Volvo s photographer Sven Sj stedt and was later donated to the Volvo Industrial Museum around but was used as transportation vehicles within the manufacturing plant and as test benches for new developed components during the first years br br br Economic problems br Volvo did not show any profit for the first couple years and SKF invested a large amount of capital to keep the company running Seeing the need to diversify in the production of trucks began with the basic chassis components from V The production of trucks was small scale in the beginning but the concept was successful from start Regardless in late SKF nearly sold the company to Charles Nash president of Nash Motors in the United States Bj rn Prytz and Assar Gabrielsson managed to convince the SKF board to call the deal off just one day before Charles Nash arrived by boat to Gothenburg Charles Nash and Assar Gabrielsson became good friends during his visit in Sweden and Assar later visited Nash in America on several occasions to discuss the automobile business By the end of AB Volvo showed a small profit for the first time In SKF came to the conclusion that AB Volvo was ready to stand on its own feet as a public company introducing Volvo to the Stockholm stock exchange With this move SKF relieved themselves of a majority of their shares and could now concentrate on their core business development and manufacturing of bearings br br br Volvo finally a success br When Assar celebrated his th birthday in the th Volvo car was delivered It took ten years to produce the first cars but only four years for the next cars In just after the end of the Second World War the modern family car PV was introduced with a completely new design The PV was an immediate sales success The company now stood on solid ground and the production of both cars and trucks was increasing fast br br br The last years br Assar
