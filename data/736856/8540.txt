title: Diesel engine
id: 8540
The diesel engine named after Rudolf Diesel is an internal combustion engine in which ignition of the fuel is caused by the elevated temperature of the air in the cylinder due to mechanical compression thus the diesel engine is called a compression ignition engine CI engine This contrasts with engines using spark plug ignition of the air fuel mixture such as a petrol engine gasoline engine or a gas engine using a gaseous fuel like natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas br br br Introduction br Diesel engines work by compressing only air or air plus residual combustion gases from the exhaust known as exhaust gas recirculation EGR Air is inducted into the chamber during the intake stroke and compressed during the compression stroke This increases the air temperature inside the cylinder so that atomised diesel fuel injected into the combustion chamber ignites With the fuel being injected into the air just before combustion the dispersion of the fuel is uneven this is called a heterogeneous air fuel mixture The torque a diesel engine produces is controlled by manipulating the air fuel ratio instead of throttling the intake air the diesel engine relies on altering the amount of fuel that is injected and the air fuel ratio is usually high br The diesel engine has the highest thermal efficiency engine efficiency of any practical internal or external combustion engine due to its very high expansion ratio and inherent lean burn which enables heat dissipation by the excess air A small efficiency loss is also avoided compared with non direct injection gasoline engines since unburned fuel is not present during valve overlap and therefore no fuel goes directly from the intake injection to the exhaust Low speed diesel engines as used in ships and other applications where overall engine weight is relatively unimportant can reach effective efficiencies of up to The combined cycle gas turbine Brayton and Rankine cycle is a combustion engine that is more efficient than a diesel engine but it is due to its mass and dimensions unsuited for vehicles watercraft or aircraft The world s largest diesel engines put in service are cylinder two stroke marine diesel engines they produce a peak power of almost MW each br Diesel engines may be designed with either two stroke or four stroke combustion cycles They were originally used as a more efficient replacement for stationary steam engines Since the s they have been used in submarines and ships Use in locomotives buses trucks heavy equipment agricultural equipment and electricity generation plants followed later In the s they slowly began to be used in a few automobiles Since the s energy crisis demand for higher fuel efficiency has resulted in most major automakers at some point offering diesel powered models even in very small cars According to Konrad Reif the EU average for diesel cars at the time accounted for half of newly registered cars However air pollution emissions are harder to control in diesel engines than in gasoline engines so the use of diesel auto engines in the U S is now largely relegated to larger on road and off road vehicles br Though aviation has traditionally avoided diesel engines aircraft diesel engines have become increasingly available in the st century Since the late s for various reasons including the diesel s normal advantages over gasoline engines but also for recent issues peculiar to aviation development and production of diesel engines for aircraft has surged with over such engines delivered worldwide between and particularly for light airplanes and unmanned aerial vehicles br br br History br br br Diesel s idea br br In Rudolf Diesel who was a student at the Polytechnikum in Munich attended the lectures of Carl von Linde Linde explained that steam engines are capable of converting just of the heat energy into work but that the Carnot cycle allows conversion of much more of the heat energy into work by means of isothermal change in condition According to Diesel this ignited the idea of creating a highly efficient engine that could work on the Carnot cycle Diesel was also introduced to a fire piston a traditional fire starter using rapid adiabatic compression principles which Linde had acquired from Southeast Asia After several years of working on his ideas Diesel published them in in the essay Theory and Construction of a Rational Heat Motor br Diesel was heavily criticised for his essay but only a few found the mistake that he made his rational heat motor was supposed to utilise a constant temperature cycle with isothermal compression that would require a much higher level of compression than that needed for compression ignition Diesel s idea was to compress the air so tightly that the temperature of the air would exceed that of combustion However such an engine could never perform any usable work In his US patent granted in Diesel describes the compression required for his cycle br br pure atmospheric air is compressed according to curve to such a degree that before ignition or combustion takes place the highest pressure of the diagram and the highest temperature are obtained that is to say the temperature at which the subsequent combustion has to take place not the burning or igniting point To make this more clear let it be assumed that the subsequent combustion shall take place at a temperature of Then in that case the initial pressure must be sixty four atmospheres or for centigrade the pressure must be ninety atmospheres and so on Into the air thus compressed is then gradually introduced from the exterior finely divided fuel which ignites on introduction since the air is at a temperature far above the igniting point of the fuel The characteristic features of the cycle according to my present invention are therefore increase of pressure and temperature up to the maximum not by combustion but prior to combustion by mechanical compression of air and there upon the subsequent performance of work without increase of pressure and temperature by gradual combustion during a prescribed part of the stroke determined by the cut oil br By June Diesel had realised his original cycle would not work and he adopted the constant pressure cycle Diesel describes the cycle in his patent application Notice that there is no longer a mention of compression temperatures exceeding the temperature of combustion Now it is simply stated that the compression must be sufficient to trigger ignition br br In an internal combustion engine the combination of a cylinder and piston constructed and arranged to compress air to a degree producing a temperature above the igniting point of the fuel a supply for compressed air or gas a fuel supply a distributing valve for fuel a passage from the air supply to the cylinder in communication with the fuel distributing valve an inlet to the cylinder in communication with the air supply and with the fuel valve and a cut oil substantially as described br In Diesel received patents in Germany Switzerland the United Kingdom and the United States for Method of and Apparatus for Converting Heat into Work In and he filed patents and addenda in various countries for his engine the first patents were issued in Spain No France No and Belgium No in December and in Germany No in and the United States No in br Diesel was attacked and criticised over a time period of several years Critics claimed that Diesel never invented a new motor and that the invention of the diesel engine is fraud Otto K hler and Emil Capitaine were two of the most prominent critics of Diesel s time K hler had published an essay in in which he describes an engine similar to the engine Diesel describes in his essay K hler figured that such an engine could not perform any work Emil Capitaine had built a petroleum engine with glow tube ignition in the early s he claimed against his own better judgement that his glow tube ignition engine worked the same way Diesel s engine did His claims were unfounded and he lost a patent lawsuit against Diesel Other engines such as the Akroyd engine and the Brayton engine also use an operating cycle that is different from the diesel engine cycle Friedrich Sass says that the diesel engine is Diesel s very own work and that any Diesel myth is falsification of history br br br The first diesel engine br Diesel sought out firms and factories that would build his engine With the help of Moritz Schr ter and Max Gutermuth he succeeded in convincing both Krupp in Essen and the Maschinenfabrik Augsburg Contracts were signed in April and in early summer Diesel s first prototype engine was built in Augsburg On August the first ignition took place the fuel used was petrol In winter Diesel redesigned the existing engine and by January his mechanics had converted it into the second prototype During January that year an air blast injection system was added to the engine s cylinder head and tested Friedrich Sass argues that it can be presumed that Diesel copied the concept of air blast injection from George B Brayton albeit that Diesel substantially improved the system On February the redesigned engine ran for revolutions one minute with this news Maschinenfabrik Augsburg s stock rose by indicative of the tremendous anticipated demands for a more efficient engine On June the engine achieved an effective efficiency of and had a fuel consumption of g kW h br However despite proving the concept the engine caused problems and Diesel could not achieve any substantial progress Therefore Krupp considered rescinding the contract they had made with Diesel Diesel was forced to improve the design of his engine and rushed to construct a third prototype engine Between November and December the second prototype had successfully covered over hours on the test bench In the January report this was considered a success br In February Diesel considered supercharging the third prototype Imanuel Lauster who was ordered to draw the third prototype Motor had finished the drawings by April During summer that year the engine was built it was completed on October Tests were conducted until early First public tests began on February Moritz Schr ter s test on February was the main test of Diesel s engine The engine was rated kW with a specific fuel consumption of g kW h

emissions controls only during laboratory emissions testing br br br Operating principle br br br Overview br The characteristics of a diesel engine are br br Use of compression ignition instead of an ignition apparatus such as a spark plug br Internal mixture formation In diesel engines the mixture of air and fuel is only formed inside the combustion chamber br Quality torque control The amount of torque a diesel engine produces is not controlled by throttling the intake air unlike a traditional spark ignition petrol engine where the airflow is reduced in order to regulate the torque output instead the volume of air entering the engine is maximised at all times and the torque output is regulated solely by controlling the amount of injected fuel br High air fuel ratio Diesel engines run at global air fuel ratios significantly leaner than the stoichiometric ratio br Diffusion flame At combustion oxygen first has to diffuse into the flame rather than having oxygen and fuel already mixed before combustion which would result in a premixed flame br Heterogeneous air fuel mixture In diesel engines there is no even dispersion of fuel and air inside the cylinder That is because the combustion process begins at the end of the injection phase before a homogeneous mixture of air and fuel can be formed br Preference for the fuel to have a high ignition performance Cetane number rather than a high knocking resistance octane rating that is preferred for petrol engines br br br Thermodynamic cycle br br The diesel internal combustion engine differs from the gasoline powered Otto cycle by using highly compressed hot air to ignite the fuel rather than using a spark plug compression ignition rather than spark ignition br In the diesel engine only air is initially introduced into the combustion chamber The air is then compressed with a compression ratio typically between and This high compression causes the temperature of the air to rise At about the top of the compression stroke fuel is injected directly into the compressed air in the combustion chamber This may be into a typically toroidal void in the top of the piston or a pre chamber depending upon the design of the engine The fuel injector ensures that the fuel is broken down into small droplets and that the fuel is distributed evenly The heat of the compressed air vaporises fuel from the surface of the droplets The vapour is then ignited by the heat from the compressed air in the combustion chamber the droplets continue to vaporise from their surfaces and burn getting smaller until all the fuel in the droplets has been burnt Combustion occurs at a substantially constant pressure during the initial part of the power stroke The start of vaporisation causes a delay before ignition and the characteristic diesel knocking sound as the vapour reaches ignition temperature and causes an abrupt increase in pressure above the piston not shown on the P V indicator diagram When combustion is complete the combustion gases expand as the piston descends further the high pressure in the cylinder drives the piston downward supplying power to the crankshaft br As well as the high level of compression allowing combustion to take place without a separate ignition system a high compression ratio greatly increases the engine s efficiency Increasing the compression ratio in a spark ignition engine where fuel and air are mixed before entry to the cylinder is limited by the need to prevent pre ignition which would cause engine damage Since only air is compressed in a diesel engine and fuel is not introduced into the cylinder until shortly before top dead centre TDC premature detonation is not a problem and compression ratios are much higher br br The pressure volume diagram pV diagram is a simplified and idealised representation of the events involved in a diesel engine cycle arranged to illustrate the similarity with a Carnot cycle Starting at the piston is at bottom dead centre and both valves are closed at the start of the compression stroke the cylinder contains air at atmospheric pressure Between and the air is compressed adiabatically that is without heat transfer to or from the environment by the rising piston This is only approximately true since there will be some heat exchange with the cylinder walls During this compression the volume is reduced the pressure and temperature both rise At or slightly before TDC fuel is injected and burns in the compressed hot air Chemical energy is released and this constitutes an injection of thermal energy heat into the compressed gas Combustion and heating occur between and In this interval the pressure remains constant since the piston descends and the volume increases the temperature rises as a consequence of the energy of combustion At fuel injection and combustion are complete and the cylinder contains gas at a higher temperature than at Between and this hot gas expands again approximately adiabatically Work is done on the system to which the engine is connected During this expansion phase the volume of the gas rises and its temperature and pressure both fall At the exhaust valve opens and the pressure falls abruptly to atmospheric approximately This is unresisted expansion and no useful work is done by it Ideally the adiabatic expansion should continue extending the line to the right until the pressure falls to that of the surrounding air but the loss of efficiency caused by this unresisted expansion is justified by the practical difficulties involved in recovering it the engine would have to be much larger After the opening of the exhaust valve the exhaust stroke follows but this and the following induction stroke are not shown on the diagram If shown they would be represented by a low pressure loop at the bottom of the diagram At it is assumed that the exhaust and induction strokes have been completed and the cylinder is again filled with air The piston cylinder system absorbs energy between and this is the work needed to compress the air in the cylinder and is provided by mechanical kinetic energy stored in the flywheel of the engine Work output is done by the piston cylinder combination between and The difference between these two increments of work is the indicated work output per cycle and is represented by the area enclosed by the pV loop The adiabatic expansion is in a higher pressure range than that of the compression because the gas in the cylinder is hotter during expansion than during compression It is for this reason that the loop has a finite area and the net output of work during a cycle is positive br br br Efficiency br The fuel efficiency of diesel engines is better than most other types of combustion engines due to their high compression ratio high air fuel equivalence ratio and the lack of intake air restrictions i e throttle valves Theoretically the highest possible efficiency for a diesel engine is However in practice the efficiency is much lower with efficiencies of up to for passenger car engines up to for large truck and bus engines and up to for large two stroke marine engines The average efficiency over a motor vehicle driving cycle is lower than the diesel engine s peak efficiency for example a average efficiency for an engine with a peak efficiency of That is because the fuel efficiency of a diesel engine drops at lower loads however it does not drop quite as fast as the Otto spark ignition engine s br br br Emissions br br Diesel engines are combustion engines and therefore emit combustion products in their exhaust gas Due to incomplete combustion diesel engine exhaust gases include carbon monoxide hydrocarbons particulate matter and nitrogen oxides pollutants About per cent of the pollutants can be removed from the exhaust gas using exhaust gas treatment technology Road vehicle diesel engines have no sulfur dioxide emissions because motor vehicle diesel fuel has been sulfur free since Helmut Tsch ke argues that particulate matter emitted from motor vehicles has negative impacts on human health br The particulate matter in diesel exhaust emissions is sometimes classified as a carcinogen or probable carcinogen and is known to increase the risk of heart and respiratory diseases br br br Electrical system br In principle a diesel engine does not require any sort of electrical system However most modern diesel engines are equipped with an electrical fuel pump and an electronic engine control unit br However there is no high voltage electrical ignition system present in a diesel engine This eliminates a source of radio frequency emissions which can interfere with navigation and communication equipment which is why only diesel powered vehicles are allowed in some parts of the American National Radio Quiet Zone br br br Torque control br To control the torque output at any given time i e when the driver of a car adjusts the accelerator pedal a governor adjusts the amount of fuel injected into the engine Mechanical governors have been used in the past however electronic governors are more common on modern engines Mechanical governors are usually driven by the engine s accessory belt or a gear drive system and use a combination of springs and weights to control fuel delivery relative to both load and speed Electronically governed engines use an electronic control unit ECU or electronic control module ECM to control the fuel delivery The ECM ECU uses various sensors such as engine speed signal intake manifold pressure and fuel temperature to determine the amount of fuel injected into the engine br Due to the amount of air being constant for a given RPM while the amount of fuel varies very high lean air fuel ratios are used in situations where minimal torque output is required This differs from a petrol engine where a throttle is used to also reduce the amount of intake air as part of regulating the engine s torque output Controlling the timing of the start of injection of fuel into the cylinder is similar to controlling the ignition timing in a petrol engine It is therefore a key factor in controlling the power output fuel consumption and exhaust emissions br br br Classification br There are several different ways of categorising diesel engines as outlined in the following sections br br br RPM operating range br G nter Mau categorises diesel engines by their rotational speeds into three groups br br High speed engines rpm br Medium speed engines rpm and br Slow speed engines rpm br High speed diesel engines br High speed engines are used to power trucks lorries buses tractors cars yachts compressors pumps and small electrical generators As of most high speed engines have direct injection Many modern engines particularly in on highway applications have common rail direct injection On bigger ships high speed diesel engines are often used for powering electric generators The highest power output of high speed diesel engines is approximately MW br br Medium speed diesel engines br br Medium speed engines are used in large electrical generators railway diesel locomotives ship propulsion and mechanical drive applications such as large compressors or pumps Medium speed diesel engines operate on either diesel fuel or heavy fuel oil by direct injection in the same manner as low speed engines Usually they are four stroke engines with trunk pistons a notable exception being the EMD and engines which are all two stroke br The power output of medium speed diesel engines can be as high as kW with the effective efficiency being around Most larger medium speed engines are started with compressed air direct on pistons using an air distributor as opposed to a pneumatic starting motor acting on the flywheel which tends to be used for smaller engines br Medium speed engines intended for marine applications are usually used to power ro ro ferries passenger ships or small freight ships Using medium speed engines reduces the cost of smaller ships and increases their transport capacity In addition to that a single ship can use two smaller engines instead of one big engine which increases the ship s safety br br Low speed diesel engines br br Low speed diesel engines are usually very large in size and mostly used to power ships There are two different types of low speed engines that are commonly used Two stroke engines with a crosshead and four stroke engines with a regular trunk piston Two stroke engines have a limited rotational frequency and their charge exchange is more difficult which means that they are usually bigger than four stroke engines and used to directly power a ship s propeller br Four stroke engines on ships are usually used to power an electric generator An electric motor powers the propeller Both types are usually very undersquare meaning the bore is smaller than the stroke Low speed diesel engines as used in ships and other applications where overall engine weight is relatively unimportant often have an effective efficiency of up to Like medium speed engines low speed engines are started with compressed air and they use heavy oil as their primary fuel br br br Combustion cycle br br Four stroke engines use the combustion cycle described earlier Most smaller diesels for vehicular use for instance typically use the four stroke cycle This is due to several factors such as the two stroke design s narrow powerband which is not particularly suitable for automotive use and the necessity for complicated and expensive built in lubrication systems and scavenging measures The cost effectiveness and proportion of added weight of these technologies has less of an impact on larger more expensive engines while engines intended for shipping or stationary use can be run at a single speed for long periods br Two stroke engines use a combustion cycle which is completed in two strokes instead of four strokes Filling the cylinder with air and compressing it takes place in one stroke and the power and exhaust strokes are combined The compression in a two stroke diesel engine is similar to the compression that takes place in a four stroke diesel engine As the piston passes through bottom centre and starts upward compression commences culminating in fuel injection and ignition Instead of a full set of valves two stroke diesel engines have simple intake ports and exhaust ports or exhaust valves When the piston approaches bottom dead centre both the intake and the exhaust ports are open which means that there is atmospheric pressure inside the cylinder Therefore some sort of pump is required to blow the air into the cylinder and the combustion gasses into the exhaust This process is called scavenging The pressure required is approximately kPa br Due to the lack of discrete exhaust and intake strokes all two stroke diesel engines use a scavenge blower or some form of compressor to charge the cylinders with air and assist in scavenging Roots type superchargers were used for ship engines until the mid s however since they have been widely replaced by turbochargers Usually a two stroke ship diesel engine has a single stage turbocharger with a turbine that has an axial inflow and a radial outflow br br br Scavenging in two stroke engines br In general there are three types of scavenging possible br br Uniflow scavenging br Crossflow scavenging br Reverse flow scavenging br Crossflow scavenging is incomplete and limits the stroke yet some manufacturers used it Reverse flow scavenging is a very simple way of scavenging and it was popular amongst manufacturers until the early s Uniflow scavenging is more complicated to make but allows the highest fuel efficiency since the early s manufacturers such as MAN and Sulzer have switched to this system It is standard for modern marine two stroke diesel engines br br br Fuel used br br So called dual fuel diesel engines or gas diesel engines burn two different types of fuel simultaneously for instance a gaseous fuel and diesel engine fuel The diesel engine fuel auto ignites due to compression ignition and then ignites the gaseous fuel Such engines do not require any type of spark ignition and operate similar to regular diesel engines br br br Fuel injection br The fuel is injected at high pressure into either the combustion chamber swirl chamber or pre chamber unlike petrol engines where the fuel is often added in the inlet manifold or carburetor Engines where the fuel is injected into the main combustion chamber are called direct injection DI engines while those which use a swirl chamber or pre chamber are called indirect injection IDI engines br br br Direct injection br br Most direct injection diesel engines have a combustion cup in the top of the piston where the fuel is sprayed Many different methods of injection can be used Usually an engine with helix controlled mechanic direct injection has either an inline or a distributor injection pump For each engine cylinder the corresponding plunger in the fuel pump measures out the correct amount of fuel and determines the timing of each injection These engines use injectors that are very precise spring loaded valves that open and close at a specific fuel pressure Separate high pressure fuel lines connect the fuel pump with each cylinder Fuel volume for each single combustion is controlled by a slanted groove in the plunger which rotates only a few degrees releasing the pressure and is controlled by a mechanical governor consisting of weights rotating at engine speed constrained by springs and a lever The injectors are held open by the fuel pressure On high speed engines the plunger pumps are together in one unit The length of fuel lines from the pump to each injector is normally the same for each cylinder in order to obtain the same pressure delay Direct injected diesel engines usually use orifice type fuel injectors br Electronic control of the fuel injection transformed the direct injection engine by allowing much greater control over the combustion br br Common rail br Common rail CR direct injection systems do not have the fuel metering pressure raising and delivery functions in a single unit as in the case of a Bosch distributor type pump for example A high pressure pump supplies the CR The requirements of each cylinder injector are supplied from this common high pressure reservoir of fuel An Electronic Diesel Control EDC controls both rail pressure and injections depending on engine operating conditions The injectors of older CR systems have solenoid driven plungers for lifting the injection needle whilst newer CR injectors use plungers driven by piezoelectric actuators that have less moving mass and therefore allow even more injections in a very short period of time Early common rail system were controlled by mechanical means br The injection pressure of modern CR systems ranges from MPa to MPa br br br Indirect injection br br An indirect diesel injection system IDI engine delivers fuel into a small chamber called a swirl chamber precombustion chamber pre chamber or ante chamber which is connected to the cylinder by a narrow air passage Generally the goal of the pre chamber is to create increased turbulence for better air fuel mixing This system also allows for a smoother quieter running engine and because fuel mixing is assisted by turbulence injector pressures can be lower Most IDI systems use a single orifice injector The pre chamber has the disadvantage of lowering efficiency due to increased heat loss to the engine s cooling system restricting the combustion burn thus reducing the efficiency by IDI engines are also more difficult to start and usually require the use of glow plugs IDI engines may be cheaper to build but generally require a higher compression ratio than the DI counterpart IDI also makes it easier to produce smooth quieter running engines with a simple mechanical injection system since exact injection timing is not as critical Most modern automotive engines are DI which have the benefits of greater efficiency and easier starting however IDI engines can still be found in the many ATV and small diesel applications Indirect injected diesel engines use pintle type fuel injectors br br br Air blast injection br br Early diesel engines injected fuel with the assistance of compressed air which atomised the fuel and forced it into the engine through a nozzle a similar principle to an aerosol spray The nozzle opening was closed by a pin valve actuated by the camshaft Although the engine was also required to drive an air compressor used for air blast injection the efficiency was nonetheless better than other combustion engines of the time However the system was heavy and it was slow to react to changing torque demands making it unsuitable for road vehicles br br br Unit injectors br br A unit injector system also known as Pumpe D se pump nozzle in German combines the injector and fuel pump into a single component which is positioned above each cylinder This eliminates the high pressure fuel lines and achieves a more consistent injection Under full load the injection pressure can reach up to MPa Unit injectors are operated by a cam and the quantity of fuel injected is controlled either mechanically by a rack or lever or electronically br Due to increased performance requirements unit injectors have been largely replaced by common rail injection systems br br br Diesel engine particularities br br br Mass br The average diesel engine has a poorer power to mass ratio than an equivalent petrol engine The lower engine speeds RPM of typical diesel engines results in a lower power output Also the mass of a diesel engine is typically higher since the higher operating pressure inside the combustion chamber increases the internal forces which requires stronger and therefore heavier parts to withstand these forces br br br Noise diesel clatter br br The distinctive noise of a diesel engine particularly at idling speeds is sometimes called diesel clatter This noise is largely caused by the sudden ignition of the diesel fuel when injected into the combustion chamber which causes a pressure wave that sounds like knocking br Engine designers can reduce diesel clatter through indirect injection pilot or pre injection injection timing injection rate compression ratio turbo boost and exhaust gas recirculation EGR Common rail diesel injection systems permit multiple injection events as an aid to noise reduction Through measures such as these diesel clatter noise is greatly reduced in modern engines Diesel fuels with a higher cetane rating are more likely to ignite and hence reduce diesel clatter br br br Cold weather starting br In warmer climates diesel engines do not require any starting aid aside from the starter motor However many diesel engines include some form of preheating for the combustion chamber to assist starting in cold conditions Engines with a displacement of less than litre per cylinder usually have glowplugs whilst larger heavy duty engines have flame start systems The minimum starting temperature that allows starting without pre heating is C F for precombustion chamber engines C F for swirl chamber engines and C F for direct injected engines br In the past a wider variety of cold start methods were used Some engines such as Detroit Diesel engines used a system to introduce small amounts of ether into the inlet manifold to start combustion Instead of glowplugs some diesel engines are equipped with starting aid systems that change valve timing The simplest way this can be done is with a decompression lever Activating the decompression lever locks the outlet valves in a slight down position resulting in the engine not having any compression and thus allowing for turning the crankshaft over with significantly less resistance When the crankshaft reaches a higher speed flipping the decompression lever back into its normal position will abruptly re activate the outlet valves resulting in compression the flywheel s mass moment of inertia then starts the engine Other diesel engines such as the precombustion chamber engine XII Jv made by Ganz Co have a valve timing changing system that is operated by adjusting the inlet valve camshaft moving it into a slight late position This will make the inlet valves open with a delay forcing the inlet air to heat up when entering the combustion chamber br br br Supercharging turbocharging br br Forced induction especially turbocharging is commonly used on diesel engines because it greatly increases efficiency and torque output Diesel engines are well suited for forced induction setups due to their operating principle which is characterised by wide ignition limits and the absence of fuel during the compression stroke Therefore knocking pre ignition or detonation cannot occur and a lean mixture caused by excess supercharging air inside the combustion chamber does not negatively affect combustion br br br Major manufacturers br MTU br MAN br Wartsila br Rolls

MAPNA BHEL DESA Steyr Motors GmbH Iran Khodro Diesel Isotta Fraschini EMD Fairbanks Morse Shanxi Henan Diesel SDM br br br Fuel and fluid characteristics br br Diesel engines can combust a huge variety of fuels including several fuel oils that have advantages over fuels such as petrol These advantages include br br Low fuel costs as fuel oils are relatively cheap br Good lubrication properties br High energy density br Low risk of catching fire as they do not form a flammable vapour br Biodiesel is an easily synthesised non petroleum based fuel through transesterification which can run directly in many diesel engines while gasoline engines either need adaptation to run synthetic fuels or else use them as an additive to gasoline e g ethanol added to gasohol br In diesel engines a mechanical injector system atomizes the fuel directly into the combustion chamber as opposed to a Venturi jet in a carburetor or a fuel injector in a manifold injection system atomizing fuel into the intake manifold or intake runners as in a petrol engine Because only air is inducted into the cylinder in a diesel engine the compression ratio can be much higher as there is no risk of pre ignition provided the injection process is accurately timed This means that cylinder temperatures are much higher in a diesel engine than a petrol engine allowing less volatile fuels to be used br br Therefore diesel engines can operate on a huge variety of different fuels In general fuel for diesel engines should have a proper viscosity so that the injection pump can pump the fuel to the injection nozzles without causing damage to itself or corrosion of the fuel line At injection the fuel should form a good fuel spray and it should not have a coking effect upon the injection nozzles To ensure proper engine starting and smooth operation the fuel should be willing to ignite and hence not cause a high ignition delay this means that the fuel should have a high cetane number Diesel fuel should also have a high lower heating value br Inline mechanical injector pumps generally tolerate poor quality or bio fuels better than distributor type pumps Also indirect injection engines generally run more satisfactorily on fuels with a high ignition delay for instance petrol than direct injection engines This is partly because an indirect injection engine has a much greater swirl effect improving vaporisation and combustion of fuel and because in the case of vegetable oil type fuels lipid depositions can condense on the cylinder walls of a direct injection engine if combustion temperatures are too low such as starting the engine from cold Direct injected engines with an MAN centre sphere combustion chamber rely on fuel condensing on the combustion chamber walls The fuel starts vaporising only after ignition sets in and it burns relatively smoothly Therefore such engines also tolerate fuels with poor ignition delay characteristics and in general they can operate on petrol rated RON br br br Fuel types br In his work Theory and Construction of a Rational Heat Motor Rudolf Diesel considers using coal dust as fuel for the diesel engine However Diesel just considered using coal dust as well as liquid fuels and gas his actual engine was designed to operate on petroleum which was soon replaced with regular petrol and kerosene for further testing purposes as petroleum proved to be too viscous In addition to kerosene and petrol Diesel s engine could also operate on ligroin br Before diesel engine fuel was standardised fuels such as petrol kerosene gas oil vegetable oil and mineral oil as well as mixtures of these fuels were used Typical fuels specifically intended to be used for diesel engines were petroleum distillates and coal tar distillates such as the following these fuels have specific lower heating values of br br Diesel oil kcal kg MJ kg up to kcal kg MJ kg br Heating oil kcal kg MJ kg up to kcal kg MJ kg br Coal tar creosote kcal kg MJ kg up to kcal kg MJ kg br Kerosene up to kcal kg MJ kg br Source br The first diesel fuel standards were the DIN VTL and NATO F which appeared after World War II The modern European EN diesel fuel standard was established in May the modern version of the NATO F standard is mostly identical with it The DIN biodiesel standard was rendered obsolete by the version of the EN FAME biodiesel conforms to the EN standard Watercraft diesel engines usually operate on diesel engine fuel that conforms to the ISO standard Bunker C Also some diesel engines can operate on gasses such as LNG br br br Modern diesel fuel properties br br br Gelling br DIN diesel fuel was prone to waxing or gelling in cold weather both are terms for the solidification of diesel oil into a partially crystalline state The crystals build up in the fuel system especially in fuel filters eventually starving the engine of fuel and causing it to stop running Low output electric heaters in fuel tanks and around fuel lines were used to solve this problem Also most engines have a spill return system by which any excess fuel from the injector pump and injectors is returned to the fuel tank Once the engine has warmed returning warm fuel prevents waxing in the tank Before direct injection diesel engines some manufacturers such as BMW recommended mixing up to petrol in with the diesel by fuelling diesel cars with petrol to prevent the fuel from gelling when the temperatures dropped below C br br br Safety br br br Fuel flammability br Diesel fuel is less flammable than petrol because its flash point is C leading to a lower risk of fire caused by fuel in a vehicle equipped with a diesel engine br Diesel fuel can create an explosive air vapour mix under the right conditions However compared with petrol it is less prone due to its lower vapour pressure which is an indication of evaporation rate The Material Safety Data Sheet for ultra low sulfur diesel fuel indicates a vapour explosion hazard for diesel fuel indoors outdoors or in sewers br br br Cancer br Diesel exhaust has been classified as an IARC Group carcinogen It causes lung cancer and is associated with an increased risk for bladder cancer br br br Engine runaway uncontrollable overspeeding br See diesel engine runaway br br br Applications br The characteristics of diesel have different advantages for different applications br br br Passenger cars br br Diesel engines have long been popular in bigger cars and have been used in smaller cars such as superminis in Europe since the s They were popular in larger cars earlier as the weight and cost penalties were less noticeable Smooth operation as well as high low end torque are deemed important for passenger cars and small commercial vehicles The introduction of electronically controlled fuel injection significantly improved the smooth torque generation and starting in the early s car manufacturers began offering their high end luxury vehicles with diesel engines Passenger car diesel engines usually have between three and twelve cylinders and a displacement ranging from to litres Modern powerplants are usually turbocharged and have direct injection br Diesel engines do not suffer from intake air throttling resulting in very low fuel consumption especially at low partial load for instance driving at city speeds One fifth of all passenger cars worldwide have diesel engines with many of them being in Europe where approximately of all passenger cars are diesel powered Daimler Benz in conjunction with Robert Bosch GmbH produced diesel powered passenger cars starting in The popularity of diesel powered passenger cars in markets such as India South Korea and Japan is increasing as of br br br Commercial vehicles and lorries br br In Rudolf Diesel suggested that the diesel engine could possibly power wagons lorries The first lorries with diesel engines were brought to market in br Modern diesel engines for lorries have to be both extremely reliable and very fuel efficient Common rail direct injection turbocharging and four valves per cylinder are standard Displacements range from to litres with power to mass ratios of kg kW for heavy duty and kg kW for medium duty engines V and V engines used to be common due to the relatively low engine mass the V configuration provides Recently the V configuration has been abandoned in favour of straight engines These engines are usually straight for heavy and medium duties and straight for medium duty Their undersquare design causes lower overall piston speeds which results in increased lifespan of up to kilometres mi Compared with s diesel engines the expected lifespan of modern lorry diesel engines has more than doubled br br br Railroad rolling stock br Diesel engines for locomotives are built for continuous operation between refuelings and may need to be designed to use poor quality fuel in some circumstances Some locomotives use two stroke diesel engines Diesel engines have replaced steam engines on all non electrified railroads in the world The first diesel locomotives appeared in and diesel multiple units soon after Nearly all modern diesel locomotives are more correctly known as diesel electric locomotives because they use an electric transmission the diesel engine drives an electric generator which powers electric traction motors While electric locomotives have replaced the diesel locomotive for passenger services in many areas diesel traction is widely used for cargo hauling freight trains and on tracks where electrification is not economically viable br In the s road vehicle diesel engines with power outputs of metric horsepower kW hp were considered reasonable for DMUs Commonly regular truck powerplants were used The height of these engines had to be less than metre ft in to allow underfloor installation Usually the engine was mated with a pneumatically operated mechanical gearbox due to the low size mass and production costs of this design Some DMUs used hydraulic torque converters instead Diesel electric transmission was not suitable for such small engines In the s the Deutsche Reichsbahn standardised its first DMU engine It was a litres cu in cylinder boxer unit producing metric horsepower kW hp Several German manufacturers produced engines according to this standard br br br Watercraft br br The requirements for marine diesel engines vary depending on the application For military use and medium size boats medium speed four stroke diesel engines are most suitable These engines usually have up to cylinders and come with power outputs in the one digit Megawatt region Small boats may use lorry diesel engines Large ships use extremely efficient low speed two stroke diesel engines They can reach efficiencies of up to Unlike most regular diesel engines two stroke watercraft engines use highly viscous fuel oil Submarines are usually diesel electric br The first diesel engines for ships were made by A B Diesels Motorer Stockholm in These engines were three cylinder units of PS kW and four cylinder units of PS kW and used for Russian ships In World War I especially submarine diesel engine development advanced quickly By the end of the War double acting piston two stroke engines with up to PS MW had been made for marine use br br br Aviation br br br Early br Diesel engines had been used in aircraft before World War II for instance in the rigid airship LZ Hindenburg which was powered by four Daimler Benz DB diesel engines or in several Junkers aircraft which had Jumo engines installed br In in the United States the Packard Motor Company developed America s first aircraft diesel engine the Packard DR an air cooled cylinder radial engine They installed it in various aircraft of the era some of which were used in record breaking distance or endurance flights and in the first successful demonstration of ground to air radiophone communications voice radio having been previously unintelligible in aircraft equipped with spark ignition engines due to electromagnetic interference Additional advantages cited at the time included a lower risk of post crash fire and superior performance at high altitudes br On March the engine received an Approved Type Certificate first ever for an aircraft diesel engine from the U S Department of Commerce However noxious exhaust fumes cold start and vibration problems engine structural failures the death of its developer and the industrial economic contraction of the Great Depression combined to kill the program br br br Modern br From then until the late s there had not been many applications of the diesel engine in aircraft In Piper Cherokee co designer Karl H Bergey argued that the likelihood of a general aviation diesel in the near future is remote br However with the s energy crisis and environmental movement and resulting pressures for greater fuel economy reduced carbon and lead in the atmosphere and other issues there was a resurgence of interest in diesel engines for aircraft High compression piston aircraft engines that run on aviation gasoline avgas generally require the addition of toxic Tetraethyl lead to avgas to avoid engine pre ignition and detonation but diesel engines do not require leaded fuel Also biodiesel can theoretically provide a net reduction in atmospheric carbon compared to avgas For these reasons the general aviation community has begun to fear the possible banning or discontinuance of leaded avgas br Additionally avgas is a specialty fuel in very low and declining demand compared to other fuels and its makers are susceptible to costly aviation crash lawsuits reducing refiners interest in producing it Outside the United States avgas has already become increasingly difficult to find at airports and generally than less expensive diesel compatible fuels like Jet A and other jet fuels br By the late s early s diesel engines were beginning to appear in light aircraft Most notably Frank Thielert and his Austrian engine enterprise began developing diesel engines to replace the horsepower kW horsepower kW gasoline piston engines in common light aircraft use First successful application of the Theilerts to production aircraft was in the Diamond DA Twin Star light twin which exhibited exceptional fuel efficiency surpassing anything in its class and its single seat predecessor the Diamond DA Diamond Star br In subsequent years several other companies have developed aircraft diesel engines or have begun to most notably Continental Aerospace Technologies which by was reporting it had sold over such engines worldwide br The United States Federal Aviation Administration has reported that by various jet fueled piston aircraft had logged well over hours of service In early AOPA reported that a diesel engine model for general aviation aircraft is approaching the finish line By late Continental was reporting that its Jet A fueled engines had exceeded in operation today with over million hours and were being specified by major OEMs for Cessna Piper Diamond Mooney Tecnam Glasair and Robin aircraft br In recent years diesel engines have also found use in unmanned aircraft UAV due to their reliability durability and low fuel consumption br br br Non road diesel engines br br Non road diesel engines are commonly used for construction equipment and agricultural machinery Fuel efficiency reliability and ease of maintenance are very important for such engines whilst high power output and quiet operation are negligible Therefore mechanically controlled fuel injection and air cooling are still very common The common power outputs of non road diesel engines vary a lot with the smallest units starting at kW and the most powerful engines being heavy duty lorry engines br br br Stationary diesel engines br br Stationary diesel engines are commonly used for electricity generation but also for powering refrigerator compressors or other types of compressors or pumps Usually these engines either run continuously with partial load or intermittently with full load Stationary diesel engines powering electric generators that put out an alternating current usually operate with alternating load but fixed rotational frequency This is due to the mains fixed frequency of either Hz Europe or Hz United States The engine s crankshaft rotational frequency is chosen so that the mains frequency is a multiple of it For practical reasons this results in crankshaft rotational frequencies of either Hz per minute or Hz per minute br br br Low heat rejection engines br A special class of prototype internal combustion piston engines has been developed over several decades with the goal of improving efficiency by reducing heat loss These engines are variously called adiabatic engines due to better approximation of adiabatic expansion low heat rejection engines or high temperature engines They are generally piston engines with combustion chamber parts lined with ceramic thermal barrier coatings Some make use of pistons and other parts made of titanium which has a low thermal conductivity and density Some designs are able to eliminate the use of a cooling system and associated parasitic losses altogether Developing lubricants able to withstand the higher temperatures involved has been a major barrier to commercialization br br br Future developments br In mid s literature main development goals for future diesel engines are described as improvements of exhaust emissions reduction of fuel consumption and increase of lifespan It is said that the diesel engine especially the diesel engine for commercial vehicles will remain the most important vehicle powerplant until the mid s Editors assume that the complexity of the diesel engine will increase further Some editors expect a future convergency of diesel and Otto engines operating principles due to Otto engine development steps made towards homogeneous charge
