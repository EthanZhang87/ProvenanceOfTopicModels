behind everything we make at Volvo therefore is and must remain safety br br The company was created as a subsidiary to SKF Assar Gabrielsson was appointed managing director and Gustav Larson technical manager br br The trademark Volvo which is Latin for I roll was first registered by SKF on May with the intention to use it for a special series of ball bearing for the American market but it was never used for this purpose however in the application for the trademark it was also designated for the purpose of automobiles The SKF trademark as it looks today was used instead for all the SKF products Some pre series of Volvo bearings stamped with the brand name Volvo were manufactured but never released to the market and it was not until that the trademark was used again now as a trademark and company name for an automobile br The first Volvo car left the assembly line on April and was called Volvo V After this the young company produced closed top and cabriolet vehicles which were designed to hold strong in the Swedish climate and terrain In the registration application for Volvo logotype in they simply made a copy of the entire radiator for V viewed from the front The

the s In Volvo sold cars in the US marking a record year for the company The appearance of Japanese brands like Acura and Lexus and the growing popularity of Subaru station wagons in subsequent years meant the loss of a significant market share for Volvo one which they have never regained br Volvo s long time CEO Pehr G Gyllenhammar saw early on that Volvo was too small to survive in the future and attempted several times to merge with other manufacturers Volvo nearly merged with Saab in the late seventies while in an aborted affair would have seen the Norwegian state take over percent of the company In return Volvo would receive million SEK and a ten percent concession in the Oseberg oil field Major institutional actors in Sweden opposed the deal and blocked it A deal to merge with

downturns Ford decided to restructure plans for Volvo Cars pushing it further upmarket alongside the lower end of Mercedes and BMW sedans wagons and SUV crossovers The outcome was the luxurious second generation Volvo S and the new small premium crossover Volvo XC br When the global economic crisis of threatened the US automakers Swedish authorities became concerned about the fate of Volvo should Ford file for bankruptcy These concerns mounted after repeated mass layoffs at Volvo In December Ford announced that it was considering selling Volvo Cars Initially a sale price of US billion was reported Ford said it was also looking into the possibility of spinning off Volvo as an independent company The Swedish government was asked to look into a possible state ownership of Volvo or a financial bailout for Volvo Cars and SAAB of GM Former parent AB Volvo agreed to help Volvo cut costs through partnerships and suggested taking part in a shared ownership of Volvo Cars as part of a larger consortium Other rumored candidates to purchase Volvo Cars included BMW AG of Germany Investor AB of Sweden Chinese investors and Russian investors br Although it was rumoured that Volkswagen would buy Volvo Cars and despite initial denials the company Geely Holding Group was ultimately selected to take over the Swedish automaker Geely Holding allegedly bid about US billion to take over

In July the automaker announced that beginning in all of its new models will include an electric motor in their powertrain Implementation of the announcement could mean Volvo becoming the first manufacturer to end production of internal combustion only vehicles with all vehicles hybrid or electric powered Between and Volvo plans to launch three electric cars under the Volvo brand and two more under the Polestar performance brand br Volvo is one of the proponents of autonomous vehicles On November Uber announced that it planned to buy up to Volvo cars designed to accept autonomous

with a vehicle to grid V G pilot programme in Gothenburg along with local power utility Goteborg Energi br br br Safety br Volvo cars have long been marketed as safe and the company has stressed their historic reputation for solidity and reliability in marketing campaigns Volvo uses high tech safety systems as standard equipment in new vehicles Prior to strong government safety regulation Volvo had been at the forefront of safety engineering br In laminated glass was introduced in the PV model After Vattenfall engineers presented their pioneering work to Volvo in the s Volvo engineer Nils Bohlin invented and patented the modern three point safety belt which became standard on all Volvo cars in and then made this design patent open in the interest of safety and made it available to other car manufacturers for free Additionally Volvo developed the first rear facing child seat in and introduced its own booster seat in br In the introduced the first three point seat belt for the middle of the rear seat and a child safety cushion integrated in the middle armrest Also in it introduced the Side Impact Protection System SIPS on the and models which channels the force of a side impact away from the doors and into the safety cage br In to add to its SIPS Volvo was the first to introduce side airbags and installed them as standard equipment in all models from At the start of the model year side impact protection airbags were standard on high trim level Volvo s and optional on other s By the middle of the production year they were standard on all s In model year SIPS airbags became standard on all Volvo models br In the Volvo was recalled as the front seatbelt mounts could break in a collision br In Volvo installed a head protecting airbag which was made standard in all new models as well as some existing models The IC head protecting airbag was not available on the C since the initial design deployed the airbag from the roof and the C being a convertible could not accommodate such an airbag A later version of the C featured a head protecting airbag deploying upwards from the door avoiding this problem It has been stated by many testing authorities that side head protecting curtain airbags can reduce the risk of death in a side impact by up to and brain injury by up to as well as protect occupants during a rollover In Volvo introduced its Whiplash Protection System WHIPS a safety device to prevent injury to front seat users during collisions br In Volvo pioneered the development of a virtual crash test dummy representing a midsized pregnant female It was named Linda and was modeled in her th week of pregnancy to analyze the effects of high speed impact on the womb placenta and fetus Collaborating with Chalmers University of Technology they also crafted a computer model of an average sized female to advance their Whiplash Protection System WHIPS br In Volvo introduced the Blind Spot Information System BLIS which detects vehicles entering the vehicle s blind spot with a side view mirror mounted camera and alerts the driver with a light That year also saw Volvos sold in all markets equipped with side marker lights and daytime running lights Also since all Volvo models except for the coupes C and C are available with an all wheel drive system developed by Haldex Traction of Sweden br In Volvo presented the second generation of Volvo C which came with extra stiff door mounted inflatable side curtains the first of its kind in a convertible dubbed DMIC br Volvo s safety systems remained standard on all Volvo vehicles while under ownership of Ford Motor Company Volvo had patented many of its safety innovations including SIPS WHIPS ROPS DSTC and body structures Some of these systems were fitted to other Ford and Premier Automotive Group vehicles in forms similar to those of Volvo systems br A Folksam report put the from on in the better than average category the second from the top category br In when the American non profit non governmental Insurance Institute for Highway Safety IIHS released its first annual Top Safety Picks vehicles list none of Volvo s offered vehicles in the US were included on the list br According to Russ Rader a spokesman for IIHS Volvo lagged behind its competitors Dan Johnston a Volvo spokesman denied that the company s vehicles were any less safe than the institute s top rated vehicles adding that br br It s just a philosophy on safety that is different from building cars to pass these kinds of tests br In Volvo s Personal Car Communicator PCC remote control was launched as an optional feature with the all new Volvo S Before a driver enters their car they can review the security level and know whether they had set the alarm and if the car is locked Additionally a heartbeat sensor warns if someone is hiding inside the car The S was also the first Volvo model to feature adaptive cruise control ACC with Collision Warning and Brake Support CWBS br In a French court found Volvo partially responsible for causing the death of two children and serious injuries of another in Wasselonne on June when the brakes of a Volvo failed The court subjected Volvo to a fine br According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety IIHS Volvo s S became one of the Top Safety Picks Award winners The previous versions of the S and S models models with standard side airbags failed to attain the highest rating in their side impact test However according to the IIHS in recent years Volvo cars have still managed to maintain their high class safety ratings as seen in test results The Volvo XC S C XC S and C are all rated Top Safety Picks in these crash tests The models of the XC XC S and S have even received the Top Safety Pick rating All Volvos tested in the small overlap test have received a good rating br Volvo has also scored high in Euro NCAP tests Since all the Volvo models that Euro NCAP have tested have received five star safety ratings Volvo C V V V plug in hybrid XC and V The second generation Volvo V got the best test result of any car model ever tested by Euro NCAP at the time As well the redesigned XC received the highest adult occupant score in br In the United States Volvo paid million in fines for missing its Corporate Average Fuel Economy targets for the model years In July Volvo announced that new models launched from onward would be fully electric or hybrid electric heralding the end of production of nearly a century of Volvo vehicles powered solely by the internal combustion engine Volvo however will continue to produce non electric non hybrid cars from models introduced before that year but will discontinue them once the non hybrid non electric cars receive a facelift or complete redesign In Volvo announced that it plans to produce only electrified cars from the year onwards br In Volvo introduced the E V A Equal Vehicles for All Initiative which aims to share the results of research and safety development since This initiative s goal is to contribute to safer cars for everyone regardless of gender and size Due to the traditional use of male crash test dummies in safety tests women face a higher risk of injury in car accidents Volvo s Accident Research Team however has been collecting real world collision data since the s ensuring representation for both men and women br br br Safety milestones br br

keeping with its car naming consistent with the XC br Originally Volvo was planning a different naming scheme S and C were to be the same but F standing for flexibility was to be used on station wagons When Volvo introduced the first generation S and V in they were announced as the S and F However Audi complained that it had inherent rights to the S name since it names its sporty vehicles S and the yet to be introduced sport version of the Audi A would have the S name Volvo agreed to add a second digit so the vehicles became the S and F However that led to another complaint from Ferrari
