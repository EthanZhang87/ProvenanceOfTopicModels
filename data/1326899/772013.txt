id: 772013
A steering wheel also called a driving wheel a hand wheel or simply wheel is a type of steering control in vehicles br Steering wheels are used in most modern land vehicles including all mass production automobiles buses light and heavy trucks as well as tractors and tanks The steering wheel is the part of the steering system that the driver manipulates the rest of the steering system responds to such driver inputs This can be through direct mechanical contact as in recirculating ball or rack and pinion steering gears without or with the assistance of hydraulic power steering HPS or as in some modern production cars with the help of computer controlled motors known as electric power steering br br br History br br Near the start of the th century many sea vessels appeared using the ship s wheel design However historians are unclear when that approach to steering was first used The first automobiles were steered with a tiller but in Alfred Vacheron took part in the Paris Rouen race with a Panhard hp model which he had fitted with a steering wheel That is believed to be one of the earliest employments of the principle br From the Panhard et Levassor cars were equipped as standard with steering wheels Charles Rolls introduced the first car in Britain fitted with a steering wheel when he imported a hp Panhard from France in Arthur Constantin Krebs replaced the tiller with an inclined steering wheel for the Panhard car he designed for the Paris Amsterdam Paris race which ran July br In Thomas B Jeffery and his son Charles T Jeffery developed two advanced experimental cars featuring a front mounted engine and a steering wheel mounted on the left hand side However the early automaker adopted a more conventional rear engine and tiller steering layout for its first mass produced Ramblers in The following year the Rambler Model E was largely unchanged except that it came equipped with a tiller early in the year that was changed to a steering wheel by the end of By all Ramblers featured steering wheels Within a decade the steering wheel had entirely replaced the tiller in automobiles br At the insistence of Thomas B Jeffery the driver s position was also moved to the left hand side of the car during the Rambler production Most other car makers began offering cars with left hand drive in Soon after most cars in the U S converted to left hand drive br br br Passenger cars br br Steering wheels for passenger automobiles are generally circular They are mounted to the steering column by a hub connected to the outer ring of the steering wheel by one or more spokes single spoke wheels being a relatively rare exception Other types of vehicles may use a modified circular design a butterfly shape or some other shape such as a yoke On some Tesla models the steering control is through a yoke rectangle shaped with rounded edges and two pistol grips The C Corvette includes a square type steering wheel with rounded corners described as a squircle The objective of the flat bottom is to ease diver egress while the flattened top enhances the line of sight when driving General Motors applied for a U S patent for a modular steering control that can be updated with components or changed in shape ranging from a traditional circle to a yoke br In countries where cars must drive on the left side of the road the steering wheel is typically on the right side of the car right hand drive or RHD the converse applies in countries where cars drive on the right side of the road left hand drive or LHD br In addition to its use in steering the steering wheel is the usual location for a button to activate the car s horn Modern automobiles may have other controls such as cruise control audio system and telephone controls as well as paddle shifters built into the steering wheel to minimize the extent to which the driver must take their hands off the wheel br The steering wheels were rigid and mounted on non collapsible steering columns This arrangement increased the risk of impaling the driver in case of a severe crash The first collapsible steering column was invented in but was never successfully marketed By Ford came out with a safety steering wheel that was set high above the post with spokes that would flex but the column was still rigid In United States regulations FMVSS Standard No were implemented concerning the acceptable rearward movement of the steering wheel in case of a crash Collapsible steering columns were required to meet that standard Before this invention the Citro n DS incorporated a curved and off center single spoke steering wheel designed to deflect the driver from the steering column in case of a crash br Power steering affords the driver reduced effort to steer the car Modern power steering has almost universally relied on a hydraulic system although electrical systems are steadily replacing this technology Mechanical power steering systems were introduced such as on Studebakers However hydraulically assisted systems have prevailed br While other methods of steering passenger cars have resulted from experiments for example the wrist twist steering of the Mercury Park Lane concept car was controlled by two inch mm rings none have yet been deployed as successfully as the conventional large steering wheel br Passenger automobile regulations implemented by the U S Department of Transportation required the locking of steering wheel rotation or transmission locked in park to hinder motor vehicle theft in most vehicles this is accomplished when the ignition key is removed from the ignition lock See steering lock br br br Other designs br br The driver s seat and steering wheel are centrally located on certain high performance sports cars such as the McLaren F and most single seat racing cars br As drivers may continuously have their hands on the steering wheel for many hours these are designed with ergonomics in mind However the most crucial concern is that the driver can effectively convey torque to the steering system especially in vehicles without power steering or in the rare event of a loss of steering assist A typical design for circular steering wheels is a steel or magnesium rim with a plastic or rubberized grip molded over and around it Some drivers purchase vinyl or textile steering wheel covers to enhance grip and comfort or simply as decoration Another device used to make steering easier is the brodie knob br A similar device in aircraft is the yoke Water vessels not steered from a stern mounted tiller are directed with the ship s wheel which may have inspired the concept of the steering wheel The steering wheel is better than other user interfaces and has persisted because driving requires precise feedback that is provided by a large interface br Early Formula One cars used steering wheels taken directly from road cars They were normally made from wood Without interior cabin packaging constraints they tended to be made as large a diameter as possible to reduce the effort needed to turn As cars grew progressively lower and driver s areas more compact throughout the s and s steering wheels became smaller to fit into the interior space br br br Spokes in steering wheel br br The number of spokes in the steering wheel has continuously changed Most early cars had four spoke steering wheels br A Banjo steering wheel was an option in early automobiles They predate power steering The wire spokes were a buffer or absorber between the driver s hands and the vibration transmitted from the road surfaces Most were three or four spokes made of four or five wires in each spoke hence the name Banjo br br br Adjustable steering wheels br br br Tilt wheel br br Edward James Lobdell developed the original tilt wheel in the early s A position tilt wheel was introduced by the Saginaw Division of General Motors in for all passenger car divisions except Chevrolet which received the tilt wheel in This tilt wheel was also supplied to the other U S automakers except Ford Originally a luxury option on cars the tilt function helps to adjust the steering wheel by moving the wheel through an arc in an up and down motion Tilt Steering Wheels rely upon a ratchet joint located in the steering column just below the steering wheel The wheel can be adjusted upward or downward by disengaging the ratchet lock while the steering column remains stationary below the joint Some designs place the pivot slightly forward along the column allowing for a fair amount of vertical movement of the steering wheel with slight actual tilt In contrast other designs place the pivot almost inside the steering wheel allowing adjustment of the angle of the steering wheel with nearly no change in its height br br br Adjustable steering column br An adjustable steering column allows the steering wheel height to be adjusted with only a small useful change in tilt Most of these systems work with compression locks or electric motors instead of ratchet mechanisms the latter may be capable of moving to a memorized position when a given driver uses the car or automatically moving up and forward to ease egress br br br Telescope wheel br Many pre war British cars offered telescoping steering wheels that required loosening a locknut before adjustment many using the Douglas ASW Adjustable Steering Wheel In the Jaguar XK introduced a new steering wheel supplied by Bluemel that was driver adjustable by loosening a sleeve around the column by hand The Ford Thunderbird had a similar design with inches mm of total travel In the travel was restricted to inches mm A patent was filed regarding a telescoping steering wheel in July by Bernard Maurer of the Saginaw Steering Gear Division of General Motors now Nexteer Automotive Nevertheless GM would not offer a telescoping wheel of their own until the debut of the optional telescopic wheel on the Corvette and Corvair and the optional tilt telescope wheel on Cadillacs The GM column was released by twisting a locking ring surrounding the center hub and offered a inch mm range of adjustment br br br Swing away steering wheel br br A swing away steering column was introduced in the Ford Thunderbird and made available on other Ford products during the s The swing away steering wheel allowed the steering wheel to move inches mm to the right when the transmission selector was in the park position to make the driver s exit and entry easier br br br Tilt away steering wheel br A tilt away wheel was introduced by Ford in after updates to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards requirements Though it was an update to the swing away steering wheel which did not meet updated safety standards it offers limited movement but added convenience due to the automatic pop over function over its predecessor br br br Quick release hub steering wheel br br Some steering wheels can be mounted on a detachable or a quick release hub The steering wheel can be removed without using tools by pressing a button The system is often found in narrow spaced racing cars to facilitate the driver getting in and out as well as in other cars as an anti theft device The quick release connector is often brand specific with some makes being interchangeable The most common mounting pattern is mm which denotes a bolt circle pattern with six bolts placed along a circle mm in diameter Other examples of common bolt patterns are in mm in mm mm and in mm The quick release itself is often proprietary br br br Usage br The steering wheel should be used with strategic movements of the hand and wrist in spinning motions Caution and care should be used to ensure the safety of the extremities The constant motions used must be performed with caution Proper posture of the hand arm system while using hand tools is essential As a rule the wrist should not be bent but must be kept straight to avoid overexertion of tissues like tendons and tendon sheaths and compression of nerves and blood vessels br Turning the steering wheel while the vehicle is stationary is called dry steering It is generally advised to avoid dry steering as it strains the steering mechanism and causes undue wear to the tires br br br Buttons and controls on the steering wheel br br The first button added to the steering wheel was a switch to activate the car s electric horn Traditionally located on the steering wheel hub or center pad the horn switch was sometimes placed on the spokes or activated via a decorative horn ring which obviated the necessity of moving a hand away from the rim Electrical connections are made via a slip ring A further development the Rim Blow steering wheel integrated the horn switch into the steering wheel rim br In Ford offered the Highway Pilot Speed Control option with steering wheel pad mounted rocker switches on its Thunderbird Uniquely the Thunderbird also lightly applied the brakes and illuminated the stop lamps when the Retard was continuously depressed with the cruise control on but not engaged br In Lincoln added two rocker switches on the steering wheel to activate various cruise control functions on the Continental and Continental Mark IV In Pontiac offered a steering wheel with buttons controlling various audio functions on the Trans Am STE and Bonneville br br In the s a proliferation of new buttons began to appear on automobile steering wheels Remote or alternate adjustments could include vehicle audio telephone and voice control navigation Scroll wheels or buttons are often used to set volume levels or page through menus and change radio stations or audio tracks These controls can use universal interfaces wired or wirelessly br br br Other uses br br br br br br br br br br br br Gaming imitations br br Game controllers are available for arcade cabinets personal computers and console games that are designed to look and feel like a steering wheel and intended for use in racing games An early example is the Telstar Arcade which featured a wheel in for use in the Road Race game that came packaged with it Some modern gaming wheels employ force feedback to simulate the tactile feedback a real driver feels from a steering wheel as well as buttons to allow for more inputs br br br See also br List of auto parts br Remote control br br br br br br External links br Media
