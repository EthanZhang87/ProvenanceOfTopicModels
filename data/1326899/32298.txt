USS Constitution also known as Old Ironsides is a three masted wooden hulled heavy frigate of the United States Navy She is the world s oldest commissioned naval warship still afloat She was launched in one of six original frigates authorized for construction by the Naval Act of and the third constructed The name Constitution was among ten names submitted to President George Washington by Secretary of War Timothy Pickering in March of for the frigates that were to be constructed Joshua Humphreys designed the frigates to be the young Navy s capital ships and so Constitution and her sister ships were larger and more heavily armed and built than standard frigates of the period She was built at Edmund Hartt s shipyard in the North End of Boston Massachusetts Her first duties were to provide protection for American merchant shipping during the Quasi War with France and to defeat the Barbary pirates in the First Barbary War br Constitution is most noted for her actions during the War of against the United Kingdom when she captured numerous merchant ships and defeated five British warships HMS Guerriere Java Pictou Cyane and Levant The battle with Guerriere earned her the nickname Old Ironsides and public adoration that has repeatedly saved her from scrapping She continued to serve as flagship in the Mediterranean and African squadrons and she circled the world in the s During the American Civil War she served as a training ship for the United States Naval Academy She carried American artwork and industrial displays to the Paris Exposition of br Constitution was retired from active service in and served as a receiving ship until being designated a museum ship in In she completed a three year port tour of the nation She sailed under her own power for her th birthday in and again in August to commemorate the th anniversary of her victory over Guerriere br Constitution s stated mission today is to promote understanding of the Navy s role in war and peace through educational outreach historical demonstration and active participation in public events as part of the Naval History and Heritage Command As she is a fully commissioned Navy ship her crew of officers and sailors participate in ceremonies educational programs and special events while keeping her open to visitors year round and providing free tours The officers and crew are all active duty Navy personnel and the assignment is considered to be special duty She is usually berthed at Pier of the former Charlestown Navy Yard at one end of Boston s Freedom Trail br br br Construction br br In Barbary pirates most notably from Algiers began to seize American merchant vessels in the Mediterranean Sea In alone American ships were captured and their crews and stores held for ransom To combat this problem proposals were made for warships to protect American shipping resulting in the Naval Act of The act provided funds to construct six frigates but it included a clause that the construction of the ships would be halted if peace terms were agreed to with Algiers br Joshua Humphreys design was unusual for the time being deep long on keel narrow of beam width and mounting very heavy guns The design called for diagonal br riders intended to restrict hogging and sagging while giving the ships extremely heavy planking This design gave the hull a greater strength than a more lightly built frigate It was based on Humphrey s realization that the fledgling United States could not match the European states in the size of their navies so they were designed to overpower any other frigate while escaping from a ship of the line br Her keel was laid down on November at Edmund Hartt s shipyard in Boston Massachusetts under the supervision of Captain Samuel Nicholson master shipwright Colonel George Claghorn and Foreman Prince Athearn of the Martha s Vineyard Athearns Constitution s hull was built inches mm thick and her length between perpendiculars was ft m with a ft m length overall and a width of ft in m In total acres ha of trees were needed for her construction Primary materials consisted of pine and oak including southern live oak which was cut from Gascoigne Bluff and milled near St Simons Island Georgia Enslaved workers were used to harvest the oak used for the ship s construction and USS Constitution Museum historian Carl Herzog stated that the forced labor of enslaved people was an expediency that Navy officials and contractors saw as fundamental to the job enslaved people were essential to the construction of naval warships built to secure the very American freedoms they were denied br A peace accord was announced between the United States and Algiers in March and construction was halted in accordance with the Naval Act of After some debate and prompting by President Washington Congress agreed to continue funding the construction of the three ships nearest to completion United States Constellation and Constitution Constitution s launching ceremony on September was attended by President John Adams and Massachusetts Governor Increase Sumner Upon launch she slid down the ways only feet m before stopping her weight had caused the ways to settle into the ground preventing further movement An attempt two days later resulted in only feet m of additional travel before the ship again stopped After a month of rebuilding the ways Constitution finally slipped into Boston Harbor on October with Captain James Sever breaking a bottle of Madeira wine on her bowsprit br br br Armament br br Constitution was rated as a gun frigate but she often carried more than guns at a time Ships of this era had no permanent battery of guns such as those of modern Navy ships The guns and cannons were designed to be completely portable and often were exchanged between ships as situations warranted Each commanding officer outfitted armaments to his liking taking into consideration factors such as the overall weight of stores complement of personnel aboard and planned routes to be sailed Consequently the armaments on ships changed often during their careers and records of the changes were not generally kept br During the War of Constitution s battery of guns typically consisted of long pounder kg cannons with on each side of the gun deck Twenty two more guns were deployed on the spar deck per side each a short pounder kg carronade Four chase guns were also positioned two each at the stern and bow br All of the guns aboard Constitution have been replicas since her restoration Most were cast in but two carronades on the spar deck were cast in A modern mm in saluting gun was hidden inside the forward long gun on each side during her restoration in order to restore the capability of firing ceremonial salutes br br br Quasi War br br President John Adams ordered all Navy ships to sea in late May to patrol for armed French ships and to free any American ship captured by them Constitution was still not ready to sail and eventually had to borrow sixteen pound kg cannons from Castle Island before finally being ready She put to sea on the evening of July with orders to patrol the Eastern seaboard between New Hampshire and New York She was patrolling between Chesapeake Bay and Savannah Georgia a month later when Nicholson found his first opportunity for capturing a prize They intercepted Niger off the coast of Charleston South Carolina on September a gun ship sailing with a French crew en route from Jamaica to Philadelphia claiming to have been under the orders of Great Britain Nicholson had the crewmen imprisoned perhaps not understanding his orders correctly He placed a prize crew aboard Niger and brought her into Norfolk Virginia br Constitution sailed south again a week later to escort a merchant convoy but her bowsprit was severely damaged in a gale and she returned to Boston for repairs In the meantime Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Stoddert determined that Niger had been operating under the orders of Great Britain as claimed and the ship and her crew were released to continue their voyage The American government paid a restitution of equivalent to in to Great Britain br Constitution departed Boston on December Nicholson reported to Commodore John Barry who was flying his flag in United States near the island of Dominica for patrols in the West Indies On January Constitution intercepted the English merchantman Spencer which had been taken prize by the French frigate L Insurgente a few days prior Technically Spencer was a French ship operated by a French prize crew but Nicholson released the ship and her crew the next morning perhaps hesitant after the affair with Niger Upon joining Barry s command Constitution almost immediately had to put in for repairs to her rigging due to storm damage and it was not until March that anything of note occurred On this date she encountered HMS Santa Margarita whose captain was an acquaintance of Nicholson s The two agreed to a sailing duel which the English captain was confident he would win But after hours of sailing Santa Margarita lowered her sails and admitted defeat paying off the bet with a cask of wine to Nicholson Resuming her patrols Constitution managed to recapture the American sloop Neutrality on March On April she recaptured His Majesty s Packet Carteret that had been captured by the French on March Secretary Stoddert had other plans however and recalled Constitution to Boston She arrived there on May and Nicholson was relieved of command br br br Change of command br Captain Silas Talbot was recalled to duty to command Constitution and serve as Commodore of operations in the West Indies After repairs and resupply were completed Constitution departed Boston on July with a destination of Saint Domingue via Norfolk and a mission to interrupt French shipping She departed Norfolk on August She took the prize Amelia from a French prize crew on September and Talbot sent the ship back to New York City with an American prize crew Constitution arrived at Saint Domingue on October and rendezvoused with Boston General Greene and Norfolk No further incidents occurred over the next six months as French depredations in the area had declined Constitution busied herself with routine patrols and Talbot made diplomatic visits On February put men aboard an unidentified American schooner and had it sent to New York for possible illegal trading It was not until April that Talbot investigated an increase in ship traffic near Puerto Plata Santo Domingo and discovered that the French privateer Sandwich had taken refuge there On May the squadron captured the sloop Sally and Talbot hatched a plan to capture Sandwich by utilizing the familiarity of Sally to allow the Americans access to the harbor First Lieutenant Isaac Hull led sailors and Marines into Puerto Plata without challenge on May capturing Sandwich and spiking the guns of the nearby Spanish fort However it was later determined that Sandwich had been captured from a neutral port she was returned to the French with apologies and no prize money was awarded to the squadron br Routine patrols again occupied Constitution for the next two months until July when the mainmast trouble of a few months before recurred She put into Cap Fran ais for repairs With the terms of enlistment soon to expire for the sailors aboard her she made preparations to return to the United States and was relieved of duty by Constellation on July Constitution escorted merchantmen to Philadelphia on her return voyage and on August put in at Boston where she received new masts sails and rigging Even though peace was imminent between the United States and France Constitution again sailed for the West Indies on December as squadron flagship rendezvousing with Congress Adams Augusta Richmond and Trumbull Although no longer allowed to pursue French shipping the squadron was assigned to protect American shipping and continued in that capacity until April when Herald arrived with orders for the squadron to return to the United States Constitution returned to Boston where she lingered she was finally scheduled for an overhaul in October but it was later canceled She was placed in ordinary on July br br br First Barbary War br br The United States paid tribute to the Barbary States during the Quasi War to ensure that American merchant ships were not harassed and seized In Yusuf Karamanli of Tripoli was dissatisfied that the United States was paying him less than they paid Algiers and he demanded an immediate payment of equivalent to in In response Thomas Jefferson sent a squadron of frigates to protect American merchant ships in the Mediterranean and to pursue peace with the Barbary States br br The first squadron under the command of Richard Dale in President was instructed to escort merchant ships through the Mediterranean and to negotiate with leaders of the Barbary States A second squadron was assembled under the command of Richard Valentine Morris in Chesapeake The performance of Morris s squadron was so poor however that he was recalled and subsequently dismissed from the Navy in br Captain Edward Preble recommissioned Constitution on May as his flagship and made preparations to command a new squadron for a third blockade attempt The copper sheathing on her hull needed to be replaced and Paul Revere supplied the copper sheets necessary for the job She departed Boston on August and she encountered an unknown ship in the darkness on September near the Rock of Gibraltar Constitution went to general quarters then ran alongside the unknown ship Preble hailed her only to receive a hail in return He identified his ship as the United States frigate Constitution but received an evasive answer from the other ship Preble replied I am now going to hail you for the last time If a proper answer is not returned I will fire a shot into you The stranger returned If you give me a shot I ll give you a broadside Preble demanded that the other ship identify herself and the stranger replied This is His Britannic Majesty s ship Donegal guns Sir Richard Strachan an English commodore He then commanded Preble Send your boat on board Preble was now devoid of all patience and exclaimed This is United States ship Constitution guns Edward Preble an American commodore who will be damned before he sends his boat on board of any vessel And then to his gun crews Blow your matches boys Before the incident escalated further however a boat arrived from the other ship and a British lieutenant relayed his captain s apologies The ship was in fact not Donegal but instead HMS Maidstone a gun frigate Constitution had come alongside her so quietly that Maidstone had delayed answering with the proper hail while she readied her guns This act began the strong allegiance between Preble and the officers under his command known as Preble s boys as he had shown that he was willing to defy a presumed ship of the line br Constitution arrived at Gibraltar on September where Preble waited for the other ships of the squadron His first order of business was to arrange a treaty with Sultan Slimane of Morocco who was holding American ships hostage to ensure the return of two vessels that the Americans had captured Constitution and Nautilus departed Gibraltar on October and arrived at Tangier on the th Adams and New York arrived the next day With four American warships in his harbor the Sultan was glad to arrange the transfer of ships between the two nations and Preble departed with his squadron on October heading back to Gibraltar br br br Battle of Tripoli Harbor br br Philadelphia ran aground off Tripoli on October under the command of William Bainbridge while pursuing a Tripoline vessel The crew was taken prisoner Philadelphia was refloated by the Tripolines and brought into their harbor To deprive the Tripolines of their prize Preble planned to destroy Philadelphia using the captured ship Mastico which was renamed Intrepid Intrepid entered Tripoli Harbor on February under the command of Stephen Decatur disguised as a merchant ship Decatur s crew quickly overpowered the Tripoline crew and set Philadelphia ablaze br br Preble withdrew the squadron to Syracuse Sicily and began planning for a summer attack on Tripoli He procured a number of smaller gunboats that could move in closer to Tripoli than was feasible for Constitution given her deep draft Constitution Argus Enterprise Scourge Syren the six gunboats and two bomb ketches arrived the morning of August and immediately began operations Twenty two Tripoline gunboats met them in the harbor Constitution and her squadron severely damaged or destroyed the Tripoline gunboats in a series of attacks over the coming month taking their crews prisoner Constitution primarily provided gunfire support bombarding the shore batteries of Tripoli yet Karamanli remained firm in his demand for ransom and tribute despite his losses br Preble outfitted Intrepid as a floating volcano with short tons t of gunpowder aboard in a final attempt of the season She was to sail into Tripoli harbor and blow up in the midst of the corsair fleet close under the walls of the city Intrepid made her way into the harbor on the evening of September under the command of Richard Somers but she exploded prematurely killing Somers and his entire crew of thirteen volunteers br Constellation and President arrived at Tripoli on the th with Samuel Barron in command Preble was forced to relinquish his command of the squadron to Barron who was senior in rank Constitution was ordered to Malta on the th for repairs and while en route captured two Greek vessels attempting to deliver wheat into Tripoli On the th a collision with President severely damaged Constitution s bow stern and figurehead of Hercules The collision was attributed to an act of God in the form of a sudden change in wind direction br br br Peace treaty br Captain John Rodgers assumed command of Constitution on November while she underwent repairs and resupply in Malta She resumed the blockade of Tripoli on April capturing a Tripoline xebec along with two prizes that the xebec had captured Meanwhile Commodore Barron gave William Eaton naval support to bombard Derne while a detachment of US Marines under the command of Presley O Bannon was assembled to attack the city by land They captured it on April A peace treaty with Tripoli was signed aboard Constitution on June in which she embarked the crew members of Philadelphia and returned them to Syracuse She was then dispatched to Tunis and arrived there on July Seventeen additional American warships had gathered in its harbor by August Congress Constellation Enterprise Essex Franklin Hornet John Adams Nautilus Syren and eight gunboats Negotiations went on for several days until a short term blockade of the harbor finally produced a peace treaty on August br Rodgers remained in command of the squadron sending warships back to the United States when they were no longer needed Eventually all that remained were Constitution Enterprise and Hornet They performed routine patrols and observed the French and Royal Navy operations of the Napoleonic Wars Rodgers turned over the command of the squadron and Constitution to Captain Hugh G Campbell on May br James Barron sailed Chesapeake out of Norfolk on May to replace Constitution as the flagship of the Mediterranean squadron but he encountered HMS Leopard resulting in the Chesapeake Leopard affair and delaying the relief of Constitution Constitution continued patrols unaware of the delay She arrived in late June at Leghorn where she took aboard the disassembled Tripoli Monument for transport back to the United States Campbell learned the fate of Chesapeake when he arrived at M laga and he immediately began preparing Constitution and Hornet for possible war against Britain The crew became mutinous upon learning of the delay in their relief and refused to sail any farther unless the destination was the United States Campbell and his officers threatened to fire a cannon loaded with grapeshot at the crewmen if they did not comply thereby putting an end to the conflict Campbell and the squadron were ordered home on August and set sail for Boston on September arriving there on October Constitution had been gone for more than four years br br br War of br br Constitution was recommissioned in December with Captain John Rodgers again taking command to oversee a major refitting She was overhauled at a cost just under however Rodgers inexplicably failed to clean her copper sheathing leading him to later declare her a slow sailer She spent most of the following two years on training runs and ordinary duty Isaac Hull took command in June and he immediately recognized that she needed her bottom cleaned Ten waggon loads of barnacles and seaweed were removed br Hull departed for France on August transporting the new Ambassador Joel Barlow and his family they arrived on September Hull remained near France and the Netherlands through the winter months continually holding sail and gun drills to keep the crew ready for possible hostilities with the British Tensions were high between the United States and Britain after the events of the Little Belt affair the previous May and Constitution was shadowed by British frigates while awaiting dispatches from Barlow to carry back to the United States They arrived home on February br War was declared on June and Hull put to sea on July attempting to join the five ships of a squadron under the command of Rodgers in President He sighted five ships off Egg Harbor New Jersey on July and at first believed them to be Rodgers squadron but by the following morning the lookouts determined that they were a British squadron out of Halifax HMS Aeolus Africa Belvidera Guerriere and Shannon They had sighted Constitution and were giving chase br Constitution was becalmed and unable to run from the five British ships but Hull acted on a suggestion from his First Lieutenant Charles Morris He ordered the crew to put boats over the side to tow the ship out of range using kedge anchors to draw the ship forward and wetting the sails to take advantage of every breath of wind The British ships soon imitated the tactic of kedging and remained in pursuit The resulting hour chase in the July heat forced the crew of Constitution to employ myriad tactics to outrun the squadron finally pumping overboard US gal kl of drinking water Cannon fire was exchanged several times though the British attempts fell short or overshot their mark including an attempted broadside from Belvidera On July Constitution pulled far enough ahead of the British that they abandoned the pursuit br Constitution arrived in Boston on July and remained there just long enough to replenish her supplies Hull sailed without orders on August to avoid being blockaded in port heading on a northeast route towards the British shipping lanes near Halifax and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence Constitution captured three British merchantmen which Hull burned rather than risk taking them back to an American port On August he learned of a British frigate nmi km mi to the south and sailed in pursuit br br br Constitution vs Guerriere br br A frigate was sighted on August and subsequently determined to be HMS Guerriere with the words Not The Little Belt painted on her foretopsail Guerriere opened fire upon entering range of Constitution doing little damage After a few exchanges of cannon fire between the ships Captain Hull maneuvered Constitution into an advantageous position within yards m of Guerriere He then ordered a full double loaded broadside of grape and round shot which took out Guerriere s mizzenmast Guerriere s maneuverability decreased with her mizzenmast dragging in the water and she collided with Constitution entangling her bowsprit in Constitution s mizzen rigging This left only Guerriere s bow guns capable of effective fire Hull s cabin caught fire from the shots but it was quickly extinguished With the ships locked together both captains ordered boarding parties into action but the sea was heavy and neither party was able to board the opposing ship br At one point the two ships rotated together counter clockwise with Constitution continuing to fire broadsides When the two ships pulled apart the force of the bowsprit s extraction sent shock waves through Guerriere s rigging Her foremast collapsed and that brought the mainmast down shortly afterward Guerriere was now a dismasted unmanageable hulk with close to a third of her crew wounded or killed while Constitution remained largely intact The British surrendered br Hull had surprised the British with his heavier broadsides and his ship s sailing ability Adding to their astonishment many of the British shots had rebounded harmlessly off Constitution s hull An American sailor reportedly exclaimed Huzzah her sides are made of iron and Constitution acquired the nickname Old Ironsides br The battle left Guerriere so badly damaged that she was not worth towing to port and Hull ordered her to be burned the next morning after transferring the British prisoners onto Constitution Constitution arrived back in Boston on August where Hull and his crew found that news of their victory had spread fast and they were hailed as heroes br br br Constitution vs Java br br William Bainbridge senior to Hull took command of Old Ironsides on September and prepared her for another mission in British shipping lanes near Brazil sailing with Hornet on October They arrived near S o Salvador on December sighting HMS Bonne Citoyenne in the harbor Bonne Citoyenne was reportedly carrying million in spices to England and her captain refused to leave the neutral harbor lest he lose his cargo Constitution sailed offshore in search of prizes leaving Hornet to await the departure of Bonne Citoyenne On December she met with HMS Java under Captain Henry Lambert At the initial hail from Bainbridge Java answered with a broadside that severely damaged Constitution s rigging She was able to recover however and returned a series of broadsides to Java A shot from Java destroyed Constitution s helm wheel so Bainbridge directed the crew to steer her manually using the tiller for the remainder of the engagement Bainbridge was wounded twice during the battle Java s bowsprit became entangled in Constitution s rigging as in the battle with Guerriere allowing Bainbridge to continue raking her with broadsides Java s foremast collapsed sending her fighting top crashing down through two decks below br Bainbridge drew off to make emergency repairs and re approached Java an hour later She was a shambles an unmanageable wreck with a badly wounded crew and she surrendered Bainbridge determined that Java was far too damaged to retain as a prize and ordered her burned but not before having her helm salvaged and installed on Constitution Constitution returned to S o Salvador on January to disembark the prisoners of Java where she met with Hornet and her two British prizes Bainbridge ordered Constitution to sail for Boston on January being far away from a friendly port and needing extensive repairs leaving Hornet behind to continue waiting for Bonne Citoyenne in the hopes that she would leave the harbor she did not Java was the third British warship in three months to be captured by the United States and Constitution s victory prompted the British Admiralty to order its frigates not to engage the heavier American frigates one on one only British ships of the line or squadrons were permitted to come close enough to attack Constitution arrived in Boston on February to even greater celebrations than Hull had received a few months earlier br br br Marblehead and blockade br Bainbridge determined that Constitution required new spar deck planking and beams masts sails and rigging as well as replacement of her copper bottom However personnel and supplies were being diverted to the Great Lakes causing shortages that kept her in Boston intermittently with her sister ships Chesapeake Congress and President for the majority of the year Charles Stewart took command on July and struggled to complete the construction and recruitment of a new crew finally making sail on December She set course for the West Indies to harass British shipping and had captured five merchant ships and the gun HMS Pictou by late March She also pursued HMS Columbine and HMS Pique though both ships escaped after realizing that she was an American frigate br Her mainmast split off the coast of Bermuda on March requiring immediate repair Stewart set a course for Boston where British ships HMS Junon and Tenedos commenced pursuit on April Stewart ordered drinking water and food to be cast overboard to lighten her load and gain speed trusting that her mainmast would hold together long enough for her to make her way into Marblehead Massachusetts The last item thrown overboard was the supply of spirits Upon Constitution s arrival in the harbor the citizens of Marblehead rallied in support assembling what cannons they possessed at Fort Sewall and the British called off the pursuit Two weeks later Constitution made her way into Boston where she remained blockaded in port until mid December br br br HMS Cyane and HMS Levant br br Captain George Collier of the Royal Navy received command of the gun HMS Leander and was sent to North America to deal with the American frigates that were causing such losses to British shipping Meanwhile Charles Stewart saw his chance to escape from Boston Harbor and made it good on the afternoon of December and Constitution again set course for Bermuda Collier gathered a squadron consisting of Leander Newcastle and Acasta and set off in pursuit but he was unable to overtake her On December Constitution intercepted the merchantman Lord Nelson and placed a prize crew aboard Constitution had left Boston not fully supplied but Lord Nelson s stores supplied a Christmas dinner for the crew br Constitution was cruising off Cape Finisterre on February when Stewart learned that the Treaty of Ghent had been signed He realized however that a state of war still existed until the treaty was ratified and Constitution captured the British merchantman Susanna on February her cargo of animal hides was valued at br On February Constitution sighted the small British ships Cyane and Levant sailing in company and gave chase Cyane and Levant began a series of broadsides against her but Stewart outmaneuvered both of them and forced Levant to draw off for repairs He concentrated fire on Cyane which soon struck her colors Levant returned to engage Constitution but she turned and attempted to escape when she saw that Cyane had been defeated Constitution overtook her and after several more broadsides she struck her colors Stewart remained with his new prizes overnight while ordering repairs to all ships Constitution had suffered little damage in the battle though it was later discovered that she had twelve pound British cannonballs embedded in her hull none of which had penetrated The trio then set a course for the Cape Verde Islands and arrived at Porto Praya on March br The next morning Collier s squadron was spotted on a course for the harbor and Stewart ordered all ships to sail immediately he had been unaware until then of Collier s pursuit Cyane was able to elude the squadron and make sail for America where she arrived on April but Levant was overtaken and recaptured Collier s squadron was distracted with Levant while Constitution made another escape from overwhelming forces br Constitution set a course towards Guinea and then west towards Brazil as Stewart had learned from the capture of Susanna that HMS Inconstant was transporting gold bullion back to England and he wanted her as a prize Constitution put into Maranh o on April to offload her British prisoners and replenish her drinking water While there Stewart learned by rumor that the Treaty of Ghent had been ratified and set course for America receiving verification of peace at San Juan Puerto Rico on April He then set course for New York and arrived home on May to large celebrations Constitution emerged from the war undefeated though her sister ships Chesapeake and President were not so fortunate having been captured in and respectively Constitution was moved to Boston and placed in ordinary in January sitting out the Second Barbary War br br br Mediterranean Squadron br Charlestown Navy Yard s commandant Isaac Hull directed a refitting of Constitution to prepare her for duty with the Mediterranean Squadron in April They removed Joshua Humphreys diagonal riders to make room for two iron freshwater tanks and they replaced the copper sheathing and timbers below the waterline At the direction of Secretary of the Navy Smith Thompson she was also subjected to an unusual experiment in which manually operated paddle wheels were fitted to her hull The paddle wheels were designed to propel her at up to knots km h mph if she was ever becalmed by the crew using the ship s capstan Initial testing was successful but Hull and Constitution s commanding officer Jacob Jones were reportedly unimpressed with paddle wheels on a US Navy ship Jones had them removed and stowed in the cargo hold before he departed on May for a three year tour of duty in the Mediterranean On April she collided with the British merchant ship Bicton in the Mediterranean Sea and Bicton sank with the loss of her captain br Constitution otherwise experienced an uneventful tour sailing in company with Ontario and Nonsuch until crew behavior during shore leave gave Jones a reputation as a commodore who was lax in discipline The Navy grew weary of receiving complaints about the crews antics while in port and ordered Jones to return Constitution arrived in Boston on May and Jones was relieved of command Thomas Macdonough took command and sailed on October for the Mediterranean under the direction of John Rodgers in North Carolina With discipline restored Constitution resumed uneventful duty Macdonough resigned his command for health reasons on October Constitution put in for repairs during December and into January until Daniel Todd Patterson assumed command on February By August she had been put into Port Mahon suffering decay of her spar deck and she remained there until temporary repairs were completed in March Constitution returned to Boston on July and was placed in reserve br br br Old Ironsides br Constitution was built in an era when a ship s expected service life was to years Secretary of the Navy John Branch made a routine order for surveys of ships in the reserve fleet and commandant of the Charlestown Navy Yard Charles Morris estimated a repair cost of over for Constitution On September an article appeared in the Boston Advertiser which erroneously claimed that the Navy intended to scrap Constitution Two days later Oliver Wendell Holmes poem Old Ironsides was published in the same paper and later all over the country igniting public indignation and inciting efforts to save Old Ironsides from the scrap yard Secretary Branch approved the costs and Constitution began a leisurely repair period while awaiting completion of the dry dock then under construction at the yard In contrast to the efforts to save Constitution another round of surveys in found her sister ship Congress unfit for repair she was unceremoniously broken up in br On June Constitution entered dry dock Captain Jesse Elliott the new commander of the Navy yard oversaw her reconstruction Constitution had in mm of hog in her keel and remained in dry dock until June This was the first of many times that souvenirs were made from her old planking Isaac Hull ordered walking canes picture frames and even a phaeton which was presented to President Andrew Jackson br Meanwhile Elliott directed the installation of a new figurehead of President Jackson under the bowsprit which became a subject of much controversy due to Jackson s political unpopularity in Boston at the time Elliot was a Jacksonian Democrat and he received death threats Rumors circulated about the citizens of Boston storming the navy yard to remove the figurehead themselves br A merchant captain named Samuel Dewey accepted a small wager as to whether he could complete the task of removal Elliot had posted guards on Constitution to ensure the safety of the figurehead but Dewey crossed the Charles River in a small boat using the noise of thunderstorms to mask his movements and managed to saw off most of Jackson s head The severed head made the rounds between taverns and meeting houses in Boston until Dewey personally returned it to Secretary of the Navy Mahlon Dickerson it remained on Dickerson s library shelf for many years The addition of busts to her stern escaped controversy of any kind depicting Isaac Hull William Bainbridge and Charles Stewart the busts remained in place for the next years br br br Mediterranean and Pacific Squadrons br Elliot was appointed captain of Constitution and got underway in March to New York where he ordered repairs to the Jackson figurehead avoiding a second round of controversy Departing on March Constitution set a course for France to deliver Edward Livingston to his post as Minister She arrived on April and began the return voyage on May She arrived back in Boston on June then sailed on August to take her station as flagship in the Mediterranean arriving at Port Mahon on September Her duty over the next two years was uneventful as she and United States made routine patrols and diplomatic visits From April into February Elliot collected various ancient artifacts to carry back to America adding various livestock during the return voyage Constitution arrived in Norfolk on July Elliot was later suspended from duty for transporting livestock on a Navy ship br As the flagship of the Pacific Squadron under the command of Captain Daniel Turner she began her next voyage on March with the duty of patrolling the western coast of South America Often spending months in one port or another she visited Valpara so Callao Paita and Puna while her crew amused themselves with the beaches and taverns in each locality The return voyage found her at Rio de Janeiro where Emperor Pedro II of Brazil visited her about August Departing Rio she returned to Norfolk on October On June she was recommissioned under the command of Foxhall Alexander Parker for duty with the Home Squadron After spending months in port she put to sea for three weeks during December then was again put in ordinary br br br Around the world br In late she was moored at Norfolk serving as a receiving ship Naval Constructor Foster Rhodes calculated that it would require to make her seaworthy Acting Secretary David Henshaw faced a dilemma His budget could not support such a cost yet he could not allow the country s favorite ship to deteriorate He turned to Captain John Percival known in the service as Mad Jack The captain traveled to Virginia and conducted his own survey of the ship s needs He reported that the necessary repairs and upgrades could be done at a cost of On November Henshaw told Percival to proceed without delay but stay within his projected figure After several months of labor Percival reported Constitution ready for a two or even a three year cruise br She got underway on May carrying Ambassador to Brazil Henry A Wise and his family arriving at Rio de Janeiro on August after making two port visits along the way She sailed again on September making port calls at Madagascar Mozambique and Zanzibar and arriving at Sumatra on January Many of her crew began to suffer from dysentery and fevers causing several deaths which led Percival to set course for Singapore arriving there February While in Singapore Commodore Henry Ducie Chads of HMS Cambrian paid a visit to Constitution offering what medical assistance his squadron could provide Chads had been the Lieutenant of Java when she surrendered to William Bainbridge years earlier The relationship between the United States and Brunei began on April when she was anchored in Brunei Bay in which a Treaty of Peace Friendship Commerce and Navigation was formed br Leaving Singapore Constitution arrived at Turon Cochinchina present day Da Nang Vietnam on May Not long after Percival was informed that French missionary Dominique Lef bvre was being held captive under sentence of death He went ashore with a squad of Marines to speak with the local Mandarin Percival demanded the return of Lef bvre and took three local leaders hostage to ensure that his demands were met When no communication was forthcoming he ordered the capture of three junks which were brought to Constitution He released the hostages after two days attempting to show good faith towards the Mandarin who had demanded their return During a storm the three junks escaped upriver a detachment of Marines pursued and recaptured them The supply of food and water from shore was stopped and Percival gave in to another demand for the release of the junks in order to keep his ship supplied expecting Lef bvre to be released He soon realized that no return would be made however and Percival ordered Constitution to depart on May br She arrived at Canton China on June and spent the next six weeks there while Percival made shore and diplomatic visits Again the crew suffered from dysentery due to poor drinking water resulting in three more deaths by the time that she reached Manila on September spending a week there preparing to enter the Pacific Ocean She then sailed on September for the Hawaiian Islands arriving at Honolulu on November She found Commodore John D Sloat and his flagship Savannah there Sloat informed Percival that Constitution was needed in Mexico as the United States was preparing for war after the Texas annexation She provisioned for six months and sailed for Mazatl n arriving there on January She sat at anchor for more than three months until she was finally allowed to sail for home on April rounding Cape Horn on July Arriving in Rio de Janeiro the ship s party learned that the Mexican War had begun on May soon after their departure from Mazatl n She arrived home in Boston on September and was mothballed on October br br br Mediterranean and African Squadrons br br Constitution began a refitting in for duty with the Mediterranean Squadron The figurehead of Andrew Jackson that caused so much controversy years earlier was replaced with another likeness of Jackson this time without a top hat and with a more Napoleonic pose Captain John Gwinn commanded her on this voyage departing on December and arriving at Tripoli on January She received King Ferdinand II and Pope Pius IX on board at Gaeta on August giving them a gun salute This was the first time that a Pope set foot on American territory or its equivalent br At Palermo on September Captain Gwinn died of chronic gastritis and was buried near Lazaretto on the th Captain Thomas Conover assumed command on the th and resumed routine patrolling for the rest of the tour heading home on December She was involved in a severe collision with the English brig Confidence cutting her in half which sank with the loss of her captain The surviving crew members were carried back to America where Constitution was put in ordinary once again this time at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in January br Constitution was recommissioned on December under the command of John Rudd She carried Commodore Isaac Mayo for duty with the African Squadron departing the yard on March on a leisurely sail towards Africa and arriving there on June Mayo made a diplomatic visit in Liberia arranging a treaty between the Gbarbo and the Grebo tribes Mayo resorted to firing cannons into the village of the Gbarbo in order to get them to agree to the treaty About June he arranged another peace treaty between the leaders of Grahway and Half Cavally On July he arranged a compact with the King of Lagos br Constitution took the American ship H N Gambrill as a prize near Angola on November H N Gambrill was involved in the slave trade and proved to be Constitution s final capture The rest of her tour passed uneventfully and she sailed for home on March She was diverted to Havana Cuba arriving there on May and departing on the th She arrived at Portsmouth Navy Yard and was decommissioned on June ending her last duty on the front lines br br br Civil War br br Since the formation of the US Naval Academy in there had been a growing need for quarters in which to house the students midshipmen In Constitution was moved to dry dock at the Portsmouth Navy Yard for conversion into a training ship Some of the earliest known photographs of her were taken during this refitting which added classrooms on her spar and gun decks and reduced her armament to only guns Her rating was changed to a nd rate ship She was recommissioned on August and moved from Portsmouth to the Naval Academy br br At the outbreak of the Civil War in April Constitution was ordered to relocate farther north after threats had been made against her by Confederate sympathizers Several companies of Massachusetts volunteer soldiers were stationed aboard for her protection R R Cuyler towed her to New York City where she arrived on April She was subsequently relocated along with the Naval Academy to Fort Adams in Newport Rhode Island for the duration of the war Her sister ship United States was abandoned by the Union and then captured by Confederate forces at the Gosport Shipyard leaving Constitution the only remaining frigate of the original six br The Navy launched an ironclad on May as part of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron and they bestowed on her the name New Ironsides to honor Constitution s tradition of service However New Ironsides naval career was short as she was destroyed by fire on December In August Constitution moved back to Annapolis along with the rest of the Naval Academy During the voyage she was allowed to drop her tow lines from the tug and continue alone under wind power Despite her age she was recorded running at knots km h mph and arrived at Hampton Roads ten hours ahead of the tug Andersonville Prisoners Thorp and his fellow soldiers were transported to Jacksonville Fla then on USS Constitution to Camp Parole in Annapolis Md There they were issued rations clothing and back pay before being sent to their respective regimental headquarters for discharge br As Constitution settled in again at the Academy a series of upgrades was installed that included steam pipes and radiators to supply heat from shore along with gas lighting From June to August each year she would depart with midshipmen for their summer training cruise and then return to operate for the rest of the year as a classroom In June her last known plank owner William Bryant died in Maine George Dewey assumed command in November he served as her commanding officer until In her condition had deteriorated to the point where she was retired as a training ship and then towed to the Philadelphia Navy Yard where she was placed in ordinary on September br br br Paris Exposition br br Constitution was overhauled beginning in in order to participate in the centennial celebrations of the United States Work began slowly and was intermittently delayed by the transition of the Philadelphia Navy Yard to League Island By late the Navy opened bids for an outside contractor to complete the work and Constitution was moved to Wood Dialogue and Company in May where a coal bin and a small boiler for heat were installed The Andrew Jackson figurehead was removed at this time and given to the Naval Academy Museum where it remains today Her construction dragged on during the rest of until the centennial celebrations had long passed and the Navy decided that she would be used as a training and school ship for apprentices br Oscar C Badger took command on January to prepare her for a voyage to the Paris Exposition of transporting artwork and industrial displays to France Three railroad cars were lashed to her spar deck and all but two cannons were removed when she departed on March While docking at Le Havre she collided with Ville de Paris which resulted in Constitution entering dry dock for repairs and remaining in France for the rest of She got underway for the United States on January but poor navigation ran her aground the next day near Bollard Head Dorset United Kingdom She was refloated with the assistance of the tugs Commodore Lightning Lothair Royal Albert Malta and Telegraph She was towed into the Portsmouth Naval Dockyard Hampshire England where only minor damage was found and repaired br Her problem plagued voyage continued on February when her rudder was damaged during heavy storms resulting in a total loss of steering control with the rudder smashing into the hull at random Three crewmen went over the stern on ropes and boatswain s chairs and secured it The next morning they rigged a temporary steering system Badger set a course for the nearest port and she arrived in Lisbon on February Slow dock services delayed her departure until April and her voyage home did not end until May Carpenter s Mate Henry Williams Captain of the Top Joseph Matthews and Captain of the Top James Horton received the Medal of Honor for their actions in repairing the damaged rudder at sea Constitution returned to her previous duties of training apprentice boys and Ship s Corporal James Thayer received a Medal of Honor for saving a fellow crew member from drowning on November br Over the next two years she continued her training cruises but it soon became apparent that her overhaul in had been of poor quality and in she was determined to be unfit for service Funds were lacking for another overhaul so she was decommissioned ending her days as an active duty naval ship She was moved to the Portsmouth Navy Yard and used as a receiving ship There she had a housing structure built over her spar deck and her condition continued to deteriorate with only a minimal amount of maintenance performed to keep her afloat In Massachusetts Congressman John F Fitzgerald became aware of her condition and proposed to Congress that funds be appropriated to restore her enough to return to Boston She arrived at the Charlestown Navy Yard under tow on September and after her centennial celebrations in October she lay there with an uncertain future br br br Museum ship br br In Congress authorized the restoration of Constitution but did not appropriate any funds for the project funding was to be raised privately The Massachusetts Society of the United Daughters of the War of spearheaded an effort to raise funds but they ultimately failed In the Massachusetts Historical Society s president Charles Francis Adams requested of Congress that Constitution be rehabilitated and placed back into active service br In Secretary of the Navy Charles Joseph Bonaparte suggested that Constitution be towed out to sea and used as target practice after which she would be allowed to sink Moses H Gulesian read about this in a Boston newspaper he was a businessman from Worcester Massachusetts and he offered to purchase her for The State Department refused but Gulesian initiated a public campaign which began from Boston and ultimately spilled all over the country The storms of protest from the public prompted Congress to authorize million in in for the ship s restoration First to be removed was the barracks structure on her spar deck but the limited amount of funds allowed just a partial restoration By Constitution began to serve as a museum ship with tours offered to the public On December she was renamed Old Constitution to free her name for a planned new Lexington class battlecruiser The name Constitution was originally destined for the lead ship of the class but was shuffled between hulls until CC was given the name construction of CC was canceled in due to the Washington Naval Treaty The incomplete hull was sold for scrap and Old Constitution was granted the return of her name on July br br br restoration and tour br Admiral Edward Walter Eberle Chief of Naval Operations ordered the Board of Inspection and Survey to compile a report on her condition and the inspection of February found her in grave condition Water had to be pumped out of her hold every day just to keep her afloat and her stern was in danger of falling off Almost all deck areas and structural components were filled with rot and she was considered to be on the verge of ruin Yet the Board recommended that she be thoroughly repaired in order to preserve her as long as possible The estimated cost of repairs was Secretary of the Navy Curtis D Wilbur proposed to Congress that the required funds be raised privately and he was authorized to assemble the committee charged with her restoration br The first effort was sponsored by the national Elks Lodge Programs presented to schoolchildren about Old Ironsides encouraged them to donate pennies towards her restoration eventually raising In the meantime the estimates for repair began to climb eventually reaching over million in after costs of materials were realized In September Wilbur began to sell copies of a painting of Constitution at cents per copy The silent film Old Ironsides portrayed Constitution during the First Barbary War It premiered in December and helped spur more contributions to her restoration fund The final campaign allowed memorabilia to be made of her discarded planking and metal The committee eventually raised more than after expenses still short of the required amount and Congress approved up to to complete the restoration The final cost of the restoration was equivalent to in br br Lieutenant John A Lord was selected to oversee the reconstruction project and work began while fund raising efforts were still underway Materials were difficult to find especially the live oak needed Lord uncovered a long forgotten stash of live oak some short tons t at Naval Air Station Pensacola Florida that had been cut sometime in the s for a ship building program that never began Constitution entered dry dock with a crowd of observers on June Meanwhile Charles Francis Adams had been appointed as Secretary of the Navy and he proposed that Constitution make a tour of the United States upon her completion as a gift to the nation for its efforts to help restore her She emerged from dry dock on March approximately percent of the ship had been renewed i e replaced to make her seaworthy Many amenities were installed to prepare her for the three year tour of the country including water piping throughout modern toilet and shower facilities electric lighting to make the interior visible for visitors and several peloruses for ease of navigation miles m of rigging was made for Constitution at Charlestown Navy Yard ropewalk br Constitution recommissioned on July under the command of Louis J Gulliver with a crew of officers and sailors Marines and a pet monkey named Rosie as their mascot The tour began at Portsmouth New Hampshire with much celebration and a gun salute scheduled to visit port cities along the Atlantic Gulf and Pacific coasts Due to the heavy itinerary she was towed by the minesweeper Grebe She went as far north as Bar Harbor Maine south and into the Gulf of Mexico then through the Panama Canal Zone and north again to Bellingham Washington on the Pacific Coast Constitution returned to her home port of Boston in May after more than million people visited her during the three year tour br br br return to Boston br Constitution returned to serving as a museum ship receiving visitors per year in Boston She was maintained by a small crew who were berthed on the ship requiring more reliable heating The heating was upgraded to a forced air system in the s and a sprinkler system was added that protects her from fire Constitution broke loose from her dock on September during the New England Hurricane and was blown into Boston Harbor where she collided with the destroyer Ralph Talbot she suffered only minor damage br br With limited funds available she experienced more deterioration over the years and items began to disappear from the ship as souvenir hunters picked away at the more portable objects Constitution and USS Constellation were recommissioned in at the request of President Franklin Roosevelt br In early Constitution was assigned the hull classification symbol IX and began to serve as a brig for officers awaiting court martial br The United States Postal Service issued a stamp commemorating Constitution in and an Act of Congress in made the Secretary of the Navy responsible for her upkeep br br br Restoration br In another survey was performed on her condition finding that repairs were required but not as extensively as needed in the s The US Navy determined that a commander was required as commanding officer typically someone with about years of seniority this would ensure the experience to organize the maintenance that she required Funds were approved in for her restoration and she entered dry dock in April remaining until April During this period large quantities of red oak were removed and replaced The red oak had been added in the s as an experiment to see if it would be more durable than the live oak but it had mostly rotted away by br br br Bicentennial celebrations br Commander Tyrone G Martin became her captain in August as preparations began for the upcoming United States Bicentennial celebrations He set the precedent that all construction work on Constitution was to be aimed towards maintaining her to the configuration for which she is most noted In September her hull classification of IX was officially canceled br The privately run USS Constitution Museum opened on April and Commander Martin dedicated a tract of land as Constitution Grove one month later located at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Indiana The acres km now supply the majority of the white oak required for repair work On July Constitution led the parade of tall ships up Boston Harbor for Operation Sail firing her guns at one minute intervals for the first time in approximately years On July she rendered a gun salute to Her Majesty s Yacht Britannia as Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip arrived for a state visit The royal couple were piped aboard and privately toured the ship for approximately minutes with Commander Martin and Secretary of the Navy J William Middendorf Upon their departure the crew of Constitution rendered three cheers for the Queen Over visitors toured Old Ironsides that year br br br reconstruction br Constitution entered dry dock in for an inspection and minor repair period that turned out to be her most comprehensive structural restoration and repair since she was launched in Multiple refittings over the years of her career had removed most of her original construction components and design as her mission changed from a fighting warship to a training ship and eventually to a receiving ship In the Naval History Heritage Command Detachment Boston reviewed Humphreys original plans and identified five main structural components that were required to prevent hogging of the hull as Constitution had in mm of hog at that point Using a scale model of the ship they were able to determine that restoring the original components would result in a increase in hull stiffness br Three hundred scans were completed on her timbers using radiography to find any hidden problems otherwise undetectable from the outside technology that was unavailable during previous reconstructions The repair crew used sound wave testing aided by the United States Forest Service s Forest Products Laboratory to determine the condition of the remaining timbers that might have been rotting from the inside The in mm of hog was removed from her keel by allowing the ship to settle naturally while in dry dock The most difficult task was the procurement of timber in the quantity and sizes needed as was the case during her s restoration as well The city of Charleston South Carolina donated live oak trees that had been felled by Hurricane Hugo in and the International Paper Company donated live oak from its own property The project continued to reconstruct her to specifications even as she remained open to visitors who were allowed to observe the process and converse with workers The million project was completed in br br br Sailing on th anniversary br br As early as Commander David Cashman had suggested that Constitution should sail to celebrate her th anniversary in rather than being towed The proposal was approved though it was thought to be a large undertaking since she had not sailed in over years When she emerged from dry dock in a more serious effort began to prepare her for sail As in the s education programs aimed at school children helped collect pennies to purchase the sails to make the voyage possible Her six sail battle configuration consisted of jibs topsails and driver br Commander Mike Beck began training the crew for the historic sail using an Navy sailing manual and several months of practice including time spent aboard the Coast Guard cutter Eagle On July Constitution was towed from her usual berth in Boston to an overnight mooring in Marblehead Massachusetts En route she made her first sail in years at a recorded knots km h mph br On July she was towed nautical miles km mi offshore where the tow line was dropped and Commander Beck ordered six sails set jibs topsails and spanker She then sailed for minutes on a south south east course with true wind speeds of about kn km h mph attaining a top recorded speed of kn km h mph Her modern US naval combatant escorts were the guided missile destroyer Ramage and frigate Halyburton They rendered passing honors to Old Ironsides while she was under sail and she was overflown by the US Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron the Blue Angels Inbound to her permanent berth at Charlestown she rendered a gun salute to the nation off Fort Independence in Boston Harbor br br br Present day br br The mission of Constitution is to promote understanding of the Navy s role in war and peace through active participation in public events and education through outreach programs public access and historic demonstration Her crew of approximately US Navy sailors participate in ceremonies educational programs and special events while keeping the ship open to visitors year round and providing free tours The crewmen are all active duty members of the US Navy and the assignment is considered to be special duty She entered dry dock in May for a scheduled restoration before returning to sea br Constitution is berthed at Pier One of the former Charlestown Navy Yard at the terminus of Boston s Freedom Trail She is open to the public year round The privately run USS Constitution Museum is nearby located in a restored shipyard building at the foot of Pier Two Constitution typically makes at least one turnaround cruise each year during which she is towed into Boston Harbor to perform underway demonstrations including a gun drill she then returns to her dock in the opposite direction to ensure that she weathers evenly The turnaround cruise is open to the general public based on a lottery draw of interested persons each year br The Naval History and Heritage Command Detachment Boston is responsible for planning and performing her maintenance repair and restoration keeping her as close as possible to her configuration The detachment estimates that approximately percent of the timber in Constitution contains original material installed during her initial construction period in the years The Navy maintains Constitution Grove at Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division near Bloomington Indiana to ensure a supply of mature white oak br In the special effects crew from the production of Master and Commander The Far Side of the World spent several days using Constitution as a computer model for the fictional French frigate Acheron using stem to stern digital image scans Lieutenant Commander John Scivier of the Royal Navy commanding officer of HMS Victory paid a visit to Constitution in November touring the local facilities with Commander William A Bullard III They discussed arranging an exchange program between the two ships br br Constitution emerged from a three year repair period in November During this time the entire spar deck was stripped down to the support beams and the decking overhead was replaced to restore its original curvature allowing water to drain overboard and not remain standing on the deck In addition to decking repairs hull planks and the main hatch were repaired or replaced The restoration continued the focus toward keeping her appearance of by replacing her upper sides so that she now resembles what she looked like after her triumph over Guerriere when she gained her nickname Old Ironsides The crew of Constitution under Commander Matt Bonner sailed Constitution under her own power on August the anniversary of her victory over Guerriere Bonner was Constitution s nd commanding officer br On May the ship entered Dry Dock in Charlestown Navy Yard to begin a two year restoration program The restoration planned to restore the copper sheets on the ship s hull and replace deck boards The Department of the Navy provided the million expected cost After the restoration was complete she was returned to the water on July In November Commander Nathaniel R Shick relieved Commander Robert S Gerosa Jr who had spent
