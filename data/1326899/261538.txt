A winch is a mechanical device that is used to pull in wind up or let out wind out or otherwise adjust the tension of a rope or wire rope also called cable or wire cable br In its simplest form it consists of a spool or drum attached to a hand crank Traditionally winches on ships accumulated wire or rope on the drum those that do not accumulate and instead pass on the wire rope see yacht photo above are called capstans Despite this sailboat capstans are most often referred to as winches Winches are the basis of such machines as tow trucks steam shovels and elevators More complex designs have gear assemblies and can be powered by electric hydraulic pneumatic or internal combustion drives It might include a solenoid brake and or a mechanical brake or ratchet and pawl which prevents it unwinding unless the pawl is retracted The rope may be stored on the winch When trimming a line on a sailboat the crew member turns the winch handle with one hand while tailing pulling on the loose tail end with the other to maintain tension on the turns Some winches have a stripper or cleat to maintain tension These are known as self tailing winches br br br History br br br In the Ancient World br br The earliest literary reference to a winch can be found in the account of Herodotus of Halicarnassus on the Persian Wars Histories where he describes how wooden winches were used to tighten the cables for a pontoon bridge across the Hellespont in BCE Winches may have been employed even earlier in Assyria br By the th century BCE winch and pulley hoists were regarded by Aristotle as common for architectural use Mech b br br br In the th Century br The yacht Reliance American defender of the America s Cup was the first racing boat to be fitted with modern winches below decks The Reliance s competitors relied on muscle power using topside mounted capstans and windlasses which would soon be replaced in most applications by winches including on fishing boats where they are used to bring in the fishing nets br br br Other applications br br br Vehicle recovery br br The main feature that legally distinguishes a tow truck from a conventional truck in many jurisdictions is the presence of a winch which is used to either extract disabled or immobilized vehicles or to load them onto flatbed tilt and load type tow trucks These may be electrically or hydraulically powered from a power take off and is wound with a wire cable and equipped with a hook Snatch blocks may be used to change direction or increase the pulling power and a variety of specialized hooks may be attached to the main hook including hooks which attach to specific parts of the car J hooks which look somewhat like blunt meat hooks are used to hook around axles Mini J hooks can be used if there is a tow loop provided and R and T hooks are designed to hook into slots cut by the manufacturer in the underside of the frame on many cars Axle straps may also be used when there are few other places to attach br br br Off road vehicles br Off road vehicles may be equipped with recovery tools such as winches on the front and back bumpers usually mounted to a winch bar or frame mounted metal bumper Less commonly it is mounted on a specialised metal plate hidden winch mount behind the vehicle s stock bumper this is referred to as a hidden winch as the hook and fairlead hides behind a flip up front number plate the winch itself is not visible The snubbing winch is used to pull vehicles out of mud snow sand rocks and water and to pull vehicles through or over obstacles The winch is made of cable made up of a braided synthetic rope or a steel cable wrapped around a motorized drum Each is controlled electronically allowing the operator to control the winch speed Modern vehicles typically use electric winches running off the car s V starter or V secondary battery The winch is either controlled with a detachable cable a button inside the car or wireless remote Older vehicles may have a PTO winch controlled via the car s transmission a secondary clutch maybe used so the vehicle does not need to be moving while winching Some winches are powered by the pressure generated in the hydraulic steering system The high lift jack or come along is used for manual winching br br br Aircraft use br br Gliders are often launched using a winch mounted on a trailer or heavy vehicle This method is widely used at many European gliding clubs as an inexpensive alternative to aerotowing The engine is usually a gas petrol LPG or diesel though hydraulic fluid engines and electrical motors are also used The winch pulls in to m to ft of high tensile steel wire or a synthetic fibre cable attached at the other end to the glider The cable is released at a height of about to m to ft after a short steep climb br Search and Rescue helicopters are often equipped with winches to avoid having to get the helicopter dangerously close to obstacles or into ocean troughs allowing rescue teams to be lowered and evacuees to be extricated while the helicopter hovers overhead Helicopter winches are also used for heli logging and for airlifting oversized cargo such as vehicles and other aircraft although the winch in these cases is only used to reduce the hazards to flying with an loose cable hanging below the helicopter br Stationary balloons such as the barrage balloons used during the Second World War to discourage marauding aircraft and the Kite balloons used during the First World War for artillery spotting are usually tethered with a winch which can be used to lower the balloon either to relocate it or to bring it down quickly to prevent it being shot down by enemy aircraft Larger man carrying kites often used winches to raise and lower them br Towed gunnery targets used to train anti aircraft gunners and both fighter pilots and aircraft gunners are run out behind the target tug aircraft for practice and winched in for take off and landing br Before advances were made in antennas in the s radio aerials were quite long and needed to be winched out for use and winched back in for landing Failure to do so would then damage the aerial as happened to Amelia Earhart on one of the legs of her last flight br br br Theatre br br Winches are frequently used as elements of backstage mechanics to move scenery in large theatrical productions They are often embedded in the stage floor and used to move large set pieces on and off br br br Wakeskate winch br br Wakeskate winching is a sport where a person on a waterski or snowboard is propelled across the water with a winch The winch consists of a gas powered engine spool rope frame and sometimes a simple transmission The person being towed walks or swims away from the winch while extending the rope When the winch is engaged it pulls the boarder in at a speed ranging from to kilometres per hour to mph The winch may be mounted to a vehicle set into the ground by stakes or tied to a tree The cable may also be run through pulleys mounted offshore so that it pulls the person away from where the winch is located and multiple pulleys may be used to multiply the force applied by a small but high revving motor instead of using a transmission br br br Winch types br br br Lever winch br br Lever winches are winches that use self gripping jaws instead of spools to move rope or wire through the winch Powered by moving a handle back and forth they allow one person to move objects several tons in weight br br br Snubbing winch br This is a vertical spool with a ratchet mechanism similar to a conventional winch but with no crank handle or other form of drive The line is wrapped around the spool and can be tightened or reeled in by pulling the tail line The winch takes the load once the pull is stopped with little operator tension needed to hold it These also allow controlled release of the tension by the operator using the friction of the line around the ratcheted spool They are used on small sailing boats and dinghies to control sheets and other lines and in larger applications to supplement and relieve tension on the primary winches br br br Air winch br An air winch sometimes known as an air hoist or air tugger is an air powered version of a winch It is commonly used for the lifting and the suspension of materials In the oil and gas construction and maritime industries air winches are frequently preferred to electric diesel and hydraulic winches because of their durability versatility and safety br br br See also br br br br br br External links br br Arctander Erik H May
