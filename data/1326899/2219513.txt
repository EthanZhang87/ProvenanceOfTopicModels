id: 2219513
The top on a traditional square rigged ship is the platform at the upper end of each lower mast This is not the masthead crow s nest of the popular imagination above the mainmast for example is the main topmast main topgallant mast and main royal mast so that the top is actually about to of the way up the mast as a whole br The main purpose of the top is to anchor the shrouds of the topmast that extends above it Shrouds down to the side of the hull would be at too acute an angle from the mast so crosstrees run sideways out from the mast to spread the topmast shrouds These crosstrees rest on two trestle trees running fore and aft which themselves are placed on top of the cheeks of hounds bolted to the sides of the mast Placing a few timbers onto the crosstrees produces a useful platform the top The futtock shrouds carry the load of the upper shrouds into the mast below br At the upper end of the topmast and topgallant there is a similar situation regarding the next mast up topgallant and royal respectively At these points a smaller top might be constructed but it is more usual simply to leave the shroud bearing struts open in which case they are known as crosstrees br Access for sailors to the top may be by a Jacob s ladder lubber s hole or the futtock shrouds br A foremast might be stepped into a similar fore top platform on the foremast A mizzen top would be a platform on the mizzenmast Similar main top and fore top platforms have been retained on steam ships and motor vessels as preferred locations for installing rotating radar antennae br br br Fighting top br A fighting top was an enlarged top with swivel guns designed to fire down at the deck of enemy ships They could also hold sailors or marines armed with muskets or rifles Horatio Nelson was mortally wounded at the Battle of Trafalgar by a sniper firing from a fighting top of the Redoutable br br br External links br Media related to Top sailing at Wikimedia Commons br Media related to Fighting tops at Wikimedia Commons br br br Sources
