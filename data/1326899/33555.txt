id: 33555
A wheel is a rotating component typically circular in shape that is intended to turn on an axle bearing The wheel is one of the key components of the wheel and axle which is one of the six simple machines Wheels in conjunction with axles allow heavy objects to be moved easily facilitating movement or transportation while supporting a load or performing labor in machines Wheels are also used for other purposes such as a ship s wheel steering wheel potter s wheel and flywheel br Common examples can be found in transport applications A wheel reduces friction by facilitating motion by rolling together with the use of axles In order for wheels to rotate a moment needs to be applied to the wheel about its axis either by way of gravity or by the application of another external force or torque Using the wheel Sumerians invented a device that spins clay as a potter shapes it into the desired object br br br Terminology br The English word wheel comes from the Old English word hw ol from Proto Germanic hwehwlaz from Proto Indo European kw kwlos an extended form of the root kwel to revolve move around Cognates within Indo European include Icelandic hj l wheel tyre Greek k klos and Sanskrit chakra the last two both meaning circle or wheel br br br History br The place and time of the invention of the wheel remains unclear because the oldest hints do not guarantee the existence of real wheeled transport or are dated with too much scatter Mesopotamian civilization is credited with the invention of the wheel by several mainly old sources However some recent sources either suggest that it was invented independently in both Mesopotamia and Eastern Europe or credit prehistoric Eastern Europeans with the invention of the wheel and that unlike other breakthrough inventions the wheel cannot be attributed to a single nor several inventors Evidence of early usage of wheeled carts has been found across the Middle East in Europe Eastern Europe India and China It is not known whether Chinese Indians Europeans and even Mesopotamians invented the wheel independently or not br The invention of the solid wooden disk wheel falls into the late Neolithic and may be seen in conjunction with other technological advances that gave rise to the early Bronze Age This implies the passage of several wheelless millennia even after the invention of agriculture and of pottery during the Aceramic Neolithic br br BCE Copper Age invention of the potter s wheel earliest solid wooden wheels disks with a hole for the axle earliest wheeled vehicles domestication of the horse br BCE Early Bronze Age br BCE Middle Bronze Age invention of the spoked wheel and the chariot br br The Halaf culture of BCE is sometimes credited with the earliest depiction of a wheeled vehicle but this is doubtful as there is no evidence of Halafians using either wheeled vehicles or even pottery wheels Precursors of pottery wheels known as tournettes or slow wheels were known in the Middle East by the th millennium BCE One of the earliest examples was discovered at Tepe Pardis Iran and dated to BCE These were made of stone or clay and secured to the ground with a peg in the center but required significant effort to turn True potter s wheels which are freely spinning and have a wheel and axle mechanism were developed in Mesopotamia Iraq by BCE The oldest surviving example which was found in Ur modern day Iraq dates to approximately BCE Wheels of uncertain dates have also been found in the Indus Valley civilization a th millennium BCE civilization covering areas of present day India and Pakistan br The oldest indirect evidence of wheeled movement was found in the form of miniature clay wheels north of the Black Sea before BCE From the middle of the th millennium BCE onward the evidence is condensed throughout Europe in the form of toy cars depictions or ruts with the oldest find in Northern Germany dating back to around BCE In Mesopotamia depictions of wheeled wagons found on clay tablet pictographs at the Eanna district of Uruk in the Sumerian civilization are dated to c BCE In the second half of the th millennium BCE evidence of wheeled vehicles appeared near simultaneously in the Northern Maykop culture and South Caucasus and Eastern Europe Cucuteni Trypillian culture br br Depictions of a wheeled vehicle appeared between and BCE in the Bronocice clay pot excavated in a Funnelbeaker culture settlement in southern Poland In nearby Olszanica a m wide door was constructed for wagon entry this barn was m long with three doors dated to BCE and belonged to the neolithic Linear Pottery culture Surviving evidence of a wheel axle combination from Stare Gmajne near Ljubljana in Slovenia Ljubljana Marshes Wooden Wheel is dated within two standard deviations to BCE the axle to BCE Two types of early Neolithic European wheel and axle are known a circumalpine type of wagon construction the wheel and axle rotate together as in Ljubljana Marshes Wheel and that of the Baden culture in Hungary axle does not rotate They both are dated to c BCE Some historians believe that there was a diffusion of the wheeled vehicle from the Near East to Europe around the mid th millennium BCE br br Early wheels were simple wooden disks with a hole for the axle Some of the earliest wheels were made from horizontal slices of tree trunks Because of the uneven structure of wood a wheel made from a horizontal slice of a tree trunk will tend to be inferior to one made from rounded pieces of longitudinal boards br The spoked wheel was invented more recently and allowed the construction of lighter and swifter vehicles The earliest known examples of wooden spoked wheels are in the context of the Sintashta culture dating to c BCE Krivoye Lake Soon after this horse cultures of the Caucasus region used horse drawn spoked wheel war chariots for the greater part of three centuries They moved deep into the Greek peninsula where they joined with the existing Mediterranean peoples to give rise eventually to classical Greece after the breaking of Minoan dominance and consolidations led by pre classical Sparta and Athens Celtic chariots introduced an iron rim around the wheel in the st millennium BCE br In China wheel tracks dating to around BCE have been found at Pingliangtai a site of the Longshan Culture Similar tracks were also found at Yanshi a city of the Erlitou culture dating to around BCE The earliest evidence of spoked wheels in China comes from Qinghai in the form of two wheel hubs from a site dated between and BCE br In Britain a large wooden wheel measuring about m ft in diameter was uncovered at the Must Farm site in East Anglia in The specimen dating from to BCE represents the most complete and earliest of its type found in Britain The wheel s hub is also present A horse s spine found nearby suggests the wheel may have been part of a horse drawn cart The wheel was found in a settlement built on stilts over wetland indicating that the settlement had some sort of link to dry land br br Although large scale use of wheels did not occur in the Americas prior to European contact numerous small wheeled artifacts identified as children s toys have been found in Mexican archeological sites some dating to approximately BCE Some argue that the primary obstacle to large scale development of the wheel in the Americas was the absence of domesticated large animals that could be used to pull wheeled carriages The closest relative of cattle present in Americas in pre Columbian times the American bison is difficult to domesticate and was never domesticated by Native Americans several horse species existed until about years ago but ultimately became extinct The only large animal that was domesticated in the Western hemisphere the llama a pack animal was not physically suited to use as a draft animal to pull wheeled vehicles and use of the llama did not spread far beyond the Andes by the time of the arrival of Europeans br On the other hand Mesoamericans never developed the wheelbarrow the potter s wheel nor any other practical object with a wheel or wheels Although present in a number of toys very similar to those found throughout the world and still made for children today pull toys the wheel was never put into practical use in Mesoamerica before the th century Possibly the closest the Mayas came to the utilitarian wheel is the spindle whorl and some scholars believe that these toys were originally made with spindle whorls and spindle sticks as wheels and axes br Aboriginal Australians traditionally used circular discs rolled along the ground for target practice br Nubians from after about BCE used wheels for spinning pottery and as water wheels It is thought that Nubian waterwheels may have been ox driven It is also known that Nubians used horse drawn chariots imported from Egypt br Starting from the th century in West Africa wheeled vehicles were mostly used for ceremonial purposes in places like Dahomey The wheel was barely used for transportation with the exception of Ethiopia and Somalia in Sub Saharan Africa well into the th century br br The spoked wheel was in continued use without major modification until the s when wire spoked wheels and pneumatic tires were invented Pneumatic tires can greatly reduce rolling resistance and improve comfort Wire spokes are under tension not compression making it possible for the wheel to be both stiff and light Early radially spoked wire wheels gave rise to tangentially spoked wire wheels which were widely used on cars into the late th century Cast alloy wheels are now more commonly used forged alloy wheels are used when weight is critical br The invention of the wheel has also been important for technology in general important applications including the water wheel the cogwheel see also antikythera mechanism the spinning wheel and the astrolabe or torquetum More modern descendants of the wheel include the propeller the jet engine the flywheel gyroscope and the turbine br br br Mechanics and function br br A wheeled vehicle requires much less work to move than simply dragging the same weight The low resistance to motion is explained by the fact that the frictional work done is no longer at the surface that the vehicle is traversing but in the bearings In the simplest and oldest case the bearing is just a round hole through which the axle passes a plain bearing Even with a plain bearing the frictional work is greatly reduced because br br The normal force at the sliding interface is same as with simple dragging br The sliding distance is reduced for a given distance of travel br The coefficient of friction at the interface is usually lower br Example br br If a kg object is dragged for m along a surface with the coefficient of friction the normal force is N and the work done required energy is work force x distance joules br Now give the object wheels The normal force between the wheels and axles is the same in total N Assume for wood and say the wheel diameter is mm and axle diameter is mm So while the object still moves m the sliding frictional surfaces only slide over each other a distance of m The work done is joules the work done has reduced to of that of dragging br Additional energy is lost from the wheel to road interface This is termed rolling resistance which is predominantly a deformation loss It depends on the nature of the ground of the material of the wheel its inflation in the case of a tire the net torque exerted by the eventual engine and many other factors br A wheel can also offer advantages in traversing irregular surfaces if the wheel radius is sufficiently large compared to the irregularities br The wheel alone is not a machine but when attached to an axle in conjunction with bearing it forms the wheel and axle one of the simple machines A driven wheel is an example of a wheel and axle Wheels pre date driven wheels by about years themselves an evolution of using round logs as rollers to move a heavy load a practice going back in pre history so far that it has not been dated br br br Construction br br br Rim br br The rim is the outer edge of a wheel holding the tire It makes up the outer circular design of the wheel on which the inside edge of the tire is mounted on vehicles such as automobiles For example on a bicycle wheel the rim is a large hoop attached to the outer ends of the spokes of the wheel that holds the tire and tube br In the st millennium BCE an iron rim was introduced around the wooden wheels of chariots br br br Hub br The hub is the center of the wheel and typically houses a bearing and is where the spokes meet br A hubless wheel also known as a rim rider or centerless wheel is a type of wheel with no center hub More specifically the hub is actually almost as big as the wheel itself The axle is hollow following the wheel at very close tolerances br br br Spokes br br A spoke is one of some number of rods radiating from the center of a wheel the hub where the axle connects connecting the hub with the round traction surface The term originally referred to portions of a log which had been split lengthwise into four or six sections The radial members of a wagon wheel were made by carving a spoke from a log into their finished shape A spokeshave is a tool originally developed for this purpose Eventually the term spoke was more commonly applied to the finished product of the wheelwright s work than to the materials used br br br Wire br br The rims of wire wheels or wire spoked wheels are connected to their hubs by wire spokes Although these wires are generally stiffer than a typical wire rope they function mechanically the same as tensioned flexible wires keeping the rim true while supporting applied loads br Wire wheels are used on most bicycles and still used on many motorcycles They were invented by aeronautical engineer George Cayley and first used in bicycles by James Starley A process of assembling wire wheels is described as wheelbuilding br br br Tire Tyre br br A tire in American English and Canadian English or tyre in some Commonwealth Nations such as UK India South Africa Australia and New Zealand is a ring shaped covering that fits around a wheel rim to protect it and enable better vehicle performance by providing a flexible cushion that absorbs shock while keeping the wheel in close contact with the ground The word itself may be derived from the word tie which refers to the outer steel ring part of a wooden cart wheel that ties the wood segments together see Etymology above br The fundamental materials of modern tires are synthetic rubber natural rubber fabric and wire along with other compound chemicals They consist of a tread and a body The tread provides traction while the body ensures support Before rubber was invented the first versions of tires were simply bands of metal that fitted around wooden wheels to prevent wear and tear Today the vast majority of tires are pneumatic inflatable structures comprising a doughnut shaped body of cords and wires encased in rubber and generally filled with compressed air to form an inflatable cushion Pneumatic tires are used on many types of vehicles such as cars bicycles motorcycles trucks earthmovers and aircraft br br br Protruding or covering attachments br Extreme off road conditions have resulted in the invention of several types of wheel cover which may be constructed as removable attachments or as permanent covers Wheels like this are no longer necessarily round or have panels that make the ground contact area flat br Examples include br br Snow chains Specially designed chain assemblies that wrap around the tire to provide increased grip designed for deep snow br Dreadnaught wheel A type of permanently attached hinged panels for general extreme off road use These are not connected directly to the wheels but to each other br Pedrail wheel A system of rails that holds panels that hold the vehicle These do not necessarily have to be built as a circle wheel and are thus also a form of Continuous track br A version of the above examples name unknown to the writer was commonly used on heavy artillery during World War I Specific examples Cannone da A and the Big Bertha These were panels that were connected to each other by multiple hinges and could be installed over a contemporary wheel br Continuous track A system of linked and hinged chains panels that cover multiple wheels in a way that allows the vehicles mass to be distributed across the space between wheels that are positioned in front of behind other wheels br Tire totes A bag designed to cover a tire to improve traction in deep snow br Truck and bus wheels may block stop rotating under certain circumstances such as brake system failure To help detect this they sometimes feature wheel rotation indicators colored strips of plastic attached to the rim and protruding out from it such that they can be seen by the driver in the side view mirrors These devices were invented and patented in by a Canadian truck shop owner br br br Alternatives br While wheels are very widely used for ground transport there are alternatives some of which are suitable for terrain where wheels are ineffective Alternative methods for ground transport without wheels include br br br Symbolism br br The wheel has also become a strong cultural and spiritual metaphor for a cycle or regular repetition see chakra reincarnation Yin and Yang among others As such and because of the difficult terrain wheeled vehicles were forbidden in old Tibet The wheel in ancient China is seen as a symbol of health and strength and used by some villages as a tool to predict future health and success The diameter of the wheel is indicator of one s future health The Kalachakra or wheel of time is also a subject in some forms of Buddhism along with the dharmachakra br The winged wheel is a symbol of progress seen in many contexts including the coat of arms of Panama the logo of the Ohio State Highway Patrol and the State Railway of Thailand The wheel is also the prominent figure on the flag of India The wheel in this case represents law dharma It also appears in the flag of the Romani people hinting to their nomadic history and their Indian origins br br The introduction of spoked chariot wheels in the Middle Bronze Age appears to have carried somewhat of a prestige The sun cross appears to have a significance in Bronze Age religion replacing the earlier concept of a solar barge with the more modern and technologically advanced solar chariot The wheel was also a solar symbol for the Ancient Egyptians br In modern usage the invention of the wheel can be considered as a symbol of one of the first technologies of early civilization alongside farming and metalwork and thus be used as a benchmark to grade the level of societal progress br Some Neopagans such as Wiccans have adopted the Wheel of the Year into their religious practices br br br See also br Types Alloy wheel Artillery wheel Ball transfer unit Bicycle wheel Caster Cogwheel
