A leeboard is a form of pivoting keel used by a sailboat largely and very often in lieu of a fixed keel Typically mounted in pairs on each side of a hull leeboards function much like a centreboard allowing shallow draft craft to ply waters fixed keel boats cannot br Only the leeward side leeboard is used at any time as it submerges when the boat heels under the force of the wind br A disadvantage where there is an inadequate fixed keel is that they typically ship bear little ballast which being on the far side delays the onset of unballasted craft s heeling that is to put up a good constant resistance against the wind The classical archetypal definition of ballast is a low central weight to optimise centre of mass reduce turning moment and therefore resistance to the boat keeling over however tends to be higher in self righting vessels Modern developments allow them to act as a speed enhancing lifting foil br br br History br br Leeboards existed in China from at least the eighth century on warships that held the ships so that even when wind and wave arise in fury they are neither driven sideways nor overturn Leeboards for stabilizing junks and improving their capability to sail upwind are documented from a book by Li Chuan The innovation was transmitted to Portuguese and Dutch ships around The Portuguese experimented with caulking their vessels in the Chinese manner and the Dutch probably added leeboards to their craft that were copied from Chinese models br Leeboards have been used by relatively large inshore and coastal sailing vessels used for transport since such as Dutch barges Thames barges and American gundalows For these boats leeboards provided the advantages of shallow draught for working close inshore and an unobstructed hold for cargo In particular they allowed gundalows to take the hard to load and unload cargo in unimproved tidal areas as well as readily conduct maintenance on their hulls Leeboards were also easier to build than a large centreboard would have been br br br Today br Leeboards are no longer common in commercially built boats because many people consider them inelegant and awkward They are far more common in home built boats especially the Puddle Duck Racer and stitch and glue type sailboats Leeboards simplify construction of the hull as they are attached to the outside and do not require holes in the hull which can leak Since centreboards are retractable they require a large watertight trunk to hold them in place when retracted and this occupies what otherwise might be useful space in the cabin or cockpit of the boat Use of leeboards while it adds complexity to the process of tacking leaves the floor of the boat unobstructed br According to traditional design principles a boat utilizing a leeboard either needs to have two retractable leeboards one on each side or a method of removing the leeboard and attaching it to either side while under way because nearly all sailboats tack to work their way upwind with the exception of the proa However some small sailboat designers claim to have created seaworthy vessels with only a single fixed leeboard br On a traditional two leeboard or non fixed leeboard design the boards are designed so that the windward board can be retracted to reduce drag Unlike centreboards which are symmetric along the boat s axis leeboards are often asymmetric so that they more efficiently provide lift in one direction Some fast racing scows use bilgeboards which are mounted between the centreline of the hull and the sides so they can use a pair of asymmetric foils for maximum lift and minimum drag br br br See also br Bruce foil br br br br br br External links
