The forecastle FOHK s l contracted as fo c sle or fo c s le is the upper deck of a sailing ship forward of the foremast or historically the forward part of a ship with the sailors living quarters Related to the latter meaning is the phrase before the mast which denotes anything related to ordinary sailors as opposed to a ship s officers br br br History and design br br In medieval shipbuilding a ship of war was usually equipped with a tall multi deck castle like structure in the bow of the ship It served as a platform for archers to shoot down on enemy ships or as a defensive stronghold if the ship were boarded A similar but usually much larger structure called the aftcastle was at the aft end of the ship often stretching all the way from the main mast to the stern br Having such tall upper works on the ship was detrimental to sailing performance As cannons were introduced and gunfire replaced boarding as the primary means of naval combat during the th century the medieval forecastle was no longer needed and later ships such as the galleon had only a low one deck high forecastle Sailors stationed on the forecastle or forecastle men were responsible for handling the headsails and the anchors In the Royal Navy of the th and th centuries these roles were reserved for older seamen who lacked the agility to go aloft or take other more strenuous duties aboard br br By the end of the th century a raised forecastle had become a typical feature on warships again in an attempt to keep forward gun positions from getting unacceptably wet on heavy seas In addition the forecastle may provide additional crew s quarters as in the past and may contain essential machinery such as the anchor windlass A disadvantage of such a design is the structural weakness at the forecastle break the rear end of the forecastle with the main deck behind and below relative to a flush deck structure br Some sailing ships and many modern non sail ships have no forecastle as such at all but the name is still used to indicate the foremost part of the upper deck although often called the foredeck and for any crew s quarters in the bow of the ship even if below the main deck br br br See also br Beakhead br Bridge nautical br Aftercastle br Poop deck br br br br br br Notes br br br External links br Media related to Forecastles at Wikimedia Commons
