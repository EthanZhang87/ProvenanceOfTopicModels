A cathead is a large wooden beam located on either side of the bow of a sailing ship and angled forward at roughly degrees The beam is used to support the ship s anchor when raising it weighing anchor or lowering it letting go and for carrying the anchor on its stock end when suspended outside the ship s side The cathead is furnished with sheaves at the outer end and the inner end which is called the cat s tail fits down on the cat beam The shank painter is a short rope or chain by which the shank of an anchor is held fast to a ship s side when not in use The process of securing the anchor is called catting and fishing it The cat stopper also fastens the anchor on The purpose of the cathead is to provide both a heavy enough beam to support the massive weight of the anchor and to hold the metal anchor away from the wooden side of the ship to prevent damage when the anchor is being raised from the water The stockless anchor made the cathead obsolete br In common practice the projecting end of the beam was carved to resemble the face of a lion or cat Whether such carving was due to a play on the already existing name of the beam or whether the beam was so named because of the practice of such carving is unknown br The origin of the term cathead is obscure but dates at least to the th century as it was used by Mainwaring and Boteler in their dictionaries The Mainwaring dictionary was written in br Nautical author Robert Charles Leslie writes The term catheads used for the two stout projecting timbers on either bow from which the anchor hung clear of the ship before letting go was no doubt connected with the fact of a lion or large cat usually carved upon the end of the item br br br Additional nautical use of the term br A second cat head was associated with a ship s anchor cable and windlass This was a square pin thrust into one of the handspike holes of a ship s windlass When at anchor the anchor rope called a cable or catfall was secured to this with a smaller rope tie called a seizing The English term for this pin was Norman In German however it was called a Kattenkopf cat head and in this case it is a reference to the traditional way the top was notched and chamfered off so that in cross section it resembled the ears of a cat br br br
