id: 920844
A deck is a permanent covering over a compartment or a hull of a ship On a boat or ship the primary or upper deck is the horizontal structure that forms the roof of the hull strengthening it and serving as the primary working surface Vessels often have more than one level both within the hull and in the superstructure above the primary deck similar to the floors of a multi storey building that are also referred to as decks as are certain compartments and decks built over specific areas of the superstructure Decks for some purposes have specific names br br br Structure br The main purpose of the upper or primary deck is structural and only secondarily to provide weather tightness and support people and equipment The deck serves as the lid to the complex box girder which can be identified as the hull It resists tension compression and racking forces The deck s scantling is usually the same as the topsides or might be heavier if the deck is expected to carry heavier loads for example a container ship The deck will be reinforced around deck fittings such as the capstan cleats or bollards br br On ships with more than one level deck refers to the level itself The actual floor surface is called the sole the term deck refers to a structural member tying the ships frames or ribs together over the keel In modern ships the interior decks are usually numbered from the primary deck which is downward and upward So the first deck below the primary deck will be and the first above the primary deck will be A or S for above or superstructure Some merchant ships may alternatively designate decks below the primary deck usually machinery spaces by numbers and those above it in the accommodation block by letters Ships may also call decks by common names or especially on cruise ships may invent fanciful and romantic names for a specific deck or area of that specific ship such as the lido deck of the Princess Cruises Love Boat br Equipment mounted on deck such as the ship s wheel binnacle fife rails and so forth may be collectively referred to as deck furniture Weather decks in Western designs evolved from having structures fore forward or front and aft rear of the ship mostly clear in the th century pilothouses wheelhouses and deckhouses began to appear eventually developing into the superstructure of modern ships Eastern designs developed earlier with efficient middle decks and minimalist fore and aft cabin structures across a range of designs br br br Common names for decks br br In vessels having more than one deck there are various naming conventions numerically alphabetically etc However there are also various common historical names and types of decks br br level is the term used in naval services to refer to the deck above the main deck The next higher decks are referred to as the level the level and so on Although these are formally called decks they are usually referred to as levels because they are usually incomplete decks that do not extend all the way from the stem to the stern or across the ship br Afterdeck an open deck area toward the stern aft br Berth deck naval A deck next below the gun deck where the hammocks of the crew are slung br Boat deck Especially on ships with sponsons the deck area where lifeboats or the ship s gig are stored br Boiler deck river steamers The passenger deck above the vessel s boilers br Bridge deck a The deck area including the helm and navigation station and where the Officer of the Deck Watch will be found also known as the conn b An athwartships structure at the forward end of the cockpit with a deck often somewhat lower than the primary deck to prevent a pooping wave a wave which comes over the stern and onto the deck from entering through the companionway May also refer to the deck of a bridge br Flight deck naval A deck from which aircraft take off or land br Flush deck Any continuous unbroken deck from stem to stern br Forecastle deck A partial deck above the main deck under which the sailors have their berths extending from the foremast to the bow br Freeboard deck assigned by a classification society to determine the ship s freeboard usually the highest continuous deck i e equivalent to the main deck br Gun deck naval on a multi decked vessel a deck below the upper deck where the ships cannon were carried The term originally referred to deck for which the primary function was the mounting of cannon to be fired in broadsides However on many smaller and unrated vessels the upper deck forecastle and quarterdeck bore all of the cannons but were not referred to as the gun deck br Hangar deck naval A deck aboard an aircraft carrier used to store and maintain aircraft br Half deck That portion of the deck next below the forecastle or quarterdeck which is between the mainmast and the cabin br Helicopter deck heli or helo deck Usually located near the stern and always kept clear of obstacles hazardous to a helicopter landing br Hurricane deck river steamers etc the upper deck usually a light deck erected above the frame of the hull deriving its name from the wind that always seemed to blow on the deck br Lido deck Open area typically at or near the stern of a passenger ship housing the main outdoor swimming pool and sunbathing area br Lower deck a the deck immediately over the hold originally only of a ship with two decks b synonym for berth deck c alternative name for a secondary gun deck br Main deck The principal deck of a vessel in some ships the highest deck of the hull usually but not always the weather deck in sailing warships often a deck under the upper deck br Middle or waist deck The upper deck amidships the working area of the deck br Orlop deck The deck or part of a deck where the cables are stowed usually below the waterline It is the lowest deck in a ship br Poop deck The deck forming the roof of a poop or poop cabin built on the upper deck and extending from the mizzenmast aft br Promenade deck A wrap around porch found on passenger ships and riverboats encircling the superstructure This can have open railings or be enclosed in glass or a combination Often the entire level where this is located is referred to as the promenade deck br Quarterdeck a The part of the upper deck abaft the mainmast including the poop deck when there is one Usually reserved for ship s officers guests and passengers b naval The shipboard area connected by a gangplank to a dock or another ship where personnel arrive and depart a naval vessel in port It is where the Officer of the Deck and his assistants are stationed official visitors received and personnel arrival departure ceremonies conducted In the event of multiple gangplanks only one will lead to the official Quarterdeck the others will be manned by Junior OODs or a Petty Officer of the Watch The Quarterdeck also functions as an administrative point in port where the ship s log is maintained announcements are made via an electronic public address system called the MC on American navy and coast guard ships and the Tannoy on others the ship s bell rung etc c naval Some ships have a space named quarterdeck usually amidships that normally but situationally may not be used for that purpose br Shelter deck A lightly constructed deck over the main deck of a ship covering a space open to the weather offering some protection from the weather but not completely enclosed br Side deck The upper deck outboard of any structures such as a coachroof or doghouse also called a breezeway br Spar deck In larger vessels during the age of sail spare spars could be roped together to provide a temporary surface known as a spar deck These served as jury rigged repairs for permanent decks or as an additional platform under which to shelter goods or crew The term was also informally applied to areas of the forecastle or quarterdeck where spare spars were stored by laying them flat against the existing decking In the modern era the term has been used to describe the uppermost deck on flush decked vessels On Great Lakes bulk freighters this is the term used for the deck over the cargo holds br Steerage The lower deck of a ship where the cargo is stored above the closed hold In the late th and early th century steamship steerage decks were used to provide the lowest cost and lowest class of travel br Sundeck A deck onboard passenger watercraft used for suntanning br Sweep deck naval The aftmost deck on a minesweeper set close to the waterline for ease in launch and recovery of equipment br Topgallant forecastle deck Any raised deck occurring above the forecastle deck see above br Tween deck the storage space between the hold and the main deck often retractable br Upper deck The highest deck of the hull extending from stem to stern br Vehicle deck naval aboard amphibious assault ships the deck or decks used to carry vehicles aboard civilian ferries and other commercial vessels a deck used for a similar purpose br Weather deck a Any deck exposed to the outside b The windward side decks br Well deck a An exposed deck weather deck lower than decks fore and aft In particular it is one enclosed by bulwarks limiting flow of water and thus drainage b modern naval A hangar like deck located at the waterline in the stern of some amphibious assault ships also known as a well dock By taking on water the ship can lower the stern flooding the well deck and allowing boats and landing craft to dock within the ship br br br Construction br br br Methods in wood br A traditional wood deck would consist of planks laid fore and aft over beams and along carlins the seams of which are caulked and paid with tar A yacht or other fancy boat might then have the deck canvased with the fabric laid down in a thick layer of paint or sealant and additional coats painted over The wash or apron boards form the joint between the deck planking and that of the topsides and are caulked similarly br Modern constructed decks are used primarily on fiberglass composite and cold molded hulls The under structure of beams and carlins is the same as above The decking itself is usually multiple layers of marine grade plywood covered over with layers of fibreglass in a plastic resin such as epoxy or polyester overlapped onto the topsides of the hull br br br Methods in metal br Generally speaking the method outlined for constructed decks is most similar to metal decks The deck plating is laid over metal beams and carlins and tacked temporarily in place The difficulty in metal construction is avoiding distortion of the plate while welding due to the high heat involved in the process Welds are usually double pass meaning each seam is welded twice a time consuming process which may take longer than building the wood deck However welds result in a waterproof deck which is strong and easily repairable The deck structure is welded to the hull making it structurally a single unit br Because a metal deck painted to reduce corrosion can pick up heat from the sun and be quite slippery and noisy to work on a layer of wood decking or thick non skid paint is often applied to its surface br br br Methods in fiberglass br The process for building a deck in fiberglass is the same as for building a hull a female mould is built a layer of gel coat is sprayed in then layers of fiberglass in resin are built up to the required deck thickness if the deck has a core the outer skin layers of fiberglass and resin are laid then the core material and finally the inner skin layers The deck is removed from the mould and usually mechanically fastened to the hull br Fiberglass decks are quite slick with their mirror smooth surfaces so a non skid texture is often moulded into their surface or non skid pads glued down in working areas br br br Rules of thumb to determine the deck scantlings br The thickness of the decking affects how strong the hull is and is directly related to how thick the skin of the hull itself is which is of course related to how large the vessel is the kind of work it is expected to do and the kind of weather it may reasonably be expected to endure While a naval engineer or architect may have precise methods of determining what the scantlings should be traditional builders used previous experiences and simpler rules of thumb to determine how thick the deck should be built br The numbers derived by these formulae gives a rough number for determining the average thickness of materials based on some crude hull measurements Below the waterline the thickness should be approximately of the result while upper topsides and decks might be reduced to of the result br br In wood For plank thickness in inches LOA
