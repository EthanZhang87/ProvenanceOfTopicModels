The mast of a sailing vessel is a tall spar or arrangement of spars erected more or less vertically on the centre line of a ship or boat Its purposes include carrying sails spars and derricks giving necessary height to a navigation light look out position signal yard control position radio aerial or signal lamp Large ships have several masts with the size and configuration depending on the style of ship Nearly all sailing masts are guyed br Until the mid th century all vessels masts were made of wood formed from a single or several pieces of timber which typically consisted of the trunk of a conifer tree From the th century vessels were often built of a size requiring masts taller and thicker than from single tree trunks On these larger vessels to achieve the required height the masts were built from up to four sections also called masts From lowest to highest these were called lower top topgallant and royal masts Giving the lower sections sufficient thickness necessitated building them up from separate pieces of wood Such a section was known as a made mast as opposed to sections formed from single pieces of timber which were known as pole masts br Those who specialised in making masts were known as mastmakers br br br Nomenclature br For square sail carrying ships masts in their standard names in bow to stern front to back order are br br Sprit topmast a small mast set on the end of the bowsprit discontinued after the early th century not usually counted as a mast however when identifying a ship as two masted or three masted br Fore mast the mast nearest the bow or the mast forward of the main mast As it is the furthest afore it may be rigged to the bowsprit br Sections fore mast lower fore topmast fore topgallant mast br Main mast the tallest mast usually located near the center of the ship br Sections main mast lower main topmast main topgallant mast royal mast if fitted br Mizzen mast the aft most mast Typically shorter than the fore mast br Sections mizzen mast lower mizzen topmast mizzen topgallant mast br Some names given to masts in ships carrying other types of rig where the naming is less standardised are br br Bonaventure mizzen the fourth mast on larger sixteenth century galleons typically lateen rigged and shorter than the main mizzen br Jigger mast typically where it is the shortest the aftmost mast on vessels with more than three masts br Sections jigger mast lower jigger topmast jigger topgallant mast br br When a vessel has two masts as a general rule the main mast is the one setting the largest sail Therefore in a brig the forward mast is the foremast and the after mast is the mainmast In a schooner with two masts even if the masts are of the same height the after one usually carries a larger sail because a longer boom can be used so the after mast is the mainmast This contrasts with a ketch or a yawl where the after mast and its principal sail is clearly the smaller of the two so the terminology is from forward mainmast and mizzen In a yawl the term jigger is occasionally used for the after mast br Some two masted luggers have a fore mast and a mizzen mast there is no main mast This is because these traditional types used to have three masts but it was found convenient to dispense with the main mast and carry larger sails on the remaining masts This gave more working room particularly on fishing vessels br On square rigged vessels each mast carries several horizontal yards from which the individual sails are rigged br Folding mast ships use a tabernacle anchor point Definitions include the partly open socket or double post on the deck into which a mast is fixed with a pivot near the top so that the mast can be lowered large bracket attached firmly to the deck to which the foot of the mast is fixed it has two sides or cheeks and a bolt forming the pivot around which the mast is raised and lowered substantial fitting for mounting the mast on deck so that it can be lowered easily for trailering or for sailing under bridges hinged device allowing for the easy folding of a mast degrees from perpendicular as for transporting the boat on a trailer or passing under a bridge br br br History br br In the West the concept of a ship carrying more than one mast to give it more speed under sail and to improve its sailing qualities evolved in northern Mediterranean waters The earliest foremast has been identified on an Etruscan pyxis from Caere Italy dating to the mid th century BC a warship with a furled mainsail is engaging an enemy vessel deploying a foresail A two masted merchant vessel with a sizable foresail rigged on a slightly inclined foremast is depicted in an Etruscan tomb painting from to BC An artemon Greek for foresail almost the same size as the galley s mainsail can be found on a Corinthian krater as early as the late th century BC apart from that Greek longships are uniformly shown without it until the th century BC In the East ancient Indian Kingdoms like the Kalinga from as early as nd century are believed to have commanded naval sail ships One of the earliest documented evidence of Indian sail building comes from the mural of the three masted ship in Ajanta caves that date back to CE br The foremast became fairly common on Roman galleys where inclined at an angle of it was more akin to a bowsprit and the foresail set on it reduced in size seems to be used rather as an aid to steering than for propulsion While most of the ancient evidence is iconographic the existence of foremasts can also be deduced archaeologically from slots in foremast feets located too close to the prow for a mainsail br br Artemon along with mainsail and topsail developed into the standard rig of seagoing vessels in imperial times complemented by a mizzen on the largest freighters The earliest recorded three masters were the giant Syracusia a prestige object commissioned by king Hiero II of Syracuse and devised by the polymath Archimedes around BC and other Syracusan merchant ships of the time The imperial grain freighters travelling the routes between Alexandria and Rome also included three masted vessels A mosaic in Ostia c AD depicts a freighter with a three masted rig entering Rome s harbour Special craft could carry many more masts Theophrastus Hist Plant records how the Romans imported Corsican timber by way of a huge raft propelled by as many as fifty masts and sails br br Throughout antiquity both foresail and mizzen remained secondary in terms of canvas size although large enough to require full running rigging In late antiquity the foremast lost most of its tilt standing nearly upright on some ships br By the onset of the Early Middle Ages rigging had undergone a fundamental transformation in Mediterranean navigation the lateen which had long evolved on smaller Greco Roman craft replaced the square rig the chief sail type of the ancients that practically disappeared from the record until the th century while it remained dominant in northern Europe The dromon the lateen rigged and oared bireme of the Byzantine navy almost certainly had two masts a larger foremast and one midships Their length has been estimated at m and m respectively somewhat smaller than the Sicilian war galleys of the time br Multiple masted sailing ships were reintroduced into the Mediterranean Sea by the Late Middle Ages Large vessels were coming more and more into use and the need for additional masts to control these ships adequately grew with the increase in tonnage Unlike in antiquity the mizzen mast was adopted on medieval two masters earlier than the foremast a process which can be traced back by pictorial evidence from Venice and Barcelona to the mid th century To balance out the sail plan the next obvious step was to add a mast fore of the main mast which first appears in a Catalan ink drawing from With the three masted ship established propelled by square rig and lateen and guided by the pintle and gudgeon rudder all advanced ship design technology necessary for the great transoceanic voyages was in place by the beginning of the th century br br br Hollow masts br The first hollow mast was fitted on the American sloop Maria in m ft long and built of staves bound with iron hoops like a barrel Other hollow masts were made from two tapered timbers hollowed and glued together Nearly a century later the simple box form of mast was arrived at br br br Modern masts br br Although sailing ships were superseded by engine powered ships in the th century recreational sailing ships and yachts continue to be designed and constructed br In the s aluminum masts were introduced on large J class yachts An aluminum mast has considerable advantages over a wooden one it is lighter and slimmer than a wooden one of the same strength is impervious to rot and can be produced as a single extruded length During the s wood was eclipsed by aluminum Aluminum alloys generally series are commonly utilised br Recently some sailing yachts particularly home built yachts have begun to use steel masts Whilst somewhat heavier than aluminum steel has its own set of advantages It is significantly cheaper and a steel mast of an equivalent strength can be smaller in diameter than an aluminum mast allowing less turbulence and a better airflow onto the sail br br From the mid s racing yachts introduced the use of carbon fibre and other composite materials to construct masts with even better strength to weight ratios Carbon fibre masts could also be constructed with more precisely engineered aerodynamic profiles br Modern masts form the leading edge of a sail s airfoil and tend to have a teardrop shaped cross section On smaller racing yachts and catamarans the mast rotates to the optimum angle for the sail s airfoil If the mast has a long thin cross section and makes up a significant area of the airfoil it is called a wing mast boats using these have a smaller sail area to compensate for the larger mast area There are many manufacturers of modern masts for sailing yachts of all sizes a few notable companies are Hall Spars Offshore Spars and Southern Spars br After the end of the age of sail warships retained masts initially as observation posts and to observe fall of shot also holding fire control equipment such as rangefinders and later as a mounting point for radar and telecommunication antennas which need to be mounted high up to increase range Simple pole lattice and tripod masts have been used also on some past Japanese warships complex pagoda
