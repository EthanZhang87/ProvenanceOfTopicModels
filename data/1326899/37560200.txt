A whipstaff is a steering device that was used on European sailing ships from the th to the th century Its development preceded the invention of the more complex ship s wheel and followed the simple use of a tiller to control the steering of a ship underway br In a typical arrangement an iron gooseneck was fitted at the fore end of the tiller Then a metal ring was fitted over this and secured with a pin The ring was attached to a long thin pole the whipstaff proper and this pole connected the tiller to the helmsman one or more decks above it through a pivot point roll or rowle described as that round piece of wood or iron wherein the whip doth go and is made turn about that it may carry over the whip from side to side with more ease p The helmsman himself still usually did not stand on the topmost deck but rather viewed what lay ahead of the ship through a small port or hatchway in the deck above him called a companion To move the ship to port the forward facing helmsman pulled the top of the staff to his left and pushed the pole down and to the right to move it to starboard he pulled the top to his right and pushed the pole down and to the left In this fashion the tiller might get as much as of turn though angles of between and seem more likely The tiller rested on a very strong horizontal wooden bar called the tiller sweep which was sheathed in metal and coated with soap and grease to minimize the drag of the tiller as it rode across it br br This arrangement however meant that the helmsman still had very limited range of control of the tiller s movement no more than to either side p and he had to steer either with extremely limited views of the sails or sometimes dependent entirely upon the conn for direction Emphasis had to be placed on the use of sails to control the ship s course and this was imprecise and depended on the vicissitudes of the wind Where extreme movement of the rudder was necessary the use of relieving tackle had to be implemented br br br
