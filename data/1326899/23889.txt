A pulley is a wheel on an axle or shaft enabling a taut cable or belt passing over the wheel to move and change direction or transfer power between itself and a shaft A sheave or pulley wheel is a pulley using an axle supported by a frame or shell block to guide a cable or exert force br A pulley may have a groove or grooves between flanges around its circumference to locate the cable or belt The drive element of a pulley system can be a rope cable belt or chain br The earliest evidence of pulleys dates back to Ancient Egypt in the Twelfth Dynasty BC and Mesopotamia in the early nd millennium BC In Roman Egypt Hero of Alexandria c AD identified the pulley as one of six simple machines used to lift weights Pulleys are assembled to form a block and tackle in order to provide mechanical advantage to apply large forces Pulleys are also assembled as part of belt and chain drives in order to transmit power from one rotating shaft to another Plutarch s Parallel Lives recounts a scene where Archimedes proved the effectiveness of compound pulleys and the block and tackle system by using one to pull a fully laden ship towards him as if it was gliding through water br br br Block and tackle br br A block is a set of pulleys wheels assembled so that each pulley rotates independently from every other pulley Two blocks with a rope attached to one of the blocks and threaded through the two sets of pulleys form a block and tackle br br A block and tackle is assembled so one block is attached to the fixed mounting point and the other is attached to the moving load The ideal mechanical advantage of the block and tackle is equal to the number of sections of the rope that support the moving block br In the diagram on the right the ideal mechanical advantage of each of the block and tackle assemblies shown is as follows br br Gun tackle br Luff tackle br Double tackle br Gyn tackle br Threefold purchase br br br Rope and pulley systems br br A rope and pulley system that is a block and tackle is characterised by the use of a single continuous rope to transmit a tension force around one or more pulleys to lift or move a load the rope may be a light line or a strong cable This system is included in the list of simple machines identified by Renaissance scientists br If the rope and pulley system does not dissipate or store energy then its mechanical advantage is the number of parts of the rope that act on the load This can be shown as follows br Consider the set of pulleys that form the moving block and the parts of the rope that support this block If there are p of these parts of the rope supporting the load W then a force balance on the moving block shows that the tension in each of the parts of the rope must be W p This means the input force on the rope is T W p Thus the block and tackle reduces the input force by the factor p br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Method of operation br The simplest theory of operation for a pulley system assumes that the pulleys and lines are weightless and that there is no energy loss due to friction It is also assumed that the lines do not stretch br In equilibrium the forces on the moving block must sum to zero In addition the tension in the rope must be the same for each of its parts This means that the two parts of the rope supporting the moving block must each support half the load br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br These are different types of pulley systems br br Fixed A fixed pulley has an axle mounted in bearings attached to a supporting structure A fixed pulley changes the direction of the force on a rope or belt that moves along its circumference Mechanical advantage is gained by combining a fixed pulley with a movable pulley or another fixed pulley of a different diameter br Movable A movable pulley has an axle in a movable block A single movable pulley is supported by two parts of the same rope and has a mechanical advantage of two br Compound A combination of fixed and movable pulleys forms a block and tackle A block and tackle can have several pulleys mounted on the fixed and moving axles further increasing the mechanical advantage br br br br br br br br br br br The mechanical advantage of the gun tackle can be increased by interchanging the fixed and moving blocks so the rope is attached to the moving block and the rope is pulled in the direction of the lifted load In this case the block and tackle is said to be rove to advantage Diagram shows that now three rope parts support the load W which means the tension in the rope is W Thus the mechanical advantage is three br By adding a pulley to the fixed block of a gun tackle the direction of the pulling force is reversed though the mechanical advantage remains the same Diagram a This is an example of the Luff tackle br br br Free body diagrams br The mechanical advantage of a pulley system can be analysed using free body diagrams which balance the tension force in the rope with the force of gravity on the load In an ideal system the massless and frictionless pulleys do not dissipate energy and allow for a change of direction of a rope that does not stretch or wear In this case a force balance on a free body that includes the load W and n supporting sections of a rope with tension T yields br br br br br n br T

belt and pulley system is characterized by two or more pulleys in common to a belt This allows for mechanical power torque and speed to be transmitted across axles If the pulleys are of differing diameters a mechanical advantage is realized br A belt drive is analogous to that of a chain drive however a belt sheave may be smooth devoid of discrete interlocking members as would be found on a chain sprocket spur gear or timing belt so that the mechanical advantage is approximately given by the ratio of the pitch diameter of the sheaves only not fixed exactly by the ratio of teeth as with gears and sprockets br In the case of a drum style pulley without a groove or flanges the pulley often is slightly convex to keep the flat belt centered It is sometimes referred to as a crowned pulley Though once widely used on factory line shafts this type of pulley is still found driving the rotating brush in upright vacuum cleaners in belt sanders and bandsaws Agricultural tractors built up to the early s generally had a belt pulley for a flat belt which is what Belt Pulley magazine was named after It has been replaced by other mechanisms with more flexibility in methods of use such as power take off and hydraulics br Just as the diameters of gears and correspondingly their number of teeth determine a gear ratio and thus the speed increases or reductions and the mechanical advantage that they can deliver the diameters of pulleys determine those same factors Cone pulleys and step pulleys which operate on the same principle although the names tend to be applied to flat belt versions and V belt versions respectively are a way to provide multiple drive ratios in a belt and pulley system that can be shifted as needed just as a transmission provides this function with a gear train that can be shifted V belt step pulleys are the most common way that drill presses deliver a range of spindle speeds br With belts and pulleys friction is one of the most important forces Some uses for belts and pulleys involve peculiar angles leading to bad belt tracking and possibly slipping the belt off the pulley or low belt tension environments causing unnecessary slippage of the belt and hence extra wear to the belt To solve this pulleys are sometimes lagged Lagging is the term used to describe the application of a coating cover or wearing surface with various textured patterns which is sometimes applied to pulley shells Lagging is often applied in order to extend the life of the shell by providing a replaceable wearing surface or to improve the friction between the belt and the pulley Notably drive pulleys are often rubber lagged coated with a rubber friction layer for exactly this reason br br br See also br br br br br br External links
