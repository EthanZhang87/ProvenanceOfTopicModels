Hardwood is wood from angiosperm trees These are usually found in broad leaved temperate and tropical forests In temperate and boreal latitudes they are mostly deciduous but in tropics and subtropics mostly evergreen Hardwood which comes from angiosperm trees contrasts with softwood which is from gymnosperm trees br br br Characteristics br br Hardwoods are produced by angiosperm trees that reproduce by flowers and have broad leaves Many species are deciduous Those of temperate regions lose their leaves every autumn as temperatures fall and are dormant in the winter but those of tropical regions may shed their leaves in response to seasonal or sporadic periods of drought Hardwood from deciduous species such as oak normally shows annual growth rings but these may be absent in some tropical hardwoods br Hardwoods have a more complex structure than softwoods and are often much slower growing as a result The dominant feature separating hardwoods from softwoods is the presence of pores or vessels The vessels may show considerable variation in size shape of perforation plates simple scalariform reticulate foraminate and structure of cell wall such as spiral thickenings br As the name suggests the wood from these trees is generally harder than that of softwoods but there are significant exceptions In both groups there is an enormous variation in actual wood hardness with the range in density in hardwoods completely including that of softwoods some hardwoods e g balsa are softer than most softwoods while yew is an example of a hard softwood br br br Chemistry br The structural polymers of hardwoods are cellulose hemicellulose and lignin The constituents of hardwood lignin differs from those included in softwood Sinapyl alcohol and coniferyl alcohol are the main monomers of hardwood lignin br Hardwoods contain less amount of non structural constituents named extractives than softwoods These extractives are usually categorized into three broad groups aliphatic compounds terpenes and phenolic compounds Aliphatic compounds found in hardwoods include fatty acids fatty alcohols and their esters with glycerol fatty alcohols waxes and sterols steryl esters hydrocarbons such as alkanes sterols such as sitosterol sitostanol and campesterol The terpene content of the hardwood significantly differs from the softwood and mainly consists of triterpenoids polyprenols and other higher terpenes Triterpenoids commonly purified from hardwoods include cycloartenol betulin and squalene Hardwood polyterpenes are rubber gutta percha gutta balat and betulaprenols Although in small quantities hardwoods also contain mono sesqui and diterpenes such as and pinenes carene myrcene limonene hinokitiol cadinene and cadinols borneol Hardwood is rich in phenolic compounds such as stilbenes lignans norlignans tannins flavonoids br br br Applications br Hardwoods are employed in a large range of applications including fuel tools construction boat building furniture making musical instruments flooring cooking barrels and manufacture of charcoal Solid hardwood joinery tends to be expensive compared to softwood In the past tropical hardwoods were easily available but the supply of some species such as Burma teak and mahogany is now becoming scarce due to over exploitation Cheaper hardwood doors for instance now consist of a thin veneer bonded to a core of softwood plywood or medium density fibreboard MDF Hardwoods may be used in a variety of objects but are most frequently seen in furniture or musical instruments because of their density which adds to durability appearance and performance Different species of hardwood lend themselves to different end uses or construction processes This is due to the variety of characteristics apparent in different timbers including density grain pore size growth and fibre pattern flexibility and ability to be steam bent For example the interlocked grain of elm wood Ulmus spp makes it suitable for the making of chair seats where the driving in of legs and other components can cause splitting in other woods br br br Cooking br There is a correlation between density and calories volume This makes the denser hardwoods like oak cherry and apple more suited for camp fires cooking fires and smoking meat as they tend to burn hotter and longer than softwoods like pine or cedar whose low density construction and highly flammable pitch make them burn quickly and without producing quite as much heat br br br See also br List of woods br Hardwood flooring br Softwood br Janka hardness test br
