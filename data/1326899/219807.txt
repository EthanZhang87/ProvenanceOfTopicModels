The keel is the bottom most longitudinal structural element on a watercraft On some sailboats it may have a hydrodynamic and counterbalancing purpose as well The laying of the keel is often the initial step in the construction of a ship In the British and American shipbuilding traditions this event marks the beginning date of a ship s construction br br br Etymology br The word keel comes from Old English c ol Old Norse kj ll ship or keel It has the distinction of being regarded by some scholars as the first word in the English language recorded in writing having been recorded by Gildas in his th century Latin work De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae under the spelling cyulae he was referring to the three ships that the Saxons first arrived in br Carina is the Latin word for keel and is the origin of the term careen to clean a keel and the hull in general often by rolling the ship on its side An example of this use is Careening Cove a suburb of Sydney Australia where careening was carried out in early colonial days br br br History br br br Origins br br The use of a keel in sailing vessels goes back to antiquity br The wreck of an ancient Greek merchant ship known as the Kyrenia ship establishes the origin of the keel at least as far back as BC br The Uluburun shipwreck c BC had a rudimentary keel but it may have been more of a center plank than a keel br br br Construction styles br br br Frame first br In carvel built hulls construction began with the laying of the keel followed by the stern and stem Frames were set up afterward set at key points along the keel Later the keelson was attached to the keel either bolted or with treenails br br br Plank first br br br Structural keels br A structural keel is the bottom most structural member around which the hull of a ship is built The keel runs along the centerline of the ship from the bow to the stern The keel is often the first part of a ship s hull to be constructed and laying the keel or placing the keel in the cradle in which the ship will be built may mark the start time of its construction Large modern ships are now often built in a series of pre fabricated complete hull sections rather than being built around a single keel so the shipbuilding process commences with the cutting of the first sheet of steel br The most common type of keel is the flat plate keel and this is fitted in the majority of ocean going ships and other vessels A form of keel found on smaller vessels is the bar keel which may be fitted in trawlers tugs and smaller ferries Where grounding is possible this type of keel is suitable with its massive scantlings but there is always a problem of the increased draft with no additional cargo capacity If a double bottom is fitted the keel is almost inevitably of the flat plate type bar keels often being associated with open floors where the plate keel may also be fitted br br br Hydrodynamic keels br Hydrodynamic keels have the primary purpose of interacting with the water and are typical of certain sailboats Fixed hydrodynamic keels have the structural strength to support the weight of the boat br br br Sailboat keels br In sailboats keels serve two purposes as an underwater foil to minimize the lateral motion of the vessel under sail leeway and as a counterweight to the lateral force of the wind on the sail s that causes rolling to the side heeling As an underwater foil a keel uses the forward motion of the boat to generate lift to counteract the leeward force of the wind Related foils include centerboards and daggerboards which do not have the secondary purpose of being a counterweight As counterweight a keel increasingly offsets the heeling moment with increasing angle of heel br Moveable sailboat keels may pivot a swing keel retract upwards retracting keel or swing sideways in the water canting keels to move the ballasting effect to one side and allow the boat to sail in a more upright position br br br See also br Coin ceremony br Kelson br False keel br Daggerboard br Leeboard br Bilgeboard br Bruce foil br Keelhauling an archaic maritime punishment br Keel block br br br Notes br br br Bibliography br br Rousmaniere John The Annapolis Book of Seamanship Simon Schuster br Chapman Book of Piloting various contributors Hearst Corporation br Herreshoff Halsey consulting editor The Sailor s Handbook Little Brown and Company br Seidman David The Complete Sailor International Marine br Jobson Gary Sailing Fundamentals Simon Schuster
