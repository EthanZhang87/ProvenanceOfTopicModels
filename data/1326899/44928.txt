Mahogany is a straight grained reddish brown timber of three tropical hardwood species of the genus Swietenia indigenous to the Americas and part of the pantropical chinaberry family Meliaceae Mahogany is used commercially for a wide variety of goods due to its coloring and durable nature It is naturally found within the Americas but has also been imported to plantations across Asia and Oceania The mahogany trade may have begun as early as the th century and flourished in the th and th centuries In certain countries mahogany is considered an invasive species br Mahogany is wood from any of three tree species Honduran or big leaf mahogany Swietenia macrophylla West Indian or Cuban mahogany Swietenia mahagoni and Swietenia humilis Honduran mahogany is the most widespread and the only genuine mahogany species commercially grown today Mahogany is a valuable lumber used for paneling furniture boats musical instruments and other items The United States is the leading importer of mahogany while Peru is the largest exporter Mahogany is the national tree of the Dominican Republic and Belize br Swietenia species have been introduced in various countries outside the Americas since the s with many plantings becoming naturalized forests All species of Swietenia are now listed by CITES and protected due to concerns over illegal logging and mismanagement Mahogany species can crossbreed when they grow in proximity and the hybrid between S mahagoni and S macrophylla is widely planted for timber br The history of the American mahogany trade dates back to the th century when the wood was first noticed by Europeans during the Spanish colonization of the Americas Mahogany became more popular in the th century when the British Parliament removed import duties on timber from British possessions leading to increased exports to Europe and North America Throughout the th and th centuries mahogany from various regions was imported into Europe and North America with Britain being the largest consumer br By the late th century African mahogany began to dominate the market and by the early th century the supply of American mahogany became scarcer In response to concerns about the sustainability of mahogany several species have been placed on CITES Appendices to regulate the trade br Mahogany is known for its straight fine grain and durability making it a popular choice for fine furniture boat construction and musical instruments However the over harvesting of mahogany and environmental concerns have led to a decrease in its use br br br Etymology br The etymology of mahogany is uncertain and a subject of debate The term first appeared in John Ogilby s America referring to a curious and rich wood from Jamaica Initial mentions of the mahogany tree as opposed to wood date to with its first detailed description in attributed to Swietenia mahagoni by Kemp Malone in Malone suggested that mahogany originated as a generic term for wood in a native Bahamian language F Bruce Lamb disagreed pointing out that the Arawak language s word for wood is caoba Lamb identified a West African origin for the word in the Yoruba oganwo collectively m oganwo meaning one which is the tallest or most high used for the Khaya genus of trees whose timber is today called African mahogany Lamb proposes that Yoruba and Igbo people brought to Jamaica as slaves identified the local trees of the Swietenia genus as m oganwo which developed into the Portuguese term mogano which first appeared in print as the name of a river in before finally developing into the English mahogany in Jamaica between and br Malone criticized this etymology arguing that the proposed metamorphosis from the Yoruba m oganwo to the Portuguese mogano to the English mahogany was a logical and linguistic stretch relying on the conversion of the singular oganwo to the collective m oganwo which Malone finds unlikely considering the tree s generally solitary nature He also argues that Lamb s earliest identified use of the Portuguese mog a no which is for a river that Lamb asserts must have been so named for the mahogany oganwo trees on its banks could just as well have been named for any tall tree since oganwo only means tall Lamb in turn criticized Malone s methodology and perceived bias and maintained that there is no evidence for mahogany as a generic word br br br Description br The three species are br br Honduran or big leaf mahogany Swietenia macrophylla with a range from Mexico to southern Amazonia in Brazil the most widespread species of mahogany and the only genuine mahogany species commercially grown today Illegal logging of S macrophylla and its highly destructive environmental effects led to the species placement in on Appendix II of Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species CITES the first time that a high volume high value tree was listed on Appendix II br West Indian or Cuban mahogany Swietenia mahagoni native to southern Florida and the Caribbean formerly dominant in the mahogany trade but not in widespread commercial use since World War II br Swietenia humilis a small and often twisted mahogany tree limited to seasonally dry forests in Pacific Central America that is of limited commercial utility Some botanists believe that S humilis is a mere variant of S macrophylla br While only the three Swietenia species are classified officially as genuine mahogany other Meliaceae species with timber uses are classified as true mahogany Some may or may not have the word mahogany in their trade or common name Some of these true mahoganies include the African genera Khaya African mahogany and Entandrophragma sapele mahogany New Zealand mahogany or kohekohe Dysoxylum spectabile Chinese mahogany Toona sinensis Indonesian mahogany Toona sureni Indian mahogany Toona ciliata Chinaberry Melia azedarach Pink Mahogany or Bosse Guarea Chittagong also known as Indian Mahogany Chukrasia velutina and Crabwood Carapa guianensis Some members of the genus Shorea Meranti Balau or Lauan of the family Dipterocarpaceae are also sometimes sold as Philippine mahogany although the name is more properly applied to another species of Toona Toona calantas br br Mahogany is a commercially important lumber prized for its beauty durability and color and used for paneling and to make furniture boats musical instruments and other items The leading importer of mahogany is the United States followed by Britain while the largest exporter today is Peru which surpassed Brazil after that country banned mahogany exports in It is estimated that some or percent of Peruvian mahogany exported to the United States is illegally harvested with the economic cost of illegal logging in Peru placed conservatively at million USD annually It was estimated that in some mahogany trees were harvested to supply the U S furniture trade alone br Mahogany is the national tree of the Dominican Republic and Belize A mahogany tree with two woodcutters bearing an axe and a paddle also appears on the Belizean national coat of arms under the national motto Sub umbra floreo Latin for under the shade I flourish br The specific density of mahogany is Mahogany African kg m Mahogany Cuban kg m Mahogany Honduras kg m Mahogany Spanish kg m br br br Overview br br br Distribution br The natural distribution of these species within the Americas is geographically distinct S mahagoni grows on the West Indian islands as far north as the Bahamas the Florida Keys and parts of Florida S humilis grows in the dry regions of the Pacific coast of Central America from south western Mexico to Costa Rica S macrophylla grows in Central America from Yucatan southwards and into South America extending as far as Peru Bolivia and extreme western Brazil In the th century various botanists attempted to further define S macrophylla in South America as a new species such as S candollei Pittier and S tessmannii Harms but many authorities consider these spurious According to Record and Hess all of the mahogany of continental North and South America can be considered as one botanical species Swietenia macrophylla King br Both major species of Swietenia were introduced in several countries outside of the Americas during the s and early s using seeds from South America and the Caribbean Many of these plantings became naturalized forests over time br India had both S macrophylla and S mahagoni introduced in using seeds from West Indies Both eventually became naturalized forests Bangladesh had Honduran S macrophylla introduced in and as with India it became naturalized in some areas S mahagoni and S macrophylla were introduced in Indonesia in using seeds from India S macrophylla was included in plantation forests planted in Indonesia from the s to the s Philippines had S macrophylla introduced in and in as well as S mahagoni in and Planting resumed in the late s It was planted with many other exotic tree species for the purpose of reforestation S macrophylla was planted in Sri Lanka in but it was left unmanaged until the s when reforestation efforts initiated by the Sri Lankan government led to plantations being consciously developed In the early s S mahagoni was planted on the islands of O ahu and Maui in Hawaii but was neglected and became naturalized forests Additionally S macrophylla was planted in on O ahu and is now naturalized Fiji had S macrophylla introduced originally in as an ornamental species using seeds from Honduras and Belize Fiji has become a major producer of mahogany in the st Century due to a robust plantation program spanning over years Harvesting began in br br br History br The name mahogany was initially associated only with those islands in the West Indies under British control French colonists used the term acajou while in the Spanish territories it was called caoba The origin of the name is uncertain but it could be a corruption of m oganwo the name used by the Yoruba and Ibo people of West Africa to describe trees of the genus Khaya which is closely related to Swietenia When transported to Jamaica as slaves they gave the same name to the similar trees they saw there Though this interpretation has been disputed no one has suggested a more plausible origin The indigenous Arawak name for the tree is not known In the word mahogany appeared in print for the first time in John Ogilby s America Among botanists and naturalists however the tree was considered a type of cedar and in was classified by Carl Linnaeus as Cedrela mahagoni The following year it was assigned to a new genus by Nicholas Joseph Jacquin and named Swietenia mahagoni br Until the th century all of the mahogany was regarded as one species although varying in quality and character according to soil and climate In the German botanist Joseph Gerhard Zuccarini identified a second species while working on specimens collected on the Pacific coast of Mexico and named it Swietenia humilis In a third species Swietenia macrophylla was named by Sir George King after studying specimens of Honduras mahogany planted in the Botanic Gardens in Calcutta India br Today all species of Swietenia grown in their native locations are listed by CITES and are therefore protected After S mahogani and S macrophylla were added to CITES appendixes in and respectively international conservation programs began in earnest aided by a World Bank report entitled Tropical Hardwood Marketing Strategies for Southeast Asia Efforts to repopulate mahogany largely failed in its native locations due to attacks from the shoot borer Hypsipyla grandella and similarly failed in Africa due to the attacks by the equivalent Hypsipyla robusta After so many years of mismanagement and illegal logging Swietenia also suffered from genetic loss thus mutating and weakening the seeds Additionally erosion in its native locations meant seeds could no longer even be planted However both species grew well in Asia and Asia Pacific due to the absence of these shoot borers and absence of other limitations Plantation management progressed throughout the s and s in Asia and the South Pacific Global supply of genuine mahogany has been increasing from these plantations notably Fiji and Philippines For Swietenia macrophylla the trees in these plantations are still relatively young compared to the trees being harvested from old growth forests in South America Thus the illegal trade of bigleaf mahogany continues apace br br br Species br Species of Swietenia cross breed readily when they grow in proximity the hybrid between S mahagoni and S macrophylla is widely planted for its timber br In addition the U S timber trade also markets various other Federal Trade Commission defined species as mahoganies under a variety of different commercial names most notably Philippine mahogany which is actually from the genus Shorea a dipterocarp This wood is also called Lauan or Meranti br br br History of American mahogany trade br br In the th century the buccaneer Alexandre Exquemelin recorded the use of mahogany or Caoba Cedrela being the Spanish name on Hispaniola for making canoes The Indians make these canoes without the use of any iron instruments by only burning the trees at the bottom near the root and afterwards governing the fire with such industry that nothing is burnt more than what they would have br The wood first came to the notice of Europeans with the beginning of Spanish colonisation in the Americas A cross in the Cathedral at Santo Domingo bearing the date is said to be mahogany and Philip II of Spain apparently used the wood for the interior joinery of the palace El Escorial begun in However caoba as the Taino Natives called the wood was principally reserved for shipbuilding and it was declared a royal monopoly at Havana in Hence very little of the mahogany growing in Spanish controlled territory found its way to Europe br After the French established a colony in Saint Domingue now Haiti some mahogany from that island probably found its way to France where joiners in the port cities of Saint Malo Nantes La Rochelle and Bordeaux used the wood to a limited extent from about On the English controlled islands especially Jamaica and the Bahamas mahogany was abundant but not exported in any quantity before br br br th century br While the trade in mahogany from the Spanish and French territories in America remained moribund for most of the th century this was not true for those islands under British control In the British Parliament removed all import duties from timber imported into Britain from British possessions in the Americas This immediately stimulated the trade in West Indian timbers including most importantly mahogany Importations of mahogany into England and excluding those to Scotland which were recorded separately reached tons per annum by tons by and more than tons in the peak year of the th century trade br At the same time the Act had the effect of substantially increasing exports of mahogany from the West Indies to the British colonies in North America Although initially regarded as a joinery wood mahogany rapidly became the timber of choice for makers of high quality furniture in both the British Isles and the colonies of North America br br Until the s over per cent of the mahogany imported into Britain came from Jamaica Some of this was re exported to continental Europe but most was used by British furniture makers Quantities of Jamaican mahogany also went to the North American colonies but most of the wood used in American furniture came from the Bahamas This was sometimes called Providence wood after the main port of the islands but more often madera or maderah which was the Bahamian name for mahogany br In addition to Jamaica and Bahamas all the British controlled islands exported some mahogany at various times but the quantities were not large The most significant third source was Black River and adjacent areas on the Mosquito Coast now Republic of Honduras from where quantities of mahogany were shipped from the s onwards This mahogany was known as Rattan mahogany after the island of Ruatan which was the main offshore entrepot for the British settlers in the area br At the end of the Seven Years War the mahogany trade began to change significantly During the occupation of Havana by British forces between August and July quantities of Cuban or Havanna mahogany were sent to Britain and after the city was restored to Spain in Cuba continued to export small quantities mostly to ports on the north coast of Jamaica from where it went to Britain However this mahogany was regarded as inferior to the Jamaican variety and the trade remained sporadic until the th century br Another variety new to the market was Hispaniola mahogany also called Spanish and St Domingo mahogany This was the result of the Free Ports Act which opened Kingston and other designated Jamaican ports to foreign vessels for the first time The object was primarily to encourage importations of cotton from French plantations in Saint Domingue but quantities of high quality mahogany were also shipped These were then forwarded to Britain where they entered the market in the late s br br In terms of quantity the most significant new addition to the mahogany trade was Honduras mahogany also called baywood after the Bay of Honduras British settlers had been active in southern Yucatan since the beginning of the th century despite the opposition of the Spanish who claimed sovereignty over all of Central America br Their main occupation was cutting logwood a dyewood in high demand in Europe The center of their activity and the primary point of export was Belize Under Article XVII of the Treaty of Paris British cutters were for the first time given the right to cut logwood in Yucatan unmolested within agreed limits Such was the enthusiasm of the cutters that within a few years the European market was glutted and the price of logwood collapsed br However the price of mahogany was still high after the war and so the cutters turned to cutting mahogany The first Honduras mahogany arrived in Kingston Jamaica in November and the first shipments arrived in Britain the following year br By the s most of the viable stocks of mahogany in Jamaica had been cut and the market was divided between two principal sources or types of mahogany Honduras mahogany was relatively cheap plentiful but rarely of the best quality Hispaniola also called Spanish or Santo Domingo mahogany was the wood of choice for high quality work br Data are lacking but it is likely that the newly independent United States now received a good proportion of its mahogany from Cuba In the last quarter of the th century France began to use mahogany more widely they had ample supplies of high quality wood from Saint Domingue The rest of Europe where the wood was increasingly fashionable obtained most of their wood from Britain br br br Recent history br The French Revolution of and the wars that followed radically changed the mahogany trade primarily due to the progressive collapse of the French and Spanish colonial empires which allowed British traders into areas previously closed to them Saint Domingue became the independent republic of Haiti and from Spanish controlled Santo Domingo and Cuba were both open to British vessels for the first time br From the s mahogany from all these areas was imported into Europe and North America with the majority of them going to Britain In Central America British loggers moved northwest towards Mexico and south into Guatemala Other areas of Central America as far south as Panama also began to be exploited br The most important new development was the beginning of large scale logging in Mexico from the s Most mahogany was cut in the province of Tabasco and exported from a number of ports on the Gulf of Campeche from Vera Cruz eastwards to Campeche and Sisal By the end of the th century there was scarcely any part of Central America within reach of the coast untouched by logging and activity also extended into Colombia Venezuela Peru and Brazil br Trade in American mahogany probably reached a peak in the last quarter of the th century Figures are not available for all countries but Britain alone imported more than tons in This figure was not matched again From the s African mahogany Khaya spp a related genus began to be exported in increasing quantities from West Africa and by the early th century it dominated the market br In the total of mahogany from all sources imported into Europe was tons of which tons were from West Africa By this time mahogany from Cuba Haiti and other West Indian sources had become increasingly difficult to obtain in commercial sizes and by the late th century Central American and even South American mahogany was heading in a similar direction In S humilis was placed on CITES Appendix II a list of species that would be in danger of extinction without strict regulation followed by S mahagoni in The most abundant species S macrophylla was placed on Appendix III in and moved to Appendix II in br br br Uses br br Mahogany has a straight fine and even grain and is relatively free of voids and pockets Its reddish brown color darkens over time and displays a reddish sheen when polished It has excellent workability and is very durable Historically the tree s girth allowed for wide boards from traditional mahogany species These properties make it a favorable wood for crafting cabinets and furniture br Much of the first quality furniture made in the American colonies from the mid th century was made of mahogany when the wood first became available to American craftsmen Mahogany is still widely used for fine furniture however the rarity of Cuban mahogany the over harvesting of Honduras and Brazilian mahogany and the protests by indigenous peoples and environmental organizations from the s into the s have diminished their use Recent mahogany production from Mexico and Fiji has a lighter color and density than South American production from the early th century br Mahogany also resists wood rot making it attractive in boat construction and outdoor decking It is a tonewood often used for musical instruments particularly the backs sides and necks of acoustic guitars electric guitar bodies and drum shells because of its ability to produce a very deep warm tone compared to other commonly used woods such as maple alder ash Fraxinus or spruce Guitars featuring mahogany in their construction include many acoustic guitars from Martin Taylor and Gibson and Gibson electric guitars such as the Les Paul and SG In the s Gibson used the wood to make banjo necks as well br br br Mahogany as an invasive species br br In the Philippines environmentalists are calling for an end to the planting of mahogany because of its negative impact on the environment and wildlife including possibly causing soil acidification and no net benefit to wildlife br br br br br br
