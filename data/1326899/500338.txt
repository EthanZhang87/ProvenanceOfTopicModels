An outrigger is a projecting structure on a boat with specific meaning depending on types of vessel Outriggers may also refer to legs on a wheeled vehicle that are folded out when it needs stabilization for example on a crane that lifts heavy loads br br br Powered vessels and sailboats br br An outrigger describes any contraposing float rigging beyond the side gunwale of a boat to improve the vessel s stability If a single outrigger is used it is usually but not always windward The technology was originally developed by the Austronesian people There are two main types of boats with outriggers double outriggers prevalent in maritime Southeast Asia and single outriggers prevalent in Madagascar Melanesia Micronesia and Polynesia Multihull ships are also derived from outrigger boats br In an outrigger canoe and in sailboats such as the proa an outrigger is a thin long solid hull used to stabilise an inherently unstable main hull The outrigger is positioned rigidly and parallel to the main hull so that the main hull is less likely to capsize If only one outrigger is used on a vessel its weight reduces the tendency to capsize in one direction and its buoyancy reduces the tendency in the other direction br On a keelboat outrigger refers to a variety of structures by which the running rigging such as a sheet may be attached outboard outside the lateral limits of the boat s hull The Racing Rules of Sailing generally prohibit such outriggers though they are explicitly permitted on specific classes such as the IMOCA Open used in several major offshore races br br br Fishing br In fishing from vessels an outrigger is a pole or series of poles that allow boats to trawl more lines in the water without tangling and simulates a school of fish br br br Rowing br br In a rowing boat or galley an outrigger or rigger is a triangular frame that holds the rowlock into which the oar is slotted away from the saxboard or gunwale in gig rowing to optimize leverage Wooden outriggers appear on the new trireme around the th or th centuries BC and later on Italian galleys around AD while Harry Clasper a British professional rower popularised the use of the modern tubular metal version and the top rowing events accepted the physiological and ergonomic advantages so acceded to its use in competitions In recent decades some manufacturers of racing shells have developed wing riggers which are reinforced arcs or flattened tubular projections akin to aircraft wings instead of conventional triangular structures br br br See also br br Outrigger canoe br Outrigger canoe racing br Racing shell br Sailing canoe br Training wheels br br br
