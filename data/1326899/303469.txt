Teak Tectona grandis is a tropical hardwood tree species in the family Lamiaceae It is a large deciduous tree that occurs in mixed hardwood forests Tectona grandis has small fragrant white flowers arranged in dense clusters panicles at the end of the branches These flowers contain both types of reproductive organs perfect flowers The large papery leaves of teak trees are often hairy on the lower surface Teak wood has a leather like smell when it is freshly milled and is particularly valued for its durability and water resistance The wood is used for boat building exterior construction veneer furniture carving turnings and various small projects br Tectona grandis is native to south and southeast Asia mainly Bangladesh India Indonesia Malaysia Myanmar Thailand and Sri Lanka but is naturalised and cultivated in many countries in Africa and the Caribbean Myanmar s teak forests account for nearly half of the world s naturally occurring teak Molecular studies show that there are two centres of the genetic origin of teak one in India and the other in Myanmar and Laos br br br Description br br Teak is a large deciduous tree up to m ft tall with grey to greyish brown branches known for its high quality wood Its leaves are ovate elliptic to ovate cm in long by cm in wide and are held on robust petioles which are cm in long Leaf margins are entire br br Fragrant white flowers are borne on cm in long by cm in wide panicles from June to August The corolla tube is mm long with mm wide obtuse lobes Tectona grandis sets fruit from September to December fruits are globose and cm in diameter Flowers are weakly protandrous in that the anthers precede the stigma in maturity and pollen is shed within a few hours of the flower opening The flowers are primarily entomophilous insect pollinated but can occasionally be anemophilous wind pollinated A study found that in its native range in Thailand the major pollinators were species in the bee genus Ceratina br br br Wood br Wood texture is hard and rings are porous The density varies according to moisture content at moisture content it is kg m The heartwood is yellowish to golden brown Sapwood is whitish to pale yellowish brown It can easily separate from heartwood Teak darkens as it ages There can be a large variation depending on which region the teak is from Old growth has much tighter rings than new growth There is a leather like scent in newly cut wood br br br Botanical history br Tectona grandis was first formally described by Carl Linnaeus the Younger in his work Supplementum Plantarum In Harold Norman Moldenke published new descriptions of four forms of this species in the journal Phytologia Moldenke described each form as varying slightly from the type specimen T grandis f canescens is distinguished from the type material by being densely canescent or covered in hairs on the underside of the leaf T grandis f pilosula is distinct from the type material in the varying morphology of the leaf veins T grandis f punctata is only hairy on the larger veins on the underside of the leaf and T grandis f tomentella is noted for its dense yellowish tomentose hairs on the lower surface of the leaf br br br Etymology br The English word teak comes via the Portuguese teca from Malayalam tekka cognate with Tamil tekku Telugu teku and Kannada tegu via Sanskrit shaka and saka Central Province teak and Nagpur teak are named for those regions of India br br br Distribution and habitat br Tectona grandis is one of three species in the genus Tectona The other two species T hamiltoniana and T philippinensis are endemics with relatively small native distributions in Myanmar and the Philippines respectively Tectona grandis is native to India Bangladesh Sri Lanka Indonesia Myanmar northern Thailand and northwestern Laos br Tectona grandis is found in a variety of habitats and climatic conditions from arid areas with only mm of rain per year to very moist forests with up to mm of rain per year Typically though the annual rainfall in areas where teak grows averages mm with a month dry season br br br Cultivation br Teak s natural oils make it useful in exposed locations and make the timber termite and pest resistant Teak is durable even when not treated with oil or varnish Timber cut from old teak trees was once believed to be more durable and harder than plantation grown teak Studies have shown that plantation teak performs on par with old growth teak in erosion rate dimensional stability warping and surface checking but is more susceptible to colour change from UV exposure br The vast majority of commercially harvested teak is grown on teak plantations found in Indonesia and controlled by Perum Perhutani a state owned forest enterprise that manages the country s forests The primary use of teak harvested in Indonesia is in the production of outdoor teak furniture for export Nilambur in Kerala India is also a major producer of teak and is home to the world s oldest teak plantation br Teak consumption raises several environmental concerns such as the disappearance of rare old growth teak However its popularity has led to growth in sustainable plantation teak production throughout the seasonally dry tropics in forestry plantations The Forest Stewardship Council offers certification of sustainably grown and harvested teak products Propagation of teak via tissue culture for plantation purposes is commercially viable br Teak plantations were widely established in Equatorial Africa during the Colonial era These timber resources as well as the oil reserves are at the heart of the current South Sudanese conflict br Much of the world s teak is exported by Indonesia and Myanmar There is also a rapidly growing plantation grown market in Central America Costa Rica and South America With a depletion of remaining natural hectares of teak forests growth in plantations in Latin America is expected to rise br Hyblaea puera commonly known as the teak defoliator is a moth native to southeast Asia It is a teak pest whose caterpillar feeds on teak and other species of trees common in the region of Southeast Asia br br br Uses br Teak s high oil content high tensile strength and tight grain make it particularly suitable where weather resistance is desired It is used in the manufacture of outdoor furniture and boat decks It is also used for cutting boards indoor flooring countertops and as a veneer for indoor finishings Although easily worked it can cause severe blunting on edged tools because of the presence of silica in the wood Over time teak can weather to a silvery grey finish especially when exposed to sunlight br Teak is used extensively in India to make doors and window frames furniture and columns and beams in homes It is resistant to termite attacks and damage caused by other insects Mature teak fetches a very good price It is grown extensively by forest departments of different states in forest areas It was also used in the construction of the Kaaba in the Masjid al Haram of Mecca which is the holiest structure in the Islamic faith br Leaves of the teak wood tree are used in making Pellakai gatti jackfruit dumpling where batter is poured into a teak leaf and steamed This type of usage is found in the coastal district of Udupi in the Tulunadu region in South India The leaves are also used in gudeg a dish of young jackfruit made in Central Java Indonesia and give the dish its dark brown colour br Teak is used as a food plant by the larvae of moths of the genus Endoclita including E aroura E chalybeatus E damor E gmelina E malabaricus E sericeus and E signifer other Lepidoptera including the turnip moth br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Boatbuilding br br Teak has been used as a boatbuilding material for over years it was found in an archaeological dig in Berenice Panchrysos a port on the Indian Roman trade route In addition to relatively high strength teak is also highly resistant to rot fungi and mildew The wood has a relatively low shrinkage ratio which makes it excellent for applications where it undergoes periodic changes in moisture Teak has the unusual property of being both an excellent structural timber for framing or planking while at the same time being easily worked and finished unlike some otherwise similar woods such as purpleheart For this reason it is also prized for the trim work on boat interiors Due to the oily nature of the wood care must be taken to properly prepare the wood before gluing br When used on boats teak is also very flexible in the finishes that may be applied One option is to use no finish at all in which case the wood will naturally weather to a pleasing silver grey The wood may also be oiled with a finishing agent such as linseed or tung oil This results in a pleasant somewhat dull finish Finally teak may also be varnished for a deep lustrous glow br Teak is also used extensively in boat decks as it is extremely durable and requires very little maintenance The teak tends to wear into the softer summer growth bands first forming a natural non slip surface Any sanding is therefore only damaging The use of modern cleaning compounds oils or preservatives will shorten the life of the teak as it contains natural teak oil a very small distance below the white surface Wooden boat experts will only wash the teak with salt water and re caulk when needed This cleans the deck and prevents it from drying out and the wood shrinking The salt helps it absorb and retain moisture and prevents any mildew and algal growth Over maintenance such as cleaning teak with harsh chemicals can shorten its usable lifespan as decking br br br Propagation br br Teak is propagated mainly from seeds Germination of the seeds involves pretreatment to remove dormancy arising from the thick pericarp Pretreatment involves alternate wetting and drying of the seed The seeds are soaked in water for hours and then spread to dry in the sun for hours This is repeated for days and then the seeds are sown in shallow germination beds of coarse peat covered by sand The seeds then germinate after to days br Clonal propagation of teak has been successfully done through grafting rooted stem cuttings and micropropagation While bud grafting onto seedling root stock has been the method used for establishing clonal seed orchards that enables assemblage of clones of the superior trees to encourage crossing rooted stem cuttings and micro propagated plants are being increasingly used around the world for raising clonal plantations br br br Illegal logging br br Illegal logging is prevalent in countries with natural teak forests including India and Burma br Since the state owned Myanma Timber Enterprise has run the country s logging industry In Myanmar s government imposed a strict ban on exporting wild grown teak logs In Chinese loggers were sentenced to life in prison for illegal logging Illegal teak logging persists especially in contested areas While it is illegal for timber to be exported via land borders of Myanmar s teak enters China through the China Myanmar border br Since the Myanmar coup d tat illegal logging of teak and tamalan trees has surged in Sagaing Region predominantly in key contested battlegrounds including Kani Yinmabin Kantbalu Indaw and Banmauk townships Both the Burmese military and resistance groups have profited from the illegal logging trade Smugglers transport the wood to India to circumvent economic sanctions and use the Myanma Timber Enterprise to license the wood as being sourced from permitted areas br br br World s largest living teak tree br Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forestry Myanmar found the world s two biggest living teak trees on August in Homalin Township Sagaing Region Myanmar The biggest one named Homemalynn is feet m in girth and feet m tall The second biggest one named Homemalynn is feet m in girth br Previously the world s biggest recorded teak tree was located within the Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary in the Palakkad District of Kerala in India named Kannimara The tree is approximately metres ft tall Its age is between and years and is considered one of the oldest teak trees in the world br In a tree was discovered in the Ottakallan area of the Thundathil range of the Malayattoor Forest Division in Kerala with a girth of metres ft and a height of metres ft A teak tree in Kappayam Edamalayar Kerala which used to be considered the biggest has a girth of
