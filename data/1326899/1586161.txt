On a vessel s hull a strake is a longitudinal course of planking or plating which runs from the boat s stempost at the bows to the sternpost or transom at the rear The garboard strakes are the two immediately adjacent to the keel on each side br The word derives from traditional wooden boat building methods used in both carvel and clinker construction In a metal ship a strake is a course of plating br br br Construction br In small boats strakes may be single continuous pieces of wood In larger wooden vessels strakes typically comprise several planks which are either scarfed or butt jointed and reinforced with a butt block Where the transverse sections of the vessel s shape are fuller the strakes are wider they taper toward the ends br In a riveted steel ship the strakes were usually lapped and joggled one strake given projections to match indentions in the one adjoining but where a smoother finish was sought they might be riveted on a butt strap though this was weaker In modern welded construction the plates are normally butt welded with full penetration welds all round to adjoining plates within the strake and to adjoining strakes br br br Terminology br In boat and ship construction strakes immediately adjacent to either side of the keel are known as the garboard strakes or A strakes The next two are the first broad or B strake and second broad or C strake Working upward come the bottom strakes lowers bilge strakes topside strakes and uppers also named sequentially as the D strake E strake etc The uppermost along the topsides is called the sheer strake Strakes are joined to the stem by their hood ends br A rubbing strake was traditionally built in just below a carvel sheer strake It was much less broad but thicker than other strakes so that it projected and took any rubbing against piers or other boats when the boat was in use In clinker boats the rubbing strake was applied to the outside of the sheer strake Many current pleasure craft reflect this history in that they have a mechanically attached and therefore replaceable rub rail at the location formerly occupied by a rubbing strake often doubling to cover the joint between a GRP hull and its innerliner Inflatable dinghies and RIBs usually have a rubbing strake typically a glued on rubber extrusion at the edge br A stealer is a short strake employed to reduce the width of plank required where the girth of the hull increases or to accommodate a tuck in the shape It is commonly employed in carvel and iron steel shipbuilding but very few clinker craft use them br br br Sources
