In some boats and ships a transom is the aft transverse surface of the hull that forms the stern of a vessel Historically they are a development from the canoe stern or double ender wherein which both bow and stern are pointed br Transoms add both strength and width to the stern They may be flat or curved and they may be vertical raked forward known as retrouss or raked aft In small boats and yachts this flat termination of the stern is typically above the waterline but large commercial vessels often exhibit vertical transoms that dip slightly beneath the water On cruising boats a counter stern may be truncated to form a truncated counter stern in which there is a part of the stern that approximates a transom br Although that standard stern transom is typically vertical they may be raked such that there is an overhang above the water as at the bow A reverse transom is angled from the waterline forwards br On smaller boats such as dinghies transoms may be used to support a rudder outboard motor or a wind generator pole On cruising yachts the transome may hinge outwards when at anchor to form a swimming cum access platform and to provide a lazarette for deck items and leisure toys br br br Etymology br The term was used as far back as Middle English in the s having come from Latin transversus transverse via Old French traversain set crosswise br br br Gallery br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br
