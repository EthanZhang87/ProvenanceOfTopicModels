perform marriages This depends on the country of registry however most do not permit performance of a marriage by the master of a ship at sea br In the United States Navy a captain s powers are defined by its Code of Regulations specifically stating The commanding officer shall not perform a marriage ceremony on board his ship or aircraft He shall not permit a marriage ceremony to be performed on board when the ship or aircraft is outside the territory of the United States However there may be exceptions in accordance with local laws and the laws of the state territory or district in which the parties are domiciled and in the presence of a diplomatic or consular official of the United States who has consented to issue the certificates and make the returns required by the consular regulations br Furthermore in the United States there have been a few contradictory legal precedents courts did not recognize a shipboard marriage in California s Norman v Norman but did in New York s Fisher v Fisher notwithstanding the absence of municipal laws so carried and in s Johnson v Baker an Oregon court ordered the payment of death benefits to a widow because she had established that her marriage at sea was lawful However in Fisher v Fisher the involvement of the ship s captain was irrelevant to the outcome New Jersey s Bolmer v Edsall said a shipboard marriage ceremony is governed by the laws of the nation where ownership of the vessel lies br In the United Kingdom the captain of a merchant ship has never been permitted to perform marriages although from any which took place had to be reported in the ship s log A ship s master can however conduct a church service regardless of any clergy aboard br Spanish and Filipino law as narrow exceptions

allows ship captains to perform a marriage ceremony at sea but only for Japanese citizens Malta Bermuda and the Bahamas permit captains of ships registered in their jurisdictions to perform marriages at sea Princess Cruises whose ships are registered in Bermuda has used this as a selling point for their cruises while Cunard moved the registration of its ships Queen Mary Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth from Southampton to Bermuda in to allow marriages to be conducted on their ships br Some captains obtain other credentials such as ordination as ministers of religion or accreditation as notaries public which allow them to perform marriages in some jurisdictions where they would otherwise not be permitted to do so Another possibility is a wedding on a ship in port under the authority of an official from that port br In works of fiction ship captains have performed marriages in various media including the film The African Queen and episodes of The Love Boat How I Met Your Mother
