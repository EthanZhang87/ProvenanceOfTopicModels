title: Steering
id: 264373
Steering is the control of the direction of motion or the components that enable its control Steering is achieved through various arrangements among them ailerons for airplanes rudders for boats tilting rotors for helicopters and many more br br br Aircraft br Aircraft flight control systems are normally steered when airborne by the use of ailerons spoilerons or both to bank the aircraft into a turn although the rudder can also be used to turn the aircraft it is usually used to minimize adverse yaw rather than as a means to directly cause the turn On the ground aircraft are generally steered at low speeds by turning the nosewheel or tailwheel using a tiller or the rudder pedals or through differential braking and by the rudder at high speeds Missiles airships and large hovercraft are usually steered by a rudder thrust vectoring or both Small sport hovercraft have similar rudders but steer mostly by the pilot shifting their weight from side to side and unbalancing the more powerful lift forces beneath the skirt Jet packs and flying platforms are steered by thrust vectoring only br Helicopter flight controls are steered by cyclic control changing the thrust vector of the main rotor s and by anti torque control usually provided by a tail rotor br br br Automotive br br A conventional automotive steering arrangement allows a driver to control the direction of the vehicle by turning the direction of the front wheels using a hand operated steering wheel positioned in front of the driver The steering wheel is attached to a steering column which is linked to rods pivots and gears that allow the driver to change the direction of the front wheels Other arrangements are sometimes found on different types of vehicles for example a tiller or rear wheel steering Tracked vehicles such as bulldozers and tanks usually employ differential steering where the tracks are made to move at different speeds or even in opposite directions using the clutch and brakes to achieve a change of direction br Common steering system components include br br br Geometry br br The basic aim of steering is to ensure that the wheels are pointing in the desired direction to move the vehicle as required This is typically achieved by a series of linkages rods pivots and gears One of the fundamental concepts is that of caster angle Each wheel is steered with a pivot point ahead of the wheel which tends to make the steering self centered in the direction of travel br The steering linkages connecting the steering box and the wheels usually conform to a variation of Ackermann steering geometry to account for the fact that in a turn the inner wheel travels in a path of smaller radius than the outer wheel so that the degree of toe suitable for driving in a straight path is not suitable for turns The angle the wheels make in the vertical plane known as camber angle also influences steering dynamics as do the tires br br Steering wheel turning is often measured in terms of number of full degree turns to go lock to lock This is when the steering input mechanism is restrained at its mechanical limit from the full right turn stop to the left turn stop br br br Rack and pinion recirculating ball worm and sector br br Many modern cars have a steering mechanism called a rack and pinion The steering wheel turns a pinion gear which moves a rack back and forth to steer the wheels This mechanism converts the circular motion of the steering wheel to linear motion which is applied to the wheels of the car via tie rods and a steering knuckle br Rack and pinion steering has several advantages such as a direct steering feel This means that the driver can feel the road better and have more precise control over the car s movement br BMW was one of the first manufacturers to adopt rack and pinion steering systems in the s with many other European manufacturers following suit American automakers began using rack and pinion steering in the Ford Pinto br Older designs use two main principles the worm and sector design and the screw and nut Both types were enhanced by reducing the friction for screw and nut it is the recirculating ball mechanism which is still found on trucks and utility vehicles The steering column turns a large screw which meshes with the nut by recirculating balls The nut moves a sector of a gear causing it to rotate about its axis as the screw is turned an arm attached to the axis of the sector moves the pitman arm which is connected to the steering linkage and thus steers the wheels The recirculating ball version of this apparatus reduces the considerable friction by placing large ball bearings between the screw and the nut At either end of the apparatus the balls exit from between the two pieces into a channel internal to the box which connects them with the other end of the apparatus Thus they are recirculated br The recirculating ball mechanism has the advantage of a much greater mechanical advantage so that it was found on larger heavier vehicles while the rack and pinion was originally limited to smaller and lighter ones due to the almost universal adoption of power steering however this is no longer an important advantage leading to the increasing use of rack and pinion on newer cars The recirculating ball design also has a perceptible lash or dead spot on center where a minute turn of the steering wheel in either direction does not move the steering apparatus this is easily adjustable via a screw on the end of the steering box to account for wear but it cannot be eliminated because it will produce excessive internal forces at other positions and the mechanism will wear very rapidly This design is still in use in trucks and other large vehicles where rapidity of steering and direct feel are less important than robustness maintainability and mechanical advantage br The worm and sector was an older design used for example in Willys and Chrysler vehicles and the Ford Falcon s To reduce friction the sector is replaced by a roller or rotating pins on the rocker shaft arm br Generally older vehicles use the recirculating ball mechanism and only newer vehicles use rack and pinion steering This division is not very strict however and rack and pinion steering systems can be found on British sports cars of the mid s and some German carmakers did not give up recirculating ball technology until the early s br Other systems for steering exist but are uncommon on road vehicles Children s toys and go karts often use a very direct linkage in the form of a bellcrank also commonly known as a pitman arm attached directly between the steering column and the steering arms and the use of cable operated steering linkages e g the capstan and bowstring mechanism is also found on some home built vehicles such as soapbox cars and recumbent tricycles br br br Power steering br br Power steering helps the driver of a vehicle to steer by directing some of its engine power to assist in swiveling the steered road wheels about their steering axes As vehicles have become heavier and switched to front wheel drive particularly using negative offset geometry along with increases in tire width and diameter the effort needed to turn the wheels about their steering axis has increased often to the point where major physical exertion would be needed were it not for power assistance To alleviate this auto makers have developed power steering systems or more correctly power assisted steering since on road going vehicles there has to be a mechanical linkage as a fail safe There are two types of power steering systems hydraulic and electric electronic A hydraulic electric hybrid system is also possible br A Hydraulic Power Steering HPS uses hydraulic pressure supplied by an engine driven pump to assist the motion of turning the steering wheel Electric Power Steering EPS is more efficient than hydraulic power steering since the electric power steering motor only needs to provide assistance when the steering wheel is turned whereas the hydraulic pump must run constantly In EPS the amount of assistance is easily tunable to the vehicle type road speed and driver preference An added benefit is the elimination of the environmental hazard posed by leakage and disposal of hydraulic power steering fluid In addition electrical assistance is not lost when the engine fails or stalls whereas hydraulic assistance stops working if the engine stops making the steering doubly heavy as the driver must now turn not only the very heavy steering without any help but also the power assistance system itself br br br Speed sensitive steering br Speed sensitive steering allows for highly assisted steering at low speeds for maneuverability and lightly assisted steering at high speed for stability The first vehicle with this feature was the Citro n SM with its DIRAVI system first sold in France in The hydraulic steering system applied force on a centering cam which pushed the steering rack and wheel back to the straight ahead position The centering force increased with speed requiring more effort to turn the wheel at greater speeds br Modern speed sensitive power steering systems reduce the mechanical or electrical assistance as the vehicle speed increases giving a more direct feel This feature is gradually becoming more common For example it was used on a production pickup truck the Tesla Cybertruck in br br br Four wheel steering br br Four wheel steering is a system employed by some vehicles to improve steering response increase vehicle stability while maneuvering at high speed or to decrease turning radius at low speed br br br Active four wheel steering br In an active four wheel steering system all four wheels turn at the same time when the driver steers In most active four wheel steering systems the rear wheels are steered by a computer and actuators The rear wheels generally cannot turn as far as the front wheels There can be controls to switch off the rear steering and options to steer only the rear wheels independently of the front wheels At low speed e g parking the rear wheels turn opposite to the front wheels reducing the turning radius sometimes critical for large trucks tractors vehicles with trailers and passenger cars with a large wheelbase while at higher speeds both front and rear wheels turn alike electronically controlled so that the vehicle may change position with less yaw and improved build up of the lateral acceleration enhancing straight line stability The snaking effect experienced during motorway drives while towing a travel trailer is thus largely nullified br Four wheel steering found its most widespread use in monster trucks where maneuverability in small arenas is critical and it is also popular in large farm vehicles and trucks Some of the modern European Intercity buses also utilize four wheel steering to assist maneuverability in bus terminals and also to improve road stability Mazda were pioneers in applying four wheel steering to automobiles showing it on their Mazda MX concept car where the rear wheels counter steered at low speeds Mazda proceeded to offer a version of this electronic four wheel steering system on the Mazda and MX in The first rally vehicle to use the technology was the Peugeot Turbo which debuted at the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb br Previously Honda had mechanical four wheel steering as an option in their Prelude and Honda Ascot models later upgrading to electronically controlled General Motors offered Delphi s Quadrasteer in their Silverado Sierra and Suburban Yukon Due to low demand GM discontinued the technology at the end of the model year Nissan Infiniti offer several versions of their HICAS system as standard or as an option in much of their line up br In the early s a new generation of four wheel steering systems was introduced into the market In BMW equipped the E series with an all wheel steering system optional called Integral Active Steering which is available on the current and series as an option Renault introduced an optional all wheel steering called control in at first on the Laguna GT which is currently available on the Talisman M gane and Espace vehicle lines In Porsche introduced a system on the Turbo as standard equipment Since the Panamera has been offered with optional all wheel steering The Audi Q was launched with an optional system Also the Japanese OEMs offer luxury segment vehicles equipped with all wheel steering such as Infiniti on its QX model Rear Active Steering and Lexus on the GS Italian manufacturers have launched the technology in the model years with the Ferrari F tdf the Ferrari GTC Lusso as well as the Lamborghini Aventador S Coup br br br Crab steering br Crab steering is a special type of active four wheel steering It operates by steering all wheels in the same direction and at the same angle Crab steering is used when the vehicle needs to proceed in a straight line but at an angle when changing lanes on a highway at speed when moving loads with a reach truck or during filming with a camera dolly br Rear wheel steering can also be used when the rear wheels may not follow the path taken by the front wheel tracks e g to reduce soil compaction when using rolling farm equipment br br br Passive rear wheel steering br Many modern vehicles have passive rear wheel steering On many vehicles when cornering the rear wheels tend to steer slightly to the outside of a turn which can reduce stability The passive steering system uses the lateral forces generated in a turn through suspension geometry and the bushings to correct this tendency and steer the wheels slightly to the inside of the corner This improves the stability of the car through the turn This effect is called compliance understeer it or its opposite is present on all suspensions Typical methods of achieving compliance understeer are to use a Watt s link on a live rear axle or the use of toe control bushings on a twist beam suspension On an independent rear suspension it is normally achieved by changing the rates of the rubber bushings in the suspension Some suspensions typically have compliance oversteer due to geometry such as Hotchkiss live axles semi trailing arm IRS and rear twist beams but may be mitigated by revisions to the pivot points of the leaf spring or trailing arm or additional suspension links or complex internal geometry of the bushings br Passive rear wheel steering is not a new concept as it has been in use for many years although not always recognized as such br br br Articulated steering br br Articulated steering is a system by which a vehicle is split into front and rear halves which are connected by a vertical hinge The front and rear halves are connected with one or more hydraulic cylinders that change the angle between the halves including the front and rear axles and wheels thus steering the vehicle This system does not use steering arms king pins tie rods etc as does four wheel steering If the vertical hinge is placed equidistant between the two axles it also eliminates the need for a central differential in four wheel drive vehicles as both front and rear axles will follow the same path and thus rotate at the same speed Articulated haulers have very good off road performance br Vehicle trailer combinations such as semi trailers road trains articulated buses and internal transport trolley trains can be regarded as passively articulated vehicles br br br Rear wheel steering br A few types of vehicle use only rear wheel steering notably fork lift trucks camera dollies early pay loaders Buckminster Fuller s Dymaxion car and the ThrustSSC br In cars rear wheel steering tends to be unstable because in turns the steering geometry changes hence decreasing the turn radius oversteer rather than increasing it understeer Rear wheel steering is meant for slower vehicles that need high maneuverability in tight spaces e g fork lifts br For heavy haulage or for increased maneuverability some semi trailers are fitted with rear wheel steering controlled electro hydraulically The wheels on all or some of the rear axles may be turned through different angles to enable tighter cornering or through the same angle crab steering to move the rear of the trailer laterally br br br Steer by wire br br The aim of steer by wire technology is to completely remove as many mechanical components steering shaft column gear reduction mechanism etc as possible Completely replacing conventional steering system with steer by wire has several advantages such as br br The absence of steering column simplifies the car interior design br The absence of steering shaft column and gear reduction mechanism allows much better space utilization in the engine compartment br The steering mechanism can be designed and installed as a modular unit br Without mechanical connection between the steering wheel and the road wheel it is less likely that the impact of a frontal crash will cause the steering wheel to impact the driver br Steering system characteristics can easily be adjusted to change the steering response and feel br Steer by wire without the use of a steering column was first offered in a production car with the Nissan Infiniti Q in Steer by wire continued to be offered with the QX and QX and as of is being offered with the Infiniti Q coupe br Production battery electric vehicles in the s that offer steer by wire with no steering column include the Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle Lexus RZ e REE Automotive P module based vehicles Toyota bZ X and Tesla Cybertruck As of Lotus Peugeot and Mercedes Benz plan to offer steer by wire cars in the mid to late s br br br Safety br br Traditionally cars feature a collapsible steering column energy absorbing steering column which will collapse in the event of a heavy frontal impact to avoid excessive injuries to the driver Airbags are also generally fitted as standard Non collapsible steering columns fitted to older vehicles very often impaled drivers in frontal crashes particularly when the steering box or rack was mounted in front of the front axle line at the front of the crumple zone This was particularly a problem on vehicles that had a rigid separate chassis frame with no crumple zone Many modern vehicle steering boxes or racks are mounted behind the front axle on the front bulkhead at the rear of the front crumple zone br Collapsible steering columns were invented by B la Bar nyi and were introduced in the Mercedes Benz W Fintail along with crumple zones This safety feature first appeared on cars built by General Motors after an extensive and very public lobbying campaign enacted by Ralph Nader Ford started to install collapsible steering columns in br Audi used a retractable steering wheel and seat belt tensioning system called procon ten but it has since been discontinued in favor of airbags and pyrotechnic seat belt pre tensioners br br br Cycles br br See the section Bicycles br br br Differential steering br br Differential steering is the primary means of steering tracked vehicles such as tanks and bulldozers it is also used in certain wheeled vehicles commonly known as skid steers and implemented in some automobiles where it is called torque vectoring to augment steering by changing wheel direction relative to the vehicle br br br Regulations br In the European Union Russia and Japan United Nations Economic Commission for Europe UNECE vehicle regulation is related to steering br In the United States Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards and are related to impact protection for the driver from the steering control system and steering control rearward displacement while Code of Federal Regulations is related to steering wheel systems br In North America hands off or hands free level systems allowing the drivers to remove both hands from the steering wheel were introduced and legally permitted General Motors Super Cruise is such an implementation In those designs warnings are raised when driver disengages his her visual attention br In May in Europe UNECE regulation still requires assistant systems for steering to prompt drivers not to remove their hands from the steering wheel Those systems are known as hands on systems With hands on assisted driving systems British and European drivers are required by the system itself to keep one or both hands on the steering wheel as with unassisted driving When driving with assisted steering if drivers remove both hands from the steering wheel an optical warning occurs after the first seconds and an acoustic warning occurs after more seconds Assisted steering is deactivated after additional seconds br In the United Kingdom drivers must control the vehicle at all times and Rule of the Highway Code instructs to drive with both hands on the wheel where possible and to use ADAS according to the manufacturer s instructions br br br Bicycles br The bicycle is steered by turning the handlebar and by the lean of the rider and the bicycle br br Turning the handlebar rotates the front wheel with respect to the plane of the circumference of the rear wheel Friction of the front wheel with the ground provides the lateral forces that steer the bicycle Modern bicycles have the front wheel ground contact point trailing behind the steering axis which is the long axis of the bicycle fork through the center of the front wheel This trailing contact point adds to the effects of inertia and centre of mass offset which affect the steering and self stability of the bicycle br Leaning the frame of the bicycle which displaces the rider and parts of the bicycle in relation to the axis along the ground contact points of the wheels Gravitational forces then provide the lateral forces that steer the bicycle br br br Watercraft br Ships and boats are usually steered with a rudder Depending on the size of the vessel rudders can be manually actuated or operated using a servomechanism or a trim tab or servo tab system Rowing may be used to steer rowboats by using specific paddle strokes Boats using outboard motors steer by rotating the entire drive unit Boats with inboard motors sometimes steer by rotating the propeller pod only i e Volvo Penta IPS drive Steering wheels may be used to control the rudder or propeller Modern ships with diesel electric drive use azimuth thrusters Boats powered by oars or paddles are steered by generating a higher propulsion force on the side of the boat opposite of the direction of turn Jet skis are steered by weight shift induced roll and water jet thrust vectoring br The rudder of a vessel can steer the ship only when water is passing over it Hence when a ship is not moving relative to the water it is in or cannot move its rudder it does not respond to the helm and is said to have lost steerage The motion of a ship through the water is known as making way Boats on rivers must always be under propulsion even when traveling downstream in order to steer requiring sufficient water to pass over the surface of the rudder to effect changes in the direction of the boat in response to the helm This is called having steerage way br br br See also br br br br br br External links br br How Car Steering Works at HowStuffWorks br technical
