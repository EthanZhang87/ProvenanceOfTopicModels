title: Anchor windlass
id: 3127809
A windlass is a machine used on ships that is used to let out and heave up equipment such as a ship s anchor or a fishing trawl On some ships it may be located in a specific room called the windlass room br An anchor windlass is a machine that restrains and manipulates the anchor chain on a boat allowing the anchor to be raised and lowered by means of chain cable A notched wheel engages the links of the chain or the rope br A trawl windlass is a similar machine that restrains or manipulates the trawl on a commercial fishing vessel The trawl is a sort of big fishing net that is wound on the windlass The fishermen either let out the trawl or heave up the trawl during fishing operations A brake is provided for additional control The windlass is usually powered by an electric or hydraulic motor operating via a gear train br br br Horizontal or vertical br Technically speaking the term windlass refers only to horizontal winches Vertical designs are correctly called capstans Horizontal windlasses make use of an integral gearbox and motor assembly all typically located above deck with a horizontal shaft through the unit and wheels for chain and or rope on either side Vertical capstans use a vertical shaft with the motor and gearbox situated below the winch unit usually below decks br Horizontal windlasses offer several advantages The unit tends to be more self contained protecting the machinery from the corrosive environment found on boats The dual wheels also allow two anchors on double rollers to be serviced Vertical capstans for their part allow the machinery to be placed below decks thus lowering the center of gravity important on boats and also allow a flexible angle of pull which means rope or chain can be run out to different fair leads br It tends to be the case that smaller boats use capstans and larger boats have windlasses although this is by no means a hard and fast rule br br br The links from bitts to anchor br The anchor is shackled to the anchor cable US anchor chain the cable passes up through the hawsepipe through the pawl over the windlass gypsy US wildcat down through the spurling pipe to the chain cable locker under the forecastle or poop if at the stern US fantail the anchor bitts are on a bulkhead in the cable locker and the bitter end of the cable is connected to the bitts using the bitter pin which should be able to be released from outside the locker to slip the anchor This would occur if the windlass brake has slipped in a storm for example and the cable has reached the bitter end This is the origin of the term to the bitter end It originally applied in sailing vessels where the cable was a rope and the windlass or capstan was powered by many sailors below decks br br br Gypsies and wildcats br The wheels on either a vertical or horizontal windlass provide for either chain or line to be engaged The wheel for line is termed a warping head while the chain handling wheel is variously referred to as the gypsy in the UK or wildcat in North America For clarity in communication the generic term chainwheel is often used On small craft a warping drum is sometimes used to handle both chain rope although particular care must be taken with sizing and compatibility of line chain and windlass for this feature to work effectively br It is important that the chainwheel match the chain size i e the link pitch closely Even a small difference in link size or consistency can cause undue wear on the chainwheel and or cause the chain to jump off the windlass when the winch is operating particularly during payout a runaway condition sometimes referred to as water spouting should it occur at high speed br Nowadays especially on large tankers and cruise ships the windlass may be split into independent port and starboard units In these cases they are frequently coupled with warping drums as distinct from warping heads In some of these the warping drums are of the self tensioning or constant tension type br br br Mechanical advantage br The mechanical advantage of a windlass is derived from the pulling force being multiplied by wrapping the rope around the drum br The math for such force phenomena is described by the Capstan equation The formula is br br br br br br T br br load br br br br br T br br hold br br br br br e br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle T text load T text

While many modern windlasses require an external power source many remain manually driven in the same manner as most sailing boats winches for sheets br Powered solutions include steam antiquated hydraulics and electrics Electrics are convenient and relatively cheap but hydraulics may be more efficient and powerful if available br In general windlasses and their power system should be capable of lifting the anchor and all its rode chain and rope so that the anchor and rode hang suspended in deep water This task should be within the windlass rated working pull not its maximum pull br br br Devil s claw br br The devil s claw is a device that is used as a chain stopper to grab and hold an anchor chain It consists of a turnbuckle usually attached at the base of the anchor windlass and a metal hook with two curved fingers that grab one link of a chain br A devil s claw is often used on merchant ships because it is lighter and easier to manage than other types of chain stoppers such as a pelican hook br After hoisting the anchor and setting the windlass brake the claw is placed on a chain link and the turnbuckle is tightened to take up the tension on the chain If more than one stopper is used the turnbuckles can be adjusted to evenly distribute the load br A devil s claw cannot be released while it is under tension To release it the tension must first be taken up by the windlass brake Then the turnbuckle can be loosened and removed br br br br br br External links br Media related to Anchor windlasses at Wikimedia Commons
