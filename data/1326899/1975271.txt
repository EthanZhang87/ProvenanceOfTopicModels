title: Watchkeeping
id: 1975271
Watchkeeping or watchstanding is the assignment of sailors to specific roles on a ship to operate it continuously These assignments also known at sea as watches are constantly active as they are considered essential to the safe operation of the vessel and also allow the ship to respond to emergencies and other situations quickly These watches are divided into work periods to ensure that the roles are always occupied at all times while those members of the crew who are assigned to work during a watch are known as watchkeepers br On a typical seafaring vessel be it naval or merchant personnel keep a watch in various locations and duties across the ship such as the bridge and engine room Typical bridge watchkeepers include a lookout and a deck officer who is responsible for the safe navigation of the ship whereas in the engine room an engine officer ensures that running machinery continues to operate within tolerances br br br Types of watches br A wide variety of types of watches have developed due to the different needs aboard merchant and naval vessels This table gives some examples br br br Watch systems br A watch system watch schedule or watch bill is a method of assigning regular periods of watchkeeping duty aboard ships and some other areas of employment A watch system allows the ship s crew to operate the ship hours a day while also allowing individual personnel adequate time for rest and other duties br Watch durations vary between vessels due to some reasons and restrictions some watch systems aim to ensure that each team takes turns to work late at night while other systems ensure the same team consistently works at the same hours every day br Many watch systems incorporate the concept of a dog watch whereby one watch is split into two shorter watches so that there is an odd number each day Doing so allows crew members to have a different watch schedule each day Often the dog watches are set at dinner time to allow the entire crew to be fed in short order br br br Traditional system br br The traditional watch system arose from sailing ships of the late th century and was used by the Royal Navy and many other Commonwealth navies It consisted of four hour periods and two hour periods Those members of the crew whose work must be done at all times of the day were assigned to one of two divisions the starboard or the port division These can be further divided into two parts e g First Port Second Starboard br The Royal Navy traditional submarine three watch system is on off during the day a m to p m and on off during the night p m to a m br br br Traditional system with three sections br br The same arrangement of watch times can also be used with a crew divided into three sections This gives each sailor more time off duty sometimes allowing sleeping periods of over seven hours Names for the three watches instead of Port and Starboard vary from ship to ship Naming schemes such as Foremast Mainmast and Mizzen and Tomato White and Blue are common br br br Five and dime br br The so called five and dime arrangement splits the day into five hour watches with the exception of a four hour watch from to br br br Six hour shift br br The six hour shift splits the day into four six hour watches permitting a three section crew to maximize rest time in a three day working cycle Also this watch system takes into better account the meal times of a four meals a day system so that the ingoing team will be fed first then keep watch while the outgoing team will be relieved of watch and then proceed to the mess deck br br br US submarine system with three sections br br Aboard United States submarines the crew is typically divided into three sections with each section keeping hours of watch followed by hours off watch This schedule has been a fairly recent change to submariner work and rest routines For nearly years before submariners were on hour days with hours of watch followed by hours off watch The hours off watch were further divided into the first hours being used for maintenance cleaning and entertainment while the second hours were usually for sleeping br Note that this arrangement resulted in one of the sections having two watches in one hour day and there were no dog watches Also watch reliefs occurred no later than the bottom of the hour Typically the first minutes of the hour were used for the oncoming section to eat while the second minutes of the hour were used for the off going section to eat br br br One in two watch system br br Some warships now use the one in two system also known as s and s for the duration of the watches This watch system is also sometimes referred to as Port and Starboard watches This gives the sailors a longer sleeping period than the traditional two watch system while still maintaining the ability for the ship to function Meals are generally scheduled around the watch turnovers at and sometimes a light midnight meal known as mid rats midnight rations is provided for the turnover br br br Swedish system br br Various alternative watch schedules have been devised which are typically referred to as Swedish watches Although there is no standard for what constitutes a Swedish watch the variations all feature some element of extended watches to accommodate longer time off Like the traditional watch system they begin at hours Some popular variations have durations of and br br br Merchant ships br br On merchant ships watchkeepers typically keep watch for six periods of four consecutive hours This system has a couple of advantages it is easy to remember and it is consistent For example a member of watch team will only have to remember that he is on the watch and knows that he goes on watch at a m and p m This scheme also allows inexperienced watchkeepers to keep watch from a m and p m when senior watchkeepers are likely to be awake and ready to assist in case of trouble br By custom in a ship with five deck officers the junior third mate takes the to watch the senior third mate the to watch and the second mate the to watch This enables the second officer who is the ship s navigator to take morning and evening star sights In ships with only four deck officers the third officer will keep the to the second officer the to and the Chief Mate equivalent to the Executive Officer in a navy ship the to watch The reason for this is to enable the Chief Mate to assign work to the deck gang before the ship s day begins and to inspect it before going on watch at hours br br br Ship s bell br br A ship s bell is used in concert with a watch system to indicate the time using bell strikes to mark the time and help sailors know when to change watches Unlike civil clock bells the strikes of a ship s bell do not accord to the number of the hour Instead there are eight bells one for each half hour of a four hour watch Bells would be struck every half hour and in a pattern of pairs for easier counting with any odd bells at the end of the sequence br br br See also br br Canonical hours br Duty officer br USS Fitzgerald and MV ACX Crystal collision br Melbourne Evans collision br Work shift br br br
