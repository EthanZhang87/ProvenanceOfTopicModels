title: Canting keel
id: 2488019
A canting keel is a form of sailing ballast suspended from a rigid canting strut beneath the boat which can be swung to windward of a boat under sail in order to counteract the heeling force of the sail The canting keel must be able to pivot to either port or starboard depending on the current tack br br br Purpose and history br The traditional yacht keel performs four functions br br the development of lateral water force to resist lateral aerodynamic force from sails and superstructure br the physical housing of ballast load as low as possible br roll damping to resist energy inputs from waves and disturbed water and br a contribution to directional stability br The traditional fin keel pointing straight down from the boat provides no righting moment when the boat is level The heeling force of the wind on the sails is therefore not counteracted until the boat has heeled over by a certain amount moving the fixed keel to windward of the centerline The purpose of the canting keel is to allow the boat to sail closer to level which generates maximum speed by swinging the keel to windward and developing an adequate righting moment to keep the boat s angle of heel closer to level br With the canting keel handling the ballast functions lateral resistance and steering can be managed separately with a foil or pair of foils either on each side or fore and aft such as daggerboards This allows for much quicker maneuverability than traditional keelboats with about half the weight usually required for ballast br The first patent for a canting keel device was granted by Douglas Beardy on May br The first yacht to have a canting keel was the Fiery Cross designed by Jim Young New Zealand in In this canting keel device the lever was mounted inside the fin at an angle and at the top it was connected to a vertical shaft When the shaft was twisted around its axis a curved lever pressed against the inner walls of the fin and tilted it br A version of the technology was invented and patented by CBF Technology in the s The canting keel s first use in an offshore race was the Mini Transat on number Fouesnant la Foret and then in the Vendee Globe of which Pete Goss completed in a ft Adrian Thompson designed yacht named Aqua Quorum Development of the yacht and the events of the Race are described in detail in Pete s subsequent book Close to the Wind Subsequent use in major competition was in September when five boats using the canting keel in the Maxi Yacht Rolex Cup placed ahead of the previously unbeaten world champion Alfa Romeo Alfa Romeo II designed by Reichel Pugh features a canting keel and fore and aft twin foils CBTF br A variation of the canting keel is the d keel invented by Fran ois Lucas in which allows movement in three directions side to side forward and aft and side to side br br br Current use br Originally used in large maxi yachts such as the maxZ canting keels are now beginning to appear in smaller boats such as the Open and the VO and Volvo Ocean Volvo Ocean ocean racing classes and the even smaller Schock and Classe Mini The Schock owned by Tom Schock famously lost its keel and capsized illustrating the fundamental problem with complicated keel design without a keel most boats cannot float upright br The Volvo Open class boats in the around the world Volvo Ocean Race are perhaps the most well known boats to use canting keels for ballast While previous years boats showed a few percent improvement in speed each race the race is held every three years the VO class are showing a improvement in speed The ton ballast bulb hanging over feet meters below the water and capable of canting up to degrees produces a tremendous amount of righting moment over ft lbf or N m with the hull level allowing the boat to reach speeds of over knots br br br Disadvantages br The current canting keel technology is far from perfect At least three of the seven boats in the Volvo Ocean Race one of the first major long term races allowing canting keels had problems with the keels One area in particular the plates sealing the opening through which the keel passes are prone to leaks Unlike a centerboard or daggerboard trunk the opening for a canting keel must allow significant lateral motion which requires sliding seals br The boat movistar had problems on Leg of the Volvo Ocean Race miles off Cape Horn during the night on March It sprung a significant leak when the sliding plates that covered the keel opening fell off in the middle of the night This was a problem that had occurred earlier movistar s aft keel pivot broke loose and began flooding the boat They made repairs in Ushuaia on the Beagle Channel Later on in Leg the same problem occurred in the north Atlantic This time the decision was made to abandon ship and the crew transferred to ABN AMRO TWO movistar continued to broadcast its position for several days but an aerial search failed to find the vessel and it was lost br In the Velux Oceans Race a single handed round the world race the Open yacht Hugo Boss skippered by Alex Thomson had to be abandoned in the Southern Ocean due to the snapping of the hydraulic rams that controlled the keel which caused the catastrophic failure of the keel When this failure caused the yacht to nearly capsize the boat was abandoned Thomson was rescued by fellow competitor Mike Golding On November the boat s Sat C transponder stopped transmitting The abandoned hull was found washed up on the shores of Patagonia years later br In December Wild Oats XI has retired from the nd Sydney to Hobart yacht race citing a broken hydraulic ram Race spokesman Bruce Montgomery said Wild Oats XI was unable to move its keel after a hydraulic ram broke It s the gear that operates its canting keel which is the keel that swings under the boat he said br br br America s Cup br There were rumors that the International America s Cup Class yacht Alinghi might have had a canting keel This would have given Alinghi an advantage over its challenger for the America s Cup unless the challenger Emirates Team New Zealand also had a swinging keel The America s Cup Class Committee chaired by Ken McAlpine issued a ruling on May which stated that canting keels and other movable appendages were specifically prohibited br br br Alternative designs br br In recent years canting keel devices have been proposed in which the drive is not a lever as it was before but something else One of these devices is a canting keel with a chain drive which is able to tilt the fin degrees or more The author of this invention is Boris Kuchukov The fin and ballast keel must be in the air when a yacht equipped with such a device is moving In theory this should increase the speed of the yacht br br br br br Canting Ballast Twin Foil
