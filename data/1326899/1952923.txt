A capstan is a vertical axled rotating machine developed for use on sailing ships to multiply the pulling force of seamen when hauling ropes cables and hawsers The principle is similar to that of the windlass which has a horizontal axle br br br History br The word connected with the Old French capestan or cabestan t from Old Proven al cabestan from capestre pulley cord from Latin capistrum a halter from capere to take hold of seems to have come into English th century from Portuguese or Spanish shipmen at the time of the Crusades Both device and word are considered Spanish inventions br br br Early form br In its earliest form the capstan consisted of a timber mounted vertically through a vessel s structure which was free to rotate Levers known as bars were inserted through holes at the top of the timber and used to turn the capstan A rope wrapped several turns around the drum was thus hauled upon A rudimentary ratchet was provided to hold the tension The ropes were always wound in a clockwise direction seen from above br br br Later form br Capstans evolved to consist of a wooden drum or barrel mounted on an iron axle Two barrels on a common axle were used frequently to allow men on two decks to apply force to the bars Later capstans were made entirely of iron with gearing in the head providing a mechanical advantage when the bars were pushed counterclockwise One form of capstan was connected by a shaft and gears to an anchor windlass on the deck below On riverine vessels the capstan was sometimes cranked by steam power br br br br Capstan winches were also important on sailing trawlers e g Brixham trawlers as a means for fetching in the nets after the trawl When they became available steam powered capstan winches offered a great saving in effort These used a compact combined steam engine and boiler below decks that drove the winch from below via a shaft Ruston Proctor and Company at the UK Fisheries Exhibition marketed an engine boiler shafts and capstan designed specifically for this task br br br Messenger br As ships and their anchors grew in size the anchor cable or chain would be too big to go around the capstan Also a wet cable or chain would be difficult to manage A messenger would then be used as an intermediate device This was a continuous loop of cable or chain which would go around the capstan The main anchor cable or chain would then be attached to the messenger for hauling using some temporary connection such as ropes called nippers These would be attached and detached as the anchor was pulled up onto the ship weighed thus allowing a continuous hoist of the anchor without any need for stopping or surging br br br Modern form br Modern capstans are powered electrically hydraulically pneumatically or via an internal combustion engine Typically a gearbox is used which trades reduced speed relative to the prime mover for increased torque br br br Similar machines br In yachting terminology a winch functions on the same principle as a capstan However in industrial applications the term winch generally implies a machine which stores the rope on a drum br Most cassette players utilize a device called a capstan to draw the magnetic tape from the cassette across the tape head It functions similarly to and was likely named for the nautical device br br br Use on land br br Hydraulically powered capstans were sometimes used in railway goods yards for shunting or shifting railcars short distances One example was Broad Street goods station in London The yard was on a deck above some warehouses and the deck was not strong enough to carry a locomotive so ropes and capstans were used instead br br br See also br Capstan equation br br br Notes br br br br br EtymologyOnLine
