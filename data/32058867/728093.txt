grandeur and a tenacious obsession with the last war is much harder to shake off The article was dusted down during the general election campaign when the Daily Mail interpreted the article as being a Nazi slur on Britain and Clegg had begun to feel the full heat of the British tabloid press following his success during the first leaders debate br br br Parliamentary candidate br On leaving the European Parliament Clegg joined political lobbying firm GPlus in April as a fifth partner br br It s especially exciting to be joining GPlus at a time when Brussels is moving more and more to the

Affairs Spokesperson Menzies Campbell Clegg s ability to articulate liberal values at a very practical level quickly lent him prominence with many already seeing him as a future Liberal Democrat leader Following the resignation of Kennedy on January Clegg was touted as a possible leadership contender He was quick to rule himself out however instead declaring his support for Menzies Campbell ahead of his former colleague in the European Parliament Chris Huhne with Campbell going on to win the ballot Clegg had been a signatory to the letter circulated by Vince Cable prior to Kennedy s

Liberal Democrat party conference in he admitted his leadership ambitions to journalists at a fringe event The admission followed a period of increased media speculation about Sir Menzies Campbell s leadership which the admission by Clegg did nothing to reduce and resulted in a rebuke by some of his frontbench colleagues This followed a report from Kevin Maguire in the New Statesman that Clegg had failed to hide his disloyalty to Campbell s leadership Campbell eventually resigned on October saying that questions about his leadership were getting in the way of further progress by the party br br br Leader of the Liberal Democrats br br br Election to the leadership br br After Campbell s resignation Clegg was regarded by much of the media as front runner in the leadership election The

as defending civil liberties devolving the running of public services to parents pupils and patients and protecting the environment br In an interview on BBC Radio Live on the morning after his election to the leadership Clegg stated that he does not believe in God but that he has an immense amount of respect for people of faith In Clegg elaborated on this question stating I was asked a question once in one of those questions where you re only allowed to answer yes or no and I was asked Do you believe in God As it happens I don t know whether God exists I m much more of an agnostic br Clegg resigned as the leader of the Liberal Democrats after the general election He said the results were immeasurably more crushing and unkind than he feared He was succeeded by Tim Farron after a leadership election br br br GQ magazine interview controversy br In March GQ magazine ran with an interview conducted by Piers Morgan in which Clegg admitted to sleeping with no more than women Senior Lib Dem MPs defended his comments Lembit pik said it showed you can be a human being and a party Leader and Norman Lamb that Nick tries to be absolutely straight in everything that he does and that might sometimes get him into trouble but he will build a reputation for being honest and straightforward Speaking to the BBC about the interview Clegg said wisdom with hindsight is an easy thing as what had been a split second response had been taken out of context interpreted over interpreted and so on br br br Relationships with the frontbench br Upon his election Clegg appointed leadership rival Huhne as his replacement as Home Affairs spokesperson and following his strong performances as acting party leader Vince Cable was retained as the main Treasury spokesperson Media commentators noted that the Clegg Huhne Cable triumvirate provided the Liberal Democrats with an effective political team for the coming years On March Clegg suffered a real test following the resignation of three of his front bench team David Heath Alistair Carmichael and Tim Farron had been told to abstain in the vote for a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty but had wanted to vote in favour and so defied the whip In addition to the three frontbenchers a further more backbench LibDem MPs also defied the whip and voted yes Clegg said though we have disagreed on this issue I fully understand and respect their strongly held views on the subject However as they have recognised the shadow cabinet cannot operate effectively unless the principle of collective responsibility is maintained br The resignations happened not long after Michael Martin the Speaker of the House of Commons had on February blocked calls by the Liberal Democrats for an in or out referendum on Britain s EU membership The Speaker s authority was called into question when led by Nick Clegg the Liberal Democrats marched out of the House of Commons calling the Speaker s decision a constitutional outrage Just moments earlier frontbench foreign affairs spokesman for the party Ed Davey had been expelled from the chamber by the Speaker s deputy Sir Michael Lord for further challenging the ruling br In November Clegg suffered more allegations of difficulties with the front bench following an article in the Daily Mirror that reported that Clegg had criticised senior members of his front bench whilst on a plane journey He told the BBC s Politics Show that a lot of it is frankly fiction br br br Attitudes to other parties br In the Commons Clegg initially concentrated most of his fire on Labour and Prime Minister Gordon Brown but in the autumn of began also focusing on David Cameron and the Conservatives Clegg rejected an appeal from Cameron for their two parties to work together Clegg argued that the Conservatives were totally different from his party and that the Lib Dems were the true progressives in UK politics At the party conference in Bournemouth he accused the Conservatives of simply believing it is their turn and claimed that come the election the choice before people is the choice between fake phoney change from Cameron s Conservatives and real change the Liberal Democrats offer br br br Parliamentary expenses br br Clegg became the first party leader in modern political history to call for a Speaker of the House of Commons to resign describing then Speaker Michael Martin following his handling of the expenses scandal as a defender of the status quo and an obstacle to the reform of Parliament br In response to revelations about MPs expenses Clegg set out his plans for reform of Parliament in The Guardian Speaking about the plans he said let us bar the gates of Westminster and stop MPs leaving for their summer holidays until this crisis has been sorted out and every nook and cranny of our political system has been reformed He argued for the reinvention of British politics within days calling for a commitment to accept the Kelly expenses report in full the power to recall members suspended for misconduct House of Lords reform reform of party funding fixed term parliaments enabling legislation for a referendum on AV and changes to House of Commons procedure to reduce executive power br Shortly ahead of the election Clegg was asked about his own expenses by Andrew Neil of the BBC Clegg allegedly claimed the full amount permissible under the Additional Cost Allowance including claims for food gardening and redecorating his second home The Telegraph also said Clegg claimed for international call charges a claim he said he would repay br br br Perspective br Clegg aimed to modernise the Liberal Democrat Party at the same time as maintaining its traditions of political and philosophical liberalism In he told a party conference that the Liberal Democrats were radical centrist in orientation Our opponents try to divide us with their outdated labels of left and right But we are not on the left and we are not on the right We have our own label Liberal We are liberals and we own the freehold to the centre ground of British politics Our politics is the politics of the radical centre br br br Policies br When he became leader of the Liberal Democrats Clegg called for more choice for patients on waiting lists in the National Health Service NHS giving them the option to go private and to be funded by the NHS if they wish a substantial tax cut to put more money back into the pockets of people better action on the environment the abandonment of Britain s Trident missile defence system fixed term parliaments devolving more power to local councils giving constituents the power to force a by election if their MP was found responsible for serious wrongdoing and a slimming of government across the board Clegg campaigned to cut spending on defence projects such as Eurofighter as well as the UK Trident programme As regards public spending at the party s conference in Bournemouth Clegg argued for savage spending cuts and said politicians need to treat voters like grown ups whilst accusing the Labour and Conservative parties of indulging in childish games over the c word br br br Gurkha campaign br On April the Liberal Democrats proposed in the House of Commons to offer all Gurkhas an equal right of residence the motion resulted in a defeat for the Government by votes to It was the only first day motion defeat for a government since On speaking about the result Clegg said this is an immense victory for the rights of Gurkhas who have been waiting so long for justice a victory for Parliament a victory for decency He added that it was the kind of thing people want this country to do br On May the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith announced that all Gurkha veterans who retired before with at least four years service could settle in the UK The actress and daughter of Gurkha corps Major James Lumley Joanna Lumley who had highlighted the treatment of the Gurkhas and campaigned for their rights commented This is the welcome we have always longed to give br br br Deputy Prime Minister br br The morning after the general election presented the country with no single political party able to form a government that would command a majority in the House of Commons In light of this reality Cameron went public and gave a big open and comprehensive offer to the Liberal Democrats leader and said that he wanted to open up negotiations with them to form Britain s first coalition government since Winston Churchill s war ministry during the Second World War In reply Clegg said that he had always maintained that the party with the most seats and the most votes should have the right to seek to govern Clegg as Deputy Prime Minister took Prime Minister s Questions PMQs when Cameron was unavailable br Following the announcement teams of negotiators from both parties formulated what would become the Coalition Agreement which would form the basis of their partnership together Gordon Brown s resignation on May meant that Cameron was invited by the Queen to form a government and a coalition with the Liberal Democrats was agreed with Clegg as the Deputy Prime Minister and Lord President of the Council He was also made Minister for Constitutional and Political Reform which was a key point for the Liberal Democrats during the creation of the coalition Of the Liberal Democrat MPs only two Charles Kennedy and John Leech refused to support the Conservative Coalition agreement br br On July Clegg unveiled plans to have fewer MPs and to hold a referendum on the voting system so that the next general election would be contested under the Alternative Vote system The Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill if successful would see the date of the referendum set for May The bill also introduced plans to reduce the number of MP s in the House of Commons from to something the Labour party attacked as gerrymandering as to do this there would need to be boundary changes The referendum on AV was to ask voters if they wish to adopt the alternative vote system instead of the current first past the post system for electing MPs The question required a yes or no answer The result of the referendum was that the alternative vote proposal was defeated by a margin of br br Clegg also confirmed that the government planned to introduce legislation for five year fixed term parliaments with elections to be held on the first Thursday in May of the fifth year after the previous general election starting with May The corresponding bill was presented to parliament on July and the Fixed term Parliaments Act received Royal Assent on September br On July Clegg became the first Liberal Democrat leader to answer for Prime minister s questions He courted controversy during the exchange when at the despatch box he attacked Shadow Secretary of State for Justice and Shadow Lord Chancellor Jack Straw for the decision to invade Iraq saying perhaps one day you could account for your role in the most disastrous decision of all which is the illegal invasion of Iraq Despite having long held views about the issue the comment was controversial as it did not reflect the policy of the government which was that the legality of the war in Iraq was currently being studied by the Iraq inquiry br The issue of student financing had been considered one of the flagship policies of the Liberal Democrats with all of the party s MPs including Clegg signing the Vote for Students pledge to oppose any increase in student tuition fees prior to the general election As part of the coalition agreement the Lib Dems abandoned their pledge to oppose any increase in tuition fees but gained permission to abstain on any vote relating to the increase of tuition fees Clegg wrote to his MPs saying that he had struggled endlessly with the issue and said that departing from the pledge he had made prior to the election would be one of the most difficult decisions of my political career Defending recommendations of the Browne Review Clegg said that poorer students would pay less since the income level at which students needed to earn before beginning to pay off their student loan would rise from to On September Clegg apologised not for breaking his pledge but for having made a promise we weren t absolutely sure we could deliver The apology was parodied in a song br br On October Clegg delivered a speech at a school in Chesterfield at which he announced the government s intention to spend billion on a fairness premium designed to see extra support going to the poorest pupils over the course of the parliament The package announced would provide hours a week free nursery education for the poorest two year olds and a pupil premium which would be given to schools to help those pupils eligible for free school meals worth billion a year On October the plans for the fairness premium were introduced by the Treasury as part of the spending review which said that the money would be introduced over the period of the review which will support the poorest in the early years and at every stage of their education br In June Clegg proposed that more than million people would be handed shares in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group under the people s bank plan The plan proposes that ordinary voters would be able to profit from any increase in the value of their shares once the Treasury has recouped taxpayers money used for the bail out an offer that could eventually be worth up to to householders Clegg said that it was psychologically immensely important for people to be given a stake in the banks in the wake of the financial crisis br br In August after reform of the House of Lords was abandoned Clegg said the Conservatives had defied the Coalition agreement by trying to pick and choose which items of Government policy they support Clegg also revealed the Conservatives rejected his suggestion of a last ditch compromise to save both policies In September Clegg formally announced that he was regrettably withdrawing proposals to reform the Lords in the face of overwhelming opposition from Conservative MPs He signalled he would exact his revenge by refusing to sack any Liberal Democrat minister who voted against changes to MPs boundaries which is Government policy in retaliation over the Lords reform d b cle Traditionally party leaders are offered peerages when they leave the House of Commons When asked in the House of Commons if he would take a seat in the Lords he said No adding I personally will not take a seat in an unreformed House of Lords It just sticks in the throat br br br Opposition br Clegg retained his Sheffield Hallam seat in the election despite a strong campaign from Labour with a swing in the vote Clegg supported the Britain Stronger in Europe
