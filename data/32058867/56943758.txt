id: 56943758
In the s personal data belonging to millions of Facebook users was collected without their consent by British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica predominantly to be used for political advertising br The data was collected through an app called This Is Your Digital Life developed by data scientist Aleksandr Kogan and his company Global Science Research in The app consisted of a series of questions to build psychological profiles on users and collected the personal data of the users Facebook friends via Facebook s Open Graph platform The app harvested the data of up to million Facebook profiles Cambridge Analytica used the data to analytical assist the presidential campaigns of Ted Cruz and Donald Trump Cambridge Analytica was also widely accused of interfering with the Brexit referendum although the official investigation recognised that the company was not involved beyond some initial enquiries and that no significant breaches took place br In interviews with The Guardian and The New York Times information about the data misuse was disclosed in by Christopher Wylie a former Cambridge Analytica employee In response Facebook apologized for their role in the data harvesting and their CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in front of Congress In July it was announced that Facebook was to be fined billion by the Federal Trade Commission due to its privacy violations In October Facebook agreed to pay a fine to the UK Information Commissioner s Office for exposing the data of its users to a serious risk of harm In May Cambridge Analytica filed for Chapter bankruptcy br Other advertising agencies have been implementing various forms of psychological targeting for years and Facebook had patented a similar technology in Nevertheless Cambridge Analytica s methods and their high profile clients including the Trump presidential campaign and the UK s Leave EU campaign brought the problems of psychological targeting that scholars have been warning against to public awareness The scandal sparked an increased public interest in privacy and social media s influence on politics The online movement DeleteFacebook trended on Twitter br br br Overview br Aleksandr Kogan a data scientist at the University of Cambridge was hired by Cambridge Analytica an offshoot of SCL Group to develop an app called This Is Your Digital Life sometimes stylized as thisisyourdigitallife Cambridge Analytica then arranged an informed consent process for research in which several hundred thousand Facebook users would agree to complete a survey for payment that was only for academic use However Facebook allowed this app not only to collect personal information from survey respondents but also from respondents Facebook friends In this way Cambridge Analytica acquired data from millions of Facebook users br The collection of personal data by Cambridge Analytica was first reported in December by Harry Davies a journalist for The Guardian He reported that Cambridge Analytica was working for United States Senator Ted Cruz using data harvested from millions of people s Facebook accounts without their consent Further reports followed in November by McKenzie Funk for the New York Times Sunday Review December by Hannes Grasseger and Mikael Krogerus for the Swiss publication Das Magazin later translated and published by Vice in February by Carole Cadwalladr for The Guardian starting in February and in March by Mattathias Schwartz for The Intercept According to PolitiFact in his presidential campaign Trump paid Cambridge Analytica in September October and November for data on Americans and their political preferences br Information on the data breach came to a head in March with the emergence of a whistleblower an ex Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie He had been an anonymous source for an article in in The Observer by Cadwalladr headlined The Great British Brexit Robbery Cadwalladr worked with Wylie for a year to coax him to come forward as a whistleblower She later brought in Channel News in the UK and The New York Times due to legal threats against The Guardian and The Observer by Cambridge Analytica Kogan s name change to Aleksandr Spectre which resulted in the ominous Dr Spectre added to the intrigue and popular appeal of the story br The Guardian and The New York Times published articles simultaneously on March More than billion was knocked off Facebook s market capitalization in days and politicians in the US and UK demanded answers from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg The negative public response to the media coverage eventually led to him agreeing to testify in front of the United States Congress Meghan McCain drew an equivalence between the use of data by Cambridge Analytica and Barack Obama s presidential campaign PolitiFact however alleged that this data was not used in an unethical way since Obama s campaign used this data to have their supporters contact their most persuadable friends rather than using this data for highly targeted digital ads on websites such as Facebook br br br Data characteristics br br br Numbers br Wired The New York Times and The Observer reported that the data set had included information on million Facebook users While Cambridge Analytica claimed it had only collected million Facebook user profiles Facebook later confirmed that it actually had data on potentially over million users with million of those people from the United States Facebook estimated that California was the most affected U S state with million impacted users followed by Texas with million and Florida with million Data was collected on at least million users while only people downloaded the app br br br Information br Facebook sent a message to those users believed to be affected saying the information likely included one s public profile page likes birthday and current city Some of the app s users gave the app permission to access their News Feed timeline and messages The data was detailed enough for Cambridge Analytica to create psychographic profiles of the subjects of the data The data also included the locations of each person For a given political campaign each profile s information suggested what type of advertisement would be most effective to persuade a particular person in a particular location for some political event br br br Data use br br br Ted Cruz campaign br br In American senator Ted Cruz hired Cambridge Analytica to aid his presidential campaign The Federal Election Commission reported that Cruz paid the company million in services Although Cambridge Analytica was not well known at the time this is when it started to create individual psychographic profiles This data was then used to create tailored advertisements for each person to sway them into voting for Cruz br br br Donald Trump campaign br br Donald Trump s presidential campaign used the harvested data to build psychographic profiles determining users personality traits based on their Facebook activity The campaign team used this information as a micro targeting technique displaying customized messages about Trump to different US voters on various digital platforms Ads were segmented into different categories mainly based on whether individuals were Trump supporters or potential swing votes As described by Cambridge Analytica s CEO the key was to identify those who might be enticed to vote for their client or be discouraged to vote for their opponent Supporters of Trump received triumphant visuals of him as well as information regarding polling stations Swing voters were instead often shown images of Trump s more notable supporters and negative graphics or ideas about his opponent Hillary Clinton For example the collected data was specifically used by Make America Number Super PAC to attack Clinton through constructed advertisements that accused Clinton of corruption as a way of propping up Trump as a better candidate for the presidency br However a former Cambridge Analytica employee Brittany Kaiser was asked Is it absolutely proven that the Trump campaign relied on the data that had been illicitly obtained from Facebook She responded It has not been proven because the difficult thing about proving a situation like that is that you need to do a forensic analysis of the database br br br Alleged usage br br br Russia br In the Parliament of the United Kingdom questioned SCL Group director Alexander Nix in a hearing about Cambridge Analytica s connections with Russian oil company Lukoil Nix stated he had no connections to the two companies despite concerns that the oil company was interested in how the company s data was used to target American voters Cambridge Analytica had become a point of focus in politics since its involvement in Trump s campaign at this point Democratic officials made it a point of emphasis for improved investigation over concerns of Russian ties with Cambridge Analytica It was later confirmed by Christopher Wylie that Lukoil was interested in the company s data regarding political targeting br br br Brexit br Cambridge Analytica was allegedly hired as a consultant company for Leave EU and the UK Independence Party during as an effort to convince people to support Brexit These rumors were the result of the leaked internal emails that were shared with the British parliament Brittany Kaiser declared that the datasets that Leave EU used to create databases were provided by Cambridge Analytica These datasets composed of the data obtained from Facebook were said to be work done as an initial job deliverable for them Although Arron Banks co founder of Leave EU denied any involvement with the company he later declared When we said we d hired Cambridge Analytica maybe a better choice of words could have been deployed The official investigation by the UK Information Commissioner found that Cambridge Analytica was not involved beyond some initial enquiries and the regulator did not identify any significant breaches of data protection legislation or privacy or marketing regulations which met the threshold for formal regulatory action br br br Responses br br br Facebook and other companies br br Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg first apologized for the situation with Cambridge Analytica on CNN calling it an issue a mistake and a breach of trust He explained that he was responding to the Facebook community s concerns and that the company s initial focus on data portability had shifted to locking down data he also reminded the platform s users of their right of access to personal data Other Facebook officials argued against calling it a data breach arguing those who took the personality quiz originally consented to give away their information Zuckerberg pledged to make changes and reforms in Facebook policy to prevent similar breaches On March Zuckerberg published a personal letter in various newspapers apologizing on behalf of Facebook In April Facebook decided to implement the EU s General Data Protection Regulation in all areas of operation and not just the EU br In April Facebook established Social Science One as a response to the event On April Facebook released their first earnings report since the scandal was reported Revenue fell since the last quarter but this is usual as it followed the holiday season quote The quarter revenue was the highest for a first quarter and the second overall br Amazon said that they suspended Cambridge Analytica from using their Amazon Web Services when they learned in that their service was collecting personal information The Italian banking company UniCredit stopped advertising and marketing on Facebook in August br br br Governmental actions br The governments of India and Brazil demanded that Cambridge Analytica report how anyone used data from the breach in political campaigning and various regional governments in the United States have lawsuits in their court systems from citizens affected by the data breach br In early July the United Kingdom s Information Commissioner s Office announced it intended to fine Facebook over the data breach this being the maximum fine allowed at the time of the breach saying Facebook contravened the law by failing to safeguard people s information br In March a court filing by the U S Attorney General for the District of Columbia alleged that Facebook knew of Cambridge Analytica s improper data gathering practices months before they were first publicly reported in December br In July the Federal Trade Commission FTC voted to approve fining Facebook billion to finally settle the investigation into the data breach The record breaking settlement was one of the largest penalties ever assessed by the U S government for any violation In the ruling the FTC cited Facebook s continued violations of FTC privacy orders from which included sharing users data with apps used by their friends facial recognition being enabled by default and Facebook s use of user phone numbers for advertising purposes As a result Facebook was made subject to a new year settlement order br In July the FTC sued Cambridge Analytica s CEO Alexander Nix and GSRApp developer Aleksandr Kogan Both defendants agreed to administrative orders that restrict their future business dealings and to destroy both any collected personal data and any work product made from the data The GSRApp collected information initially on up to GSRApp users then harvested data on up to million Facebook friends Cambridge Analytica declared bankruptcy br Again in July Facebook has agreed to pay million to settle with the U S Securities and Exchange Commission for misleading investors about the risks it faced from misuse of user data The SEC s complaint alleged that Facebook did not correct its existing disclosure for more than two years despite discovering the misuse of its users information in br br br Impact on Facebook users and investors br Since April the first full month since the breaking of the Cambridge Analytica data breach the number of likes posts and shares on the site had decreased by almost and has decreased ever since with the aforementioned activity only momentarily increasing during the summer and during the US midterm elections Despite this user growth of the site has risen in the period since increased media coverage increasing by during the final quarter of br On March a little after a week after the story was initially published Facebook stock fell by about equivalent to billion By May Wall Street reported that the company recovered their losses br br br DeleteFacebook movement br br The public reacted to the data privacy breach by initiating the campaign DeleteFacebook with the aim of starting a movement to boycott Facebook The co founder of WhatsApp which is owned by Facebook joined in on the movement by declaring it was time to delete the platform The hashtag was tweeted almost times on Twitter within a day period after news of the data breach of the mentions of the hashtag actually appeared on Twitter making it the main social media platform used to share the hashtag However a survey by investment firm Raymond James found that although approximately of Facebook users were concerned about how the app used their data about of those surveyed claimed they wouldn t actually cut back on their usage of the social media network Additionally in Mark Zuckerberg commented that he didn t think the company had seen a meaningful number of people act on deleting Facebook br An additional campaign and hashtag OwnYourData was coined by Brittany Kaiser The hashtag was created by Kaiser as a Facebook campaign that pushed for increased transparency on the platform OwnYourData was also used in Kaiser s petition for Facebook to alter their policies and give users increased power and control over their data which she refers to as users assets and property In addition to the hashtag Kaiser also created the Own Your Data Foundation to promote increased digital intelligence education br br br The Great Hack br The Facebook Cambridge Analytica data scandal also received media coverage in the form of a Netflix documentary The Great Hack This is the first feature length media piece that ties together the various elements of the scandal through a narrative The documentary provides information on the background information and events related to Cambridge Analytica Facebook and the election that resulted in the overall data scandal The Great Hack communicates the experiences and personal journeys of multiple individuals that were involved in the event in different ways and through different relationships These individuals include David Carroll Brittany Kaiser and more David Carroll is a New York professor in the field of media that attempted to navigate the legal system in order to discover what data Cambridge Analytica had in possession about him Meanwhile Brittany Kaiser is a former Cambridge Analytica employee that ultimately became a whistleblower for the data scandal br br br Witness and expert testimony br The United States Senate Judiciary Committee called witnesses to testify about the data breach and general data privacy They held two hearings one focusing on Facebook s role in the breach and privacy on social media and the other on Cambridge Analytica s role and its impact in data privacy The former was held on April where Mark Zuckerberg testified and Senator Chuck Grassley and Senator Dianne Feinstein gave statements The latter occurred on May where Professor Eitan Hersh Dr Mark Jamison and Christopher Wylie testified while Senators Grassley and Feinstein again made statements br br br Mark Zuckerberg br During his testimony before Congress on April Zuckerberg said it was his personal mistake that he did not do enough to prevent Facebook from being used for harm That goes for fake news foreign interference in elections and hate speech During the testimony Mark Zuckerberg publicly apologized for the breach of private data It was my mistake and I m sorry I started Facebook I run it and I m responsible for what happens here br Zuckerberg said that in Aleksandr Kogan had created a personality quiz app which was installed by people The app was then able to retrieve Facebook information including that of the users friends and this was obtained by Kogan It was not until that Zuckerberg learned that these users information was shared by Kogan with Cambridge Analytica Cambridge Analytica was subsequently asked to remove all the data It was later discovered by The Guardian The New York Times and Channel that the data had in fact not been deleted br br br Eitan Hersh br In Professor Eitan Hersh published Hacking the Electorate How Campaigns Perceive Voters which analyzed the databases used for campaigns between and On May Eitan Hersh a professor of political science at Tufts University testified before Congress as an expert on voter targeting br Hersh claimed that the voter targeting by Cambridge Analytica did not excessively affect the outcome of the election because the techniques used by Cambridge Analytica were similar to those of presidential campaigns well before Further he claimed that the correlation between user likes and personality traits were weak and thus the psychological profiling of users were also weak br br br Mark Jamison br Dr Mark Jamison the director and Gunter Professor of the Public Utility Research Center at the University of Florida testified before Congress on May as an expert Jamison reiterated that it was not unusual for presidential campaigns to use data like Facebook s data to profile voters Presidents Barack Obama and George W Bush also used models to micro target voters Jamison criticized Facebook for not being clear and candid with its users because the users were not aware of the extent that their data would be used Jamison finished his testimony by saying that if the federal government were to regulate voter targeting to happen on sites like Facebook it would harm the users of those sites because it would be too restrictive of those sites and would make things worse for regulators br br br Christopher Wylie br br On May Christopher Wylie who is considered the whistleblower on Cambridge Analytica and also served as Cambridge Analytica s Director of Research in and also testified to the United States Senate Judiciary Committee He was considered a witness to both British and American authorities and he claims he decided to whistle blow to protect democratic institutions from rogue actors and hostile foreign interference as well as ensure the safety of Americans online He claimed that at Cambridge Analytica anything goes and that Cambridge Analytica was a corrupting force in the world He detailed to Congress how Cambridge Analytica used Facebook s data to categorize people into groups based on political ideology He also claimed that Eitan Hersh contradicted copious amounts of peer reviewed literature in top scientific journals including the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Psychological Science and Journal of Personality and Individual Differences by saying that Facebook s categorizing of people were weak br Christopher Wylie also testified about Russian contact with Cambridge Analytica and the campaign voter disengagement and his thoughts on Facebook s response br br br Aftermath br br Following the downfall of Cambridge Analytica a number of related companies have been established by people formerly affiliated with Cambridge Analytica including Emerdata Limited and Auspex International At first Julian Wheatland the former CEO of Cambridge Analytica and former director of many SCL connected firms stated that they did not plan on reestablishing the two companies Instead the directors and owners of Cambridge and its London based parent SCL group strategically positioned themselves to be acquired in the face of bankruptcy procedures and lawsuits While employees of both companies dispersed to successor firms Cambridge and SCL were acquired by Emerdata Limited a data processing company Wheatland responded to news of this story and emphasized that Emerdata would not inherit SCL companies existing data or assets and that this information belongs to the administrators in charge of the SCL companies bankruptcy David Carroll an American professor who sued Cambridge stated that Emerdata was aiming to conceal the scandals and minimize further criticism Carroll s lawyers argued that Cambridge s court administrators were acting unlawfully by liquidating the company s assets prior to a full investigation being performed While these administrators subjected SCL Group to criminal injury and a fine a U K court denied Carroll s lawsuit allowing SCL to disintegrate without turning over his data br In October following Facebook employee Frances Haugen whistleblowing Facebook activities NPR revisited the Cambridge Analytica data scandal by observing that Facebook neither took responsibility for their behavior there nor did consumers get any benefit of reform as a result In August Facebook agreed to settle a lawsuit seeking damages in the case for an undisclosed sum In December Meta Platforms agreed to pay million to settle a private class action lawsuit related to the improper user data sharing with Cambridge Analytica and other third party companies br br br See also br br AggregateIQ br BeLeave br The Great
