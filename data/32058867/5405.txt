China officially the People s Republic of China PRC is a country in East Asia With a population exceeding billion it is the world s second most populous country after India representing of the world population China spans the equivalent of five time zones and borders fourteen countries by land With an area of nearly million square kilometers sq mi it is the third largest country by total land area The country is divided into province level divisions provinces five autonomous regions four municipalities and two semi autonomous special administrative regions Beijing is the country s capital while Shanghai is its most populous city by urban area and largest financial center br China is considered one of the cradles of civilization the first human inhabitants in the region arrived during the Paleolithic by the late second millennium BCE the earliest dynastic states had emerged in the Yellow River basin The eighth to third centuries BCE saw a breakdown in the authority of the Zhou dynasty accompanied by the emergence of administrative and military techniques literature philosophy and historiography In BCE China was unified under an emperor for the first time Appointed non hereditary officials began ruling counties instead of the aristocracy ushering in more than two millennia of imperial dynasties including the Qin Han Tang Yuan Ming and Qing With the invention of gunpowder and paper the establishment of the Silk Road and the building of the Great Wall Chinese culture including languages traditions architecture philosophy and technology flourished and has heavily influenced both its neighbors and lands further afield However China began to cede parts of the country in the late th century to various European powers by a series of unequal treaties br After decades of struggle the Revolution resulted in the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the Republic of China ROC the following year The country under the nascent Beiyang government was unstable and ultimately fragmented during the Warlord Era which was ended upon the Northern Expedition conducted by the Kuomintang KMT to reunify the country The Chinese Civil War began in when KMT forces purged members of the rival Chinese Communist Party CCP who proceeded to engage in sporadic fighting against the KMT led Nationalist government Following the country s invasion by the Empire of Japan in the KMT and CCP temporarily agreed to a truce in favor of a united front against the Japanese The Second Sino Japanese War eventually ended in a Chinese victory however atrocities such as the Nanjing Massacre had a lasting impact on the country The end of war with Japan in was quickly followed by a resumption of hostilities between the KMT and CCP In the resurgent Communists established control over most of the country proclaiming the People s Republic of China and forcing the Nationalist government to retreat to the island of Taiwan The country was split with both sides claiming to be the sole legitimate government of China Following the implementation of land reforms further attempts by the PRC to realize communism failed the Great Leap Forward was largely responsible for the Great Chinese Famine that ended with millions of Chinese people having died and the subsequent Cultural Revolution was a period of social turmoil and persecution characterized by Maoist populism Following the Sino Soviet split the Shanghai Communiqu in would precipitate the normalization of relations with the United States Economic reforms that began in led by reformists within the CCP moved the country away from a socialist planned economy towards an increasingly capitalist market economy spurring significant economic growth The corresponding movement for increased democracy and liberalization stalled after the Tiananmen Square protests and massacre in br China is a unitary one party socialist republic led by the CCP It is one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council the UN representative for China was changed from the ROC to the PRC in It is a founding member of several multilateral and regional organizations such as the AIIB the Silk Road Fund the New Development Bank and the RCEP It is a member of the BRICS the G APEC the SCO and the East Asia Summit Making up around one fifth of the world economy the Chinese economy is the world s largest economy by GDP at purchasing power parity the second largest economy by nominal GDP and the second wealthiest country albeit ranking poorly in measures of democracy human rights and religious freedom The country has been one of the fastest growing major economies and is the world s largest manufacturer and exporter as well as the second largest importer China is a nuclear weapon state with the world s largest standing army by military personnel and the second largest defense budget It is a great power and a regional power and has been described as an emerging superpower China is known for its cuisine and culture and has UNESCO World Heritage Sites the second highest number of any country br br br Etymology br br The word China has been used in English since the th century however it was not used by the Chinese themselves during this period Its origin has been traced through Portuguese Malay and Persian back to the Sanskrit word C na used in ancient India China appears in Richard Eden s translation of the journal of the Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa Barbosa s usage was derived from Persian Ch n which in turn derived from Sanskrit C na C na was first used in early Hindu scripture including the Mahabharata th century BCE and the Laws of Manu nd century BCE In Martino Martini suggested that the word China is derived ultimately from the name of the Qin dynasty BCE Although use in Indian sources precedes this dynasty this derivation is still given in various sources The origin of the Sanskrit word is a matter of debate Alternative suggestions include the names for Yelang and the Jing or Chu state br The official name of the modern state is the People s Republic of China simplified Chinese traditional Chinese pinyin Zh nghu r nm n g ngh gu The shorter form is China Zh nggu from zh ng central and gu state a term which developed under the Western Zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne It was used in official documents as an synonym for the state under the Qing The name Zhongguo is also translated as Middle Kingdom in English China is sometimes referred to as mainland China or the Mainland when distinguishing it from the Republic of China and or the PRC s Special Administrative Regions br br br History br br br Prehistory br br Archaeological evidence suggests that early hominids inhabited China million years ago The hominid fossils of Peking Man a Homo erectus who used fire have been dated to between and years ago The fossilized teeth of Homo sapiens dated to years ago have been discovered in Fuyan Cave Chinese proto writing existed in Jiahu around BCE at Damaidi around BCE Dadiwan from to BCE and Banpo dating from the th millennium BCE Some scholars have suggested that the Jiahu symbols th millennium BCE constituted the earliest Chinese writing system br br br Early dynastic rule br br According to traditional Chinese historiography the Xia dynasty was established during the late third millennium BC marking the beginning of the dynastic cycle that was understood to underpin China s entire political history In the modern era the Xia s historicity came under increasing scrutiny in part due to the earliest known attestation of the Xia being written millennia after the date given for their collapse In archaeologists discovered sites belonging to the Erlitou culture that existed during the early Bronze Age they have since been characterized as the remains of the historical Xia but this conception is often rejected The Shang dynasty that traditionally succeeded the Xia is the earliest for which there are both contemporary written records and undisputed archaeological evidence The Shang ruled much of the Yellow River valley until the th century BCE with the earliest hard evidence dating to c BCE The oracle bone script attested from c BCE but generally assumed to be considerably older represents the oldest known form of written Chinese and is the direct ancestor of modern Chinese characters br The Shang were overthrown by the Zhou who ruled between the th and th centuries BCE though the centralized authority of Son of Heaven was slowly eroded by fengjian lords Some principalities eventually emerged from the weakened Zhou and continually waged war with each other during the year Spring and Autumn period By the time of the Warring States period of the th rd centuries BCE there were seven major powerful states left br br br Imperial China br br br Qin and Han br br The Warring States period ended in BCE after the state of Qin conquered the other six states reunited China and established the dominant order of autocracy King Zheng of Qin proclaimed himself the Emperor of the Qin dynasty becoming the first emperor of a unified China He enacted Qin s legalist reforms notably the standardization of Chinese characters measurements road widths and currency His dynasty also conquered the Yue tribes in Guangxi Guangdong and Northern Vietnam The Qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years falling soon after the First Emperor s death br Following widespread revolts during which the imperial library was burned the Han dynasty emerged to rule China between BCE and CE creating a cultural identity among its populace still remembered in the ethnonym of the modern Han Chinese The Han expanded the empire s territory considerably with military campaigns reaching Central Asia Mongolia Korea and Yunnan and the recovery of Guangdong and northern Vietnam from Nanyue Han involvement in Central Asia and Sogdia helped establish the land route of the Silk Road replacing the earlier path over the Himalayas to India Han China gradually became the largest economy of the ancient world Despite the Han s initial decentralization and the official abandonment of the Qin philosophy of Legalism in favor of Confucianism Qin s legalist institutions and policies continued to be employed by the Han government and its successors br br br Three Kingdoms Jin Northern and Southern dynasties br After the end of the Han dynasty a period of strife known as Three Kingdoms followed at the end of which Wei was swiftly overthrown by the Jin dynasty The Jin fell to civil war upon the ascension of a developmentally disabled emperor the Five Barbarians then rebelled and ruled northern China as the Sixteen States The Xianbei unified them as the Northern Wei whose Emperor Xiaowen reversed his predecessors apartheid policies and enforced a drastic sinification on his subjects In the south the general Liu Yu secured the abdication of the Jin in favor of the Liu Song The various successors of these states became known as the Northern and Southern dynasties with the two areas finally reunited by the Sui in br br br Sui Tang and Song br The Sui restored the Han to power through China reformed its agriculture economy and imperial examination system constructed the Grand Canal and patronized Buddhism However they fell quickly when their conscription for public works and a failed war in northern Korea provoked widespread unrest br Under the succeeding Tang and Song dynasties Chinese economy technology and culture entered a golden age The Tang dynasty retained control of the Western Regions and the Silk Road which brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa and made the capital Chang an a cosmopolitan urban center However it was devastated and weakened by the An Lushan rebellion in the th century In the Tang disintegrated completely when the local military governors became ungovernable The Song dynasty ended the separatist situation in leading to a balance of power between the Song and the Liao dynasty The Song was the first government in world history to issue paper money and the first Chinese polity to establish a permanent navy which was supported by the developed shipbuilding industry along with the sea trade br Between the th and th century CE the population of China doubled to around million people mostly because of the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern China and the production of abundant food surpluses The Song dynasty also saw a revival of Confucianism in response to the growth of Buddhism during the Tang and a flourishing of philosophy and the arts as landscape art and porcelain were brought to new levels of complexity However the military weakness of the Song army was observed by the Jin dynasty In Emperor Huizong of Song and the capital Bianjing were captured during the Jin Song wars The remnants of the Song retreated to southern China br br br Yuan br br The Mongol conquest of China began in with the campaigns against Western Xia by Genghis Khan who also invaded Jin territories In the Mongol leader Kublai Khan established the Yuan dynasty which conquered the last remnant of the Song dynasty in Before the Mongol invasion the population of Song China was million citizens this was reduced to million by the time of the census in A peasant named Zhu Yuanzhang overthrew the Yuan in and founded the Ming dynasty as the Hongwu Emperor Under the Ming dynasty China enjoyed another golden age developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture It was during this period that admiral Zheng He led the Ming treasure voyages throughout the Indian Ocean reaching as far as East Africa br br br Ming br In the early Ming dynasty China s capital was moved from Nanjing to Beijing With the budding of capitalism philosophers such as Wang Yangming critiqued and expanded Neo Confucianism with concepts of individualism and equality of four occupations The scholar official stratum became a supporting force of industry and commerce in the tax boycott movements which together with the famines and defense against Japanese invasions of Korea and Later Jin incursions led to an exhausted treasury In Beijing was captured by a coalition of peasant rebel forces led by Li Zicheng The Chongzhen Emperor committed suicide when the city fell The Manchu Qing dynasty then allied with Ming dynasty general Wu Sangui overthrew Li s short lived Shun dynasty and subsequently seized control of Beijing which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty br br br Qing br br The Qing dynasty which lasted from until was the last imperial dynasty of China The Ming Qing transition cost million lives but the Qing appeared to have restored China s imperial power and inaugurated another flowering of the arts After the Southern Ming ended the further conquest of the Dzungar Khanate added Mongolia Tibet and Xinjiang to the empire Meanwhile China s population growth resumed and shortly began to accelerate It is commonly agreed that pre modern China s population experienced two growth spurts one during the Northern Song period and other during the Qing period around By the High Qing era China was possibly the most commercialized country in the world and imperial China experienced a second commercial revolution by the end of the th century On the other hand the centralized autocracy was strengthened in part to suppress anti Qing sentiment with the policy of valuing agriculture and restraining commerce like the Haijin during the early Qing period and ideological control as represented by the literary inquisition causing some social and technological stagnation br br br Fall of the Qing dynasty br br In the mid th century the Opium Wars with Britain and France forced China to pay compensation open treaty ports allow extraterritoriality for foreign nationals and cede Hong Kong to the British under the Treaty of Nanking the first of what have been termed as the unequal treaties The First Sino Japanese War resulted in Qing China s loss of influence in the Korean Peninsula as well as the cession of Taiwan to Japan The Qing dynasty also began experiencing internal unrest in which tens of millions of people died especially in the White Lotus Rebellion the failed Taiping Rebellion that ravaged southern China in the s and s and the Dungan Revolt in the northwest The initial success of the Self Strengthening Movement of the s was frustrated by a series of military defeats in the s and s br In the th century the great Chinese diaspora began Losses due to emigration were added to by conflicts and catastrophes such as the Northern Chinese Famine of in which between and million people died The Guangxu Emperor drafted a reform plan in to establish a modern constitutional monarchy but these plans were thwarted by the Empress Dowager Cixi The ill fated anti foreign Boxer Rebellion of further weakened the dynasty Although Cixi sponsored a program of reforms known as the late Qing reforms the Xinhai Revolution of ended the Qing dynasty and established the Republic of China Puyi the last Emperor abdicated in br br br Establishment of the Republic and World War II br br On January the Republic of China was established and Sun Yat sen of the Kuomintang KMT was proclaimed provisional president In March the presidency was given to Yuan Shikai a former Qing general who in proclaimed himself Emperor of China In the face of popular condemnation and opposition from his own Beiyang Army he was forced to abdicate and re establish the republic in After Yuan Shikai s death in China was politically fragmented Its Beijing based government was internationally recognized but virtually powerless regional warlords controlled most of its territory During this period China participated in World War I and saw a far reaching popular uprising the May Fourth Movement br br In the late s the Kuomintang under Chiang Kai shek was able to reunify the country under its own control with a series of deft military and political maneuverings known collectively as the Northern Expedition The Kuomintang moved the nation s capital to Nanjing and implemented political tutelage an intermediate stage of political development outlined in Sun Yat sen s Three Principles of the People program for transforming China into a modern democratic state The Kuomintang briefly allied with the Chinese Communist Party CCP during the Northern Expedition though the alliance broke down in after Chiang violently suppressed the CCP and other leftists Shanghai marking the beginning of the Chinese Civil War The CCP declared areas of the country as the Chinese Soviet Republic Jiangxi Soviet in November in Ruijin Jiangxi The Jiangxi Soviet was wiped out by the KMT armies in leading the CCP to initiate the Long March and relocate to Yan an in Shaanxi It would be the base of the communists before major combat in the Chinese Civil War ended in br In Japan invaded and occupied Manchuria Japan invaded other parts of China in precipitating the Second Sino Japanese War a theater of World War II The war forced an uneasy alliance between the Kuomintang and the CCP Japanese forces committed numerous war atrocities against the civilian population as many as million Chinese civilians died An estimated to Chinese were massacred in Nanjing alone during the Japanese occupation China along with the UK the United States and the Soviet Union were recognized as the Allied Big Four in the Declaration by United Nations Along with the other three great powers China was one of the four major Allies of World War II and was later considered one of the primary victors in the war After the surrender of Japan in Taiwan including the Penghu was handed over to Chinese control however the validity of this handover is controversial br br br People s Republic br br China emerged victorious but war ravaged and financially drained The continued distrust between the Kuomintang and the Communists led to the resumption of civil war Constitutional rule was established in but because of the ongoing unrest many provisions of the ROC constitution were never implemented in mainland China Afterwards the CCP took control of most of mainland China and the ROC government retreated offshore to Taiwan br On October CCP Chairman Mao Zedong formally proclaimed the People s Republic of China in Tiananmen Square Beijing In the PRC captured Hainan from the ROC and annexed Tibet However remaining Kuomintang forces continued to wage an insurgency in western China throughout the s The CCP consolidated its popularity among the peasants through the Land Reform Movement which included the state tolerated executions of between and million landlords by peasants and former tenants Though the PRC initially allied closely with the Soviet Union the relations between the two communist nations gradually deteriorated leading China to develop an independent industrial system and its own nuclear weapons br The Chinese population increased from million in to million in However the Great Leap Forward an idealistic massive industrialization project resulted in an estimated to million deaths between and mostly from starvation In China s first atomic bomb exploded successfully In Mao and his allies launched the Cultural Revolution sparking a decade of political recrimination and social upheaval that lasted until Mao s death in In October the PRC replaced the ROC in the United Nations and took its seat as a permanent member of the Security Council br br br Reforms and contemporary history br br After Mao s death the Gang of Four was arrested by Hua Guofeng and held responsible for the Cultural Revolution The Cultural Revolution was rebuked with millions rehabilitated Deng Xiaoping took power in and instituted large scale political and economic reforms together with the Eight Elders most senior and influential members of the party The government loosened its control and the communes were gradually disbanded Agricultural collectivization was dismantled and farmlands privatized While foreign trade became a major focus special economic zones SEZs were created Inefficient state owned enterprises SOEs were restructured and some closed This marked China s transition away from planned economy China adopted its current constitution on December br br In the country saw the protests in Tiananmen Square unfold and later saw other protests over the entire nation Zhao Ziyang was put under house arrest for his sympathies to the protests and was replaced by Jiang Zemin Jiang continued economic reforms closing many SOEs and trimming down iron rice bowl life tenure positions China s economy grew sevenfold during this time British Hong Kong and Portuguese Macau returned to China in and respectively as special administrative regions under the principle of one country two systems The country joined the World Trade Organization in On the th CCP National Congress in Hu Jintao succeeded Jiang as the general secretary Under Hu China maintained its high rate of economic growth overtaking the United Kingdom France Germany and Japan to become the world s second largest economy However the growth also severely impacted the country s resources and environment and caused major social displacement Xi Jinping succeeded Hu as paramount leader on the th CCP National Congress in Shortly after his ascension to power Xi launched a vast anti corruption crackdown that prosecuted more than million officials by During his tenure Xi consolidated power unseen since the initiation of economic and political reforms br br br Geography br br China s landscape is vast and diverse ranging from the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts in the arid north to the subtropical forests in the wetter south The Himalaya Karakoram Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges separate China from much of South and Central Asia The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers the third and sixth longest in the world respectively run from the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated eastern seaboard China s coastline along the Pacific Ocean is km mi long and is bounded by the Bohai Yellow East China and South China seas China connects through the Kazakh border to the Eurasian Steppe br The territory of China lies between latitudes and N and longitudes and E The geographical center of China is marked by the Center of the Country Monument at N E China s landscapes vary significantly across its vast territory In the east along the shores of the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea there are extensive and densely populated alluvial plains while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north broad grasslands predominate Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges while the central east hosts the deltas of China s two major rivers the Yellow River and the Yangtze River Other major rivers include the Xi Mekong Brahmaputra and Amur To the west sit major mountain ranges most notably the Himalayas High plateaus feature among the more arid landscapes of the north such as the Taklamakan and the Gobi Desert The world s highest point Mount Everest m lies on the Sino Nepalese border The country s lowest point and the world s third lowest is the dried lake bed of Ayding Lake m in the Turpan Depression br br br Climate br br China s climate is mainly dominated by dry seasons and wet monsoons which lead to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer In the winter northern winds coming from high latitude areas are cold and dry in summer southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist br A major environmental issue in China is the continued expansion of its deserts particularly the Gobi Desert Although barrier tree lines planted since the s have reduced the frequency of sandstorms prolonged drought and poor agricultural practices have resulted in dust storms plaguing northern China each spring which then spread to other parts of East Asia including Japan and Korea Water quality erosion and pollution control have become important issues in China s relations with other countries Melting glaciers in the Himalayas could potentially lead to water shortages for hundreds of millions of people According to academics in order to limit climate change in China to C F electricity generation from coal in China without carbon capture must be phased out by With current policies the GHG emissions of China will probably peak in and by they will return to levels However such pathway still leads to three degree temperature rise br Official government statistics about Chinese agricultural productivity are considered unreliable due to exaggeration of production at subsidiary government levels Much of China has a climate very suitable for agriculture and the country has been the world s largest producer of rice wheat tomatoes eggplant grapes watermelon spinach and many other crops In percent of global permanent meadows and pastures belonged to China as well as of global cropland br br br Biodiversity br br China is one of megadiverse countries lying in two of the world s major biogeographic realms the Palearctic and the Indomalayan By one measure China has over species of animals and vascular plants making it the third most biodiverse country in the world after Brazil and Colombia The country is a party to the Convention on Biological Diversity its National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan was received by the convention in br China is home to at least species of mammals the third highest in the world species of birds eighth species of reptiles seventh and species of amphibians seventh Wildlife in China shares habitat with and bears acute pressure from one of the world s largest population of humans At least animal species are threatened vulnerable or in danger of local extinction due mainly to human activity such as habitat destruction pollution and poaching for food fur and traditional Chinese medicine Endangered wildlife is protected by law and as of the country has over nature reserves covering a total area of million hectares percent of China s total land area Most wild animals have been eliminated from the core agricultural regions of east and central China but they have fared better in the mountainous south and west The Baiji was confirmed extinct on December br China has over species of vascular plants and is home to a variety of forest types Cold coniferous forests predominate in the north of the country supporting animal species such as moose and Asian black bear along with over bird species The understory of moist conifer forests may contain thickets of bamboo In higher montane stands of juniper and yew the bamboo is replaced by rhododendrons Subtropical forests which are predominate in central and southern China support a high density of plant species including numerous rare endemics Tropical and seasonal rainforests though confined to Yunnan and Hainan contain a quarter of all the animal and plant species found in China China has over recorded species of fungi br br br Environment br br In the early s China has suffered from environmental deterioration and pollution due to its rapid pace of industrialization Regulations such as the Environmental Protection Law are fairly stringent though they are poorly enforced frequently disregarded in favor of rapid economic development China has the second highest death toll because of air pollution after India with approximately million deaths Although China ranks as the highest CO emitting country it only emits tons of CO per capita significantly lower than developed countries such as the United States Australia and South Korea Greenhouse gas emissions by China are the world s largest The country has significant water pollution problems only of China s national surface water was graded suitable for human consumption by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment in br China has prioritized clamping down on pollution bringing a significant decrease in air pollution in the s In the Chinese government announced its aims for the country to reach its peak emissions levels before and achieve carbon neutrality by in line with the Paris Agreement which according to Climate Action Tracker would lower the expected rise in global temperature by degrees the biggest single reduction ever estimated by the Climate Action Tracker br China is the world s leading investor in renewable energy and its commercialization with billion invested in it is a major manufacturer of renewable energy technologies and invests heavily in local scale renewable energy projects Long heavily relying on non renewable energy sources such as coal China s adaptation of renewable energy has increased significantly in recent years with their share increasing from percent in to percent in In of China s electricity came from coal largest producer in the world from hydroelectric power largest from wind largest from solar energy largest from nuclear energy second largest from natural gas fifth largest and from bioenergy largest in total of China s energy came from renewable energy sources Despite its emphasis on renewables China remains deeply connected to global oil markets and next to India has been the largest importer of Russian crude oil in br br br Political geography br China is the third largest country in the world by land area after Russia and the third or fourth largest country in the world by total area China s total area is generally stated as being approximately km sq mi Specific area figures range from km sq mi according to the Encyclop dia Britannica to km sq mi according to the UN Demographic Yearbook and The World Factbook China has the longest combined land border in the world measuring km mi and its coastline covers approximately km mi from the mouth of the Yalu River Amnok River to the Gulf of Tonkin China borders nations and covers the bulk of East Asia bordering Vietnam Laos and Myanmar in Southeast Asia India Bhutan Nepal Pakistan and Afghanistan in South Asia Tajikistan Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan in Central Asia and Russia Mongolia and North Korea in Inner Asia and Northeast Asia It is narrowly separated from Bangladesh and Thailand to the southwest and south and has several maritime neighbors such as Japan Philippines Malaysia and Indonesia br China has resolved its land borders with out of neighboring countries having pursued substantial compromises in most of them China currently has a disputed land border with India and Bhutan China is additionally involved in maritime disputes with multiple countries over territory in the East and South China Seas such as the Senkaku Islands and the entirety of South China Sea Islands br br br Government and politics br br The People s Republic of China is a one party state governed by the Chinese Communist Party CCP which considers itself to be Marxist Leninist This makes China one of the few countries governed by a communist party The Chinese constitution states that the PRC is a socialist state governed by a people s democratic dictatorship that is led by the working class and based on an alliance of workers and peasants that the state institutions shall practice the principle of democratic centralism and that the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party br The PRC officially terms itself as a democracy using terms such as socialist consultative democracy and whole process people s democracy However the country is commonly described as an authoritarian one party state and a dictatorship with among the heaviest restrictions worldwide in many areas most notably against freedom of the press freedom of assembly free formation of social organizations freedom of religion and free access to the Internet China has consistently been ranked amongst the lowest as an authoritarian regime by the Economist Intelligence Unit s Democracy Index ranking at th out of countries in br Other sources describe the term authoritarian as potentially Eurocentric Academic Pang Laikwan writes that terming China as authoritarian does not sufficiently account for Chinese citizen s broad identification with their government s sovereignty or the multiple consultation mechanisms that exist in Chinese government br br br Chinese Communist Party br br According to the CCP constitution its highest body is the National Congress held every five years The National Congress elects the Central Committee who then elects the party s Politburo Politburo Standing Committee and the general secretary party leader the top leadership of the country The general secretary holds ultimate power and authority over state and government and serves as the informal paramount leader The current general secretary is Xi Jinping who took office on November At the local level the secretary of the CCP committee of a subdivision outranks the local government level CCP committee secretary of a provincial division outranks the governor while the CCP committee secretary of a city outranks the mayor The CCP is officially guided by Marxism adapted to Chinese circumstances br br br Government br br The government in China is under the sole control of the CCP The CCP controls appointments in government bodies with most senior government officials being CCP members br The National People s Congress NPC with nearly members is constitutionally the highest organ of state power though it has been also described as a rubber stamp body The NPC meets annually while the NPC Standing Committee around members elected from NPC delegates meets every couple of months Elections are indirect and not pluralistic with nominations at all levels being controlled by the CCP The NPC is dominated by the CCP with another eight minor parties having nominal representation under the condition of upholding CCP leadership br The president is elected by the NPC The presidency is the ceremonial state representative but not the constitutional head of state The incumbent president is Xi Jinping who is also the general secretary of the CCP and the chairman of the Central Military Commission making him China s paramount leader and supreme commander of the Armed Forces The premier is the head of government with Li Qiang being the incumbent The premier is officially nominated by the president and then elected by the NPC and has generally been either the second or third ranking member of the Politburo Standing Committee PSC The premier presides over the State Council China s cabinet composed of four vice premiers state councilors and the heads of ministries and commissions The Chinese People s Political Consultative Conference CPPCC is a political advisory body that is critical in China s united front system which aims to gather non CCP voices to support the CCP Similar to the people s congresses CPPCC s exist at various division with the National Committee of the CPPCC being chaired by Wang Huning fourth ranking member of the PSC br The governance of China is characterized by a high degree of political centralization but significant economic decentralization Policy instruments or processes are often tested locally before being applied more widely resulting in a policy that involves experimentation and feedback Generally central government leadership refrains from drafting specific policies instead using the informal networks and site visits to affirm or suggest changes to the direction of local policy experiments or pilot programs The typical approach is that central government leadership begins drafting formal policies law or regulations after policy has been developed at local levels br br br Administrative divisions br br The PRC is constitutionally a unitary state divided into provinces five autonomous regions each with a designated minority group and four direct administered municipalities collectively referred to as mainland China as well as the special administrative regions SARs of Hong Kong and Macau The PRC regards the island of Taiwan as its Taiwan Province Kinmen and Matsu as a part of Fujian Province and islands the ROC controls in the South China Sea as a part of Hainan Province and Guangdong Province although all these territories are governed by the Republic of China ROC Geographically all provincial divisions of mainland China can be grouped into six regions North China Northeast China East China South Central China Southwestern China and Northwestern China br br br Foreign relations br br The PRC has diplomatic relations with United Nation members states and maintains embassies in As of China has one of the largest diplomatic networks of any country in the world In the PRC replaced the Republic of China ROC as the sole representative of China in the United Nations and as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council It is a member of intergovernmental organizations including the G the SCO the East Asia Summit and the APEC China was also a former member and leader of the Non Aligned Movement and still considers itself an advocate for developing countries Along with Brazil Russia India and South Africa China is a member of the BRICS group of emerging major economies and hosted the group s third official summit in April br br The PRC officially maintains the one China principle which holds the view that there is only one sovereign state in the name of China represented by the PRC and that Taiwan is part of that China The unique status of Taiwan has led to countries recognizing the PRC to maintain unique one China policies that differ from each other some countries explicitly recognize the PRC s claim over Taiwan while others including the U S and Japan only acknowledge the claim Chinese officials have protested on numerous occasions when foreign countries have made diplomatic overtures to Taiwan especially in the matter of armament sales Most countries have switched recognition from the ROC to the PRC since the latter replaced the former in the UN in Much of current Chinese foreign policy is reportedly based on Premier Zhou Enlai s Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and is also driven by the concept of harmony without uniformity which encourages diplomatic relations between states despite ideological differences This policy may have led China to support or maintain close ties with states that are regarded as dangerous and repressive by Western nations such as Sudan North Korea and Iran China s close relationship with Myanmar has involved support for its ruling governments as well as for its ethnic rebel groups including the Arakan Army China has a close political economic and military relationship with Russia and the two states often vote in unison in the UN Security Council China s relationship with the United States is complex and includes deep trade ties but significant political differences br Since the early s China has followed a policy of engaging with African nations for trade and bilateral co operation It maintains extensive and highly diversified trade links with the European Union and became its largest trading partner for goods China is increasing its influence in Central Asia and South Pacific The country has strong trade ties with ASEAN countries and major South American economies and is the largest trading partner of Brazil Chile Peru Uruguay Argentina and several others br In China initiated the Belt and Road Initiative BRI a large global infrastructure building initiative with funding on the order of billion per year BRI could be one of the largest development plans in modern history It has expanded significantly over the last six years and as of April includes countries and international organizations In addition to intensifying foreign policy relations the focus is particularly on building efficient transport routes especially the maritime Silk Road with its connections to East Africa and Europe However many loans made under the program are unsustainable and China has faced a number of calls for debt relief from debtor nations br br br Military br br The People s Liberation Army PLA is considered one of the world s most powerful militaries and has rapidly modernized in the recent decades It has also been accused of technology theft by some countries Since it consists of four services the Ground Force PLAGF the Navy PLAN the Air Force PLAAF and the Rocket Force PLARF It also has four independent arms the Aerospace Force the Cyberspace Force the Information Support Force and the Joint Logistics Support Force the first three of which were split from the disbanded Strategic Support Force PLASSF Its nearly million active duty personnel is the largest in the world The PLA holds the world s third largest stockpile of nuclear weapons and the world s second largest navy by tonnage China s official military budget for totalled US billion trillion Yuan the second largest in the world though SIPRI estimates that its real expenditure that year was US billion making up of global military spending and accounting for of the country s GDP According to SIPRI its military spending from to averaged US billion per year or per cent of GDP behind only the United States at US billion per year or per cent of GDP The PLA is commanded by the Central Military Commission CMC of the party and the state though officially two separate organizations the two CMCs have identical membership except during leadership transition periods and effectively function as one organization The chairman of the CMC is the commander in chief of the PLA br br br Sociopolitical issues and human rights br br The situation of human rights in China has attracted significant criticism from foreign governments foreign press agencies and non governmental organizations alleging widespread civil rights violations such as detention without trial forced confessions torture restrictions of fundamental rights and excessive use of the death penalty Since its inception Freedom House has ranked China as not free in its Freedom in the World survey while Amnesty International has documented significant human rights abuses The Chinese constitution states that the fundamental rights of citizens include freedom of speech freedom of the press the right to a fair trial freedom of religion universal suffrage and property rights However in practice these provisions do not afford significant protection against criminal prosecution by the state China has limited protections regarding LGBT rights br Although some criticisms of government policies and the ruling CCP are tolerated
