br br Privacy concerns br Commentators have raised concerns about the potential invasion of privacy Without prior knowledge of the product the glasses could be confused for a regular pair of Ray Ban sunglasses by individuals in close proximity to the user Another feature that poses a potential privacy concern has to do with the device s listening capabilities Individuals have voiced concerns about the ability of our smart devices to record and listen to users with or without their permission Facebook alleges that the glasses are only able to listen to the user after hearing the Hey Facebook wake phrase which in turn will alert the glasses to one of three commands take a photo record a video or stop recording br In light of privacy and security breaches happening at Facebook there has been a growing number of concerns over how data is stored and retrieved from different devices Facebook in response to this concern stated that they will not be able to access the content captured via Ray Ban Stories without authorization from the user In contrast to this the Facebook View app says that the user s voice commands could be sent to Facebook unless the user explicitly opts out According to the company this data would be used to personalize the user s experience The company also shared that it has a team dedicated to encrypting photos and data in order to prevent cyber hacking br The concern that has generated the most vocal response including concerns from Facebook s lead privacy regulator in Europe the Irish Data Protection Committee DPC centers on the effectiveness of the glasses at alerting other individuals when they are being photographed or recorded Facebook claims that the LED light feature in the upper right hand corner of the glasses is able to notify individuals that the person wearing the glasses is recording a video or capturing a photo from up to feet away According to the article if a user were to cover the LED light the camera does not record video and notifies the user The article also suggests good practices for safety and being a good community member including respecting people s preferences explaining how the LED light works not capturing images while operating a vehicle and powering off the glasses in private spaces br br br See also br Smartglasses br Google Glass Smartglasses developed by Google br Spectacles
