Maxtor Corporation was an American computer hard disk drive manufacturer Founded in it was the third largest hard disk drive manufacturer in the world before being purchased by Seagate in br br br History br br br Overview br In three former IBM employees began searching for funding and Maxtor was founded the following year In Maxtor shipped its first product the Maxtor XT In Maxtor filed its initial public offering and started trading on the New York Stock Exchange as MXO Maxtor bought hard drive manufacturer MiniScribe in Maxtor was getting close to bankruptcy in and closed its engineering operations in San Jose California in In Maxtor introduced its DiamondMax line of hard drives with DSP based architecture In Maxtor acquired Quantum s hard drive division which gave Maxtor the ATA hard drive interface and helped Maxtor revive its server hard drive market In Maxtor was acquired by Seagate br br br Early financing br br The Maxtor founders James McCoy Jack Swartz and Raymond Niedzwiecki graduates of the San Jose State University School of Engineering and former employees of IBM began the search for funding in In early B J Cassin and Chuck Hazel Bay Partners provided the initial million funding and the company officially began operations on July In February it shipped its first product to Convergent Technology and immediately received an additional million in its second round of funding The company also began negotiations with the EDB Economic Development Board of Singapore for favorable terms before committing to Singapore as its offshore manufacturing location The DBS Development Bank of Singapore agreed to provide financing to help grow the company in Singapore In the company established a liaison and procurement office in Tokyo headed by Tatsuya Yamamoto br Maxtor s product architecture used eight disks surfaces recorded data and the final surface was where the servo track information was located The company developed its own spindle motor which was fitted within the casting containing the disks This was a major departure as the spindle motor was usually mounted external to the disks The first product was designed to provide MB of storage but delays in getting magnetic heads to the Maxtor design resulted in the company taking what was available and the first drive the XT was shipped with a capacity of only MB The company received an additional round of financing of approximately million in before going public in with Goldman Sachs as the prime underwriter br br br MiniScribe acquisition br In Maxtor entered the mass market with its purchase of the assets but not the liabilities of bankrupt MiniScribe in Longmont Colorado The transition was a tough one as the early products of this union notably the AT inch MB drive had many quality and design problems Later products managed to sell well despite the initial problems In the company completely redesigned its hard drive product line by introducing its DiamondMax series with a Texas Instruments digital signal processor br br br Financial troubles br After nine years of development the original XT series of drives had achieved a capacity of GB Maxtor sold the rights to the series to Sequel of Santa Clara California in the mid s and the company exited the server drive market Sequel a spin off of Unisys was not a disk drive manufacturer rather they specialized in refurbishing drives for the existing customer base Teetering on the brink of bankruptcy in Maxtor s exit from the high capacity inch SCSI market temporarily left a product void in the industry Around this time SCSI versions of the series drives were also discontinued and all engineering operations in San Jose were shut down in late leaving only the former MiniScribe design engineering staff After turnover in the executive staff Maxtor decided it had made a mistake and when Maxtor moved its headquarters to Milpitas California it gradually began to rebuild its engineering staff br br br Acquisition of the Quantum hard drive division br In late Maxtor acquired the hard drive business of Quantum The merger which was completed on April made Maxtor larger than its rivals notably Seagate and returned it to the server hard drive market and also implemented the ATA interface into its hard drives br br br Focus on external drives br Like many other hard drive manufacturers Maxtor had been expanding in recent years into the external hard drive market Its Maxtor One Touch II external hard drive was marketed as convenient storage for the home user Maxtor entered and became dominant in consumer business as result of a marketing strategy for the OneTouch line The OneTouch is a high capacity GB to TB USB drive with a single press button to back up and mirror the computer s hard drive The line became the best selling consumer device in the computer segment with several million devices distributed globally br Maxtor had initially made efforts to get into the inch hard drive market but in the beginning of new management made the surprising decision to discontinue development in this field This was considered by many industry watchers to be a particularly peculiar move since the market for such hard drives mainly notebook computers and MP players was already experiencing rapid growth with no signs of slowing down in the foreseeable future br br br Acquisition by Seagate br In a deal worth nearly US billion Maxtor was acquired by its rival Seagate in The Maxtor brand was revived by Seagate in later although the former Maxtor factory in
