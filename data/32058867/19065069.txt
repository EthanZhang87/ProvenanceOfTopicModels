self coup and on August protests occurred throughout the United Kingdom As of September three separate court cases challenging Johnson s action were in progress or scheduled to take place and on September three Scottish judges ruled the prorogation of the UK Parliament to be unlawful On September Johnson denied lying to the Queen over suspension of the Parliament while a Belfast Court rejected claims that his Brexit plans will have a negative impact on Northern Ireland s peace policy On September the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that Johnson s advice to prorogue Parliament was unlawful and therefore the prorogation was rendered null br When Parliament resumed on September Johnson indicated he would call a general election under the Fixed term Parliaments Act after opposition and rebel Conservative MPs successfully voted against the government to take control of the order of business to prevent a no deal exit Despite government opposition the Benn Act a bill to

government to prepare for and control the outbreak has been criticised The UK was among the last major European states to close schools ban public events and order a lockdown This response is thought by some scientists to have contributed to the UK s high death toll from COVID which as of January was among the highest in the world br Reuters reported that scientists were critical of Johnson both for acting too slowly to stop the spread of COVID and for mishandling the government s response Politico quoted Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty as saying that an earlier initial lockdown would have

refurbishment personally br On May Lord Geidt published a report on the allegations which concluded that Johnson did not breach the Ministerial Code and that no conflict or reasonably perceived conflict of interest arose However Lord Geidt expressed that it was unwise for Johnson to have proceeded without more rigorous regard for how this would be funded The Electoral Commission reported on December that it found that the Conservative Party had failed to follow the law in not accurately reporting donations to the party from Lord Brownlow and imposed a fine on the party The Herald said
