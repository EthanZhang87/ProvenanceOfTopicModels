The hertz symbol Hz is the unit of frequency in the International System of Units SI equivalent to one event or cycle per second The hertz is an SI derived unit whose expression in terms of SI base units is s meaning that one hertz is the reciprocal of one second It is named after Heinrich Rudolf Hertz the first person to provide conclusive proof of the existence of electromagnetic waves Hertz are commonly expressed in multiples kilohertz kHz megahertz MHz gigahertz GHz terahertz THz br Some of the unit s most common uses are in the description of periodic waveforms and musical tones particularly those used in radio and audio related applications It is also used to describe the clock speeds at which computers and other electronics are driven The units are sometimes also used as a representation of the energy of a photon via the Planck relation E h where E is the photon s energy is its frequency and h is the Planck constant br br br Definition br The hertz is equivalent to one cycle per second The International Committee for Weights and Measures defined the second as the duration of periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium atom and then adds It follows that the hyperfine splitting in the ground state of the caesium atom is exactly hertz hfs Cs Hz The dimension of the unit hertz is time T Expressed in base SI units the unit is the reciprocal second s br In English hertz is also used as the plural form As an SI unit Hz can be prefixed commonly used multiples are kHz kilohertz Hz MHz megahertz Hz GHz gigahertz Hz and THz terahertz Hz One hertz simply means one event per second where the event being counted may be a complete cycle Hz means one hundred events per second and so on The unit may be applied to any periodic event for example a clock might be said to tick at Hz or a human heart might be said to beat at Hz br The occurrence rate of aperiodic or stochastic events is expressed in reciprocal second or inverse second s or s in general or in the specific case of radioactivity in becquerels Whereas Hz is one cycle or periodic event per second Bq is one radionuclide event per second on average br Even though frequency angular velocity angular frequency and radioactivity all have the dimension T of these only frequency is expressed using the unit hertz Thus a disc rotating at revolutions per minute rpm is said to have an angular velocity of rad s and a frequency of rotation of Hz The correspondence between a frequency f with the unit hertz and an angular velocity with the unit radians per second is br br br br br br br br br f br br br displaystyle omega pi f br br and br br br br f br br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle f frac omega

capitalisation of a common noun i e hertz becomes capitalised at the beginning of a sentence and in titles but is otherwise in lower case br br br History br br The hertz is named after the German physicist Heinrich Hertz who made important scientific contributions to the study of electromagnetism The name was established by the International Electrotechnical Commission IEC in It was adopted by the General Conference on Weights and Measures CGPM Conf rence g n rale des poids et mesures in replacing the previous name for the unit cycles per second cps along with its related multiples primarily kilocycles per second kc s and megacycles per second Mc s and occasionally kilomegacycles per second kMc s The term cycles per second was largely replaced by hertz by the s br In some usage the per second was omitted so that megacycles Mc was used as an abbreviation of megacycles per second that is megahertz MHz br br br Applications br br br Sound and vibration br Sound is a traveling longitudinal wave which is an oscillation of pressure Humans perceive the frequency of a sound as its pitch Each musical note corresponds to a particular frequency An infant s ear is able to perceive frequencies ranging from Hz to Hz the average adult human can hear sounds between Hz and Hz The range of ultrasound infrasound and other physical vibrations such as molecular and atomic vibrations extends from a few femtohertz into the terahertz range and beyond br br br Electromagnetic radiation br Electromagnetic radiation is often described by its frequency the number of oscillations of the perpendicular electric and magnetic fields per second expressed in hertz br Radio frequency radiation is usually measured in kilohertz kHz megahertz MHz or gigahertz GHz Light is electromagnetic radiation that is even higher in frequency and has frequencies in the range of tens infrared to thousands ultraviolet of terahertz Electromagnetic radiation with frequencies in the low terahertz range intermediate between those of the highest normally usable radio frequencies and long wave infrared light is often called terahertz radiation Even higher frequencies exist such as that of gamma rays which can be measured in exahertz EHz For historical reasons the frequencies of light and higher frequency electromagnetic radiation are more commonly specified in terms of their wavelengths or photon energies for a more detailed treatment of this and the above frequency ranges see Electromagnetic spectrum br br br Computers br br In computers most central processing units CPU are labeled in terms of their clock rate expressed in megahertz MHz or gigahertz GHz This specification refers to the frequency of the CPU s master clock signal This signal is nominally a square wave which is an electrical voltage that switches between low and high logic levels at regular intervals As the hertz has become the primary unit of measurement accepted by the general populace to determine the performance of a CPU many experts have criticized this approach which they claim is an easily manipulable benchmark Some processors use multiple clock cycles to perform a single operation while others can perform multiple operations in a single cycle For personal computers CPU clock speeds have ranged from approximately MHz in the late s Atari Commodore Apple computers to up to GHz in IBM Power microprocessors br Various computer buses such as the front side bus connecting the CPU and northbridge also operate at various frequencies in the megahertz range br br br SI multiples br br Higher frequencies than the International System of Units provides prefixes for are believed to occur naturally in the frequencies of the quantum mechanical vibrations of massive particles although these are not directly observable and must be inferred through other phenomena By convention these are typically not expressed in hertz but in terms of the equivalent energy which is proportional to the frequency by the factor of the Planck constant br br br Unicode br The CJK Compatibility block in Unicode contains characters for common SI units for frequency These are intended for compatibility
