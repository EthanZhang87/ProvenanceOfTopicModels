Dell BSAFE formerly known as RSA BSAFE is a FIPS validated cryptography library available in both C and Java BSAFE was initially created by RSA Security which was purchased by EMC and then in turn by Dell When Dell sold the RSA business to Symphony Technology Group in Dell elected to retain the BSAFE product line BSAFE was one of the most common encryption toolkits before the RSA patent expired in September It also contained implementations of the RCx ciphers with the most common one being RC From to the default random number generator in the library was a NIST approved RNG standard widely known to be insecure from at least containing a kleptographic backdoor from the American National Security Agency NSA as part of its secret Bullrun program In Reuters revealed that RSA had received a payment of million to set the compromised algorithm as the default option The RNG standard was subsequently withdrawn in and the RNG removed from BSAFE beginning in br br br Cryptography backdoors br br br Dual EC DRBG random number generator br From to the default cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator CSPRNG in BSAFE was Dual EC DRBG which contained an alleged backdoor from NSA in addition to being a biased and slow CSPRNG The cryptographic community had been aware that Dual EC DRBG was a very poor CSPRNG since shortly after the specification was posted in and by it had become apparent that the CSPRNG seemed to be designed to contain a hidden backdoor for NSA usable only by NSA via a secret key In Bruce Schneier described the backdoor as too obvious to trick anyone to use it The backdoor was confirmed in the Snowden leaks in and it was insinuated that NSA had paid RSA Security US million to use Dual EC DRBG by default in though RSA Security denied that they knew about the backdoor in The Reuters article which revealed the secret million contract to use Dual EC DRBG described the deal as handled by business leaders rather than pure technologists RSA Security has largely declined to explain their choice to continue using Dual EC DRBG even after the defects and potential backdoor were discovered in and and has denied knowingly inserting the backdoor br br So why would RSA pick Dual EC as the default You got me Not only is Dual EC hilariously slow which has real performance implications it was shown to be a just plain bad random number generator all the way back in By when Shumow and Ferguson raised the possibility of a backdoor in the specification no sensible cryptographer would go near the thing And the killer is that RSA employs a number of highly distinguished cryptographers It s unlikely that they d all miss the news about Dual EC br As a cryptographically secure random number generator is often the basis of cryptography much data encrypted with BSAFE was not secure against NSA Specifically it has been shown that the backdoor makes SSL TLS completely breakable by the party having the private key to the backdoor i e NSA Since the US government and US companies have also used the vulnerable BSAFE NSA can potentially have made US data less safe if NSA s secret key to the backdoor had been stolen It is also possible to derive the secret key by solving a single instance of the algorithm s elliptic curve problem breaking an instance of elliptic curve cryptography is considered unlikely with current computers and algorithms but a breakthrough may occur br In June Edward Snowden began leaking NSA documents In November RSA switched the default to HMAC DRBG with SHA as the default option The following month Reuters published the report based on the Snowden leaks stating that RSA had received a payment of million to set Dual EC DRBG as the default br With subsequent releases of Crypto C Micro Edition April Micro Edition Suite April and Crypto J March Dual EC DRBG was removed entirely br br br Extended Random TLS extension br Extended Random was a proposed extension for the Transport Layer Security TLS protocol submitted for standardization to IETF by an NSA employee although it never became a standard The extension would otherwise be harmless but together with the Dual EC DRBG it would make it easier to take advantage of the backdoor br The extension was previously not known to be enabled in any implementations but in December it was found enabled on some Canon printer models which use the RSA BSAFE library because the extension number conflicted a part of TLS version br br br Varieties br Crypto J is a Java encryption library In RSA Data Security licensed Baltimore Technologies J CRYPTO library with plans to integrate it as part of its new JSAFE encryption toolkit and released the first version of JSAFE the same year JSAFE was featured in the January edition of Byte magazine br Cert J is a Public Key Infrastructure API software library written in Java It contains the cryptographic support necessary to generate certificate requests create and sign digital certificates and create and distribute certificate revocation lists As of Cert J the entire API has been deprecated in favor of similar functionality provided BSAFE Crypto J JCE API br BSAFE Crypto C Micro Edition Crypto C ME was initially released in June under the name RSA BSAFE Wireless Core The initial release targeted Microsoft Windows EPOC Linux Solaris and Palm OS br BSAFE Micro Edition Suite is a cryptography SDK in C BSAFE Micro Edition Suite was initially announced in February as a combined offering of BSAFE SSL C Micro Edition BSAFE Cert C Micro Edition and BSAFE Crypto C Micro Edition Both SSL C Micro Edition and Cert C Micro Edition reached EOL in September while Micro Edition Suite remains supported with Crypto C Micro Edition as its FIPS validated cryptographic provider br SSL C is an SSL toolkit in the BSAFE suite It was originally written by Eric A Young and Tim J Hudson as a fork of the open library SSLeay that they developed prior to joining RSA SSL C reached End Of Life in December br SSL J is a Java toolkit that implements TLS SSL J was released as part of RSA JSAFE initial product offering in Crypto J is the default cryptographic provider of SSL J br br br Product suite support status br On November RSA announced End of Life EOL dates for BSAFE The End of Primary Support EOPS was to be reached on January and the End of Extended Support EOXS was originally set to be January That date was later further extended by RSA for some versions until January During Extended Support even though the support policy stated that only the most severe problems would be patched new versions were released containing bugfixes security fixes and new algorithms br On December Dell announced the reversal of RSA s past decision allowing BSAFE product support beyond January as well as the possibility to soon acquire new licenses Dell also announced it was rebranding the toolkits to Dell BSAFE br br br br br br External links br BSAFE Cert J Support Page br BSAFE Crypto J
