flagship Android phones and a display that was noted for its high resolution good color reproduction and ridiculous viewing angles but still being hard to use in direct sunlight The First s camera was considered to be better than expected for a low end phone but produced muddy photos and felt like a throwback to an earlier age when smartphones were nigh useless in the dark Facebook Home s functionality was considered to be good for casual users but the ability to switch back to a stock Android interface was considered stunning and a good compromise for the lack of Nexus devices with LTE support at the time br Alex Roth of TechRadar gave the HTC First a out of praising its build quality and operating system feeling that the First could develop a sort of second life as the mid range of choice among Google geeks due to its use of stock Android and LTE support and considering it to possibly be the last decent dual core handset ever made but considered Facebook Home to be a glorified screensaver and also criticized the camera s low quality and the lack of a dedicated shutter button which Roth believed would have made sense on a Facebook oriented phone br On May reports surfaced that AT T had only sold units of the First since its launch and was planning to discontinue the device in response to the poor reception of Facebook Home from both users and AT T s sales representatives The reports came shortly after AT T had lowered the First s price from to on a two year contract as a promotion however AT T denied any possible connection to the device being possibly
