Autodesk Inc is an American multinational software corporation that provides software products and services for the architecture engineering construction manufacturing media education and entertainment industries Autodesk is headquartered in San Francisco California and has offices worldwide Its U S offices are located in the states of California Oregon Colorado Texas Michigan New Hampshire and Massachusetts Its Canada offices are located in the provinces of Ontario Quebec and Alberta br The company was founded in by John Walker who was a coauthor of the first versions of AutoCAD AutoCAD is the company s flagship computer aided design CAD software and along with its D design software Revit is primarily used by architects engineers and structural designers to design draft and model buildings and other structures Autodesk software has been used in many fields and on projects from the One World Trade Center to Tesla electric cars br Autodesk became best known for AutoCAD but now develops a broad range of software for design engineering and entertainment and a line of software for consumers The manufacturing industry uses Autodesk s digital prototyping software including Autodesk Inventor Fusion and the Autodesk Product Design Suite to visualize simulate and analyze real world performance using a digital model in the design process The company s Revit line of software for building information modeling is designed to let users explore the planning construction and management of a building virtually before it is built br Autodesk s Media and Entertainment division creates software for visual effects color grading and editing as well as animation game development and design visualization ds Max and Maya are both D animation software used in film visual effects and game development br br br History br The company was founded by John Walker and a team of programmers in Walker founded the company after acquiring Interact a computer aided design program that operated on microcomputers running the bit CP M operating system and two of the new bit systems the Victor and the IBM Personal Computer PC This tool provided made it affordable for smaller design engineering and architecture companies to create detailed technical drawings The program had been developed by Michael Riddle in Riddle had struggled to sell the program and agreed to sell it to Walker in exchange for royalties The program was further developed and renamed AutoCAD br Autodesk became a public company in John Walker did not enjoy the process of writing the prospectus relating the process to lying on the beach or juggling chainsaws br Release of AutoCAD released in included AutoLISP a built in Lisp programming language interpreter initially based on XLISP This opened the door for third party developers to extend AutoCAD s functionality to address a wide range of vertical markets strengthening AutoCAD s market penetration br Subsequent to AutoCAD Release the company stopped supporting the Unix environment and the Apple Macintosh platform After AutoCAD Release R was last DOS Unix release first shipped in Autodesk discontinued development under DOS and focused exclusively on Microsoft Windows br AutoCAD has grown to become the most widely used CAD program for D non specialized applications The native file formats written by AutoCAD DXF and DWG are also widely used for CAD data interoperability br In Autodesk s sales grew to over after just four operational years br Walker remained a programmer at Autodesk until when he left due to disagreements with changes at the company With the purchase of Softdesk in Autodesk started to develop specialty versions of AutoCAD targeted to broad industry segments including architecture civil engineering and manufacturing Since the late s the company has added several significant non AutoCAD based products including Revit a parametric building modeling application acquired in from Massachusetts based Revit Technologies for million and Inventor an internally developed parametric mechanical design CAD application br In Timothy Vernor sued Autodesk Vernor v Autodesk Inc alleging that he was entitled to resell used copies of AutoCAD software on eBay He had obtained the software from an Autodesk licensee at an office liquidation sale A federal district judge in Washington denied Autodesk s initial motion to dismiss in early In February and March both sides filed motions for summary judgment addressing the issue whether the First Sale Doctrine applies to previously licensed software The Court ruled in Vernor s favor holding that when the transfer of software to the purchaser materially resembled a sale non recurring price right to perpetual possession of copy it was in fact a sale with restrictions on use giving rise to a right to resell the copy under the first sale doctrine As such Autodesk could not pursue an action for copyright infringement against Vernor who sought to resell used versions of its software on eBay Autodesk appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which reversed the lower court ruling denying Vernor the right to resale Autodesk software due to Autodesk s nontransferable licensing restrictions In October the U S Supreme Court let stand the th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling br Autodesk introduced a new logo at
