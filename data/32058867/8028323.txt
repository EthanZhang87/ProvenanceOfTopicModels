cryptlib is an open source cross platform software security toolkit library It is distributed under the Sleepycat License a free software license compatible with the GNU General Public License Alternatively cryptlib is available under a proprietary license for those preferring to use it under proprietary terms br br br Features br cryptlib is a security toolkit library that allows programmers to incorporate encryption and authentication services to software It provides a high level interface so strong security capabilities can be added to an application without needing to know many of the low level details of encryption or authentication algorithms It comes with an over page programming manual br At the highest level cryptlib provides implementations of complete security services such as S MIME and PGP OpenPGP secure enveloping SSL TLS and SSH secure sessions CA services such as CMP SCEP RTCS and OCSP and other security operations such as secure timestamping Since cryptlib uses industry standard X S MIME PGP OpenPGP and SSH SSL TLS data formats the resulting encrypted or signed data can be easily transported to other systems and processed there and cryptlib itself runs on many operating systems all Windows versions and most Unix Linux systems This allows email files and EDI transactions to be authenticated with digital signatures and encrypted in an industry standard format br cryptlib provides other capabilities including full X PKIX certificate handling all X versions from X v to X v with support for SET Microsoft AuthentiCode Identrus SigG S MIME SSL and Qualified certificates PKCS certificate chains handling of certification requests and CRLs certificate revocation lists including automated checking of certificates against CRLs and online checking using RTCS and OCSP and issuing and revoking certificates using CMP and SCEP It also implements a full range of certification authority CA functions provides complete CMP SCEP RTCS and OCSP server implementations to handle online certificate enrolment issue revocation and certificate status checking Alongside the certificate handling it provides a sophisticated key storage interface that allows the use of a wide range of key database types ranging from PKCS devices PKCS key files and PGP OpenPGP key rings through to commercial grade RDBMS and LDAP directories with optional SSL protection br cryptlib can make use of the crypto capabilities of a variety of external crypto devices such as hardware crypto accelerators Fortezza cards PKCS devices hardware security modules HSMs and crypto smart cards It can be used with a variety of crypto devices that have received FIPS or ITSEC Common Criteria certification The crypto device interface also provides a general purpose plug in capability for adding new functionality that can be used by cryptlib br cryptlib is written in C and supports BeOS DOS IBM MVS Mac OS X OS Tandem a variety of Unix versions including AIX Digital Unix DGUX FreeBSD NetBSD OpenBSD HP UX IRIX Linux MP RAS OSF QNX SCO UnixWare Solaris SunOS Ultrix and UTS VM CMS Windows x Windows ME Windows CE PocketPC SmartPhone and Windows NT XP Vista It is designed to be portable to other embedded system environments It is available as a standard Windows DLL Language bindings are available for C C C NET Delphi Java Python and Visual Basic VB br br br Algorithm support br br br Release History br cryptlib was released on March br cryptlib was released on August br cryptlib was released on January br cryptlib was released on March br cryptlib was released on December br cryptlib was released on July br cryptlib was released on October br cryptlib was released on July br cryptlib was released on February br cryptlib was released on September br cryptlib a was released on August br cryptlib was released on July br cryptlib was released on September br cryptlib was released on August br cryptlib was released on April br cryptlib was released on December br br br See also br br OpenSSL br GnuTLS br Network Security Services br Libgcrypt br MatrixSSL br mbed TLS previously PolarSSL br wolfSSL previously CyaSSL br Comparison of TLS implementations br Comparison of cryptography libraries br br br br br br External links br Official website br Cryptlib Encryption Security Software Development Toolkit by Digital Data Security Limited
