This is a technical feature comparison of different disk encryption software br br br Background information br br br Operating systems br br br Features br Hidden containers Whether hidden containers an encrypted container A within another encrypted container B so the existence of container A can not be established can be created for deniable encryption Note that some modes of operation like CBC with a plain IV can be more prone to watermarking attacks than others br Pre boot authentication Whether authentication can be required before booting the computer thus allowing one to encrypt the boot disk br Single sign on Whether credentials provided during pre boot authentication will automatically log the user into the host operating system thus preventing password fatigue and reducing the need to remember multiple passwords br Custom authentication Whether custom authentication mechanisms can be implemented with third party applications br Multiple keys Whether an encrypted volume can have more than one active key br Passphrase strengthening Whether key strengthening is used with plain text passwords to frustrate dictionary attacks usually using PBKDF or Argon br Hardware acceleration Whether dedicated cryptographic accelerator expansion cards can be taken advantage of br Trusted Platform Module Whether the implementation can use a TPM cryptoprocessor br Filesystems What filesystems are supported br Two factor authentication Whether optional security tokens hardware security modules such as Aladdin eToken and smart cards are supported for example using PKCS br br br Layering br Whole disk Whether the whole physical disk or logical volume can be encrypted including the partition tables and master boot record Note that this does not imply that the encrypted disk can be used as the boot disk itself refer to pre boot authentication in the features comparison table br Partition Whether individual disk partitions can be encrypted br File Whether the encrypted container can be stored in a file usually implemented as encrypted loop devices br Swap space Whether the swap space called a pagefile on Windows can be encrypted individually explicitly br Hibernation file Whether the hibernation file is encrypted if hibernation is supported br br br Modes of operation br br Different modes of operation supported by the software Note that an encrypted volume can only use one mode of operation br br CBC with predictable IVs The CBC cipher block chaining mode where initialization vectors are statically derived from the sector number and are not secret this means that IVs are re used when overwriting a sector and the vectors can easily be guessed by an attacker leading to watermarking attacks br CBC with secret IVs The CBC mode where initialization vectors are statically derived from the encryption key and sector number The IVs are secret but they are re used with overwrites Methods for this include ESSIV and encrypted sector numbers CGD br CBC with random per sector keys The CBC mode where random keys are generated for each sector when it is written to thus does not exhibit the typical weaknesses of CBC with re used initialization vectors The individual sector keys are stored on disk and encrypted with a master key See GBDE for details br LRW The Liskov Rivest Wagner tweakable narrow block mode a mode of operation specifically designed for disk encryption Superseded by the more secure XTS mode due to security concerns br XTS XEX based Tweaked CodeBook mode TCB with CipherText Stealing CTS the SISWG IEEE P standard for disk encryption br Authenticated encryption Protection against ciphertext modification by an attacker br br br See also br Cold boot attack br Comparison of encrypted external drives br Disk encryption software br Disk encryption theory br List of cryptographic file systems br br br Notes and references br br br External links br DiskCryptor vs Truecrypt Comparison between DiskCryptor and TrueCrypt br Buyer s Guide to Full Disk Encryption Overview of full disk encryption how it works and how it differs from file level encryption
