cryptographically entrusted to the Diem Association a membership organization of companies from payment technology telecommunication online marketplace and venture capital and nonprofits br Before

European Union the USA other countries and among the general public over monetary sovereignty financial stability privacy and antitrust concerns which ultimately helped kill the project br The Diem Association originally the Libra Association shut down in January and sold the project to Silvergate Bank Silvergate wrote off their Diem investment in January br br br History br Morgan Beller started working on cryptocurrency and blockchain at Facebook in and was initially the only person working on Facebook s blockchain initiative br Facebook vice president David A Marcus moved from Facebook Messenger to a new blockchain division in May First reports of Facebook planning a cryptocurrency with Marcus in charge emerged a few days later By February there were more than engineers

basket of currencies and US Treasury securities in an attempt to avoid volatility Facebook announced that each of the partners would inject an initial US million so Libra had full asset backing on the day it opened As of January Libra was said to have dropped the idea of a mixed currency basket in favor of individual stablecoins pegged to individual currencies br Libra service partners within the Libra Association would create new Libra currency units based on demand Libra currency units would be retired as they were redeemed for conventional currency br Initial reconciliation of transactions would be performed at each service partner and the blockchain s distributed ledger would be used for reconciliation between service partners The intent was to help prevent everyone but members of the Libra Association from trying to extract and analyze data from the distributed ledger br In contrast to cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin which use permissionless blockchains Libra was not planned to be decentralized relying on trust in the Libra Association as a de facto central bank br In September Facebook announced that the reserve basket would be made up of United States dollar Euro Japanese

of the euro zone and its democracies Libra could make Facebook its central bank Berger argues in favor of the development of a European stablecoin in order to be able to offer a secure alternative to the Facebook currency Berger will be in charge of the European report of Markets in Crypto Assets MiCA which will serve as base for a regulatory framework for crypto assets br On September Le Maire stated that France would not allow development of Libra in the European Union as it would have been a threat to the monetary sovereignty of states He also spoke about the potential for abuse of marketing dominance and systemic financial risks as reasons for not allowing stablecoins to operate yet within the EU br According to a Reuters report German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said

for the Libra digital currency in some cases trying to sell discounted Libra which was not yet accessible Numerous of these counterfeit pages used the Facebook logo images of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Libra s official marketing material The growth of fake pages and groups devoted to Libra added to Facebook s difficulties with global authorities br br br Legal issues br Diem Association formerly Libra Association faced legal challenges as both the name and the logo of the digital currency were already in use within different territories br Finco Services Inc filed a

as open source under the Apache License on GitHub br In June Elaine Ou an opinion writer at Bloomberg News tried compiling and running the publicly released code for Libra At the time the software did little more than allow fake coins to be put in a wallet almost none of the functionality outlined in the white paper was implemented including major architectural features that have yet to be invented Ou was surprised that Facebook would release software in such a state br br br Digital wallet br In June Facebook announced plans to release a digital wallet called Calibra in as a standalone app and
