title: Off-the-record messaging
id: 1915691
Off the record Messaging OTR is a cryptographic protocol that provides encryption for instant messaging conversations OTR uses a combination of AES symmetric key algorithm with bits key length the Diffie Hellman key exchange with bits group size and the SHA hash function In addition to authentication and encryption OTR provides forward secrecy and malleable encryption br The primary motivation behind the protocol was providing deniable authentication for the conversation participants while keeping conversations confidential like a private conversation in real life or off the record in journalism sourcing This is in contrast with cryptography tools that produce output which can be later used as a verifiable record of the communication event and the identities of the participants The initial introductory paper was named Off the Record Communication or Why Not To Use PGP br The OTR protocol was designed by cryptographers Ian Goldberg and Nikita Borisov and released on October They provide a client library to facilitate support for instant messaging client developers who want to implement the protocol A Pidgin and Kopete plugin exists that allows OTR to be used over any IM protocol supported by Pidgin or Kopete offering an auto detection feature that starts the OTR session with the buddies that have it enabled without interfering with regular unencrypted conversations Version of the protocol has been in development since by a team led by Sof a Celi and reviewed by Nik Unger and Ian Goldberg This version aims to provide online and offline deniability to update the cryptographic primitives and to support out of order delivery and asynchronous communication br br br History br OTR was presented in by Nikita Borisov Ian Avrum Goldberg and Eric A Brewer as an improvement over the OpenPGP and the S MIME system at the Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society WPES The first version of the reference implementation was published on November In an analysis was presented by Mario Di Raimondo Rosario Gennaro and Hugo Krawczyk that called attention to several vulnerabilities and proposed appropriate fixes most notably including a flaw in the key exchange As a result version of the OTR protocol was published in which implements a variation of the proposed modification that additionally hides the public keys Moreover the possibility to fragment OTR messages was introduced in order to deal with chat systems that have a limited message size and a simpler method of verification against man in the middle attacks was implemented br In Olivier Goffart published mod otr for ejabberd making it possible to perform man in the middle attacks on OTR users who don t check key fingerprints OTR developers countered this attack by introducing a socialist millionaire protocol implementation in libotr Instead of comparing key checksums knowledge of an arbitrary shared secret can be utilised for which relatively low entropy can be tolerated br Version of the protocol was published in As a measure against the repeated reestablishment of a session in case of several competing chat clients being signed on to the same user address at the same time more precise identification labels for sending and receiving client instances were introduced in version Moreover an additional key is negotiated which can be used for another data channel br Several solutions have been proposed for supporting conversations with multiple participants A method proposed in by Jiang Bian Remzi Seker and Umit Topaloglu uses the system of one participant as a virtual server The method called Multi party Off the Record Messaging mpOTR which was published in works without a central management host and was introduced in Cryptocat by Ian Goldberg et al br In the Signal Protocol was introduced which is based on OTR Messaging and the Silent Circle Instant Messaging Protocol SCIMP It brought about support for asynchronous communication offline messages as its major new feature as well as better resilience with distorted order of messages and simpler support for conversations with multiple participants OMEMO introduced in an Android XMPP client called Conversations in integrates the Double Ratchet Algorithm used in Signal into the instant messaging protocol XMPP Jabber and also enables encryption of file transfers In the autumn of it was submitted to the XMPP Standards Foundation for standardisation br Currently version of the protocol has been designed It was presented by Sof a Celi and Ola Bini on PETS br br br Implementation br In addition to providing encryption and authentication features also provided by typical public key cryptography suites such as PGP GnuPG and X S MIME OTR also offers some less common features br br Forward secrecy br Messages are only encrypted with temporary per message AES keys negotiated using the Diffie Hellman key exchange protocol The compromise of any long lived cryptographic keys does not compromise any previous conversations even if an attacker is in possession of ciphertexts br Deniable authentication br Messages in a conversation do not have digital signatures and after a conversation is complete anyone is able to forge a message to appear to have come from one of the participants in the conversation assuring that it is impossible to prove that a specific message came from a specific person Within the conversation the recipient can be sure that a message is coming from the person they have identified br br br Authentication br As of OTR the protocol supports mutual authentication of users using a shared secret through the socialist millionaire protocol This feature makes it possible for users to verify the identity of the remote party and avoid a man in the middle attack without the inconvenience of manually comparing public key fingerprints through an outside channel br br br Limitations br Due to limitations of the protocol OTR does not support multi user group chat as of but it may be implemented in the future As of version of the protocol specification an extra symmetric key is derived during authenticated key exchanges that can be used for secure communication e g encrypted file transfers over a different channel Support for encrypted audio or video is not planned SRTP with ZRTP exists for that purpose A project to produce a protocol for multi party off the record messaging mpOTR has been organized by Cryptocat eQualitie and other contributors including Ian Goldberg br Since OTR protocol v libotr the plugin supports multiple OTR conversations with the same buddy who is logged in at multiple locations br br br Client support br br br Native supported by project developers br These clients support Off the Record Messaging out of the box incomplete list br br br Via third party plug in br br The following clients require a plug in to use Off the Record Messaging br br HexChat with a third party plugin br Miranda NG Microsoft Windows with a third party plugin br Pidgin cross platform with a plugin available from the OTR homepage br WeeChat with a third party plugin br HexChat for nix versions with a third party plugin br br br Confusion with Google Talk off the record br Although Gmail s Google Talk uses the term off the record the feature has no connection to the Off the Record Messaging protocol described in this article its chats are not encrypted in the way described above and could be logged internally by Google even if not accessible by end users br br br See also br Free software portal br br br
