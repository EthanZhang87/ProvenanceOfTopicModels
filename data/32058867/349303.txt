Saudi Arabia officially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia KSA is a country in West Asia and the Middle East It covers the bulk of the Arabian Peninsula and has a land area of about km sq mi making it the fifth largest country in Asia and the largest in the Middle East It is bordered by the Red Sea to the west Jordan Iraq and Kuwait to the north the Persian Gulf Bahrain Qatar and the United Arab Emirates to the east Oman to the southeast and Yemen to the south The Gulf of Aqaba in the northwest separates Saudi Arabia from Egypt and Israel Saudi Arabia is the only country with a coastline along both the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf and most of its terrain consists of arid desert lowland steppe and mountains The capital and largest city is Riyadh other major cities include Jeddah and the two holiest cities in Islam Mecca and Medina With a population of almost million Saudi Arabia is the fourth most populous country in the Arab world br Pre Islamic Arabia the territory that constitutes modern day Saudi Arabia has some of the earliest traces of human activity outside Africa Islam the world s second largest religion emerged in what is now Saudi Arabia in the early seventh century Islamic prophet Muhammad united the population of the Arabian Peninsula and created a single Islamic religious polity Following his death in his followers expanded Muslim rule beyond Arabia conquering territories in North Africa Central South Asia and Iberia within decades Arab dynasties originating from modern day Saudi Arabia founded the Rashidun Umayyad Abbasid and Fatimid caliphates as well as numerous other dynasties in Asia Africa and Europe br The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in by King Abdulaziz also known as Ibn Saud who united the regions of Hejaz Najd parts of Eastern Arabia Al Ahsa and South Arabia Asir into a single state through a series of conquests beginning in with the capture of Riyadh the ancestral home of his family the House of Saud Saudi Arabia has since been an absolute monarchy where political decisions are made on the basis of consultation among the King the Council of Ministers and the country s traditional elites that oversee a highly authoritarian regime In its Basic Law Saudi Arabia defines itself as a sovereign Arab Islamic state with Islam as its official religion and Arabic as its official language The ultraconservative Wahhabi religious movement within Sunni Islam was the prevailing political and cultural force in the country until the s The Saudi government has attracted criticism for various policies such as its intervention in the Yemeni Civil War alleged sponsorship of terrorism and widespread human rights abuses br Saudi Arabia is considered both a regional and middle power Since petroleum was discovered in the country in the kingdom has become the world s third largest oil producer and leading oil exporter controlling the world s second largest oil reserves and the sixth largest gas reserves Saudi Arabia is categorized as a World Bank high income economy and is the only Arab country among the G major economies The Saudi economy is the largest in the Middle East and the world s nineteenth largest by nominal GDP and seventeenth largest by PPP Ranking very high in the Human Development Index Saudi Arabia offers tuition free university education no personal income tax and free universal health care With its dependency on foreign labour Saudi Arabia has the world s third largest immigrant population Saudi Arabians are among the world s youngest people with approximately half being under years old Saudi Arabia is an active and founding member of the Gulf Cooperation Council United Nations Organisation of Islamic Cooperation Arab League and OPEC as well as a dialogue partner of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation br br br Etymology br br Following the amalgamation of the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd Abdulaziz bin Saud issued a royal decree on September naming the new state al Mamlaka al Arabiyya as Su diyya Arabic which is normally translated as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in English but literally means the Saudi Arab Kingdom or the Arab Saudi Kingdom br The word Saudi is derived from the element as Su d yya in the Arabic name of the country which is a type of adjective known as a nisba formed from the dynastic name of the Saudi royal family the Al Saud Arabic Its inclusion expresses the view that the country is the personal possession of the royal family Al Saud is an Arabic name formed by adding the word Al meaning family of or House of to the personal name of an ancestor In the case of Al Saud this is Saud ibn Muhammad ibn Muqrin the father of the dynasty s th century founder Muhammad bin Saud br br br History br br br Prehistory br br There is evidence that human habitation in the Arabian Peninsula dates back to about years ago A study found that the first modern humans to spread east across Asia left Africa about years ago across the Bab el Mandeb connecting the Horn of Africa and Arabia The Arabian Peninsula is regarded as central to the understanding of evolution and dispersals of Man Arabia underwent an extreme environmental fluctuation in the Quaternary that led to profound evolutionary and demographic changes Arabia has a rich Lower Paleolithic record and the quantity of Oldowan like sites in the region indicate a significant role that Arabia had played in the early hominin colonization of Eurasia br In the Neolithic period prominent cultures such as Al Magar whose centre lay in modern day southwestern Najd flourished Al Magar could be considered a Neolithic Revolution in human knowledge and handicraft skills The culture is characterized as being one of the world s first to involve the widespread domestication of animals particularly the horse during the Neolithic period Al Magar statues were made from local stone and it seems that the statues were fixed in a central building that might have had a significant role in the social and religious life of the inhabitants br In November hunting scenes showing images of most likely domesticated dogs resembling the Canaan Dog and wearing leashes were discovered in Shuwaymis a hilly region of northwestern Saudi Arabia These rock engravings date back more than years making them the earliest depictions of dogs in the world br At the end of the th millennium BC Arabia entered the Bronze Age metals were widely used and the period was characterized by its m high burials which were simultaneously followed by the existence of numerous temples that included many free standing sculptures originally painted with red colours br In May archaeologists announced that a year old Acheulean site named An Nasim in the Hail region could be the oldest human habitation site in northern Saudi Arabia artefacts including hand axes and stone tools provided information about tool making traditions of the earliest living man inhabited south west Asia Paleolithic artefacts are similar to material remains uncovered at the Acheulean sites in the Nefud Desert br br br Pre Islamic br br The earliest sedentary culture in Saudi Arabia dates back to the Ubaid period at Dosariyah Climatic change and the onset of aridity may have brought about the end of this phase of settlement as little archaeological evidence exists from the succeeding millennium The settlement of the region picks up again in the period of Dilmun in the early rd millennium Known records from Uruk refer to a place called Dilmun associated on several occasions with copper and in later periods it was a source of imported woods in southern Mesopotamia Scholars have suggested that Dilmun originally designated the eastern province of Saudi Arabia notably linked with the major Dilmunite settlements of Umm an Nussi and Umm ar Ramadh in the interior and Tarout on the coast It is likely that Tarout Island was the main port and the capital of Dilmun Mesopotamian inscribed clay tablets suggest that in the early period of Dilmun a form of hierarchical organized political structure existed In an earthwork in Tarout exposed an ancient burial field that yielded a large statue dating to the Dilmunite period mid rd millennium BC The statue was locally made under the strong Mesopotamian influence on the artistic principle of Dilmun br By BC the centre of Dilmun shifted for unknown reasons from Tarout and the Saudi Arabian mainland to the island of Bahrain and a highly developed settlement emerged there where a laborious temple complex and thousands of burial mounds dating to this period were discovered br br By the late Bronze Age a historically recorded people and land Midian and the Midianites in the north western portion of Saudi Arabia are well documented in the Bible Centred in Tabouk it stretched from Wadi Arabah in the north to the area of al Wejh in the south The capital of Midian was Qurayyah it consists of a large fortified citadel encompassing hectares and below it lies a walled settlement of hectares The city hosted as many as inhabitants The Bible recounts Israel s two wars with Midian somewhere in the early th century BC Politically the Midianites were described as having a decentralized structure headed by five kings Evi Rekem Tsur Hur and Reba the names appears to be toponyms of important Midianite settlements It is common to view that Midian designated a confederation of tribes the sedentary element settled in the Hijaz while its nomadic affiliates pastured and sometimes pillaged as far away as Palestine The nomadic Midianites were one of the earliest exploiters of the domestication of camels that enabled them to navigate through the harsh terrains of the region br br At the end of the th century BC an emerging kingdom appeared in north western Arabia It started as a sheikdom of Dedan which developed into the kingdom of Lihyan During this period Dedan transformed into a kingdom that encompassed a much wider domain In the early rd century BC with bustling economic activity between the south and north Lihyan acquired large influence suitable to its strategic position on the caravan road The Lihyanites ruled over a large domain from Yathrib in the south and parts of the Levant in the north In antiquity Gulf of Aqaba used to be called Gulf of Lihyan a testimony to the extensive influence that Lihyan acquired br The Lihyanites fell into the hands of the Nabataeans around BC upon their seizure of Hegra then marching to Tayma and to their capital Dedan in BC The Nabataeans ruled large portions of north Arabia until their domain was annexed by the Roman Empire which renamed it Arabia Petraea and remained under the rule of the Romans until br br br Middle Ages and rise of Islam br br Shortly before the advent of Islam apart from urban trading settlements such as Mecca and Medina much of what was to become Saudi Arabia was populated by nomadic pastoral tribal societies The Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca in about CE In the early th century Muhammad united the various tribes of the peninsula and created a single Islamic religious polity Following his death in his followers expanded the territory under Muslim rule beyond Arabia conquering territory in the Iberian Peninsula in the west to parts of Central and South Asia in the east in a matter of decades Arabia became a more politically peripheral region of the Muslim world as the focus shifted to the newly conquered lands br Arabs originating from modern day Saudi Arabia the Hejaz in particular founded the Rashidun Umayyad Abbasid and the Fatimid caliphates From the th century to the early th century Mecca and Medina were under the control of a local Arab ruler known as the Sharif of Mecca but at most times the sharif owed allegiance to the ruler of one of the major Islamic empires based in Baghdad Cairo or Istanbul Most of the remainder of what became Saudi Arabia reverted to traditional tribal rule br br For much of the th century the Isma ili Shi ite Qarmatians were the most powerful force in the Persian Gulf In the Qarmatians pillaged Mecca outraging the Muslim world particularly with their theft of the Black Stone In an Arab sheikh named Abdullah bin Ali Al Uyuni defeated the Qarmatians in Bahrain and al Hasa with the help of the Seljuq Empire and founded the Uyunid dynasty The Uyunid Emirate later underwent expansion with its territory stretching from Najd to the Syrian Desert They were overthrown by the Usfurids in Usfurid rule was weakened after Persian rulers of Hormuz captured Bahrain and Qatif in The vassals of Ormuz the Shia Jarwanid dynasty came to rule eastern Arabia in the th century The Jabrids took control of the region after overthrowing the Jarwanids in the th century and clashed with Hormuz for more than two decades over the region for its economic revenues until finally agreeing to pay tribute in Al Muntafiq tribe later took over the region and came under Ottoman suzerainty The Bani Khalid tribe later revolted against them in the th century and took control Their rule extended from Iraq to Oman at its height and they too came under Ottoman suzerainty br br br Ottoman Hejaz br br In the th century the Ottomans added the Red Sea and Persian Gulf coast the Hejaz Asir and Al Ahsa to the empire and claimed suzerainty over the interior One reason was to thwart Portuguese attempts to attack the Red Sea hence the Hejaz and the Indian Ocean The Ottoman degree of control over these lands varied over the next four centuries with the fluctuating strength or weakness of the empire s central authority These changes contributed to later uncertainties such as the dispute with Transjordan over the inclusion of the sanjak of Ma an including the cities of Ma an and Aqaba br br br Saud dynasty and unification br br The emergence of what was to become the Saudi royal family known as the Al Saud began at the town of Diriyah in Nejd in central Arabia with the accession as emir of Muhammad bin Saud on February In he joined forces with the religious leader Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab founder of the Wahhabi movement a strict puritanical form of Sunni Islam This alliance provided the ideological impetus to Saudi expansion and remains the basis of Saudi Arabian dynastic rule today br The Emirate of Diriyah established in the area around Riyadh rapidly expanded and briefly controlled most of the present day territory of Saudi Arabia sacking Karbala in and capturing Mecca in In it was destroyed by the Ottoman viceroy of Egypt Mohammed Ali Pasha The much smaller Emirate of Nejd was established in Throughout the rest of the th century the Al Saud contested control of the interior of what was to become Saudi Arabia with another Arabian ruling family the Al Rashid who ruled the Emirate of Jabal Shammar By the Al Rashid were victorious and the Al Saud were driven into exile in Kuwait br br At the beginning of the th century the Ottoman Empire continued to control or have a suzerainty over most of the peninsula Subject to this suzerainty Arabia was ruled by a patchwork of tribal rulers with the Sharif of Mecca having pre eminence and ruling the Hejaz In Abdul Rahman s son Abdul Aziz later known as Ibn Saud recaptured control of Riyadh bringing the Al Saud back to Nejd creating the third Saudi state Ibn Saud gained the support of the Ikhwan a tribal army inspired by Wahhabism and led by Faisal Al Dawish and which had grown quickly after its foundation in With the aid of the Ikhwan Ibn Saud captured Al Ahsa from the Ottomans in br In with the encouragement and support of Britain which was fighting the Ottomans in World War I the Sharif of Mecca Hussein bin Ali led a pan Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire to create a united Arab state Although the revolt failed in its objective the Allied victory in World War I resulted in the end of Ottoman suzerainty and control in Arabia and Hussein bin Ali became King of Hejaz br Ibn Saud avoided involvement in the Arab Revolt and instead continued his struggle with the Al Rashid Following the latter s final defeat he took the title Sultan of Nejd in With the help of the Ikhwan the Kingdom of Hejaz was conquered in and on January Ibn Saud declared himself king of Hejaz For the next five years he administered the two parts of his dual kingdom as separate units br After the conquest of the Hejaz the Ikhwan leadership s objective switched to expansion of the Wahhabist realm into the British protectorates of Transjordan Iraq and Kuwait and began raiding those territories This met with Ibn Saud s opposition as he recognized the danger of a direct conflict with the British At the same time the Ikhwan became disenchanted with Ibn Saud s domestic policies which appeared to favour modernization and the increase in the number of non Muslim foreigners in the country As a result they turned against Ibn Saud and after a two year struggle were defeated in at the Battle of Sabilla where their leaders were massacred On Ibn Saud s behalf Prince Faisal declared the unification on September and the two kingdoms of Hejaz and Nejd were unified as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia That date is now a national holiday called Saudi National Day br br br th century br br The new kingdom was reliant on limited agriculture and pilgrimage revenues In vast reserves of oil were discovered in the Al Ahsa region along the coast of the Persian Gulf and full scale development of the oil fields began in under the US controlled Aramco Arabian American Oil Company Oil provided Saudi Arabia with economic prosperity and substantial political leverage internationally br Cultural life rapidly developed primarily in the Hejaz which was the centre for newspapers and radio However the large influx of foreign workers in Saudi Arabia in the oil industry increased the pre existing propensity for xenophobia At the same time the government became increasingly wasteful and extravagant By the s this had led to large governmental deficits and excessive foreign borrowing br In Saud of Saudi Arabia succeeded as the king of Saudi Arabia In he was deposed in favour of his half brother Faisal of Saudi Arabia after an intense rivalry fuelled by doubts in the royal family over Saud s competence In Saudi Arabia gained a control in Aramco thereby decreasing US control over Saudi oil In Saudi Arabia led an oil boycott against the Western countries that supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War against Egypt and Syria leading to the quadrupling of oil prices In Faisal was assassinated by his nephew Prince Faisal bin Musaid and was succeeded by his half brother King Khalid br br By Saudi Arabia had become the largest oil producer in the world Khalid s reign saw economic and social development progress at an extremely rapid rate transforming the infrastructure and educational system of the country in foreign policy close ties with the US were developed In two events occurred which greatly concerned the government and had a long term influence on Saudi foreign and domestic policy The first was the Iranian Islamic Revolution It was feared that the country s Shi ite minority in the Eastern Province which is also the location of the oil fields might rebel under the influence of their Iranian co religionists There were several anti government uprisings in the region such as the Qatif Uprising The second event was the Grand Mosque Seizure in Mecca by Islamist extremists The militants involved were in part angered by what they considered to be the corruption and un Islamic nature of the Saudi government The government regained control of the mosque after days and those captured were executed Part of the response of the royal family was to enforce the much stricter observance of traditional religious and social norms in the country for example the closure of cinemas and to give the ulema a greater role in government Neither entirely succeeded as Islamism continued to grow in strength br br In Saudi Arabia bought out the American interests in Aramco King Khalid died of a heart attack in June He was succeeded by his brother King Fahd who added the title Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques to his name in in response to considerable fundamentalist pressure to avoid the use of majesty in association with anything except God Fahd continued to develop close relations with the United States and increased the purchase of American and British military equipment br The vast wealth generated by oil revenues was beginning to have an even greater impact on Saudi society It led to rapid technological but not cultural modernization urbanization mass public education and the creation of new media This and the presence of increasingly large numbers of foreign workers greatly affected traditional Saudi norms and values Although there was a dramatic change in the social and economic life of the country political power continued to be monopolized by the royal family leading to discontent among many Saudis who began to look for wider participation in government br In the s Saudi Arabia spent billion in support of Saddam Hussein in the Iran Iraq War however Saudi Arabia condemned the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in and asked the US to intervene King Fahd allowed American and coalition troops to be stationed in Saudi Arabia He invited the Kuwaiti government and many of its citizens to stay in Saudi Arabia but expelled citizens of Yemen and Jordan because of their governments support of Iraq In Saudi Arabian forces were involved both in bombing raids on Iraq and in the land invasion that helped to liberate Kuwait br Saudi Arabia s relations with the West was one of the issues that led to an increase in Islamist terrorism in Saudi Arabia as well as Islamist terrorist attacks in Western countries by Saudi nationals Osama bin Laden was a Saudi citizen until stripped of his citizenship in and was responsible for the U S embassy bombings in East Africa and the USS Cole bombing near the port of Aden Yemen of the hijackers involved in the September attacks were Saudi nationals Many Saudis who did not support the Islamist terrorists were nevertheless deeply unhappy with the government s policies br Islamism was not the only source of hostility to the government Although extremely wealthy by the st century Saudi Arabia s economy was near stagnant High taxes and a growth in unemployment have contributed to discontent and have been reflected in a rise in civil unrest and discontent with the royal family In response a number of limited reforms were initiated by King Fahd In March he introduced the Basic Law which emphasized the duties and responsibilities of a ruler In December the Consultative Council was inaugurated It is composed of a chairman and members all chosen by the King Fahd made it clear that he did not have democracy in mind saying A system based on elections is not consistent with our Islamic creed which approves of government by consultation sh r br In Fahd suffered a debilitating stroke and the Crown Prince Abdullah assumed the role of de facto regent however his authority was hindered by conflict with Fahd s full brothers known with Fahd as the Sudairi Seven br br br st century br Signs of discontent included in and a series of bombings and armed violence in Riyadh Jeddah Yanbu and Khobar In February April the first ever nationwide municipal elections were held in Saudi Arabia Women were not allowed to take part br br In King Fahd died and was succeeded by Abdullah who continued the policy of minimum reform and clamping down on protests The king introduced economic reforms aimed at reducing the country s reliance on oil revenue limited deregulation encouragement of foreign investment and privatization In February Abdullah announced a series of governmental changes to the judiciary armed forces and various ministries to modernize these institutions including the replacement of senior appointees in the judiciary and the Mutaween religious police with more moderate individuals and the appointment of the country s first female deputy minister br On January hundreds of protesters gathered in Jeddah in a rare display of criticism against the city s poor infrastructure after flooding killed people Police stopped the demonstration after about minutes and arrested to people br Since Saudi Arabia has been affected by its own Arab Spring protests In response King Abdullah announced on February a series of benefits for citizens amounting to billion of which billion was earmarked for housing No political reforms were included though some prisoners indicted for financial crimes were pardoned Abdullah also announced a package of billion which included new homes to a cost of billion in addition to creating new security jobs Although male only municipal elections were held on September Abdullah allowed women to vote and be elected in the municipal elections and also to be nominated to the Shura Council br br br Geography br br Saudi Arabia occupies about of the Arabian Peninsula the world s largest peninsula lying between latitudes and N and longitudes and E Because the country s southeastern and southern borders with the United Arab Emirates and Oman are not precisely marked the exact size of the country is undefined The United Nations Statistics Division estimates km sq mi and lists Saudi Arabia as the world s th largest state It is geographically the largest country in the Middle East and on the Arabian Plate br Saudi Arabia s geography is dominated by the Arabian Desert associated semi desert shrubland steppes several mountain ranges volcanic lava fields and highlands The km sq mi Rub al Khali Empty Quarter in the southeastern part of the country is the world s largest contiguous sand desert Though there are lakes in the country Saudi Arabia is the largest country in the world by area with no permanent rivers Wadis non permanent rivers however are very numerous throughout the kingdom The fertile areas are to be found in the alluvial deposits in wadis basins and oases There are approximately islands in the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf br The main topographical feature is the central plateau which rises abruptly from the Red Sea and gradually descends into the Nejd and toward the Arabian Gulf On the Red Sea coast there is a narrow coastal plain known as the Tihamah parallel to which runs along an imposing escarpment The southwest province of Asir is mountainous and contains the m ft Jabal Ferwa which is the highest point in the country Saudi Arabia is home to more than dormant volcanoes Lava fields in Hejaz known locally by their Arabic name of harrat the singular is harrah form one of Earth s largest alkali basalt regions covering some square kilometres sq mi br Except for the southwestern regions such as Asir Saudi Arabia has a desert climate with very high day time temperatures during the summer and a sharp temperature drop at night Average summer temperatures are around C F but can be as high as C F In the winter the temperature rarely drops below C F with the exception of mostly the northern regions of the country where annual snowfall in particular in the mountainous regions of Tabuk Province is not uncommon The lowest recorded temperature C F was measured in Turaif br In the spring and autumn the heat is temperate temperatures average around C F Annual rainfall is very low The southern regions differ in that they are influenced by the Indian Ocean monsoons usually occurring between October and March An average of mm in of rainfall occurs during this period which is about of the annual precipitation br br br Biodiversity br br Saudi Arabia is home to five terrestrial ecoregions Arabian Peninsula coastal fog desert Southwestern Arabian foothills savanna Southwestern Arabian montane woodlands Arabian Desert and Red Sea Nubo Sindian tropical desert and semi desert Wildlife includes the Arabian leopard Arabian wolf striped hyena mongoose baboon Cape hare sand cat and jerboa Animals such as gazelles oryx leopards and cheetahs were relatively numerous until the th century when extensive hunting reduced these animals almost to extinction The culturally important Asiatic lion occurred in Saudi Arabia until the late th century before it was hunted to extinction in the wild Birds include falcons which are caught and trained for hunting eagles hawks vultures sandgrouse and bulbuls There are several species of snakes many of which are venomous Domesticated animals include the legendary Arabian horse Arabian camel sheep goats cows donkeys chickens etc br The Red Sea is a rich and diverse ecosystem with more than species of fish around of which are endemic This also includes species of deep water fish The rich diversity is partly owed to the km mi of coral reef extending along the coastline these fringing reefs are largely formed of stony acropora and porites corals The reefs form platforms and sometimes lagoons along the coast and occasional other features such as cylinders such as the Blue Hole at Dahab These coastal reefs are also visited by pelagic species including some of the species of shark There are many offshore reefs including several atolls Many of the unusual offshore reef formations defy classic i e Darwinian coral reef classification schemes and are generally attributed to the high levels of tectonic activity that characterize the area br Reflecting the country s dominant desert conditions plant life mostly consists of herbs plants and shrubs that require little water The date palm Phoenix dactylifera is widespread br br br Government and politics br br Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy however according to the Basic Law of Saudi Arabia adopted by royal decree in the king must comply with Sharia Islamic law and the Quran while the Quran and the Sunnah the traditions of Muhammad are declared to be the country s constitution No political parties or national elections are permitted While some critics consider it to be a totalitarian state others regard it as lacking aspects of totalitarianism but nevertheless classify it as an authoritarian regime The Economist ranked the Saudi government th out of in its Democracy Index and Freedom House gave it its lowest Not Free rating giving it a score of out of for According to the V Dem Democracy Indices Saudi Arabia is the least democratic country in the Middle East br In the absence of national elections and political parties politics in Saudi Arabia takes place in two distinct arenas within the royal family the Al Saud and between the royal family and the rest of Saudi society Outside of the Al Saud participation in the political process is limited to a relatively small segment of the population and takes the form of the royal family consulting with the ulema tribal sheikhs and members of important commercial families on major decisions This process is not reported by the Saudi media br br By custom all males of full age have a right to petition the king directly through the traditional tribal meeting known as the majlis In many ways the approach to government differs little from the traditional system of tribal rule Tribal identity remains strong and outside of the royal family political influence is frequently determined by tribal affiliation with tribal sheikhs maintaining a considerable degree of influence over local and national events In recent years there have been limited steps to widen political participation such as the establishment of the Consultative Council in the early s and the National Dialogue Forum in In the first municipal elections were held In the Allegiance Council was created to regulate the succession In the king made significant personnel changes to the government by appointing reformers to key positions and the first woman to a ministerial post however these changes have been criticized as being too slow or merely cosmetic br The rule of the Al Saud faces political opposition from four sources Sunni Islamist activism liberal critics the Shi ite minority particularly in the Eastern Province and long standing tribal and regionalist particularistic opponents for example in the Hejaz Of these the minority activists have been the most prominent threat to the government and have in recent years been involved in violent incidents in the country However open protest against the government even if peaceful is not tolerated br br br Monarchy and royal family br br The king combines legislative executive and judicial functions and royal decrees form the basis of the country s legislation Until the king was also the prime minister and presided over the Council of Ministers of Saudi Arabia and Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia The royal family dominates the political system The family s vast numbers allows it to control most of the kingdom s important posts and to have an involvement and presence at all levels of government The number of princes is estimated to be at least with most power and influence being wielded by the or so male descendants of Ibn Saud The key ministries are generally reserved for the royal family as are the regional governorships br br The Saudi government and the royal family have often been accused of corruption over many years and this continues into the st century In a country that is said to belong to the royal family and is named for them the lines between state assets and the personal wealth of senior princes are blurred The extent of corruption has been described as systemic and endemic and its existence was acknowledged and defended by Prince Bandar bin Sultan a senior member of the royal family in an interview in br In its Corruption Perceptions Index for Transparency International gave Saudi Arabia a score of on a scale from to where is highly corrupt and is highly clean Saudi Arabia has undergone a process of political and social reform such as to increase public transparency and good governance but nepotism and patronage are widespread when doing business in the country the enforcement of the anti corruption laws is selective and public officials engage in corruption with impunity As many as people including prominent Saudi Arabian princes government ministers and businesspeople were arrested in an anti corruption campaign in November br br br Al ash Sheikh and role of the ulema br br Saudi Arabia is unique in giving the ulema the body of Islamic religious leaders and jurists a direct role in government The preferred ulema are of the Salafi movement The ulema have been a key influence in major government decisions for example the imposition of the oil embargo in and the invitation to foreign troops to Saudi Arabia in In addition they have had a major role in the judicial and education systems and a monopoly of authority in religious and social morals br By the s as a result of oil wealth and the modernization initiated by King Faisal important changes to Saudi society were underway and the power of the ulema was in decline However this changed following the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca in by Islamist radicals The government s response to the crisis included strengthening the ulema s powers and increasing their financial support in particular they were given greater control over the education system and allowed to enforce the stricter observance of Wahhabi rules of moral and social behaviour After his accession to the throne in King Abdullah took steps to reduce the powers of the ulema for instance transferring control over girls education to the Ministry of Education br The ulema have historically been led by the Al ash Sheikh the country s leading religious family The Al ash Sheikh are the descendants of Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab the th century founder of the Wahhabi form of Sunni Islam which is today dominant in Saudi Arabia The family is second in prestige only to the Al Saud the royal family with whom they formed a mutual support pact and power sharing arrangement nearly years ago The pact which persists to this day is based on the Al Saud maintaining the Al ash Sheikh s authority in religious matters and upholding and propagating Wahhabi doctrine In return the Al ash Sheikh support the Al Saud s political authority thereby using its religious moral authority to legitimize the royal family s rule Although the Al ash Sheikh s domination of the ulema has diminished in recent decades they still hold the most important religious posts and are closely linked to the Al Saud by a high degree of intermarriage br br br Legal system br br The primary source of law is the Islamic Sharia derived from the teachings of the Qur an and the Sunnah the traditions of the Prophet Saudi Arabia is unique among modern Muslim states in that Sharia is not codified and there is no system of judicial precedent allowing judges to use independent legal reasoning to make a decision Thus divergent judgments arise even in apparently identical cases making predictability of legal interpretation difficult Saudi judges tend to follow the principles of the Hanbali school of jurisprudence fiqh found in pre modern texts and noted for its literalist interpretation of the Qur an and hadith However in Saudi Arabia announced judicial reforms which will lead to an entirely codified law that eliminates discrepancies br Royal decrees are the other main source of law but are referred to as regulations rather than laws because they are subordinate to the Sharia Royal decrees supplement Sharia in areas such as labour commercial and corporate law Additionally traditional tribal law and custom remain significant Extra Sharia government tribunals usually handle disputes relating to specific royal decrees Final appeal from both Sharia courts and government tribunals is to the king and all courts and tribunals follow Sharia rules of evidence and procedure br Retaliatory punishments or Qisas are practised for instance an eye can be surgically removed at the insistence of a victim who lost his own eye Families of someone unlawfully killed can choose between demanding the death penalty or granting clemency in return for a payment of diyya blood money by the perpetrator br br br Administrative divisions br br Saudi Arabia is divided into regions Arabic manatiq id riyya sing mintaqah idariyya The regions are further divided into governorates Arabic muhafazat sing muhafazah This number includes the regional capitals which have a different status as municipalities Arabic amanah headed by mayors Arabic amin The governorates are further subdivided into sub governorates Arabic marakiz sing markaz br br br Foreign relations br br Saudi Arabia joined the UN in and is a founding member of the Arab League Gulf Cooperation Council Muslim World League and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference now the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation It plays a prominent role in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and in joined the World Trade Organization br br Since as a founding member of OPEC its oil pricing policy has been generally to stabilize the world oil market and try to moderate sharp price movements so as not to jeopardize the Western economies In Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations imposed an oil embargo against the United States United Kingdom Japan and other Western nations which supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War of October The embargo caused an oil crisis with many short and long term effects on global politics and the global economy br Saudi Arabia and the United States are strategic allies and Saudi Arabia is considered to be pro Western On May President Donald Trump and King Salman signed a series of letters of intent for Saudi Arabia to purchase arms from the United States totaling billion over years Saudi Arabia s role in the Gulf War particularly the stationing of US troops on Saudi soil from prompted the development of a hostile Islamist response internally As a result Saudi Arabia has to some extent distanced itself from the US and for example refused to support or to participate in the US led invasion of Iraq in br China and Saudi Arabia are major allies with the relationship between the two countries growing significantly in recent decades A significant number of Saudi Arabians have also expressed a positive view of China In February Crown Prince Mohammad defended China s Xinjiang re education camps for Uyghur Muslims According to The Diplomat Saudi Arabia s human rights record has come under frequent attack abroad and so defending China becomes a roundabout way of defending themselves br The consequences of the invasion and the Arab Spring led to increasing alarm within the Saudi monarchy over the rise of Iran s influence in the region These fears were reflected in comments of King Abdullah who privately urged the United States to attack Iran and cut off the head of the snake br br Saudi Arabia has been seen as a moderating influence in the Arab Israeli conflict periodically putting forward a peace plan between Israel and the Palestinians and condemning Hezbollah Saudi Arabia halted new trade and investment dealings with Canada and suspended diplomatic ties in a dramatic escalation of a dispute over the kingdom s arrest of women s rights activist Samar Badawi on August br In as part of its nuclear power programme Saudi Arabia planned to extract uranium domestically taking a step towards self sufficiency in producing nuclear fuel br br br Allegations of sponsoring global terrorism br br Saudi Arabia has been accused of sponsoring Islamic terrorism According to Iraq Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki in March Saudi Arabia along with Qatar provided political financial and media support to terrorists against the Iraqi government Similarly President of Syria Bashar al Assad noted that the sources of the extreme ideology of the terrorist organization ISIS and other such salafist extremist groups are the Wahabbism that has been supported by the royal family of Saudi Arabia br Relations with the U S became strained following terror attacks American politicians and media accused the Saudi government of supporting terrorism and tolerating a jihadist culture Indeed Osama bin Laden and out of the hijackers were from Saudi Arabia in ISIL occupied Raqqa in mid all judges were Saudi The leaked U S Department of State memo says that governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIS and other radical groups in the region According to former U S Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Saudi Arabia remains a critical financial support base for al Qaida the Taliban LeT and other terrorist groups Donors in Saudi Arabia constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups
