The Freedom of Information Act FOIA FOY y U S C is the United States federal freedom of information law that requires the full or partial disclosure of previously unreleased or uncirculated information and documents controlled by the U S government upon request The act defines agency records subject to disclosure outlines mandatory disclosure procedures and includes nine exemptions that define categories of information not subject to disclosure The act was intended to make U S government agencies functions more transparent so that the American public could more easily identify problems in government functioning and put pressure on Congress agency officials and the president to address them The FOIA has been changed repeatedly by both the legislative and executive branches br The FOIA is commonly known for being invoked by news organizations for reporting purposes though such uses make up less than of all requests which are more frequently made by businesses law firms and individuals br br br Background br As indicated by its long title the Freedom of Information Act FOIA was moved from its original home in Section of the Administrative Procedure Act APA Section of the APA as enacted in gave agencies broad discretion concerning the publication of governmental records Following concerns that the provision had become more of a withholding than a disclosure mechanism Congress amended the section in as a standalone act to implement a general philosophy of full agency disclosure The amendment required agencies to publish their rules of procedure in the Federal Register U S C a C and to make available for public inspection and copying their opinions statements of policy interpretations and staff manuals and instructions that are not already published in the Federal Register a In addition a requires every agency upon any request for records which reasonably describes such records to make such records promptly available to any person By a B if an agency improperly withholds any documents the district court has jurisdiction to order their production Unlike the review of other agency action that must be upheld if supported by substantial evidence and not arbitrary or capricious FOIA expressly places the burden on the agency to sustain its action and directs the district courts to determine the matter de novo br With the ongoing stress on both constitutional and inherent rights of American citizens and the added assertion of government subservience to the individual some particularly representative John E Moss thought that it was necessary for government information to be available to the public This push built on existing principles and protocols of government administration already in place br Others though most notably President Lyndon B Johnson believed that certain types of unclassified government information should nonetheless remain secret Notwithstanding the White House s opposition Congress expanded Section of the APA as a standalone measure in to further standardize the publication of government records consistent with the belief that the people have the right to know about them The Privacy Act of was passed as a countervailing measure to ensure the security of government documents increasingly kept on private citizens br br br Scope br The act explicitly applies only to government agencies under the executive branch These agencies are required by several mandates to comply with public solicitation of information Along with making public and accessible all bureaucratic and technical procedures for applying for documents from that agency agencies are also subject to penalties for hindering the process of a petition for information According to the act if agency personnel acted arbitrarily or capriciously with respect to the withholding the Special Counsel shall promptly initiate a proceeding to determine whether disciplinary action is warranted against the officer or employee who was primarily responsible for the withholding In this way there is recourse for one seeking information to go to a federal court if suspicion of illegal tampering or delayed sending of records exists However nine exemptions address issues of sensitivity and personal rights They are as listed in U S C br br A specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and B are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order br related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency br specifically exempted from disclosure by statute other than section b of this title provided that such statute A requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue or B establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld FOIA Exemption Statutes br trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential br inter agency or intra agency memoranda or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency br personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy br records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information A could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings B would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication C could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy D could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source including a State local or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis and in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation information furnished by a confidential source E would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law or F could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual br contained in or related to examination operating or condition reports prepared by on behalf of or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions or br geological and geophysical information and data including maps concerning wells br The Postal Reorganization Act of at U S C c exempts the U S Postal Service from disclosure of information of a commercial nature including trade secrets whether or not obtained from a person outside the Postal Service which under good business practice would not be publicly disclosed br A federal court has concisely described the vital role of the FOIA in democracy br br It has often been observed that the central purpose of the FOIA is to open up the workings of government to public scrutiny One of the premises of that objective is the belief that an informed electorate is vital to the proper operation of a democracy A more specific goal implicit in the foregoing principles is to give citizens access to the information on the basis of which government agencies make their decisions thereby equipping the populace to evaluate and criticize those decisions br br br Legislative history br The law came about because of the determination of U S House of Representatives member John E Moss of California who was chairman of the House Government Information Subcommittee It took Moss years to get the FOIA through Congress Much of the desire for government transparency stemmed from the Department of Defense and Congressional committees evaluation of the nation s classification system in the late s They determined that the misuse of government classification of documents was causing insiders to leak documents that were marked confidential The committee also determined that the lowest rung of the confidentiality ladder confidential should be removed They deemed that secret and top secret covered National security adequately The Moss Committee took it upon itself to reform confidentiality policy and implement punishments for the overuse of classification by officials and departments br br br Initial enactment br The FOIA was initially introduced as the bill S in the th Congress When the two page bill was signed into law it became Pub L Tooltip Public Law United States Stat enacted July but had an effective date of one year after the date of enactment or July The law set up the structure of FOIA as we know it today President Lyndon B Johnson despite his misgivings signed the FOIA into law br That law was initially repealed During the period between the enactment of the act and its effective date Title of the United States Code was enacted into positive law For reasons now unclear but which may have had to do with the way the enactment of Title changed how the law being amended was supposed to be cited the original Freedom of Information Act was replaced A new act in Pub L Tooltip Public Law United States Stat enacted June originally H R in the th Congress repealed the original and put in its place a substantively identical law This statute was signed on June and had the same effective date as the original statute July br br br Amendments and executive actions br br br Privacy Act Amendments of br Following the Watergate scandal President Gerald R Ford wanted to sign FOIA strengthening amendments in the Privacy Act of but White House Chief of Staff Donald Rumsfeld and deputy Dick Cheney were concerned about leaks Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel Antonin Scalia advised the bill was unconstitutional and even telephoned the CIA asking them to lobby a particular White House staffer President Ford was persuaded to veto the bill on October according to documents declassified in However on November the lame duck Congress overrode President Ford s veto giving the United States the core Freedom of Information Act still in effect today with judicial review of executive secrecy claims br Scalia remained highly critical of the amendments writing years later that It is the Taj Mahal of the Doctrine of Unanticipated Consequences the Sistine Chapel of Cost Benefit Analysis Ignored Scalia particularly disliked the availability of judicial review decrying that if an agency denies a freedom of information request shazam the full force of the Third Branch of the government is summoned to the wronged party s assistance br Those amendments to the FOIA regulate government control of documents that concern a citizen They give one the right to see records about one self subject to the Privacy Act s exemptions the right to amend that record if it is inaccurate irrelevant untimely or incomplete and the right to sue the government for violations of the statute including permitting others to see one s records unless specifically permitted by the Act In conjunction with the FOIA the Privacy Act is used to further the rights of an individual gaining access to information held by the government The Justice Department s Office of Information and Privacy and federal district courts are the two channels of appeal available to seekers of information br br br Government in the Sunshine Act amendments br In as part of the Government in the Sunshine Act Exemption of the FOIA was amended so that several exemptions were specified br br Information relating to national defense br Related solely to internal personnel rules and practices br Related to accusing a person of a crime br Related to information where disclosure would constitute a breach of privacy br Related to investigatory records where the information would harm the proceedings br Related to information which would lead to financial speculation or endanger the stability of any financial institution and br Related to the agency s participation in legal proceedings br br br Executive Order limiting the FOIA br Between and President Reagan s Executive Order allowed federal agencies to withhold enormous amounts of information under Exemption relating to national security information claiming it would better protect the country and strengthen national security br The outcry from the effect that the Reagan Order had on FOIA requests was a factor in leading President Clinton to dramatically alter the criteria in br br br Omnibus Anti Drug Abuse Act amendments to the FOIA br The FOIA amendments were a small part of the bipartisan Anti Drug Abuse Act of Congress amended FOIA to address the fees charged by different categories of requesters and the scope of access to law enforcement and national security records The amendments are not referenced in the congressional reports on the Act so the floor statements provide an indication of Congressional intent br br br expansion br Between and President Clinton issued executive directives and amendments to the directives that allowed the release of previously classified national security documents more than years old and of historical interest as part of the FOIA This release of information allowed many previously publicly unknown details about the Cold War and other historical events to be discussed openly br br br Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of br br The Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of E FOIA stated that all agencies are required by statute to make certain types of records created by the agency on or after November available electronically Agencies must also provide electronic reading rooms for citizens to use to have access to records Given the large volume of records and limited resources the amendment also extended the agencies required response time to FOIA requests Formerly the response time was ten days and the amendment extended it to twenty business days br br br Executive Order limiting the FOIA br Executive Order drafted by Alberto R Gonzales and issued by President George W Bush on November restricted access to the records of former presidents br This order was revoked on January as part of President Barack Obama s Executive Order Public access to presidential records was restored to the original extent of five years for some records outlined in the Presidential Records Act br br br Intelligence Authorization Act of amending the FOIA br In Congress passed the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year Pub L Tooltip Public Law United States text PDF Within this omnibus legislation were amendments to the FOIA pertaining mainly to intelligence agencies entitled Prohibition on Compliance with Requests for Information Submitted by Foreign Governments br br Section a of title United States Code is amended br in subparagraph A by inserting and except as provided in subparagraph E after of this subsection and br by adding at the end the following br br E An agency or part of an agency that is an element of the intelligence community as that term is defined in section of the National Security Act of U S C a shall not make any record available under this paragraph to br i any government entity other than a State territory commonwealth or district of the United States or any subdivision thereof or br ii a representative of a government entity described in clause i br In effect this new language precluded any covered U S intelligence agency from disclosing records in response to FOIA requests made by foreign governments or international governmental organizations By its terms it prohibits disclosure in response to requests made by such non U S governmental entities either directly or through a representative This means that for any FOIA request that by its nature appears as if it might have been made by or on behalf of a non U S governmental entity a covered agency may inquire into the particular circumstances of the requester in order to properly implement this new FOIA provision br The agencies affected by this amendment are those that are part of or contain an element of the intelligence community As defined in the National Security Act of as amended they consist of the CIA the National Security Agency the Defense Intelligence Agency the National Imagery and Mapping Agency the National Reconnaissance Office and certain other reconnaissance offices within the Department of Defense the intelligence elements of the Army the Navy the Air Force and the Marine Corps the FBI the Department of the Treasury the Department of Energy and the Coast Guard the Department of Homeland Security the Bureau of Intelligence and Research in the Department of State and such other elements of any other department or agency as may be designated by the President or designated jointly by the Director of Central Intelligence and the head of the department or agency concerned as an element of the intelligence community br br br OPEN Government Act of br President Bush signed the Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act of Pub L Tooltip Public Law United States text PDF on December This law also known as the OPEN Government Act of amended the federal FOIA statute in several ways According to a White House press release it does so by br br establishing a definition of a representative of the news media br directing that required attorney fees be paid from an agency s own appropriation rather than from the Judgment Fund br prohibiting an agency from assessing certain fees if it fails to comply with FOIA deadlines and br establishing an Office of Government Information Services OGIS in the National Archives and Records Administration to review agency compliance with FOIA br Changes include the following br br it recognizes electronic media specifically and defines News Media as any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work and distributes that work to an audience br it extends the day deadline by allowing for up to days between the FOIA office of the agency and the component of the agency holding the records and specifically allows for clarification of requests by the FOIA office Effective br it calls for each agency to designate a FOIA Public Liaison who shall assist in the resolution of any disputes Effective br it requires agencies to assign tracking numbers to FOIA requests that take longer than days and to provide systems determining the status of a request br it codifies and defines annual reporting requirements for each agency s FOIA program br it specifically addresses data sources used to generate reports shall make the raw statistical data used in its reports available electronically br it redefines the definition of an agency record to include information held for an agency by a government contractor br it establishes an Office of Government Information Services OGIS which will offer mediation services to resolve disputes as non exclusive alternative to litigation br it requires agencies to make recommendations personnel matters related to FOIA such as whether FOIA performance should be used as a merit factor br it requires agencies to specify the specific exemption for each deletion or redaction in disclosed documents br br br Executive Order permitting retroactive classification br On December President Barack Obama issued Executive Order which allows the government to classify certain specific types of information relevant to national security after it has been requested That is a request for information that meets the criteria for availability under FOIA can still be denied if the government determines that the information should have been classified and unavailable It also sets a timeline for automatic declassification of old information that is not specifically identified as requiring continued secrecy br br br repeal of FOIA amendments in Wall Street reform act br The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act signed into law in July included provisions in section I that shielded the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC from requests under the Freedom of Information Act The provisions were initially motivated out of concern that the FOIA would hinder SEC investigations that involved trade secrets of financial companies including watch lists they gathered about other companies trading records of investment managers and trading algorithms used by investment firms br In September the th Congress passed an act repealing those provisions The act was introduced in the Senate on August as S and given the name A bill to amend the Securities Exchange Act of the Investment Company Act of and the Investment Advisers Act of to provide for certain disclosures under section of title United States Code commonly referred to as the Freedom of Information Act and for other purposes br br br Notable cases br A major issue in released documentation is government redaction of certain passages deemed applicable to the Exemption section of the FOIA Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI officers in charge of responding to FOIA requests so heavily redacted the released records as to preclude needed research This has also brought into question just how one can verify that they have been given complete records in response to a request br br br J Edgar Hoover br br This trend of unwillingness to release records was especially evident in the process of making public the FBI files on J Edgar Hoover Of the files and about eighteen thousand pages collected by the FBI two thirds were withheld from Athan G Theoharis most notably one entire folder entitled the White House Security Survey Despite finding out that the Truman Library had an accessible file which documented all the reports of this folder the FBI and Office of Information and Privacy put forth stony resistance to the FOIA appeal process br br br Department of Justice v Landano murder trial br A murder trial decided in Department of Justice v Landano U S involved what was alleged to be a felony murder committed during a group burglary by defendant Landano Justice Sandra Day O Connor wrote the unanimous opinion In an effort to support his claim in subsequent state court proceedings that the prosecution violated Brady v Maryland U S by withholding material exculpatory evidence he filed Freedom of Information Act FOIA requests with the FBI for information it had compiled in connection with the murder investigation br In defense the FBI put forth a claim that the redacted sections of the documents requested were withheld in accordance with FOIA regulations protecting the identity of informants who gave information regarding case details However O Connor ruled that those who supplied information had no need to remain anonymous in the court setting To the extent that the Government s proof may compromise legitimate interests the Government still can attempt to meet its burden with in camera affidavits The court thus remanded the case to the Circuit Courts and rejected the FBI s claim of confidentiality as being a valid reason to withhold information br While most individual sources may expect confidentiality the Government offers no explanation other than administrative ease why that expectation always should be presumed Thus when Theoharis and company were in the middle of fighting in court to obtain J Edgar Hoover files they may well have benefited from Landano and also Janet Reno s assertions of the government s need for greater openness and discretionary releases in br br br Iran Contra affair e mails br In the case of Scott Armstrong v Executive Office of the President et al the White House used the PROFS computer communications software With encryption designed for secure messaging PROFS notes concerning the Iran Contra affair arms for hostages under the Reagan Administration were insulated However they were also backed up and transferred to paper memos The National Security Council on the eve of President George H W Bush s inauguration planned to destroy these records The National Security Archive Armstrong s association for the preservation of government historical documents obtained an injunction in Federal District Court against the head John Fawcett of the National Archives and Records Administration and the National Security Council s purging of PROFS records A Temporary Restraining Order was approved by Senior U S District Court Judge Barrington D Parker Suit was filed at District Court under Judge Richey who upheld the injunction of PROFS records br Richey gave a further injunction to prevent a purging of the George H W Bush s administration s records as well On counts of leaving the White House clean for the new Clinton Administration the Bush group appealed but was denied its request Finally the Clinton Administration appealed to the U S Court of Appeals stating that the National Security Council was not truly an agency but a group of aides to the President and thus not subject to FOIA regulations Under the Presidential Records Act FOIA requests for NSC could not be filed until five years after the president ha d left office or twelve years if the records were classified The Clinton administration won and the National Security Archive was not granted a writ of certiorari by the Supreme Court on these grounds According to Scott Armstrong taking into account labor and material costs the three presidential administrations spent almost million on contesting the National Security Archive FOIA requests for PROFS e mail records br br br Secret e mail accounts and abusive fees br In the Associated Press uncovered several federal agencies where staff regularly used fictitious identities and secret or unlisted email accounts to conduct government business The use of these email accounts stymied FOIA requests In some cases the government demanded exorbitant greater than million fees for records that appeals showed should be available for minimal cost br br br Processing time br br The act contains a provision legally requiring agencies to respond to FOIA requests within days but for two main reasons many agencies rarely meet this requirement First the task of screening requests for sensitive or classified information is often arduous and lengthy at agencies like the FBI and the CIA Second congressional funding for agency staff to handle FOIA requests is usually far less than the necessary amount to hire sufficient employees As a result parties who request information under FOIA often end up filing lawsuits in federal court seeking judicial orders forcing the agencies to comply with their FOIA requests br The first major case of this type was the case Open America v Watergate Special Prosecution Force in which Open America had filed a FOIA request with the U S Attorney General and the FBI requesting copies of all their documents relating to the role of former FBI Director L Patrick Gray in the Watergate scandal The FBI had over pending FOIA requests at the time and did not respond within the statutory day limit Open America sued in the U S District Court for the District of Columbia and the court issued an order commanding the FBI to either immediately comply with or deny Open America s request The government appealed to the U S Court of Appeals for the D C Circuit which found that FOIA requests could be categorized into simple and difficult requests and that although Open America s request was difficult the FBI had been using due diligence in responding to it The court held that because there was no pressing urgency to Open America s request its lawsuit did not move it to the head of the queue and it would have to wait its turn This legal reasoning and holding has been adopted by all other American circuits though courts continue to complain that FOIA request delays are too long In the case McGehee v CIA the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals stated br br The Freedom of Information Act nevertheless imposes on the courts the responsibility to ensure that agencies comply with their obligation to make records promptly available to any person who requests them unless a refusal to do so is justified by one of the Act s specific exclusive exemptions Especially where as here an agency s responses to a request for information have been tardy and grudging courts should be sure they do not abdicate their own duty br In the Center for Effective Government analyzed federal agencies which receive the most FOIA requests in depth The organization used a scale considering three factors the clarity of agency rules regarding FOIA requests quality or friendliness of an agency s FOIA webpage and the timely complete manner of processing requests With this metric it concluded that federal agencies are struggling to implement public disclosure rules Using and data the most recent years available ten of the did not earn satisfactory overall grades scoring less than out of a possible points Eight of the ten earned Ds including the Department of Homeland Security percent Department of Transportation percent United States Department of the Treasury Treasury percent the Environmental Protection Agency EPA percent the United States Department of Labor percent the United States Department of Veterans Affairs percent the United States Department of Defense percent the Securities and Exchange Commission percent The Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of State earned an F The State Department s score percent was dismal due to its extremely low processing score of percent which was completely out of line with any other agency s performance Scores of five agencies the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission the Department of Health and Human Services the SEC the DOJ and the EPA even decreased marginally br br br Implementation by government agencies br Starting in the Federal government job title Government Information Specialist was established for professionals focused on FOIA or privacy matters Agencies sometimes track or process FOIA requests on websites or systems shared across organizations such as FOIAonline and eFOIA
