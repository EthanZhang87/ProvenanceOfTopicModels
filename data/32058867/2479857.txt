id: 2479857
strongSwan is a multiplatform IPsec implementation The focus of the project is on authentication mechanisms using X public key certificates and optional storage of private keys and certificates on smartcards through a PKCS interface and on TPM br br br Overview br The project is maintained by Andreas Steffen who is a professor emeritus for Security in Communications with the University of Applied Sciences in Rapperswil Switzerland br As a descendant of the FreeS WAN project strongSwan continues to be released under the GPL license It supports certificate revocation lists and the Online Certificate Status Protocol OCSP A unique feature is the use of X attribute certificates to implement access control schemes based on group memberships StrongSwan interoperates with other IPsec implementations including various Microsoft Windows and macOS VPN clients The current version of strongSwan fully implements the Internet Key Exchange IKEv protocol defined by RFC br br br Features br strongSwan supports IKEv and fully implements IKEv br br br IKEv and IKEv features br strongSwan offers plugins enhancing its functionality The user can choose among three crypto libraries legacy non US FreeS WAN OpenSSL and gcrypt br Using the openssl plugin strongSwan supports Elliptic Curve Cryptography ECDH groups and ECDSA certificates and signatures both for IKEv and IKEv so that interoperability with Microsoft s Suite B implementation on Vista Win Server etc is possible br Automatic assignment of virtual IP addresses to VPN clients from one or several address pools using either the IKEv ModeConfig or IKEv Configuration payload The pools are either volatile i e RAM based or stored in a SQLite or MySQL database with configurable lease times br The ipsec pool command line utility allows the management of IP address pools and configuration attributes like internal DNS and NBNS servers br br br IKEv only features br The IKEv daemon is inherently multi threaded threads by default br The IKEv daemon comes with a High Availability option based on Cluster IP where currently a cluster of two hosts does active load sharing and each host can take over the ESP and IKEv states without rekeying if the other host fails br The following EAP authentication methods are supported AKA and SIM including the management of multiple U SIM cards MD MSCHAPv GTC TLS TTLS EAP MSCHAPv authentication based on user passwords and EAP TLS with user certificates are interoperable with the Windows Agile VPN Client br The EAP RADIUS plugin relays EAP packets to one or multiple AAA servers e g FreeRADIUS or Active Directory br Support of RFC EAP Only Authentication in conjunction with strong mutual authentication methods like e g EAP TLS br Support of RFC IKEv Multiple Authentication Exchanges br Support of RFC IKEv Redirection br Support of the RFC Mobility and Multihoming Protocol MOBIKE which allows dynamic changes of the IP address and or network interface without IKEv rekeying MOBIKE is also supported by the Windows Agile VPN Client br The strongSwan IKEv NetworkManager applet supports EAP X certificate and PKCS smartcard based authentication Assigned DNS servers are automatically installed and removed again in etc resolv conf br Support of Trusted Network Connect TNC A strongSwan VPN client can act as a TNC client and a strongSwan VPN gateway as a Policy Enforcement Point PEP and optionally as a co located TNC server The following TCG interfaces are supported IF IMC IF IMV IF PEP IF TNCCS IF TNCCS RFC PB TNC IF M RFC PA TNC and IF MAP br The IKEv daemon has been fully ported to the Android operating system including integration into the Android VPN applet It has also been ported to the Maemo FreeBSD and macOS operating systems br br br KVM simulation environment br The focus of the strongSwan project lies on strong authentication by means of X certificates as well as the optional safe storage of private keys on smart cards using the standardized PKCS interface strongSwan certificate check lists and On line Certificate Status Protocol OCSP br An important capability is the use of X Certificate Attributes which permits it to utilize complex access control mechanisms on the basis of group memberships br strongSwan comes with a simulation environment based on KVM A network of eight virtual hosts allows the user to enact a multitude of site to site and roadwarrior VPN scenarios br br br See also br br Libreswan br Openswan br br br br br br External links br Official website br strongSwan on GitHub br strongSwan Documentation
