Silicon Graphics Inc stylized as SiliconGraphics before later rebranded SGI historically known as Silicon Graphics Computer Systems or SGCS was an American high performance computing manufacturer producing computer hardware and software Founded in Mountain View California in November by James Clark its initial market was D graphics computer workstations but its products strategies and market positions developed significantly over time br Early systems were based on the Geometry Engine that Clark and Marc Hannah had developed at Stanford University and were derived from Clark s broader background in computer graphics The Geometry Engine was the first very large scale integration VLSI implementation of a geometry pipeline specialized hardware that accelerated the inner loop geometric computations needed to display three dimensional images For much of its history the company focused on D imaging and was a major supplier of both hardware and software in this market br Silicon Graphics reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in January Through the mid to late s the rapidly improving performance of commodity Wintel machines began to erode SGI s stronghold in the D market The porting of Maya to other platforms was a major event in this process SGI made several attempts to address this including a disastrous move from their existing MIPS platforms to the Intel Itanium as well as introducing their own Linux based Intel IA based workstations and servers that failed in the market In the mid s the company repositioned itself as a supercomputer vendor a move that also failed br On April SGI filed for Chapter bankruptcy protection and announced that it would sell substantially all of its assets to Rackable Systems a deal finalized on May with Rackable assuming the name Silicon Graphics International The remains of Silicon Graphics Inc became Graphics Properties Holdings Inc br br br History br br br Early years br James H Clark left his position as an electrical engineering associate professor at Stanford University to found SGI in along with a group of seven graduate students and research staff from Stanford University Kurt Akeley David J Brown Tom Davis Rocky Rhodes Marc Hannah Herb Kuta and Mark Grossman along with Abbey Silverstone and a few others br br br Growth br Ed McCracken was CEO of Silicon Graphics from to During those years SGI grew from annual revenues of million to billion br br br Decline br The addition of D graphic capabilities to PCs and the ability of clusters of Linux and BSD based PCs to take on many of the tasks of larger SGI servers ate into SGI s core markets The porting of Maya to Linux Mac OS and Microsoft Windows further eroded the low end of SGI s product line br In response to challenges faced in the marketplace and a falling share price Ed McCracken was fired and SGI brought in Richard Belluzzo to replace him Under Belluzzo s leadership a number of initiatives were taken which are considered to have accelerated the corporate decline br One such initiative was trying to sell workstations running Windows NT called Visual Workstations in addition to workstations running IRIX the company s version of UNIX This put the company in even more direct competition with the likes of Dell making it more difficult to justify a price premium The product line was unsuccessful and abandoned a few years later br SGI s premature announcement of its migration from MIPS to Itanium and its abortive ventures into IA architecture systems the Visual Workstation line the ex Intergraph Zx range and the SGI series Linux servers damaged SGI s credibility in the market br In in an attempt to clarify their current market position as more than a graphics company Silicon Graphics Inc changed its corporate identity to SGI although its legal name was unchanged br At the same time SGI announced a new logo consisting of only the letters sgi in a proprietary font called SGI created by branding and design consulting firm Landor Associates in collaboration with designer Joe Stitzlein SGI continued to use the Silicon Graphics name for its workstation product line and later re adopted the cube logo for some workstation models br In November SGI announced that it had been delisted from the New York Stock Exchange because its common stock had fallen below the minimum share price for listing on the exchange SGI s market capitalization dwindled from a peak of over seven billion dollars in to just million at the time of delisting In February SGI noted that it could run out of cash by the end of the year br br br Re emergence br br In mid SGI hired Alix Partners to advise it on returning to profitability and received a new line of credit SGI announced it was postponing its scheduled annual December stockholders meeting until March It proposed a reverse stock split to deal with the de listing from the New York Stock Exchange br In January SGI hired Dennis McKenna as its new CEO and chairman of the board of directors Mr McKenna succeeded Robert Bishop who remained vice chairman of the board of directors br On May SGI announced that it had filed for Chapter bankruptcy protection for itself and U S subsidiaries as part of a plan to reduce debt by million Two days later the U S Bankruptcy Court approved its first day motions and its use of a million financing facility provided by a group of its bondholders Foreign subsidiaries were unaffected br On September SGI announced the end of development for the MIPS IRIX line and the IRIX operating system Production would end on December and the last orders would be fulfilled by March Support for these products would end after December br SGI emerged from bankruptcy protection on October Its stock symbol at that point SGID was canceled and new stock was issued on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol SGIC This new stock was distributed to the company s creditors and the SGID common stockholders were left with worthless shares At the end of that year the company moved its headquarters from Mountain View to Sunnyvale Its earlier North Shoreline headquarters is now occupied by the Computer History Museum the newer Amphitheatre Parkway headquarters was sold to Google which had already subleased and moved into the facility in Both of these locations were award winning designs by Studios Architecture br In April SGI re entered the visualization market with the SGI Virtu range of visualization servers and workstations which were re badged systems from BOXX Technologies based on Intel Xeon or AMD Opteron processors and Nvidia Quadro graphics chipsets running Red Hat Enterprise Linux SUSE Linux Enterprise Server or Windows Compute Cluster Server br br br Final bankruptcy and acquisition by Rackable Systems br In December SGI received a delisting notification from NASDAQ as its market value had been below the minimum million requirement for consecutive trading days and also did not meet NASDAQ s alternative requirements of a minimum stockholders equity of million or annual net income from continuing operations of or more br On April SGI filed for Chapter again and announced that it would sell substantially all of its assets to Rackable Systems for million The sale ultimately for million was finalized on May at the same time Rackable announced their adoption of Silicon Graphics International as their global name and brand The Bankruptcy Court scheduled continuing proceedings and hearings for June and and July br After the Rackable acquisition Vizworld magazine published a series of six articles that chronicle the downfall of SGI br Hewlett Packard Enterprise acquired Silicon Graphics International in November which allowed HPE to place the SGI Pleiades a TOP supercomputer at NASA Ames Research Center in its portfolio br br br Graphics Properties Holdings Inc era br During Silicon Graphics Inc s second bankruptcy phase it was renamed to Graphics Properties Holdings Inc GPHI in June br In GPHI announced it had won a significant favorable ruling in its litigation with ATI Technologies and AMD in June following the patent lawsuit originally filed during the Silicon Graphics Inc era Following the appeal by ATI over the validity of U S patent and Silicon Graphics Inc s voluntary dismissal of the U S patent patent from the lawsuit the Federal Circuit upheld the jury verdict on the validity of GPHI s U S Patent No and furthermore found that AMD had lost its right to challenge patent validity in future proceedings On January the District Court entered an order that permits AMD to pursue its invalidity affirmative defense at trial and does not permit SGI to accuse AMD s Radeon R series of graphics products of infringement in this case On April GPHI and AMD had entered into a confidential Settlement and License Agreement that resolved this litigation matter for an immaterial amount and that provides immunity under all GPHI patents for alleged infringement by AMD products including components software and designs On April the Court entered an order granting the parties agreed motion for dismissal and final judgment br In November GPHI filed another patent infringement lawsuit against Apple Inc in Delaware involving more patents than their original patent infringement case against Apple last November for alleged violation of U S patents U S patent and U S patent br In GPHI filed lawsuit against Apple Sony HTC Corp LG Electronics Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Research in Motion Ltd for allegedly violating patent relating to a computer graphics process that turns text and images into pixels to be displayed on screens Affected devices include Apple iPhone HTC EVO G LG Thrill Research in Motion Torch Samsung Galaxy S and Galaxy S II and Sony Xperia Play smartphones br br U S patent Display system having floating point rasterization and floating point br U S patent System method and computer program product for near real time load br U S patent Large area wide aspect ratio flat panel monitor having high resolution for br U S patent Data processing system for processing one and two parcel instructions br br br Technology br br br Motorola x based systems br SGI s first generation products starting with the IRIS Integrated Raster Imaging System series of high performance graphics terminals were based on the Motorola family of microprocessors The later IRIS and models developed into full UNIX workstations br br br IRIS series br The first entries in the series models and introduced in were graphics terminals peripherals to be connected to a general purpose computer such as a Digital Equipment Corporation VAX to provide graphical raster display abilities They used MHz Motorola CPUs with kB of RAM and had no disk drives They booted over the network via an Excelan EXOS Ethernet card from their controlling computer They used the PM CPU board which was a variant of the board that was used in Stanford University s SUN workstation and later in the Sun workstation from Sun Microsystems The graphics system was composed of the GF frame buffer the UC Update Controller DC Display Controller and the BP bitplane The series machines were designed around the Multibus standard br Later series machines the and ran at MHz and had MB of RAM The had a MB ST disk drive while the had a MB SMD based disk drive with a Xylogics disk controller They may have used the PM CPU and PM M RAM board from the series The usual monitor for the series ran at Hz interlaced Six beta test units of the workstation were produced and the first production unit SGI s first commercial computer was shipped to Carnegie Mellon University s Electronic Imaging Laboratory in br br br IRIS and series br br SGI rapidly developed its machines into workstations with its second product line the IRIS series first released in August SGI began using the UNIX System V operating system There were five models in two product ranges the range which used CPUs the PM CPU module and the later Turbo systems the T T and T which had s the IP CPU module All used the Excelan EXOS Ethernet card the same graphics hardware GF Frame Buffer UC Update Controller DC Display Controller BP Bitplane Their main differences were the CPU RAM and Weitek Floating Point Accelerator boards disk controllers and disk drives both ST and SMD were available These could be upgraded for example from a to a T The and T had a larger chassis a standard EIA rack with space at the bottom for two SMD disk drives weighing approximately kg each The non Turbo models used the Multibus for the CPU to communicate with the floating point accelerator while the Turbos added a ribbon cable dedicated for this Hz monitors were used for the series br The height of the machines using Motorola CPUs was reached with the IRIS series models and the s both being full size rack machines They used the same graphics subsystem and Ethernet as the s but could also use up to geometry engines the first widespread use of hardware graphics accelerators The standard monitor was a Hz non interlaced unit with a tilt swivel base Hz interlaced and a Hz non interlaced with tilt swivel base were also available br The IRIS and its smaller siblings were impressive for the time being complete UNIX workstations The was powerful enough to support a complete D animation and rendering package without mainframe support With large capacity hard drives by standards of the day two MB drives streaming tape and Ethernet it could be the centerpiece of an animation operation br The line was formally discontinued in November with about systems shipped of all and models combined br br br RISC era br With the introduction of the IRIS D series SGI switched to MIPS microprocessors These machines were more powerful and came with powerful on board floating point capability As D graphics became more popular in television and film during this time these systems were responsible for establishing much of SGI s reputation br SGI produced a broad range of MIPS based workstations and servers during the s running SGI s version of UNIX System V now called IRIX These included the massive Onyx visualization systems the size of refrigerators and capable of supporting up to processors while managing up to three streams of high resolution fully realized D graphics br In October MIPS announced the first commercially available bit microprocessor the R SGI used the R in its Crimson workstation IRIX was the first fully bit IRIX release including bit pointers br To secure the supply of future generations of MIPS microprocessors the bit R SGI acquired the company in for million and renamed it as MIPS Technologies Inc a wholly owned subsidiary of SGI br In Silicon Graphics SGI signed a deal with Nintendo to develop the Reality Coprocessor RCP GPU used in the Nintendo N video game console The deal was signed in early and it was later made public in August of that year The console itself was later released in The RCP was developed by SGI s Nintendo Operations department led by engineer Dr Wei Yen In twenty SGI employees led by Yen left SGI and founded ArtX later acquired by ATI Technologies in br In SGI relinquished some ownership of MIPS Technologies Inc in a Re IPO and fully divested itself in br In the late s when much of the industry expected the Itanium to replace both CISC and RISC architectures in non embedded computers SGI announced their intent to phase out MIPS in their systems Development of new MIPS microprocessors stopped and the existing R design was extended multiple times until to provide existing customers more time to migrate to Itanium br In August SGI announced the end of production for MIPS IRIX systems and by the end of the year MIPS IRIX products were no longer generally available from SGI br br br IRIS GL and OpenGL br Until the second generation Onyx Reality Engine machines SGI offered access to its high performance D graphics subsystems through a proprietary API known as IRIS Graphics Library IRIS GL As more features were added over the years IRIS GL became harder to maintain and more cumbersome to use In SGI decided to clean up and reform IRIS GL and made the bold move of allowing the resulting OpenGL API to be cheaply licensed by SGI s competitors and set up an industry wide consortium to maintain the OpenGL standard the OpenGL Architecture Review Board br This meant that for the first time fast efficient cross platform graphics programs could be written For over years until the introduction of the Vulkan API OpenGL remained the only real time D graphics standard to be portable across a variety of operating systems br br br ACE Consortium br br SGI was part of the Advanced Computing Environment initiative formed in the early s with other companies including Compaq Digital Equipment Corporation MIPS Computer Systems Groupe Bull Siemens NEC NeTpower Microsoft and Santa Cruz Operation Its intent was to introduce workstations based on the MIPS architecture and able to run Windows NT and SCO UNIX The group produced the Advanced RISC Computing ARC specification but began to unravel little more than a year after its formation br br br Entertainment industry br For eight consecutive years all films nominated for an Academy Award for Distinguished Achievement in Visual Effects were created on Silicon Graphics computer systems The technology was also used in commercials for a host of companies br An SGI Crimson system with the fsn three dimensional file system navigator appeared in the movie Jurassic Park br In the movie Twister protagonists can be seen using an SGI laptop computer however the unit shown was not an actual working computer but rather a fake laptop shell built around an SGI Corona LCD flat screen display br The film Congo also features an SGI laptop computer being used by Dr Ross Laura Linney to communicate via satellite to TraviCom HQ br The purple lowercased sgi logo can be seen at the beginning of the opening credits of the HBO series Silicon Valley before being taken down and replaced by the Google logo as the intro graphics progress Google leased the former SGI buildings in for their headquarters in Mountain View CA until they purchased the buildings outright in br Once inexpensive PCs began to have graphics performance close to the more expensive specialized graphical workstations which were SGI s core business SGI shifted its focus to high performance servers for digital video and the Web Many SGI graphics engineers left to work at other computer graphics companies such as ATI and Nvidia contributing to the PC D graphics revolution br br br Free software br SGI was a promoter of free software supporting several projects such as Linux and Samba and opening some of its own previously proprietary code such as the XFS filesystem and the Open compiler br SGI was also important in its contribution to the C Standard Template Library STL with many useful extensions in the MIT like licensed SGI STL implementation The extension keeps being carried by the direct descendant STLport and GNU s libstdc br br br Acquisition of Alias Wavefront Cray and Intergraph br In SGI purchased Alias Research Kroyer Films and Wavefront Technologies in a deal totaling approximately million and merged the companies into Alias Wavefront In June SGI sold the business later renamed to Alias Wavefront to the private equity investment firm Accel KKR for million In October Autodesk announced that it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Alias for million in cash br In February SGI purchased the well known supercomputer manufacturer Cray Research for million and began to use marketing names such as CrayLink for SGI developed technology integrated into the SGI server line Three months later it sold the Cray Business Systems Division responsible for the CS SPARC Solaris server to Sun Microsystems for an undisclosed amount acknowledged later by a Sun executive to be significantly less than million Many of the Cray T E engineers designed and developed the SGI Altix and NUMAlink technology SGI sold the Cray brand and product lines to Tera Computer Company on March for million plus one million shares SGI also distributed its remaining interest in MIPS Technologies through a spin off effective June br In September SGI acquired the Zx series of Windows workstations and servers from Intergraph Computer Systems for a rumored million and rebadged them as SGI systems The product line was discontinued in June br br br SGI Visual Workstations br Another attempt by SGI in the late s to introduce its own family of Intel based workstations running Windows NT or Red Hat Linux see also SGI Visual Workstation proved to be a financial disaster and shook customer confidence in SGI s commitment to its own MIPS based line br br br Switch to Itanium br In SGI announced that future generations of its machines would be based not on their own MIPS processors but the upcoming super chip from Intel code named Merced and later called Itanium Funding for its own high end processors was reduced and it was planned that the R would be the last MIPS mainstream processor MIPS Technologies would focus entirely on the embedded market where it was having some success and SGI would no longer have to fund development of a CPU that since the failure of ARC found use only in their own machines This plan quickly went awry As early as it was clear the Itanium was going to be delivered very late and would have nowhere near the performance originally expected As the production delays increased MIPS existing R based machines grew increasingly uncompetitive Eventually it was forced to introduce faster MIPS processors the R R and R which were used in a series of models from through br SGI s first Itanium based system was the short lived SGI workstation launched in SGI s MIPS based systems were not to be superseded until the launch of the Itanium based Altix servers and Prism workstations some time later Unlike the MIPS systems which ran IRIX the Itanium systems used SuSE Linux Enterprise Server with SGI enhancements as their operating system SGI used Transitive Corporation s QuickTransit software to allow their old MIPS IRIX applications to run in emulation on the new Itanium Linux platform br In the server market the Itanium based Altix eventually replaced the MIPS based Origin product line In the workstation market the switch to Itanium was not completed before SGI exited the market br The Altix was the most powerful computer in the world in assuming that a computer is defined as a collection of hardware running under a single instance of an operating system The Altix had Itanium processors running under a single instance of Linux A cluster of machines was then the eighth fastest supercomputer All faster supercomputers were clusters but none have as many FLOPS per machine However more recent supercomputers are very large clusters of machines that are individually less capable SGI acknowledged this and in moved away from the massive NUMA model to clusters br br br Switch to Xeon br Although SGI continued to market Itanium based machines its more recent machines were based on the Intel Xeon processor The first Altix XE systems were relatively low end machines but by December the XE systems were more capable than the Itanium machines by some measures e g power consumption in FLOPS W density in FLOPS m cost FLOPS The XE and XE servers used a cluster architecture This was a departure from the pure NUMA architectures of the earlier Itanium and MIPS servers br In June SGI announced the Altix ICE a blade based Xeon system with up to Xeon cores per rack An Altix ICE installed at New Mexico Computing Applications Center with processors ranked at number on the TOP list of November br br br User base and core market br Conventional wisdom holds that SGI s core market has traditionally been Hollywood visual effects studios In fact SGI s largest revenue has always been generated by government and defense applications energy and scientific and technical computing In one case Silicon Graphics largest single sale ever was to the United States Postal Service SGI s servers powered an artificial intelligence program to mechanically read tag and sort the mail hand written and block at a number of USPS s key mail centers The rise of cheap yet powerful commodity workstations running Linux Windows and Mac OS X and the availability of diverse professional software for them effectively pushed SGI out of the visual effects industry in all but the most niche markets br br br High end server market br SGI continued to enhance its line of servers including some supercomputers based on the SN architecture SN for Scalable Node is a technology developed by SGI in the mid s that uses cache coherent non uniform memory access cc NUMA In an SN system processors memory and a bus and memory controller are coupled together into an entity called a node usually on a single circuit board Nodes are connected by a high speed interconnect called NUMAlink originally marketed as CrayLink There is no internal bus and instead access between processors memory and I O devices is done through a switched fabric of links and routers br Thanks to the cache coherence of the distributed shared memory SN systems scale along several axes at once as CPU count increases so does memory capacity I O capacity and system bisection bandwidth This allows the combined memory of all the nodes to be accessed under a single OS image using standard shared memory synchronization methods This makes an SN system far easier to program and able to achieve higher sustained to peak performance than non cache coherent systems like conventional clusters or massively parallel computers which require applications code to be written or re written to do explicit message passing communication between their nodes br The first SN system known as SN was released in under the product name Origin Based on the MIPS R processor it scaled from to processors and a smaller version the Origin SN scaled from to Later enhancements enabled systems of as large as processors br The second generation system originally called SN but later SN MIPS was released in July as the Origin It scaled from to processors and processor configurations were delivered by special order to some customers A smaller less scalable implementation followed called Origin br In November SGI announced a repackaging of its SN system under the name Origin It quadrupled the processor area density of the SN MIPS system from up to processors per rack while moving to a fat tree interconnect topology br In January SGI announced a variant of the SN platform called the Altix internally called SN IA It used Intel Itanium processors and ran the Linux operating system kernel At the time it was released it was the world s most scalable Linux based computer supporting up to processors in a single system node Nodes could be connected using the same NUMAlink technology to form what SGI predictably termed superclusters br In February SGI announced general support for processor nodes to be followed by and processor versions that year br In April SGI announced the sale of its Alias software business for approximately million br In October SGI built the supercomputer Columbia which broke the world record for computer speed for the NASA Ames Research Center It was a cluster of Altix supercomputers each with Intel Itanium processors running Linux and achieved sustained speed of trillion floating point operations per second teraflops easily topping Japan s famed Earth Simulator s record of teraflops A week later IBM s upgraded Blue Gene L clocked in at teraflops br In July SGI announced an SGI Altix system with processors and TB of memory running a single Linux
