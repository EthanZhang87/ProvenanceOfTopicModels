Rambus Inc is an American technology company that designs develops and licenses chip interface technologies and architectures that are used in digital electronics products The company founded in is well known for inventing RDRAM and for its intellectual property based litigation following the introduction of DDR SDRAM memory br br br History br Rambus was founded in March by electrical and computer engineers Mike Farmwald and Mark Horowitz The company s early investors included premier venture capital and investment banking firms such as Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers Merrill Lynch Mohr Davidow Ventures and Goldman Sachs br Rambus was incorporated and founded as California company in and then re incorporated in the state of Delaware before the company went public in on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol RMBS br In the s Rambus was a high speed interface technology development and marketing company that invented MHz interface technology which solved memory bottleneck issues faced by system designers Rambus s technology was based on a very high speed chip to chip interface that was incorporated on dynamic random access memory DRAM components processors and controllers which achieved performance rates over ten times faster than conventional DRAMs Rambus s RDRAM transferred data at MHz over a narrow byte wide Rambus Channel to Rambus compatible Integrated Circuits ICs br Rambus s interface was an open standard accessible to all semiconductor companies such as Intel Rambus provided companies who licensed its technology a full range of reference designs and engineering services Rambus s interface technology was broadly licensed to leading DRAM ASIC and PC peripheral chipset suppliers in the s Licensees of Rambus s RDRAM technology included companies such as Creative Labs Intel Microsoft Nintendo Silicon Graphics Hitachi Hyundai IBM Molex Macronix and NEC br Rambus RDRAM technology was integrated into products such as Nintendo Microsoft s Talisman D graphics chip set Creative Labs Graphics Blaster D Graphics cards for PCs workstations manufactured by Silicon Graphics and Intel s system memory chipsets for PCs br In Rambus Incorporated announced that Toshiba Corp and Elpida Memory Inc will produce its new memory technology known as XDR DRAM The memory technology is capable of running at GHz and is said to be faster than any memory technology available in consumer entertainment devices and PCs at the time br Rambus purchased Cryptography Research on June for M This will enable Rambus Inc to develop its semiconductor licensing portfolio to include CRI s content protection and security According to Rambus CEO Harold Hughes the CRI security technologies would be applied to a variety of products in the company s IP portfolio br Today Rambus derives the majority of its annual revenue by licensing its technologies and patents for chip interfaces to its customers According to The Wall Street Journal history of Rambus has been marked by litigation including patent battles with numerous chip makers br In Rambus acquired Integrion Microelectronics a small Toronto based IP provider of high speed analog SerDes PHY for an undisclosed amount Through this acquisition Rambus opened its st Canadian office and boosted its high speed serdes IP portfolio offering br On August Rambus announced the new R DDR server memory chips RB DDR RDIMM and RB DDR LRDIMM The chipset includes a DDR Register Clock Driver and Data Buffer and it s fully compliant with the JEDEC DDR br In Rambus acquired Semtech s Snowbush IP for US million Snowbush IP provides analog and mixed signal IP technologies and will expand Rambus product offerings br In Rambus acquired Inphi Memory Interconnect Business for US million The acquisition includes all assets of the Inphi Memory Interconnect Business such as customer contracts product inventory supply chain agreements and intellectual property br On November Rambus announced partnership with Interac Association and Samsung Canada to assist in enabling Samsung Pay in Canada br In Rambus agreed to renew a patent license with Nvidia Rambus would be sharing its patent portfolio including those covering serial links and memory controllers with Nvidia br On December Rambus HBM PHY and Memory Controller IP were announced to be used in Inflame Technology s AI training chip br In Rambus announced that it will move headquarters from Sunnyvale California to North San Jose California br In Rambus announced that it started an expedited share buyback program with Deutsche Bank to buy up roughly million in common stock Rambus also acquired two companies AnalogX and PLDA which specialize in physical links for PCIe and CXL protocols br In May it was announced Rambus had acquired the Montreal headquartered electronic design company Hardent br In July Rambus sold its SerDes and memory interface PHY IP business to Cadence Design Systems for million In September it was announced the acquisition had been completed br br br Technology br br An early version of RDRAM base RDRAM was used in the Nintendo that was released in br Disadvantages of RDRAM technology include significantly increased latency power dissipation as heat manufacturing complexity and cost PC RDRAM operated with a minimum latency of ns compared to ns for PC SDRAM RDRAMs can also be told to increase their latencies in order to prevent the possibility of two or more chips transmitting at the same time and causing a collision However SDRAM latency depends on the current state of memory so its latency can vary widely depending on what happened earlier and the strategy used by the SDRAM controller while RDRAM latency is constant once it has been established by the memory controller RDRAM memory chips also put out significantly more heat than SDRAM chips necessitating heatsinks on all RIMM devices br Rambus also developed and licensed its XDR DRAM technology notably used in the PlayStation and more recently XDR DRAM br br br Lawsuits br In the early s Rambus was invited to join the JEDEC Rambus had been trying to interest memory manufacturers in licensing their proprietary memory interface and numerous companies had signed non disclosure agreements to view Rambus technical data During the later Infineon v Rambus trial Infineon memos from a meeting with representatives of other manufacturers surfaced including the line O ne day all computers will be built this way but hopefully without the royalties going to Rambus and continuing with a strategy discussion for reducing or eliminating royalties to be paid to Rambus As Rambus continued its participation in JEDEC it became apparent that they were not prepared to agree to JEDEC s patent policy requiring owners of patents included in a standard to agree to license that technology under terms that are reasonable and non discriminatory and Rambus withdrew from the organization in Memos from Rambus at that time showed they were tailoring new patent applications to cover features of SDRAM being discussed which were public knowledge JEDEC meetings are not secret and perfectly legal for patent owners who have patented underlying innovations but were seen as evidence of bad faith by the jury in the first Infineon v Rambus trial The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit CAFC rejected this theory of bad faith in its decision overturning the fraud conviction Infineon achieved in the first trial see below br br br Patent lawsuits br In Rambus began filing lawsuits against the largest memory manufacturers claiming that they owned SDRAM and DDR technology Seven manufacturers including Samsung quickly settled with Rambus and agreed to pay royalties on SDRAM and DDR memory In May Rambus was found guilty of fraud for having claimed that it owned SDRAM and DDR technology and all infringement claims against memory manufacturers were dismissed In January the CAFC overturned the fraud verdict of the jury trial in Virginia under Judge Payne issued a new claims construction and remanded the case back to Virginia for re trial on infringement In October the U S Supreme Court refused to hear the case Thus the case returned to Virginia per the CAFC ruling br In January Rambus filed four more lawsuits against memory chip makers Hynix Semiconductor Nanya Technology Inotera Memories and Infineon Technology claiming that DDR GDDR and GDDR chips contain Rambus technology In March Rambus had its claim for patent infringements against Infineon dismissed When Rambus was accused of shredding key documents prior to court hearings the judge agreed and dismissed Rambus s case against Infineon This led Rambus to negotiate a settlement with Infineon which agreed to pay Rambus quarterly license fees of million and in return both companies ceased all litigation against each other The agreement ran from November to November After this date if Rambus had enough remaining agreements in place Infineon may make extra payments up to million In June Rambus also sued one of its strongest proponents Samsung the world s largest memory manufacturer and terminated Samsung s license Samsung had promoted Rambus s RDRAM and currently remains a licensee of Rambus s XDR memory br In February Micron Technology sued Rambus alleging that Rambus had violated RICO and deliberately harmed Micron br On April the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a ruling vacating the order of the U S District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia saying the case with Samsung should be dismissed saying Judge Robert E Payne s findings critical of Rambus were on a case that had already been settled and thus had no legal standing br On January a Delaware federal judge ruled that Rambus could not enforce patents against Micron Technology Inc stating that Rambus had a clear and convincing show of bad faith and ruled that Rambus destruction of key related documents spoliation of evidence nullified its right to enforce its patents against Micron br In July the United States Patent and Trademark Office USPTO rejected claims by Rambus against Nvidia br On November the USPTO rejected all claims in three Rambus patents that the company asserted against Nvidia in a complaint filed with the U S International Trade Commission ITC However the ITC has announced that out of five patents Nvidia did violate three of them Due to this ruling Nvidia faced a potential U S import ban on some of its chips used in the nForce Quadro GeForce Tesla and Tegra series graphics products nearly every video card type manufactured by Nvidia br On June Rambus went to trial against Micron and Hynix in California seeking as much as billion in damages for a secret and unlawful conspiracy to kill a revolutionary technology make billions of dollars and hang onto power Rambus lawyer Bart Williams told jurors Rambus lost on November in the jury trial and its shares dropped drastically from to per share br On November Rambus lost the antitrust case against Micron Technology and Hynix Semiconductor The San Francisco County Superior Court jury ruled against Rambus in a vote In a statement posted on the company s website Rambus CEO Harold Hughes said We are reviewing our options for appeal br On January a USPTO appeals board declared the third of three patents known as the Barth patents invalid The first two had been declared invalid in September Rambus had used these patents to win infringement lawsuits against Nvidia Corp and Hewlett Packard br On June The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the USPTO and the Barth patent s validity was reinstated br In conclusion the Board s determination that all claims of the Patent are invalid as anticipated by Farmwald is not supported by substantial evidence Accordingly this court reverses br br br Federal Trade Commission antitrust suits br In May the United States Federal Trade Commission FTC filed charges against Rambus for antitrust violations Specifically the FTC complaint asserted that through the use of patent continuations and divisionals Rambus pursued a strategy of expanding the scope of its patent claims to encompass the emerging SDRAM standard The FTC s antitrust allegations against Rambus went to trial in the summer of after the organization formally accused Rambus of anti competitive behavior the previous June itself the result of an investigation launched in May at the behest of the memory manufacturers The FTC s chief administrative law judge Stephen J McGuire dismissed the antitrust claims against Rambus in saying that the memory industry had no reasonable alternatives to Rambus technology and was aware of the potential scope of Rambus patent rights according to the company Soon after FTC investigators filed a brief to appeal against that ruling br On August the FTC overturned McGuire s ruling stating that Rambus illegally monopolized the memory industry under section of the Sherman Antitrust Act and also practiced deception that violated section of the Federal Trade Commission Act br February the FTC issued a ruling that limits maximum royalties that Rambus may demand from manufacturers of dynamic random access memory DRAM which was set to for DDR SDRAM for years from the date the commission s Order is issued and then going to while SDRAM s maximum royalty was set to The Commission claimed that halving the DDR SDRAM rate for SDRAM would reflect the fact that while DDR SDRAM utilizes four of the relevant Rambus technologies SDRAM uses only two In addition to collecting fees for DRAM chips Rambus will also be able to receive and royalties for SDRAM and DDR SDRAM memory controllers or other non memory chip components respectively However the ruling did not prohibit Rambus from collecting royalties on products based on DDR SDRAM GDDR and other JEDEC post DDR memory standards Rambus has appealed the FTC Opinion Remedy and awaits a court date for the appeal br On March the jury of the U S District Court for the Northern District of California determined that had Rambus acted properly while a member of the standard setting organization JEDEC during its participating in the early s finding that the memory manufacturers did not meet their burden of proving antitrust and fraud claims br On April the U S Court of Appeals for the D C Circuit overturned the FTC reversal of McGuire s ruling saying that the FTC had not established that Rambus had harmed the competition br On February the U S Supreme Court rejected the bids by the FTC to impose royalty sanctions on Rambus via antitrust penalties br br br European Commission antitrust suit br July the European Commission launched antitrust investigations against Rambus taking the view that Rambus engaged in intentional deceptive conduct in the context of the standard setting process for example by not disclosing the existence of the patents which it later claimed were relevant to the adopted standard This type of behavior is known as a patent ambush Against this background the Commission provisionally considered that Rambus breached the EC Treaty s rules on abuse of a dominant market position Article EC Treaty by subsequently claiming unreasonable royalties for the use of those relevant patents The commission s preliminary view is that without its patent ambush Rambus would not have been able to charge the royalty rates it currently does br br br Recent settlements br In and Rambus settled and agreed on licensing terms with several of the companies involved in long running disputes On December Rambus entered an agreement with Micron to let the latter use some of its patents in exchange for million worth of royalties over seven years In June the company settled with SK Hynix with Hynix paying million to settle the disputes br In March Rambus and Nanya signed a year patent licensing agreement settling earlier claims br Rambus said these deals were part of a change in strategy to a less litigious more collaborative approach distancing themselves from accusations of patent trolling Ronald Black Rambus s CEO said Somehow we got thrown into the patent troll bunch This is just not the case br br br See also br Rambus Inc v Nvidia br br br br br br External links br br Official website br Business data for Rambus Inc br Rambus
