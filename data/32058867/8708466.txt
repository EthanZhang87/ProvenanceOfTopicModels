GBDE standing for GEOM Based Disk Encryption is a block device layer disk encryption system written for FreeBSD initially introduced in version It is based on the GEOM disk framework GBDE was designed and implemented by Poul Henning Kamp and Network Associates Inc now known as McAfee br br br Design decisions br Unlike most disk encryption software GBDE does not attempt to defeat watermarking attacks through the use of disk encryption specific modes of operation see disk encryption theory but instead generates a random key each time a sector is written Unlike some alternatives such as CBC with sector specific initialization vectors this approach does not reveal any information to the attacker even if they have access to snapshots of the disk image from different points in time since encryption keys are never re used br The one time sector key is encrypted using a pseudorandom key This pseudorandom key is derived from the sector number and a static bit master key with bits of salt The pseudorandom number generator used for this purpose is called the Cherry Picker This is not a well established PRNG but rather one invented for GBDE This generator may not meet the security levels of standard algorithms and could be distinguishable from random numbers br br br Limitations br Due to this unique approach GBDE only supports bit AES Using a different key for each write also introduces a significant CPU overhead as most block ciphers use key specific precomputations and makes disk updates non atomic since the keys are written separately from the data As a result data loss can occur on unexpected power drops even when used with journaling file systems GBDE also has a disk space overhead of about to store the per sector keys br To address these shortcomings a more typical disk encryption solution for FreeBSD GELI was written later by Pawel Jakub Dawidek br br br See also br br GELI br Disk encryption br Disk encryption software br Comparison of disk encryption software br br br
