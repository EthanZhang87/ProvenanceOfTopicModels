NeXT Inc later NeXT Computer Inc and NeXT Software Inc was an American technology company headquartered in Redwood City California that specialized in computer workstations for higher education and business markets and later developed web software It was founded in by CEO Steve Jobs the Apple Computer co founder who had been forcibly removed from Apple that year NeXT debuted with the NeXT Computer in and released the NeXTcube and smaller NeXTstation in The series had relatively limited sales with only about total units shipped Nevertheless the object oriented programming and graphical user interface were highly influential trendsetters of computer innovation br NeXT partnered with Sun Microsystems to create a programming environment called OpenStep which decoupled the NeXTSTEP operating system s application layer to host it on third party operating systems In NeXT withdrew from the hardware industry to concentrate on marketing OPENSTEP for Mach its own OpenStep implementation for several other computer vendors NeXT developed WebObjects one of the first enterprise web frameworks and although its market appeal was limited by its high price of US equivalent to in it is a prominent early example of dynamic web pages rather than static content br Apple purchased NeXT in for million including million shares of Apple stock The deal appointed Steve Jobs then the chairman and CEO of NeXT to an advisory role at Apple and OpenStep was combined with the classic Mac OS to create Rhapsody and Mac OS X br Many successful applications have lineage from NeXT including the first web browser and the video games Doom and Quake br br br History br br br Background br In Apple co founder and CEO Steve Jobs led a division campaign called SuperMicro which was responsible for developing the Macintosh and Lisa computers They were commercial successes on university campuses because Jobs had personally visited a few notable universities to promote his products and because of Apple University Consortium a discounted academic marketing program The Consortium had earned over million on computer sales by February br Jobs met Paul Berg a Nobel Laureate in chemistry at a luncheon in Silicon Valley held to honor President of France Fran ois Mitterrand Berg was frustrated by the time and expense of researching recombinant DNA via wet laboratories and suggested that Jobs should use his influence to create a M computer that is designed for higher education br Jobs was intrigued by Berg s concept of a workstation and contemplated starting a higher education computer company in late amid increasing turmoil at Apple Jobs s division did not release the upgraded versions of the Macintosh computer and much of the Macintosh Office software As a result its sales plummeted and Apple was forced to write off millions of dollars in unsold inventory In John Sculley ousted Jobs from his executive role at Apple and replaced him with Jean Louis Gass e Later that year Jobs began a power struggle to regain control over his company The board of directors sided with Sculley and Jobs took a business trip to Western Europe and the Soviet Union on behalf of Apple br br br Original NeXT team br br In September after several months of being sidelined Jobs resigned from Apple He told the board he was leaving to set up a new computer company and that he would be taking several Apple employees from the SuperMicro division with him but he also promised that his new company would not compete with Apple and might even consider licensing their designs to them under the Macintosh brand br Several former Apple employees followed him to NeXT including Joanna Hoffman Bud Tribble George Crow Rich Page Susan Barnes Susan Kare and Dan l Lewin After consulting with major educational buyers from around the country including a follow up meeting with Paul Berg a tentative specification for the workstation was drawn up It was designed to be powerful enough to run wet lab simulations and affordable enough for dormitory rooms Before the specifications were finished however Apple sued NeXT on September for nefarious schemes to take advantage of the cofounders insider information Jobs argued It is hard to think that a billion company with plus people couldn t compete with six people in blue jeans The suit was eventually dismissed before trial br In Jobs recruited graphic designer Paul Rand to create a brand identity for equivalent to in Jobs recalled I asked him if he would come up with a few options and he said No I will solve your problem for you and you will pay me You don t have to use the solution If you want options go talk to other people Rand created a page brochure detailing the brand including the precise angle used for the logo and a new company name spelling NeXT br br br NeXT Computer br br br First generation br br In mid NeXT changed its business plan to develop both hardware and software rather than just workstations Rich Page a NeXT cofounder who formerly directed Apple s Lisa team led a team to develop the hardware while Mach kernel engineer Avie Tevanian led the development of NeXT s operating system NeXTSTEP NeXT s first factory was established in Fremont California in capable of manufacturing about machines per year NeXT s first workstation is the NeXT Computer nicknamed the cube due to its distinctive magnesium one foot cm cubic case The case was designed by Hartmut Esslinger and his team at Frog Design br In Ross Perot became NeXT s first major outside investor He invested million for of NeXT s stock after seeing a segment about NeXT on the PBS documentary Entrepreneurs In he joined the company s board of directors br NeXT and Adobe collaborated on Display PostScript DPS a D graphics engine that was released in NeXT engineers wrote an alternative windowing engine edition to take full advantage of NeXTSTEP NeXT engineers used DPS for on screen graphics such as title bar and scroller for the user space windowing library br The original design team anticipated completing the computer in early and launching it for equivalent to in by mid year On October the NeXT Computer received standing ovations when it was revealed at a private gala event NeXT Introduction the Introduction to the NeXT Generation of Computers for Education at the Louise M Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco California The following day selected educators and software engineers were invited to attend the first public technical overview of the NeXT computer at the event The NeXT Day held at the San Francisco Hilton The event gave developers interested in NeXT software an insight into their architecture object oriented programming and the NeXT Computer The luncheon speaker was Steve Jobs br The first NeXT Computers were test launched in and then NeXT sold a limited number to universities with NeXTSTEP beta pre installed Initially this targeted the United States higher education institutions only with a base price of equivalent to in The computer was widely reviewed in magazines primarily the hardware portion When asked if he was upset that the computer s debut was delayed by several months Jobs responded Late This computer is five years ahead of its time br The NeXT Computer has the MHz Motorola central processing unit CPU The Motorola RISC chip was originally considered but it was not available in sufficient quantities The computer has between and MB of random access memory RAM a MB magneto optical MO drive a MB swap only MB or MB hard disk drive BASE Ethernet NuBus and a inch MegaPixel grayscale display with pixels In a typical new PC Macintosh or Amiga computer included a few megabytes of RAM a color or x color display a to megabyte hard drive and few networking capabilities It is the first computer to ship with a general purpose DSP chip Motorola on the motherboard This supports sophisticated music and sound processing including the Music Kit software br The magneto optical MO drive manufactured by Canon Inc is the primary mass storage device This drive technology was relatively new to the market and the NeXT is the first computer to use it MO drives were cheaper but much slower than hard drives with an average seek time of ms Jobs negotiated Canon s initial price of per blank MO disk so that they could sell at retail for only The drive s design made it impossible to move files between computers without a network because each NeXT Computer has only one MO drive and the disk can not be removed without shutting down the system The drive s limited speed and capacity makes it insufficient as NeXTSTEP s primary medium br In NeXT started a deal for former Compaq reseller Businessland to sell the NeXT Computer in international markets Selling through a retailer was a major change from NeXT s original business model of only selling directly to students and educational institutions Businessland founder David Norman predicted that sales of the NeXT Computer would surpass sales of Compaq computers after months br That year Canon invested million in NeXT for a stake making NeXT worth almost million This had the condition of installing NeXTSTEP on its own workstations greatly expanding NeXTSTEP s market After NeXT exited the hardware business Canon produced a PC line called object station including models and specifically designed to run NeXTSTEP on Intel Canon was NeXT s distributor in Japan br The NeXT Computer was released in for equivalent to in In June Perot resigned from the board of directors to concentrate on his company Perot Systems a Plano Texas based software system integrator br br br Second generation br br In NeXT released a second generation of workstations a revised NeXT Computer called NeXTcube and the NeXTstation The NeXTstation s nickname is the slab for its low rise box form factor Jobs ensured that NeXT staffers did not nickname the NeXTstation pizza box to avoid inadvertent comparison with competitor Sun workstations which already had that nickname br The machines were initially planned to use the MB floppy drive but its floppy disks were expensive and had failed to supplant the MB floppy NeXT used the CD ROM drive instead which eventually became the industry standard for storage Color graphics were available on the NeXTstation Color and NeXTdimension graphics processor hardware for the NeXTcube The new computers with the new Motorola processor were cheaper and faster than their predecessors br In NeXT launched Turbo variants of the NeXTcube and NeXTstation with a MHz processor and the maximum RAM capacity increased to MB In NeXT sold computers counting upgraded motherboards on back order as system sales This was a small number compared with competitors but the company reported sales of million for the year which encouraged Canon to invest a further million to keep the company afloat br br In total NeXT machines were sold including thousands to the then super secret National Reconnaissance Office located in Chantilly Virginia NeXT s long term plan was to migrate to one of the emerging high performance Reduced Instruction Set Computing RISC architectures with the NeXT RISC Workstation NRW Initially the NRW was to be based on the Motorola processor but it was later redesigned around dual PowerPC s due to a lack of confidence in Motorola s commitment to the series architecture in the time leading up to the AIM alliance s transition to PowerPC br br br NeXT Software Inc br br In late in preparation for NeXT s future withdrawal from the hardware industry the company started porting the NeXTSTEP operating system to Intel based IBM PC compatible computers In January it was demonstrated at NeXTWorld Expo By mid the process was completed and version NeXTSTEP was released br NeXTSTEP x was later ported to PA RISC and SPARC based platforms for a total of four versions NeXTSTEP NeXT for NeXT s own hardware NeXTSTEP Intel NeXTSTEP PA RISC and NeXTSTEP SPARC Although the latter three ports were not widely used NeXTSTEP gained popularity at institutions such as First Chicago NBD Swiss Bank Corporation O Connor and Company due to its sophisticated br programming model The software was used by many U S government agencies including the United States Naval Research Laboratory the National Security Agency the Advanced Research Projects Agency the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Reconnaissance Office Some IBM PC clone vendors offered somewhat customized hardware solutions that were delivered running NeXTSTEP on Intel such as the Elonex NextStation and the Canon object station br In NeXT withdrew from the hardware industry and the company was renamed to NeXT Software Inc Consequently of the staff employees were laid off NeXT negotiated to sell its hardware business including the Fremont factory to Canon which later canceled the deal Work on the PowerPC machines was stopped along with all hardware production Sun CEO Scott McNealy announced plans to invest million in and use NeXT software in future Sun systems NeXT partnered with Sun to create a programming environment called OpenStep which is NeXTSTEP s application layer decoupled for third party operating systems In Microsoft and NeXT collaborated on a port of OpenStep to Windows NT which was never released br In January a developers conference was held in Washington D C Attendees of the NeXT East Coast Developer Conference had the opportunity to purchase a software bundle including NEXTSTEP br Stepstone originally named Productivity Products International PPI was a software company founded in by Brad Cox and Tom Love best known for releasing the original version of the Objective C programming language In April NeXT acquired the Objective C trademark and rights from Stepstone Stepstone concurrently licensed back from NeXT the right to continue selling its Objective C based products Apple Computer later acquired the rights to Objective C along with NeXT br After exiting the hardware business NeXT focused on other operating systems New OpenStep products were released including OpenStep Enterprise for Windows NT NeXT launched WebObjects a platform for building large scale dynamic web applications It did not achieve wide popularity partly because of the initial high price of equivalent to in but it did generate profit for the company WebObjects is the first and most prominent early example of a web application server that enabled dynamic page generation based on user interactions instead of static web content WebObjects was used by many large businesses including Dell Disney Deutsche Bank the BBC Ford Nissan and later Apple for the iTunes Store and online Apple Store br br br Acquisition by Apple br br On December Apple Computer announced its intention to acquire NeXT Apple paid million in cash shares stock options and debt Steve Jobs preferred to only receive cash but Gil Amelio insisted he take million Apple shares to give the deal credibility The main purpose of the acquisition was to use NeXTSTEP as a foundation to replace the dated classic Mac OS Steve Jobs also returned to Apple as a consultant br The deal was finalized on February In Jobs took the CEO position as a permanent assignment holding the position until his resignation on August shortly before his death on October br Several NeXT executives replaced their Apple counterparts when Jobs restructured the company s board of directors Over the next five years the NeXTSTEP operating system was ported to the PowerPC architecture of Macintosh At the same time an Intel port and OpenStep Enterprise toolkit for Windows were produced That operating system was codenamed Rhapsody and the crossplatform toolkit is Yellow Box For backward compatibility Apple added the Blue Box to Rhapsody running existing Mac applications in a self contained cooperative multitasking environment br A server version of Rhapsody was released as Mac OS X Server in and the first consumer version Mac OS X in The OpenStep developer toolkit was renamed Cocoa Blue Box was renamed Classic Environment and changed to run applications full screen without requiring a separate window Apple included an updated version of the original Macintosh toolbox called Carbon running existing Mac applications natively without the constraints of Blue Box Some of NeXTSTEP s interface features are used in Mac OS X including the Dock the Services menu the Finder s Column view and the Cocoa text system br NeXTSTEP s processor independent capabilities were retained in Mac OS X leading to PowerPC x and ARM versions Only PowerPC versions were publicly available before and were discontinued by and ARM versions were not released until Macintosh moved to Intel processors by August and to ARM processors as of September br br br Corporate culture and community br br Jobs created a unique corporate culture at NeXT in terms of facilities salaries and benefits Jobs had experimented with some structural changes at Apple but at NeXT he abandoned conventional corporate structures instead making a community with members instead of employees There were only two different salaries at NeXT until the early s Team members who joined before were paid equivalent to in and those who joined afterward were paid equivalent to in This caused a few awkward situations where managers were paid less than their employees Later employees were given performance reviews and raises every six months To foster openness all employees had full access to the payrolls although few employees ever used the privilege NeXT s health insurance plan offered benefits to not only married couples but unmarried and same sex couples although the latter privilege was later withdrawn due to insurance complications The payroll schedule was also very different from other Silicon Valley companies at the time because instead of employees being paid twice per month at the end of the pay period they were paid once per month in advance br Jobs found office space in Palo Alto California at Deer Creek Road occupying a glass and concrete building that featured a staircase designed by the architect I M Pei The first floor had hardwood flooring and large worktables where the workstations would be assembled To avoid inventory errors NeXT used the just in time JIT inventory strategy The company contracted out for all major components such as mainboards and cases and had the finished components shipped to the first floor for assembly On the second floor was office space with an open floor plan The only enclosed rooms were Jobs s office and a few conference rooms br NeXT s expansion prompted renting an office at and Chesapeake Drive in Redwood City also designed by Pei The architectural centerpiece was a floating staircase with no visible supports The open floor plan was retained with furnishings that were luxurious such as chairs sofas and Ansel Adams prints br NeXT s Palo Alto office was subsequently occupied by Internet Shopping Network a subsidiary of Home Shopping Network in and later by SAP AG Its Redwood City office was later occupied by ApniCure and OncoMed Pharmaceuticals Inc br The first issue of NeXTWORLD magazine was printed in It was edited by Michael Miley and later Dan Ruby and was published in San Francisco by Integrated Media It was the only mainstream periodical to discuss NeXT computers and software The publication was discontinued in after only four volumes A developer conference NeXTWORLD Expo was held in and at the San Francisco Civic Center and in and at the Moscone Center in San Francisco with Jobs as the keynote speaker br br br Legacy br Though not very profitable the company had a wide ranging impact on the computer industry Object oriented programming and graphical user interfaces became more common after the release of the NeXTcube and NeXTSTEP The technologically successful platform was often held as the trendsetter when other companies started to emulate the success of NeXT s object oriented system br Widely seen as a response to NeXT Microsoft announced the Cairo project in the Cairo specification included similar object oriented user interface features for a proposed consumer version of Windows NT Although Cairo was ultimately abandoned some elements were integrated into other projects br By Taligent was considered by the press to be a competitor in objects and operating systems even without any product release and with NeXT as a main point of comparison For the first few years Taligent s theoretical innovation was often compared to NeXT s older but mature and commercially established platform but Taligent s launch in was called too little too late especially when compared with NeXT br Several developers used the NeXT platform to write pioneering programs For example in computer scientist Tim Berners Lee used a NeXT Computer to develop the first web browser and web server The video game series Doom and Quake were developed by id Software using NeXT computers Other commercial programs were released for NeXT computers including Altsys Virtuoso a vector drawing program with page layout features which was ported to Mac OS and Windows as Aldus FreeHand v and the Lotus Improv spreadsheet program br br br See also br br NeXT character set br Multi architecture
