Pretty Good Privacy PGP is an encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication PGP is used for signing encrypting and decrypting texts e mails files directories and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e mail communications Phil Zimmermann developed PGP in br PGP and similar software follow the OpenPGP standard RFC an open standard for encrypting and decrypting data Modern versions of PGP are interoperable with GnuPG and other OpenPGP compliant systems br br br Design br br PGP encryption uses a serial combination of hashing data compression symmetric key cryptography and finally public key cryptography each step uses one of several supported algorithms Each public key is bound to a username or an e mail address The first version of this system was generally known as a web of trust to contrast with the X system which uses a hierarchical approach based on certificate authority and which was added to PGP implementations later Current versions of PGP encryption include options through an automated key management server br br br PGP fingerprint br A public key fingerprint is a shorter version of a public key From a fingerprint someone can validate the correct corresponding public key A fingerprint like C A E B DF C C D B CA B FF can be printed on a business card br br br Compatibility br As PGP evolves versions that support newer features and algorithms can create encrypted messages that older PGP systems cannot decrypt even with a valid private key Therefore it is essential that partners in PGP communication understand each other s capabilities or at least agree on PGP settings br br br Confidentiality br PGP can be used to send messages confidentially For this PGP uses a hybrid cryptosystem by combining symmetric key encryption and public key encryption The message is encrypted using a symmetric encryption algorithm which requires a symmetric key generated by the sender The symmetric key is used only once and is also called a session key The message and its session key are sent to the receiver The session key must be sent to the receiver so they know how to decrypt the message but to protect it during transmission it is encrypted with the receiver s public key Only the private key belonging to the receiver can decrypt the session key and use it to symmetrically decrypt the message br br br Digital signatures br PGP supports message authentication and integrity checking The latter is used to detect whether a message has been altered since it was completed the message integrity property and the former to determine whether it was actually sent by the person or entity claimed to be the sender a digital signature Because the content is encrypted any changes in the message will fail the decryption with the appropriate key The sender uses PGP to create a digital signature for the message with either the RSA or DSA algorithms To do so PGP computes a hash also called a message digest from the plaintext and then creates the digital signature from that hash using the sender s private key br br br Web of trust br br Both when encrypting messages and when verifying signatures it is critical that the public key used to send messages to someone or some entity actually does belong to the intended recipient Simply downloading a public key from somewhere is not a reliable assurance of that association deliberate or accidental impersonation is possible From its first version PGP has always included provisions for distributing user s public keys in an identity certification which is also constructed cryptographically so that any tampering or accidental garble is readily detectable However merely making a certificate that is impossible to modify without being detected is insufficient this can prevent corruption only after the certificate has been created not before Users must also ensure by some means that the public key in a certificate actually does belong to the person or entity claiming it A given public key or more specifically information binding a user name to a key may be digitally signed by a third party user to attest to the association between someone actually a user name and the key There are several levels of confidence that can be included in such signatures Although many programs read and write this information few if any include this level of certification when calculating whether to trust a key br The web of trust protocol was first described by Phil Zimmermann in in the manual for PGP version br br As time goes on you will accumulate keys from other people that you may want to designate as trusted introducers Everyone else will each choose their own trusted introducers And everyone will gradually accumulate and distribute with their key a collection of certifying signatures from other people with the expectation that anyone receiving it will trust at least one or two of the signatures This will cause the emergence of a decentralized fault tolerant web of confidence for all public keys br The web of trust mechanism has advantages over a centrally managed public key infrastructure scheme such as that used by S MIME but has not been universally used Users have to be willing to accept certificates and check their validity manually or have to simply accept them No satisfactory solution has been found for the underlying problem br br br Certificates br br In the more recent OpenPGP specification trust signatures can be used to support creation of certificate authorities A trust signature indicates both that the key belongs to its claimed owner and that the owner of the key is trustworthy to sign other keys at one level below their own A level signature is comparable to a web of trust signature since only the validity of the key is certified A level signature is similar to the trust one has in a certificate authority because a key signed to level is able to issue an unlimited number of level signatures A level signature is highly analogous to the trust assumption users must rely on whenever they use the default certificate authority list like those included in web browsers it allows the owner of the key to make other keys certificate authorities br PGP versions have always included a way to cancel revoke public key certificates A lost or compromised private key will require this if communication security is to be retained by that user This is more or less equivalent to the certificate revocation lists of centralised PKI schemes Recent PGP versions have also supported certificate expiration dates br The problem of correctly identifying a public key as belonging to a particular user is not unique to PGP All public key private key cryptosystems have the same problem even if in slightly different guises and no fully satisfactory solution is known PGP s original scheme at least leaves the decision as to whether or not to use its endorsement vetting system to the user while most other PKI schemes do not requiring instead that every certificate attested to by a central certificate authority be accepted as correct br br br Security quality br To the best of publicly available information there is no known method which will allow a person or group to break PGP encryption by cryptographic or computational means Indeed in cryptographer Bruce Schneier characterized an early version as being the closest you re likely to get to military grade encryption Early versions of PGP have been found to have theoretical vulnerabilities and so current versions are recommended In addition to protecting data in transit over a network PGP encryption can also be used to protect data in long term data storage such as disk files These long term storage options are also known as data at rest i e data stored not in transit br The cryptographic security of PGP encryption depends on the assumption that the algorithms used are unbreakable by direct cryptanalysis with current equipment and techniques br In the original version the RSA algorithm was used to encrypt session keys RSA s security depends upon the one way function nature of mathematical integer factoring Similarly the symmetric key algorithm used in PGP version was IDEA which might at some point in the future be found to have previously undetected cryptanalytic flaws Specific instances of current PGP or IDEA insecurities if they exist are not publicly known As current versions of PGP have added additional encryption algorithms their cryptographic vulnerability varies with the algorithm used However none of the algorithms in current use are publicly known to have cryptanalytic weaknesses br New versions of PGP are released periodically and vulnerabilities fixed by developers as they come to light Any agency wanting to read PGP messages would probably use easier means than standard cryptanalysis e g rubber hose cryptanalysis or black bag cryptanalysis e g installing some form of trojan horse or keystroke logging software hardware on the target computer to capture encrypted keyrings and their passwords The FBI has already used this attack against PGP in its investigations However any such vulnerabilities apply not just to PGP but to any conventional encryption software br In an incident involving seized Psion PDAs belonging to members of the Red Brigade indicated that neither the Italian police nor the FBI were able to decrypt PGP encrypted files stored on them br A second incident in December see In re Boucher involving US customs agents who seized a laptop PC that allegedly contained child pornography indicates that US government agencies find it nearly impossible to access PGP encrypted files Additionally a magistrate judge ruling on the case in November has stated that forcing the suspect to reveal his PGP passphrase would violate his Fifth Amendment rights i e a suspect s constitutional right not to incriminate himself The Fifth Amendment issue was opened again as the government appealed the case after which a federal district judge ordered the defendant to provide the key br Evidence suggests that as of British police investigators are unable to break PGP so instead have resorted to using RIPA legislation to demand the passwords keys In November a British citizen was convicted under RIPA legislation and jailed for nine months for refusing to provide police investigators with encryption keys to PGP encrypted files br PGP as a cryptosystem has been criticized for complexity of the standard implementation and very low usability of the user interface including by recognized figures in cryptography research It uses an ineffective serialization format for storage of both keys and encrypted data which resulted in signature spamming attacks on public keys of prominent developers of GNU Privacy Guard Backwards compatibility of the OpenPGP standard results in usage of relatively weak default choices of cryptographic primitives CAST cipher CFB mode S K password hashing The standard has been also criticized for leaking metadata usage of long term keys and lack of forward secrecy Popular end user implementations have suffered from various signature striping cipher downgrade and metadata leakage vulnerabilities which have been attributed to the complexity of the standard br br br History br br br Early history br Phil Zimmermann created the first version of PGP encryption in The name Pretty Good Privacy was inspired by the name of a grocery store Ralph s Pretty Good Grocery featured in radio host Garrison Keillor s fictional town Lake Wobegon This first version included a symmetric key algorithm that Zimmermann had designed himself named BassOmatic after a Saturday Night Live sketch Zimmermann had been a long time anti nuclear activist and created PGP encryption so that similarly inclined people might securely use BBSs and securely store messages and files No license fee was required for its non commercial use and the complete source code was included with all copies br In a posting of June entitled PGP Marks th Anniversary Zimmermann describes the circumstances surrounding his release of PGP br br It was on this day in that I sent the first release of PGP to a couple of my friends for uploading to the Internet First I sent it to Allan Hoeltje who posted it to Peacenet an ISP that specialized in grassroots political organizations mainly in the peace movement Peacenet was accessible to political activists all over the world Then I uploaded it to Kelly Goen who proceeded to upload it to a Usenet newsgroup that specialized in distributing source code At my request he marked the Usenet posting as US only Kelly also uploaded it to many BBS systems around the country I don t recall if the postings to the Internet began on June th or th br It may be surprising to some that back in I did not yet know enough about Usenet newsgroups to realize that a US only tag was merely an advisory tag that had little real effect on how Usenet propagated newsgroup postings I thought it actually controlled how Usenet routed the posting But back then I had no clue how to post anything on a newsgroup and didn t even have a clear idea what a newsgroup was br PGP found its way onto the Internet and rapidly acquired a considerable following around the world Users and supporters included dissidents in totalitarian countries some affecting letters to Zimmermann have been published some of which have been included in testimony before the US Congress civil libertarians in other parts of the world see Zimmermann s published testimony in various hearings and the free communications activists who called themselves cypherpunks who provided both publicity and distribution decades later CryptoParty activists did much the same via Twitter br br br Criminal investigation br Shortly after its release PGP encryption found its way outside the United States and in February Zimmermann became the formal target of a criminal investigation by the US Government for munitions export without a license At the time cryptosystems using keys larger than bits were considered munitions within the definition of the US export regulations PGP has never used keys smaller than bits so it qualified at that time Penalties for violation if found guilty were substantial After several years the investigation of Zimmermann was closed without filing criminal charges against him or anyone else br Zimmermann challenged these regulations in an imaginative way In he published the entire source code of PGP in a hardback book via MIT Press which was distributed and sold widely Anybody wishing to build their own copy of PGP could cut off the covers separate the pages and scan them using an OCR program or conceivably enter it as a type in program if OCR software was not available creating a set of source code text files One could then build the application using the freely available GNU Compiler Collection PGP would thus be available anywhere in the world The claimed principle was simple export of munitions guns bombs planes and software was and remains restricted but the export of books is protected by the First Amendment The question was never tested in court with respect to PGP In cases addressing other encryption software however two federal appeals courts have established the rule that cryptographic software source code is speech protected by the First Amendment the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Bernstein case and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Junger case br US export regulations regarding cryptography remain in force but were liberalized substantially throughout the late s Since compliance with the regulations is also much easier PGP encryption no longer meets the definition of a non exportable weapon and can be exported internationally except to seven specific countries and a list of named groups and individuals with whom substantially all US trade is prohibited under various US export controls br The criminal investigation was dropped in br br br PGP and founding of PGP Inc br During this turmoil Zimmermann s team worked on a new version of PGP encryption called PGP This new version was to have considerable security improvements including a new certificate structure that fixed small security flaws in the PGP x certificates as well as permitting a certificate to include separate keys for signing and encryption Furthermore the experience with patent and export problems led them to eschew patents entirely PGP introduced the use of the CAST a k a CAST symmetric key algorithm and the DSA and ElGamal asymmetric key algorithms all of which were unencumbered by patents br After the Federal criminal investigation ended in Zimmermann and his team started a company to produce new versions of PGP encryption They merged with Viacrypt to whom Zimmermann had sold commercial rights and who had licensed RSA directly from RSADSI which then changed its name to PGP Incorporated The newly combined Viacrypt PGP team started work on new versions of PGP encryption based on the PGP system Unlike PGP which was an exclusively command line program PGP was designed from the start as a software library allowing users to work from a command line or inside a GUI environment The original agreement between Viacrypt and the Zimmermann team had been that Viacrypt would have even numbered versions and Zimmermann odd numbered versions Viacrypt thus created a new version based on PGP that they called PGP To remove confusion about how it could be that PGP was the successor to PGP PGP was renamed and released as PGP in May br br br Network Associates acquisition br In December PGP Inc was acquired by Network Associates Inc NAI Zimmermann and the PGP team became NAI employees NAI was the first company to have a legal export strategy by publishing source code Under NAI the PGP team added disk encryption desktop firewalls intrusion detection and IPsec VPNs to the PGP family After the export regulation liberalizations of which no longer required publishing of source NAI stopped releasing source code br br br Asset split br In early Zimmermann left NAI He served as Chief Cryptographer for Hush Communications who provide an OpenPGP based e mail service Hushmail He has also worked with Veridis and other companies In October NAI announced that its PGP assets were for sale and that it was suspending further development of PGP encryption The only remaining asset kept was the PGP E Business Server the original PGP Commandline version In February NAI canceled all support for PGP products with the exception of the renamed commandline product br br br McAfee br NAI now known as McAfee continued to sell and support the commandline product under the name McAfee E Business Server until In Intel Corporation acquired McAfee In the McAfee E Business Server was transferred to Software Diversified Services SDS which now sells supports and develops it under the name SDS E Business Server br For the enterprise Townsend Security currently offers a commercial version of PGP for the IBM i and IBM z mainframe platforms Townsend Security partnered with Network Associates in to create a compatible version of PGP for the IBM i platform Townsend Security again ported PGP in this time to the IBM z mainframe This version of PGP relies on a free z OS encryption facility which utilizes hardware acceleration SDS also offers a commercial version of PGP SDS E Business Server for the IBM z mainframe br br br PGP Corporation br In August several ex PGP team members formed a new company PGP Corporation and bought the PGP assets except for the command line version from NAI The new company was funded by Rob Theis of Doll Capital Management DCM and Terry Garnett of Venrock Associates PGP Corporation supported existing PGP users and honored NAI s support contracts Zimmermann served as a special advisor and consultant to PGP Corporation while continuing to run his own consulting company In PGP Corporation created a new server based product called PGP Universal In mid PGP Corporation shipped its own command line version called PGP Command Line which integrated with the other PGP Encryption Platform applications In PGP Corporation made its first acquisition the German software company Gl ck Kanja Technology AG which became PGP Deutschland AG In PGP Corporation acquired Hamburg based certificate authority TC TrustCenter and its parent company ChosenSecurity to form its PGP TrustCenter division br After the purchase of NAI s PGP assets PGP Corporation offered worldwide PGP technical support from its offices in Draper Utah Offenbach Germany and Tokyo Japan br br br Symantec br On April Symantec Corp announced that it would acquire PGP Corporation for million with the intent of integrating it into its Enterprise Security Group This acquisition was finalized and announced to the public on June The source code of PGP Desktop is available for peer review br In May a bug named EFAIL was discovered in certain implementations of PGP which from could reveal the plaintext contents of emails encrypted with it The chosen mitigation for this vulnerability in PGP Desktop is to mandate the use SEIP protected packets in the ciphertext which can lead to old emails or other encrypted objects to be no longer decryptable after upgrading to the software version that has the mitigation br br br Broadcom br On August Broadcom Inc announced they would be acquiring the Enterprise Security software division of Symantec which includes PGP Corporation br br br PGP Corporation encryption applications br This section describes commercial programs available from PGP Corporation For information on other programs compatible with the OpenPGP specification see External links below br While originally used primarily for encrypting the contents of e mail messages and attachments from a desktop client PGP products have been diversified since into a set of encryption applications that can be managed by an optional central policy server PGP encryption applications include e mails and attachments digital signatures full disk encryption file and folder security protection for IM sessions batch file transfer encryption and protection for files and folders stored on network servers and more recently encrypted or signed HTTP request responses by means of a client side Enigform and a server side mod openpgp module There is also a WordPress plugin available called wp enigform authentication that takes advantage of the session management features of Enigform with mod openpgp br The PGP Desktop x family includes PGP Desktop Email PGP Whole Disk Encryption and PGP NetShare Additionally a number of Desktop bundles are also available Depending on the application the products feature desktop e mail digital signatures IM security whole disk encryption file and folder security encrypted self extracting archives and secure shredding of deleted files Capabilities are licensed in different ways depending on the features required br The PGP Universal Server x management console handles centralized deployment security policy policy enforcement key management and reporting It is used for automated e mail encryption in the gateway and manages PGP Desktop x clients In addition to its local keyserver PGP Universal Server works with the PGP public keyserver called the PGP Global Directory to find recipient keys It has the capability of delivering e mail securely when no recipient key is found via a secure HTTPS browser session br With PGP Desktop x managed by PGP Universal Server x first released in all PGP encryption applications are based on a new proxy based architecture These newer versions of PGP software eliminate the use of e mail plug ins and insulate the user from changes to other desktop applications All desktop and server operations are now based on security policies and operate in an automated fashion The PGP Universal server automates the creation management and expiration of keys sharing these keys among all PGP encryption applications br The Symantec PGP platform has now undergone a rename PGP Desktop is now known as Symantec Encryption Desktop SED and the PGP Universal Server is now known as Symantec Encryption Management Server SEMS The current shipping versions are Symantec Encryption Desktop Windows and macOS platforms and Symantec Encryption Server br Also available are PGP Command Line which enables command line based encryption and signing of information for storage transfer and backup as well as the PGP Support Package for BlackBerry which enables RIM BlackBerry devices to enjoy sender to recipient messaging encryption br New versions of PGP applications use both OpenPGP and the S MIME allowing communications with any user of a NIST specified standard br br br OpenPGP br Within PGP Inc there was still concern surrounding patent issues RSADSI was challenging the continuation of the Viacrypt RSA license to the newly merged firm The company adopted an informal internal standard that they called Unencumbered PGP which would use no algorithm with licensing difficulties Because of PGP encryption s importance worldwide many wanted to write their own software that would interoperate with PGP Zimmermann became convinced that an open standard for PGP encryption was critical for them and for the cryptographic community as a whole In July PGP Inc proposed to the IETF that there be a standard called OpenPGP They gave the IETF permission to use the name OpenPGP to describe this new standard as well as any program that supported the standard The IETF accepted the proposal and started the OpenPGP Working Group br OpenPGP is on the Internet Standards Track and is under active development Many e mail clients provide OpenPGP compliant email security as described in RFC The current specification is RFC November the successor to RFC RFC specifies a suite of required algorithms consisting of ElGamal encryption DSA Triple DES and SHA In addition to these algorithms the standard recommends RSA as described in PKCS v for encryption and signing as well as AES CAST and IDEA Beyond these many other algorithms are supported The standard was extended to support Camellia cipher by RFC in and signing and key exchange based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography ECC i e ECDSA and ECDH

Pretty Good Privacy PGP br RFC MIME Security with OpenPGP br OpenPGP s encryption can ensure the secure delivery of files and messages as well as provide verification of who created or sent the message using a process called digital signing The open source office suite LibreOffice implemented document signing with OpenPGP as of version on Linux Using OpenPGP for communication requires participation by both the sender and recipient OpenPGP can also be used to secure sensitive files when they are stored in vulnerable places like mobile devices or in the cloud br In late a schism occurred in the OpenPGP world IETF s OpenPGP working group decided to choose a crypto refresh update strategy for the RFC specification rather than a more gradual bis path preferred by Werner Koch author of GnuPG As a result Koch took his draft now abandoned by the workgroup and forked it into a LibrePGP specification br br br Implementations br The Free Software Foundation has developed its own OpenPGP compliant software suite called GNU Privacy Guard freely available together with all source code under the GNU General Public License and is maintained separately from several graphical user interfaces that interact with the GnuPG library for encryption decryption and signing functions see KGPG Seahorse MacGPG Several other vendors have also developed OpenPGP compliant software br The development of an open source OpenPGP compliant library OpenPGP js written in JavaScript and supported by the Horizon Framework Programme of the European Union has allowed web based applications to use PGP encryption in the web browser br br br Limitations br With the advancement of cryptography parts of PGP and OpenPGP have been criticized for being dated br br The long length of PGP public keys caused by the use of RSA and additional data other than the actual cryptographic key br Lack of forward secrecy br Use of outdated algorithms by default in several implementations br Difficulty for the users to comprehend and poor usability br Lack of ubiquity br In October the ROCA vulnerability was announced which affects RSA keys generated by buggy Infineon firmware used on Yubikey tokens often used with OpenPGP Many published PGP keys were found to be susceptible Yubico offers free replacement of affected tokens br br br See also br br br br br br Further reading br Garfinkel Simson
