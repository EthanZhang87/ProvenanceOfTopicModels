possibility of an internet shutdown if citizens failed to use cyberspace responsibly during the electoral process In response to the initial report Information and Broadcasting Services Permanent Secretary Amos Malupenga promptly issued a statement dismissing the claims as malicious However there was a subsequent reversal in Malupenga s stance as he admitted that an internet shutdown was a viable option He emphasised the government s stance on preventing the abuse of cyberspace and warned of potential inconveniences if individuals were found to be engaging in misconduct Malupenga stressed that the government would invoke relevant legal provisions to maintain law and order and ensure peace and stability during the election period br On August numerous Twitter users took to the platform to express concerns about the apparent shutdown of popular social media and messaging apps such as Messenger Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp in the country This caused a significant impact as it hindered the flow of information and communication on a vital day for democratic processes Reports surfaced that internet users resorted to using Virtual Private Network VPN services as a workaround to bypass the restrictions imposed on WhatsApp and various social media platforms Despite these efforts to maintain connectivity the situation raised questions about the accessibility and freedom of expression during the election period br In response to the claims Malupenga refuted the reports dismissing them as malicious He emphasized the government s stance on responsible internet usage stating that the government would not tolerate any abuse of the internet Malupenga went on to caution that if any misconduct occurred the government reserved the right to take legal action to prevent any potential disruption of law and order particularly during the sensitive election period His remarks underscored the government s commitment to ensuring a secure and orderly electoral process Despite Malupenga s statements the restrictions on social media platforms persisted creating a challenging environment for citizens to freely express their views and share information The
