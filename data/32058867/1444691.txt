Kontact is a personal information manager and groupware software suite developed by KDE It supports calendars contacts notes to do lists news and email It offers a number of inter changeable graphical UIs KMail KAddressBook Akregator etc all built on top of a common core br br br Differences between Kontact and KDE PIM br Technically speaking Kontact only refers to a small umbrella application that unifies different stand alone applications under one user interface KDE PIM refers to a work group within the larger KDE project that develops the individual applications in a coordinated way br In popular terms however Kontact often refers to the whole set of KDE PIM applications These days many popular Linux distributions such as Kubuntu hide the individual applications and only place Kontact prominently br br br History br br The initial groupware container application was written in an afternoon by Matthias H lzer Kl pfel and later imported into the KDE source repository and maintained by Daniel Molkentin This container application is essential for Kontact to operate but without embedded components it is not useful by itself br The first embedded components were created by Cornelius Schumacher He modified the KAddressBook and KOrganizer applications to create the initial address book and organizer components At this stage no mail client component existed so KDE still lacked a functional integrated groupware application However Cornelius groundbreaking work acted as a prototype for other developers to base their efforts on br Don Sanders created the missing mail client component by modifying the KMail application He then integrated the mail client component with the other components and the groupware container application assembled and released the initial Kontact packages and created the initial Kontact website br Daniel Molkentin Cornelius Schumacher and Don Sanders then formed the core Kontact team The KMail and container application changes were imported into the KDE source repository and Kontact was released as part of KDE br During the construction of the Kontact application suite the Kolab groupware server was being worked on by Erfrakon Intevation net and Klar lvdalens Datakonsult simultaneously and was completed at approximately the same time This work was done as part of the Kroupware project that also involved modifying the KMail and KOrganizer applications to enhance them with additional groupware features br The core Kontact team the Kolab consortium and several independent KDE PIM developers then worked together to enhance Kontact by integrating the Kroupware functionality and making Kolab the primary Kontact server br Additionally a news component was created from br the KNode application by KDE developer Zack Rusin and Kontact was modified to support an array of mainly web based suites of collaboration software br br br Components br Kontact embeds the following br br Summary Page A summary which shows unread emails upcoming appointments and the latest news and weather from the user s subscribed RSS feeds br br br Email br br KMail supports folders filtering viewing HTML mail and international character sets It can handle IMAP IMAP IDLE dIMAP POP and local mailboxes for incoming mail It can send mail via SMTP or sendmail protocols It can forward HTML mail as an attachment but it cannot forward mail inline br br br Spam and filtering br KMail uses two special filters to provide a modular access to spam filtering programs br br Send this e mail to a program allows any program to be specified and when that KMail filter is activated the program will be run and supplied with the contents of the e mail as its standard input br Pipe this e mail through a program not only sends the e mail to a specified program but replaces the e mail with the output of that program This allows the use of systems such as SpamAssassin which can add their own headers to a piece of e mail br These modular filters can be combined with text filters to detect for example e mail which has been flagged by SpamAssassin by looking for the special headers it added br KMail allows manual filtering of spam directly on the mail server a very interesting feature for dial up users Emails that exceed some threshold size standard is kb but it may be set to any value are not automatically copied to the local computer With get decide later delete options KMail lists them but does not download the whole message which allows the deletion of spam and oversized messages without wasting time br br br Cryptographic support br br KMail supports the OpenPGP standard and can automatically encrypt decrypt sign and verify signatures of email messages and its attachments via either the inline or OpenPGP MIME method of signing encryption KMail depends on the GnuPG software for this functionality As a visual aid KMail will colour verified email messages green for trusted signatures yellow for untrusted signatures red for invalid signatures and blue for encrypted messages br KMail also supports S MIME messages as well as Chiasmus a proprietary cryptographic system created by the German Federal Office for Information Security BSI br br br Address book br br KAddressBook is an address book application br br br Description br KAddressBook is a graphical interface to organizing the addresses and contact information of family friends business partners etc It integrates with KDE Plasma allowing interoperability with other KDE programs including the e mail client KMail allowing one click access to composing an e mail and the instant messenger Kopete showing the online status of and easy access to instant messaging contacts It can be synchronized with other software or device using Kitchensync and OpenSync br A contact may be classified into customizable categories such as Family Business or Customer Many of the fields can have multiple entries for example if the contact has several e mail addresses A contact s fields are separated into four tabs and one tab for custom fields br br br Features br Exports and imports cards to and from vCard format br Uses DBUS to interface with other applications br Interoperable with KMail and Kopete as well as Kontact br Customize fields and categories br Automatic formatting of names br Filter ability to search for addresses br Capability to query an LDAP database containing person information br br br Organizer br br KOrganizer is the personal organizer It has the ability to manage calendars journals and a to do list br br br News feed aggregator br br Akregator is a feed aggregator It supports both RSS and Atom Feeds can be sorted into categories Akregator will aggregate all feeds in a particular category into a single list of new entries so that for example all news in the category Politics can be shown in one list It has an incremental search feature for the titles of all the entries in its database br Akregator can be configured to fetch feeds within regular intervals The user can also manually request to fetch all feeds individual ones or those in a selected category It supports feed icons and embeds KHTML as an internal tabbed web browser Any external browser can also be called br Akregator is part of KDE since the release and it is distributed with the kdepim module br br br Usenet news client br br KNode is the news client program for the KDE desktop environment br It supports multiple NNTP servers message threads scoring X Face headers reading and posting and international character sets br br br Personal wiki br br KJots is a simple outliner text editor which can be used to create a personal wiki It uses a basic tree structure to organize information it refers to nodes as books and leaves as pages It includes a book view which shows a table of contents and a view mode for all entries br Similar wiki style programs are Zim based on GTK and Python Wixi based on Python and GTK KeepNote based on Python and GTK Notecase based on GTK BasKet based on Qt Gnudiary also based on Qt Tomboy GTK based on Mono Gnote Tomboy port to C and Tiddlywiki self modifying single HTML contained personal wiki written in JavaScript and expandable with plugins Also Treeline an advanced outliner written in Python and personal database available for Linux and Microsoft Windows has similar functions br br br Other components br br Notes KNotes KDE Notes Management br Weather KWeather br br br Storage back end br br Along with the KDE Software Compilation life cycle Kontact moved to Akonadi for storing its data when in the past every Kontact component implemented the storage technologies itself Akonadi is currently mostly developed by the KDE PIM team but its design is done in an agnostic way and thus not depending on KDE technologies br The first SC release of Kontact was officially shipped with KDE That release did not use Akonadi Since then the Kontact components have been gradually migrating towards Akonadi The first stable version of KDE PIM using Akonadi was released together with KDE in June br br br See also br List of personal information managers br David Vignoni the
