BusKill is an open source hardware and software project that designs computer kill cords to protect the confidentiality of the system s data from physical theft The hardware designs are licensed CC BY SA and the software is licensed GPLv BusKill cables are available commercially from the official website or through authorized distributors br The name BusKill is an amalgamation of Bus from USB and Kill from kill cord br br br History br br The first computer kill cord was built by Michael Altfield in br The term BusKill was coined by Altfield in January when publishing the first BusKill build and udev usage instructions Linux only and it was ported by cyberkryption from Linux to Windows a couple weeks later The project s official website launched the following month br The first OS X version of the BusKill app was released in May by Steven Johnson br A cross platform rewrite of the software based on Kivy was released in August with support for Linux OS X and Windows br In December Alt Shift International O ran a crowdfunding campaign to manufacture BusKill cables on Crowd Supply The campaign raised by January br br br Hardware br The BusKill cable is a kill cord that physically tethers a user to their computer with a USB cable br One end of the cable plugs into a computer The other end of the cable is a carabiner that attaches to the user br In the middle of the cable is a magnetic breakaway coupler to allow the cable to be safely separated at any angle without physically damaging the computer or the user br A D printable hardware BusKill cable is currently under development br br br Software br The BusKill project maintains a cross platform GUI app that can either lock the screen or shutdown the computer when the cable s connection to the computer is severed and the app is in the armed state br br br Use br If the computer is separated from the user then a magnetic breakaway in the cable causes a USB hotplug removal event to execute a trigger in the app br The trigger executed by the BusKill cable s removal can lock the screen shutdown or securely erase the LUKS header and master encryption keys within a few seconds of the cable s separation br If combined with full disk encryption then these triggers can be used to ensure the confidentiality of data or be used as a counter forensics device br br br See also br br Dead man s switch br USBKill br Tails operating system br List of data erasing software br List of free and open source software packages br br br br br br External links br Official website br buskill app on GitHub
