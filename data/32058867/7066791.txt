id: 7066791
Disk encryption is a technology which protects information by converting it into code that cannot be deciphered easily by unauthorized people or processes Disk encryption uses disk encryption software or hardware to encrypt every bit of data that goes on a disk or disk volume It is used to prevent unauthorized access to data storage br The expression full disk encryption FDE or whole disk encryption signifies that everything on the disk is encrypted but the master boot record MBR or similar area of a bootable disk with code that starts the operating system loading sequence is not encrypted Some hardware based full disk encryption systems can truly encrypt an entire boot disk including the MBR br br br Transparent encryption br Transparent encryption also known as real time encryption and on the fly encryption OTFE is a method used by some disk encryption software Transparent refers to the fact that data is automatically encrypted or decrypted as it is loaded or saved br With transparent encryption the files are accessible immediately after the key is provided and the entire volume is typically mounted as if it were a physical drive making the files just as accessible as any unencrypted ones No data stored on an encrypted volume can be read decrypted without using the correct password keyfile s or correct encryption keys The entire file system within the volume is encrypted including file names folder names file contents and other meta data br To be transparent to the end user transparent encryption usually requires the use of device drivers to enable the encryption process Although administrator access rights are normally required to install such drivers encrypted volumes can typically be used by normal users without these rights br In general every method in which data is seamlessly encrypted on write and decrypted on read in such a way that the user and or application software remains unaware of the process can be called transparent encryption br br br Disk encryption vs filesystem level encryption br Disk encryption does not replace file encryption in all situations Disk encryption is sometimes used in conjunction with filesystem level encryption with the intention of providing a more secure implementation Since disk encryption generally uses the same key for encrypting the whole drive all of the data can be decrypted when the system runs However some disk encryption solutions use multiple keys for encrypting different volumes If an attacker gains access to the computer at run time the attacker has access to all files Conventional file and folder encryption instead allows different keys for different portions of the disk Thus an attacker cannot extract information from still encrypted files and folders br Unlike disk encryption filesystem level encryption does not typically encrypt filesystem metadata such as the directory structure file names modification timestamps or sizes br br br Disk encryption and Trusted Platform Module br Trusted Platform Module TPM is a secure cryptoprocessor embedded in the motherboard that can be used to authenticate a hardware device Since each TPM chip is unique to a particular device it is capable of performing platform authentication It can be used to verify that the system seeking the access is the expected system br A limited number of disk encryption solutions have support for TPM These implementations can wrap the decryption key using the TPM thus tying the hard disk drive HDD to a particular device If the HDD is removed from that particular device and placed in another the decryption process will fail Recovery is possible with the decryption password or token br Although this has the advantage that the disk cannot be removed from the device it might create a single point of failure in the encryption For example if something happens to the TPM or the motherboard a user would not be able to access the data by connecting the hard drive to another computer unless that user has a separate recovery key br br br Implementations br br There are multiple tools available in the market that allow for disk encryption However they vary greatly in features and security They are divided into three main categories software based hardware based within the storage device and hardware based elsewhere such as CPU or host bus adaptor Hardware based full disk encryption within the storage device are called self encrypting drives and have no impact on performance whatsoever Furthermore the media encryption key never leaves the device itself and is therefore not available to any malware in the operating system br The Trusted Computing Group Opal Storage Specification provides industry accepted standardization for self encrypting drives External hardware is considerably faster than the software based solutions although CPU versions may still have a performance impact and the media encryption keys are not as well protected br There are other non TCGA OPAL based self encrypted drives SED that don t have the known vulnerabilities of the TCG OPAL based drives see section below They are Host OS and BIOS independent and don t rely on the TPM module or the motherboard BIOS and their Encryption Key never leaves the crypto boundary of the drive br All solutions for the boot drive require a pre boot authentication component which is available for all types of solutions from a number of vendors It is important in all cases that the authentication credentials are usually a major potential weakness since the symmetric cryptography is usually strong br br br Password data recovery mechanism br Secure and safe recovery mechanisms are essential to the large scale deployment of any disk encryption solutions in an enterprise The solution must provide an easy but secure way to recover passwords most importantly data in case the user leaves the company without notice or forgets the password br br br Challenge response password recovery mechanism br Challenge response password recovery mechanism allows the password to be recovered in a secure manner It is offered by a limited number of disk encryption solutions br Some benefits of challenge response password recovery br br No need for the user to carry a disc with recovery encryption key br No secret data is exchanged during the recovery process br No information can be sniffed br Does not require a network connection i e it works for users that are at a remote location br br br Emergency recovery information ERI file password recovery mechanism br An emergency recovery information ERI file provides an alternative for recovery if a challenge response mechanism is unfeasible due to the cost of helpdesk operatives for small companies or implementation challenges br Some benefits of ERI file recovery br br Small companies can use it without implementation difficulties br No secret data is exchanged during the recovery process br No information can be sniffed br Does not require a network connection i e it works for users that are at a remote location br br br Security concerns br Most full disk encryption schemes are vulnerable to a cold boot attack whereby encryption keys can be stolen by cold booting a machine already running an operating system then dumping the contents of memory before the data disappears The attack relies on the data remanence property of computer memory whereby data bits can take up to several minutes to degrade after power has been removed Even a Trusted Platform Module TPM is not effective against the attack as the operating system needs to hold the decryption keys in memory in order to access the disk br Full disk encryption is also vulnerable when a computer is stolen when suspended As wake up does not involve a BIOS boot sequence it typically does not ask for the FDE password Hibernation in contrast goes via a BIOS boot sequence and is safe br All software based encryption systems are vulnerable to various side channel attacks such as acoustic cryptanalysis and hardware keyloggers In contrast self encrypting drives are not vulnerable to these attacks since the hardware encryption key never leaves the disk controller br Also most full disk encryption schemes don t protect from data tampering or silent data corruption i e bitrot That means they only provide privacy but not integrity Block cipher based encryption modes used for full disk encryption are not authenticated encryption themselves because of concerns of the storage overhead needed for authentication tags Thus if tampering would be done to data on the disk the data would be decrypted to garbled random data when read and hopefully errors may be indicated depending on which data is tampered with for the case of OS metadata by the file system and for the case of file data by the corresponding program that would process the file One of the ways to mitigate these concerns is to use file systems with full data integrity checks via checksums like Btrfs or ZFS on top of full disk encryption However cryptsetup started experimentally to support authenticated encryption br br br Full disk encryption br br br Benefits br Full disk encryption has several benefits compared to regular file or folder encryption or encrypted vaults The following are some benefits of disk encryption br br Nearly everything including the swap space and the temporary files is encrypted Encrypting these files is important as they can reveal important confidential data With a software implementation the bootstrapping code cannot be encrypted however For example BitLocker Drive Encryption leaves an unencrypted volume to boot from while the volume containing the operating system is fully encrypted br With full disk encryption the decision of which individual files to encrypt is not left up to users discretion This is important for situations in which users might not want or might forget to encrypt sensitive files br Immediate data destruction such as simply destroying the cryptographic keys crypto shredding renders the contained data useless However if security towards future attacks is a concern purging or physical destruction is advised br br br The boot key problem br One issue to address in full disk encryption is that the blocks where the operating system is stored must be decrypted before the OS can boot meaning that the key has to be available before there is a user interface to ask for a password Most Full Disk Encryption solutions utilize Pre Boot Authentication by loading a small highly secure operating system which is strictly locked down and hashed versus system variables to check for the integrity of the Pre Boot kernel Some implementations such as BitLocker Drive Encryption can make use of hardware such as a Trusted Platform Module to ensure the integrity of the boot environment and thereby frustrate attacks that target the boot loader by replacing it with a modified version This ensures that authentication can take place in a controlled environment without the possibility of a bootkit being used to subvert the pre boot decryption br With a pre boot authentication environment the key used to encrypt the data is not decrypted until an external key is input into the system br Solutions for storing the external key include br br Username password br Using a smartcard in combination with a PIN br Using a biometric authentication method such as a fingerprint br Using a dongle to store the key assuming that the user will not allow the dongle to be stolen with the laptop or that the dongle is encrypted as well br Using a boot time driver that can ask for a password from the user br Using a network interchange to recover the key for instance as part of a PXE boot br Using a TPM to store the decryption key preventing unauthorized access of the decryption key or subversion of the boot loader br Using a combination of the above br All these possibilities have varying degrees of security however most are better than an unencrypted disk br br br See also br Comparison of disk encryption software br Digital forensics br Disk
