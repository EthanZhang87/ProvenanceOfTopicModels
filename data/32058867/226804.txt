Bennett Coleman Co Ltd rebuffed his efforts to resume command of the company br br br Jain family Shanti Prasad Jain br In the early s Shanti Prasad Jain was imprisoned on charges of selling newsprint on the black market And based on the Vivian Bose Commission s earlier report which found wrongdoings of the Dalmia Jain group that included specific charges against Shanti Prasad Jain the Government of India filed a petition to restrain and remove the management of Bennett Coleman and Company Based on the pleading the Justice directed the Government to assume control of the newspaper which resulted in replacing half of the directors and appointing a Bombay High Court judge as the chairman br br br Under the Government of India br br Following the Vivian Bose Commission report indicating serious wrongdoings of the Dalmia Jain group on August the Bombay High Court under Justice J L Nain passed an interim order to disband the existing board of Bennett Coleman Co and to constitute a new board under the Government The bench ruled that Under these circumstances the best thing would be to pass such orders on the assumption that the allegations made by the petitioners that the affairs of the company were being conducted in a manner prejudicial to public interest and to the interests of the Company are correct Following that order Shanti Prasad Jain ceased to be a director and the company ran with new directors on board appointed by the Government of India with the exception of a lone stenographer of the Jains The court appointed D K Kunte as chairman of the board Kunte had no

Criticism and controversies br br br Paid news br br TOI has been criticised for being the first to institutionalise the practice of paid news in India where politicians businessmen corporations and celebrities can pay the newspaper and its journalists would carry the desired news for the payer The newspaper offers prominence with which the paid news is placed and the page on which it is displayed based on the amount of the payment According to this practice a payment plan assures a news feature and ensures positive coverage to the payer br In TOI began the practice of private treaties also called as brand capital where new companies individuals or movies seeking mass coverage and public relations major brands and organisations were offered sustained positive coverage and plugs in its news columns in exchange for shares or other forms of financial obligations to Bennett Coleman Company Ltd B C C L the owners of TOI br The B C C L with its private treaties program acquired stakes in companies and generated of its revenues by according to a critical article in The New Yorker The paid news and private treaties practice started by TOI has since been adopted by The Hindustan Times group the India Today group the Outlook group and other major media groups in India including Indian television channels This division of the company was later renamed Brand Capital and has contracts in place with many companies in diverse sectors br The paid news and private treaties blur the lines between content and advertising with the favourable coverage written by the staff reporters on the payroll of TOI The newspaper has defended its practice in by stating that it includes a note of disclosure to the reader though in a small font that its contents are advertorial entertainment promotional feature that they are doing this to generate revenues just like all newspapers in the world do advertorials according to TOI owners According to Maya Ranganathan this overlap in the function of a journalist to also act as a marketing and advertisement revenue seeker for the newspaper raises conflict of interest questions a problem that has morphed into ever larger scale in India and recognised by India s SEBI authority in July br Under an ad sales initiative called Medianet if a large company or Bollywood studio sponsored a news worthy event the event would be covered by TOI but the name of the company or studio that sponsored it would not be mentioned in the paper unless they paid TOI for advertising In a report by a subcommittee of the Press Council of India found that Medianet s paid news strategy had spread to a large number of newspapers and more than five hundred television channels br Critics state that the company s paid news and private treaties skew its coverage and shield its newspaper advertisers from scrutiny br The Hoot a media criticism website has pointed out that when a lift in a storey luxury apartment complex in Bangalore crashed killing two workers and injuring seven all the English language and Kannada language newspapers with the exception of TOI called out the name of the construction company Sobha Developers which was a private treaty partner An article titled reaping gold through bt cotton which first appeared in the Nagpur edition of TOI in reappeared unchanged in this time with a small print alert that the article was a marketing feature In both cases the article was factually incorrect and made false claims about the success of Monsanto s genetically modified cotton br According to a critical article published in the Indian investigative news magazine The Caravan when the Honda Motors plant in Gurgaon experienced an eight month long conflict between management and non unionised workers over wages and work conditions in the Times of India covered the concerns of Honda and the harm done to India s investment climate and largely ignored the issues raised by workers br Vineet Jain managing director of B C C L has insisted that a wall does exist between sales and the newsroom and that the paper does not give favorable coverage to the company s business partners Our editors don t know who we have Jain said although he later acknowledged that all private treaty clients are listed on the company s Web site Ravindra Dhariwal the former CEO of B C C L had defended private treaties in a interview with the magazine Outlook and claims that the partners in the private treaties sign contracts where they agree to clauses that they will not receive any favourable editorial coverage br br br Anti competitive behaviour br There have been claims that TOI would strike deals with advertisers only if they removed their advertisements from other competitor newspapers br TOI is also embroiled in an active lawsuit against the Financial Times In when the Financial Times was preparing to enter the Indian market Samir Jain the vice chairman of B C C L registered the term Financial Times as a trademark of his company and declared it his intellectual property in an attempt to stymie the Financial Times and prevent them from competing with The Economic Times which is owned by B C C L br In when the Hindustan Times was the top selling paper in New Delhi TOI slashed their prices by a third to one and a half rupees after having built up their ads sales force in preparation for the price drop to make up for the lost circulation revenue By the Hindustan Times had dropped to second place in Delhi TOI took a similar strategy in Bangalore where they dropped the price to one rupee despite protests from Siddharth Varadarajan one of the editors of the newspaper at the time who called the strategy predatory pricing br br br Cobrapost sting operation br In Vineet Jain managing director of B C C L and Sanjeev Shah executive president of B C C L were caught on camera as part of a sting operation by Cobrapost agreeing to promote right wing content through the group s many media properties for a proposed spend of crore US million some of which the client said could only be paid with black money B C C L has responded to the sting claiming that the video that was released by Cobrapost was doctored and incomplete and that the CEO Vineet Jain was engaged in a reverse sting of his own to expose the undercover reporter during the filming of the video The company is yet to release the video
