Anti computer forensics or counter forensics are techniques used to obstruct forensic analysis br br br Definition br Anti forensics has only recently been recognized as a legitimate field of study br One of the more widely known and accepted definitions comes from Marc Rogers One of the earliest detailed presentations of anti forensics in Phrack Magazine in defines anti forensics as the removal or hiding of evidence in an attempt to mitigate the effectiveness of a forensics investigation br A more abbreviated definition is given by Scott Berinato in his article entitled The Rise of Anti Forensics Anti forensics is more than technology It is an approach to criminal hacking that can be summed up like this Make it hard for them to find you and impossible for them to prove they found you Neither author takes into account using anti forensics methods to ensure the privacy of one s personal data br br br Sub categories br Anti forensics methods are often broken down into several sub categories to make classification of the various tools and techniques simpler One of the more widely accepted subcategory breakdowns was developed by Dr Marcus Rogers He has proposed the following sub categories data hiding artifact wiping trail obfuscation and attacks against the CF computer forensics processes and tools Attacks against forensics tools directly has also been called counter forensics br br br Purpose and goals br Within the field of digital forensics there is much debate over the purpose and goals of anti forensic methods The conventional wisdom is that anti forensic tools are purely malicious in intent and design Others believe that these tools should be used to illustrate deficiencies in digital forensic procedures digital forensic tools and forensic examiner education This sentiment was echoed at the Blackhat Conference by anti forensic tool authors James Foster and Vinnie Liu They stated that by exposing these issues forensic investigators will have to work harder to prove that collected evidence is both accurate and dependable They believe that this will result in better tools and education for the forensic examiner Also counter forensics has significance for defence against espionage as recovering information by forensic tools serves the goals of spies equally as well as investigators br br br Data hiding br Data hiding is the process of making data difficult to find while also keeping it accessible for future use Obfuscation and encryption of data give an adversary the ability to limit identification and collection of evidence by investigators while allowing access and use to themselves br Some of the more common forms of data hiding include encryption steganography and other various forms of hardware software based data concealment Each of the different data hiding methods makes digital forensic examinations difficult When the different data hiding methods are combined they can make a successful forensic investigation nearly impossible br br br Encryption br One of the more commonly used techniques to defeat computer forensics is data encryption In a presentation given on encryption and anti forensic methodologies the Vice President of Secure Computing Paul Henry referred to encryption as a forensic expert s nightmare br The majority of publicly available encryption programs allow the user to create virtual encrypted disks which can only be opened with a designated key Through the use of modern encryption algorithms and various encryption techniques these programs make the data virtually impossible to read without the designated key br File level encryption encrypts only the file contents This leaves important information such as file name size and timestamps unencrypted Parts of the content of the file can be reconstructed from other locations such as temporary files swap file and deleted unencrypted copies br Most encryption programs have the ability to perform a number of additional functions that make digital forensic efforts increasingly difficult Some of these functions include the use of a keyfile full volume encryption and plausible deniability The widespread availability of software containing these functions has put the field of digital forensics at a great disadvantage br br br Steganography br Steganography is a technique where information or files are hidden within another file in an attempt to hide data by leaving it in plain sight Steganography produces dark data that is typically buried within light data e g a non perceptible digital watermark buried within a digital photograph While some experts have argued that the use of steganography techniques is not very widespread and therefore the subject shouldn t be given a lot of thought most experts agree that steganography has the capability of disrupting the forensic process when used correctly br According to Jeffrey Carr a edition of Technical Mujahid a bi monthly terrorist publication outlined the importance of using a steganography program called Secrets of the Mujahideen According to Carr the program was touted as giving the user the capability to avoid detection by current steganalysis programs It did this through the use of steganography in conjunction with file compression br br br Other forms of data hiding br Other forms of data hiding involve the use of tools and techniques to hide data throughout various locations in a computer system Some of these places can include memory slack space hidden directories bad blocks alternate data streams and hidden partitions br One of the more well known tools that is often used for data hiding is called Slacker part of the Metasploit framework Slacker breaks up a file and places each piece of that file into the slack space of other files thereby hiding it from the forensic examination software Another data hiding technique involves the use of bad sectors To perform this technique the user changes a particular sector from good to bad and then data is placed onto that particular cluster The belief is that forensic examination tools will see these clusters as bad and continue on without any examination of their contents br br br Artifact wiping br br The methods used in artifact wiping are tasked with permanently eliminating particular files or entire file systems This can be accomplished through the use of a variety of methods that include disk cleaning utilities file wiping utilities and disk degaussing destruction techniques br br br Disk cleaning utilities br Disk cleaning utilities use a variety of methods to overwrite the existing data on disks see data remanence The effectiveness of disk cleaning utilities as anti forensic tools is often challenged as some believe they are not completely effective Experts who don t believe that disk cleaning utilities are acceptable for disk sanitization base their opinions of current DOD policy which states that the only acceptable form of sanitization is degaussing See National Industrial Security Program Disk cleaning utilities are also criticized because they leave signatures that the file system was wiped which in some cases is unacceptable Some of the widely used disk cleaning utilities include DBAN srm BCWipe Total WipeOut KillDisk PC Inspector and CyberScrubs cyberCide Another option which is approved by the NIST and the NSA is CMRR Secure Erase which uses the Secure Erase command built into the ATA specification br br br File wiping utilities br File wiping utilities are used to delete individual files from an operating system The advantage of file wiping utilities is that they can accomplish their task in a relatively short amount of time as opposed to disk cleaning utilities which take much longer Another advantage of file wiping utilities is that they generally leave a much smaller signature than disk cleaning utilities There are two primary disadvantages of file wiping utilities first they require user involvement in the process and second some experts believe that file wiping programs don t always correctly and completely wipe file information Some of the widely used file wiping utilities include BCWipe R Wipe Clean Eraser Aevita Wipe Delete and CyberScrubs PrivacySuite On Linux tools like shred and srm can be also used to wipe single files SSDs are by design more difficult to wipe since the firmware can write to other cells therefore allowing data recovery In these instances ATA Secure Erase should be used on the whole drive with tools like hdparm that support it br br br Disk degaussing destruction techniques br Disk degaussing is a process by which a magnetic field is applied to a digital media device The result is a device that is entirely clean of any previously stored data Degaussing is rarely used as an anti forensic method despite the fact that it is an effective means to ensure data has been wiped This is attributed to the high cost of degaussing machines which are difficult for the average consumer to afford br A more commonly used technique to ensure data wiping is the physical destruction of the device The NIST recommends that physical destruction can be accomplished using a variety of methods including disintegration incineration pulverizing shredding and melting br br br Trail obfuscation br The purpose of trail obfuscation is to confuse disorient and divert the forensic examination process Trail obfuscation covers a variety of techniques and tools that include log cleaners spoofing misinformation backbone hopping zombied accounts trojan commands br One of the more widely known trail obfuscation tools is Timestomp part of the Metasploit Framework Timestomp gives the user the ability to modify file metadata pertaining to access creation and modification times dates By using programs such as Timestomp a user can render any number of files useless in a legal setting by directly calling into question the files credibility br Another well known trail obfuscation program is Transmogrify also part of the Metasploit Framework In most file types the header of the file contains identifying information A jpg would have header information that identifies it as a jpg a doc would have information that identifies it as doc and so on Transmogrify allows the user to change the header information of a file so a jpg header could be changed to a doc header If a forensic examination program or operating system were to conduct a search for images on a machine it would simply see a doc file and skip over it br br br Attacks against computer forensics br In the past anti forensic tools have focused on attacking the forensic process by destroying data hiding data or altering data usage information Anti forensics has recently moved into a new realm where tools and techniques are focused on attacking forensic tools that perform the examinations These new anti forensic methods have benefited from a number of factors to include well documented forensic examination procedures widely known forensic tool vulnerabilities and digital forensic examiners heavy reliance on their tools br During a typical forensic examination the examiner would create an image of the computer s disks This keeps the original computer evidence from being tainted by forensic tools Hashes are created by the forensic examination software to verify the integrity of the image One of the recent anti tool techniques targets the integrity of the hash that is created to verify the image By affecting the integrity of the hash any evidence that is collected during the subsequent investigation can be challenged br br br Physical br To prevent physical access to data while the computer is powered on from a grab and go theft for instance as well as seizure from Law Enforcement there are different solutions that could be implemented br br Software frameworks like USBGuard or USBKill implements USB authorization policies and method of use policies If the software is triggered by insertion or removal of USB devices a specific action can be performed After the arrest of Silk Road s administrator Ross Ulbricht a number of proof of concept anti forensic tools have been created to detect seizing of the computer from the owner to shut it down therefore making the data inaccessible if full disk encryption is used br Hardware cable anchors using the Kensington Security Slot to prevent stealing by opportunistic thieves br Hardware kill cables like BusKill that lock shutdown or wipe data when ejected br Use of chassis intrusion detection feature in computer case or a sensor such as a photodetector rigged with explosives for self destruction In some jurisdictions this method could be illegal since it could seriously maim or kill an unauthorized user and could consist in destruction of evidence br Battery could be removed from a laptop to make it work only while attached to the power supply unit If the cable is removed shutdown of the computer will occur immediately causing data loss In the event of a power surge the same will occur though br Some of these methods rely on shutting the computer down while the data might be retained in the RAM from a couple of seconds up to a couple minutes theoretically allowing for a cold boot attack Cryogenically freezing the RAM might extend this time even further and some attacks on the wild have been spotted Methods to counteract this attack exist and can overwrite the memory before shutting down Some anti forensic tools even detect the temperature of the RAM to perform a shutdown when below a certain threshold br Attempts to create a tamper resistant desktop computer has been made as of the ORWL model is one of the best examples However security of this particular model is debated by security researcher and Qubes OS founder Joanna Rutkowska br br br Use by criminals br While the study and applications of anti forensics are generally available to protect users from forensic attacks of their confidential data by their adversaries eg investigative journalists human rights defenders activists corporate or government espionage Mac Rogers of Purdue University notes that anti forensics tools can also be used by criminals br Rogers uses a more traditional crime scene approach when defining anti forensics Attempts to negatively affect the existence amount and or quality of evidence from a crime scene or make the analysis and examination of evidence difficult or impossible to conduct br br br Effectiveness of anti forensics br Anti forensic methods rely on several weaknesses in the forensic process including the human element dependency on tools and the physical logical limitations of computers By reducing the forensic process s susceptibility to these weaknesses an examiner can reduce the likelihood of anti forensic methods successfully impacting an investigation This may be accomplished by providing increased training for investigators and corroborating results using multiple tools br br br See also br Cryptographic hash function br Data remanence br DECAF br Degauss br
