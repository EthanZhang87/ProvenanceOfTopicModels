they agreed to sell him shares worth percent of the company Jobs paid a five times multiple of their company s valuation at the time plus a five year license fee for PostScript in advance The purchase and advance made Adobe the first company in the history of Silicon Valley to become profitable in its first year br Warnock and Geschke considered various business options including a copy service business and a turnkey system for office printing Then they chose to focus on developing specialized printing software and created the Adobe PostScript page description language br PostScript was the first international standard for computer printing as it included algorithms describing the letter forms of many languages Adobe added kanji printer products in Warnock and Geschke were also able to bolster the credibility of PostScript by connecting with a typesetting manufacturer They weren t able to work with Compugraphic but then worked with Linotype to license the Helvetica and Times Roman fonts through the Linotron By PostScript had become the industry standard printer language with more than third party software programs and licensing agreements with printer companies br Adobe s first products after PostScript were digital fonts which they released in a proprietary format called Type worked on by Bill Paxton after he left Stanford Apple subsequently developed a competing standard TrueType which provided full scalability and precise control of the pixel pattern created by the font s outlines and licensed it to Microsoft br br br Introduction of creative software br Starting in

company first introduce Adobe Creative Cloud a year subscription plan to its creative software as opposed to a one time perpetual license payment which could often top for creative professionals The initial launch of Creative Cloud alongside Creative Suite users came at the same time that Adobe ran into controversy from users of Adobe s creative software with users of Adobe software stating that the original perpetual and subscription pricing plans for CS would be unaffordable for not only individuals but also businesses as well as refusing to extend a Creative Suite discount to non CS users The original announcement of Adobe Creative Cloud was met with a positive reception from CNET journalists as a much more enticing plan and Creative Cloud was first released in though a later CNET survey evidenced that more users had a negative perception about subscription creative software than a positive view The original pricing plan for Creative Cloud was per month for the entire suite of software though Adobe discounted the monthly cost to for users willing to commit to at least one year of continuous subscription for Creative Cloud and down to per month for former CS users with the one year commitment br By Adobe decided that CS would be the last version of Creative Suite software that would be sold through perpetual licensing option and in May announced that a Creative Cloud subscription would be the only way to get the newest versions of Photoshop Illustrator and other Adobe creative software Reception to the mandatory subscriptions for future Adobe software was mostly negative despite some positive testimonies on the move from customers and Adobe s attraction of Creative Cloud subscribers by the service s first year The switch to subscription only also did not

of regulatory scrutiny from the US and European Union This was due to concerns that Adobe already a major player in the design software market with XD would have too much control if it also owned

programs such as Adobe Reader to gain unauthorized access to computers Adobe s Flash Player has also been criticized for among other things suffering from performance memory usage and security problems A report by security researchers from Kaspersky Lab criticized Adobe for producing the products having top security vulnerabilities br Observers noted that Adobe was spying on its customers by including spyware in the Creative Suite software and quietly sending user data to a firm named Omniture When users became aware Adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account When a security flaw was later discovered in Photoshop CS Adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade Following a fierce backlash Adobe decided to provide the software patch br Adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including third party browser toolbars and free virus scanners usually as part of the Flash update process and for pushing a third party scareware program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs br br br Customer data breach br On October the company initially revealed that million customers sensitive and personal data was stolen in a security breach which included encrypted credit card information Adobe later admitted that million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their IDs and encrypted passwords as well as to many inactive Adobe accounts The company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted such as email addresses and physical addresses though data privacy laws in states require this information to be encrypted br In late a GB file stolen from Adobe and containing million usernames reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on AnonNews org LastPass a password security firm said that Adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not salted them Another security firm Sophos showed that Adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery of a lot of information with very little effort According to IT expert Simon Bain Adobe has failed its customers and should hang their heads in shame br Many of the credit cards were tied to the Creative Cloud software by subscription service Adobe offered its affected US customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service but no similar arrangements have been made for non US customers When a data breach occurs in the US penalties depend on the state where the victim resides not where the company is based br After stealing the customers data cyber thieves also accessed Adobe s source code repository likely in mid August Because hackers acquired copies of the source code of Adobe proprietary products they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security computer experts warned Security researcher Alex Holden chief information security officer of Hold Security characterized this Adobe breach which affected Acrobat ColdFusion and numerous other applications as one of the worst in US history Adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of Photoshop which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques and would make it easier to pirate Adobe s expensive products br Published on a server of a Russian speaking hacker group the disclosure of encryption algorithms other security schemes and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data and may have opened the gateway to new generation zero day attacks Hackers already used ColdFusion exploits to make off with usernames and encrypted passwords of PR Newswire s customers which has been tied to the Adobe security breach They also used a ColdFusion exploit to breach Washington state court and expose up to Social Security numbers br br br Anti competitive practices br In Adobe acquired Aldus Corp a software vendor that sold FreeHand a competing product FreeHand was direct competition to Adobe Illustrator Adobe s flagship vector graphics editor The Federal Trade Commission FTC intervened and forced Adobe to sell FreeHand back to Altsys and also banned Adobe from buying back FreeHand or any similar program for the next years Altsys was then bought by Macromedia which released versions to When Adobe acquired Macromedia in December it stalled development of FreeHand in effectively rendering it obsolete With FreeHand and Illustrator Adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for Macintosh operating systems br In a group of FreeHand graphic designers convened under the banner Free FreeHand and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against Adobe The suit alleged that br br Adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market Adobe has engaged in a series of exclusionary and anti competitive acts and strategies designed to kill FreeHand the dominant competitor to Adobe s Illustrator software product instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism br Adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled The FreeHand community believes Adobe should release the product to an open source community if it cannot update it internally br As of on its FreeHand product page Adobe stated While we recognize FreeHand has a loyal customer base we encourage users to migrate to the new Adobe Illustrator CS software which supports both PowerPC and Intel based Macs and Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Vista As of the FreeHand page no longer exists instead it simply redirects to the Illustrator page Adobe s software FTP server still contains a directory for FreeHand but it is empty br br br Cancellation fees br In April Adobe received criticism from Twitter users for the company s cancellation fees after a customer shared a tweet showing they had been charged a cancellation fee for their Adobe Creative Cloud subscription Many also showed their cancellation fees for Adobe Creative Cloud with this leading to many encouraging piracy of Adobe products and or purchase of alternatives with lower prices or using free and open source software instead Furthermore there have been reports that with changing subscriptions it is possible to avoid paying this fee br The U S Department of Justice and the FTC filed a lawsuit against Adobe and two of its executives in June alleging that the company s deceptive subscription practices and cancellation policies violated the Restore Online Shoppers Confidence Act According to the lawsuit the company purportedly used small text disclosures optional input fields and complex web of links to obscure a concealed early termination fee This fee reportedly amounted to fifty percent of the remaining value of annual contracts for users who chose to cancel early in the first year resulting in significant penalties Customers who tried to cancel services by contacting customer service faced obstacles including dropped calls and multiple transfers between representatives others continued to be billed by Adobe under the mistaken belief that they had successfully ended their subscriptions br br br terms of service update br On June Adobe updated their terms of service TOS for Photoshop stating we may access your content through both manual and automated methods such as for content review This sparked outrage with Adobe users as the new terms implied that the users work would be used to train Adobe s generative AI even if the work was under a non disclosure agreement NDA br Adobe responded the following day clarifying that they will not use user data to train generative AI or take users work as their own however they neglected to respond to the part in the TOS that gives Adobe the ability to view or use work that is contracted under an NDA br br br Chief executive officers br John Warnock br Bruce Chizen br Shantanu Narayen present br br
