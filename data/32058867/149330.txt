The Bharatiya Janata Party b a ti j d n ta pa i lit Indian People s Party BJP is a political party in India and one of the two major Indian political parties alongside the Indian National Congress Since it has been the ruling political party in India under the incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi The BJP is aligned with right wing politics and has close ideological and organisational links to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh RSS a far right paramilitary organisation Its policies adhere to Hindutva a Hindu nationalist ideology As of January it is the country s biggest political party in terms of representation in the Parliament of India as well as state legislatures br The party s origins lie in the Bharatiya Jana Sangh which was founded in by Indian politician Syama Prasad Mukherjee after he left Hindu Mahasabha to form a party as the political wing of RSS After the Emergency of the Jana Sangh merged with several other political parties to form the Janata Party it defeated the then incumbent Indian National Congress in the general election After three years in power the Janata Party dissolved in with the members of the erstwhile Jana Sangh reconvening to form the modern day BJP Although initially unsuccessful winning only two seats in the general election it grew in strength on the back of the movement around Ram Janmabhoomi in Uttar Pradesh Following victories in several state elections and better performances in national elections the BJP became the largest political party in the Parliament in however it lacked a majority in the lower house of Parliament and its government under its then leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee lasted for only days br After the general election the BJP led coalition known as the National Democratic Alliance NDA under prime minister Vajpayee formed a government that lasted for a year Following fresh elections the NDA government again headed by Vajpayee lasted for a full term in office this was the first non Congress government to do so In the general election the NDA suffered an unexpected defeat and for the next ten years the BJP was the principal opposition party Narendra Modi then the chief minister of Gujarat led the party to a landslide victory in the general election Modi has since led the NDA government as Indian prime minister including being re elected with a sole majority in the general election and with a coalition in the general election As of December the alliance governs Indian states and union territories br The official ideology of the BJP is integral humanism first formulated by Deendayal Upadhyaya in The party advocates social conservatism and a foreign policy centred on nationalist principles During its first period in national government the BJP avoided its Hindu nationalist priorities and focused on a largely liberal economic policy that prioritised globalisation and economic growth over social welfare Since returning to government in the BJP government has enacted several priorities of the RSS including criminalising the practice of triple talaq and revoking Article of the Constitution of India which granted autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir abrogating its statehood India has experienced nationwide democratic backsliding under the BJP s rule since br br br Name symbol and themes br br The name as well as the symbol of the party were selected by the founders The name Bharatiya Janata Party literally translates to Indian People s Party The Symbol of the party is the flower Lotus Nelumbo nucifera Lotus has a cultural significance within India as well as Hinduism The symbol has been regarded as a symbol of peace and prosperity within Hinduism Likewise during the independence movement of India the symbol was used by Indian nationalist as a symbol of revolt against the British Raj Lotus is also recognised as the national flower of India Thus use of the symbol gives the party a nationalist as well as Hindutva appeal Besides these the party also heavily uses the Saffron colour in its promotional materials and campaigning Similar to Lotus the Saffron colour also has a major significance within Hinduism The most common flag used by the party is predominantly saffron with a stripe of green in the left Within the Saffron part of the flag the lotus symbol is also integrated This perticular colour scheme used in the flag assists the party to project itself as a secular party Meanwhile this also helps the party to maintain a religious undertone for its core electorate and Hindu nationalistic supporter groups br br br Precursors br br br Bharatiya Jana Sangh br br The BJP s origins lie in the Bharatiya Jana Sangh popularly known as the Jana Sangh founded by Syama Prasad Mukherjee in in response to the politics of the dominant National Congress party It was founded in collaboration with the Hindu nationalist volunteer organisation the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh RSS and was widely regarded as the political arm of the RSS The Jana Sangh s aims included the protection of India s Hindu cultural identity in addition to countering what it perceived to be the appeasement of Muslim people and the country of Pakistan by the Congress party and then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru The RSS loaned several of its leading pracharaks or full time workers to the Jana Sangh to get the new party off the ground Prominent among these was Deendayal Upadhyaya who was appointed General Secretary The Jana Sangh won only three Lok Sabha seats in the first general elections in It maintained a minor presence in parliament until br The Jana Sangh s first major campaign begun in early centred on a demand for the complete integration of Jammu and Kashmir into India Mukherjee was arrested in May for violating orders from the state government restraining him from entering Kashmir He died of a heart attack the following month while still in jail Mauli Chandra Sharma was elected to succeed Mukherjee however he was forced out of power by the RSS activists within the party and the leadership went instead to Upadhyaya Upadhyay remained the General Secretary until and worked to build a committed grassroots organisation in the image of the RSS The party minimised engagement with the public focusing instead on building its network of propagandists Upadhyaya also articulated the philosophy of integral humanism which formed the official doctrine of the party Younger leaders such as Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani also became involved with the leadership in this period with Vajpayee succeeding Upadhyaya as president in The major themes on the party s agenda during this period were legislating a uniform civil code banning cow slaughter and abolishing the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir br After assembly elections across the country in the party entered into a coalition with several other parties including the Swatantra Party and the socialists It formed governments in various states across the Hindi Belt including Madhya Pradesh Bihar and Uttar Pradesh It was the first time the Jana Sangh held political office albeit within a coalition this caused the shelving of the Jana Sangh s more radical agenda br br br Janata Party br br In Prime Minister Indira Gandhi imposed a state of emergency The Jana Sangh took part in the widespread protests with thousands of its members being imprisoned along with other agitators across the country In the emergency was withdrawn and general elections were held The Jana Sangh merged with parties from across the political spectrum including the Socialist Party the Congress O and the Bharatiya Lok Dal to form the Janata Party with its main agenda being defeating Indira Gandhi The Janata Party won a majority in and formed a government with Morarji Desai as Prime Minister The former Jana Sangh contributed the largest tally to the Janata Party s parliamentary contingent with seats or of its strength Vajpayee previously the leader of the Jana Sangh was appointed the Minister of External Affairs br The national leadership of the former Jana Sangh consciously renounced its identity and attempted to integrate with the political culture of the Janata Party based on Gandhian and Hindu traditionalist principles Political scientist Christophe Jaffrelot wrote that this proved to be impossible assimilation The state and local levels of the Jana Sangh remained relatively unchanged retaining a strong association with the RSS which did not sit well with the moderate centre right constituents of the Party Violence between Hindus and Muslims increased sharply during the years that the Janata Party formed the government with former Jana Sangha members being implicated in the riots in Aligarh and Jamshedpur in The other major constituents of the Janata Party demanded that the former Jana Sangh members should dissociate themselves from the RSS which they refused to do Eventually a fragment of the Janata Party broke off to form the Janata Party Secular The Morarji Desai government was reduced to a minority in the Parliament forcing Desai s resignation Following a brief period of coalition rule general elections were held in in which the Janata Party fared poorly winning only seats In April shortly after the elections the National Executive Council of the Janata Party banned its members from being dual members of party and the RSS In response the former Jana Sangh members left to create a new political party known as the Bharatiya Janata Party br br br History br br br Formation and early days br br Although the newly formed BJP was technically distinct from the Jana Sangh the bulk of its rank and file were identical to its predecessor with Vajpayee being its first president Historian Ramachandra Guha writes that the early s were marked by a wave of violence between Hindus and Muslims The BJP initially moderated the Hindu nationalist stance of its predecessor the Jana Sangh to gain a wider appeal emphasising its links to the Janata Party and the ideology of Gandhian socialism This was unsuccessful as it won only two Lok Sabha seats in the elections of The assassination of Indira Gandhi a few months earlier resulted in a wave of support for the Congress which won a record tally of seats contributing to the low number for the BJP br br br Ram Janmabhoomi movement br br The failure of Vajpayee s moderate strategy led to a shift in the ideology of the party toward a policy of more hardline Hindu nationalism In Advani was appointed president of the party and under him it became the political voice of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement In the early s the Vishva Hindu Parishad VHP began a campaign for the construction of a temple dedicated to the Hindu deity Rama at the disputed site of the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya The mosque had been constructed by the Mughal Emperor Babur in There is a dispute about whether a temple once stood there The agitation was on the basis of the belief that the site is the birthplace of Rama and that a temple had been demolished to construct the mosque The BJP threw its support behind this campaign and made it a part of their election platform It won Lok Sabha seats in a tally which made its support crucial to the National Front government of V P Singh br In September Advani began a Rath Yatra chariot journey to Ayodhya in support of the Ram temple movement According to Guha the imagery employed by the yatra was religious allusive militant masculine and anti Muslim Advani was placed under preventive detention on the orders of the then Bihar chief minister Lalu Prasad Yadav A large number of kar sevaks religious volunteers nonetheless converged at Ayodhya and some attacked the mosque Three days of fighting with the paramilitary forces ended with the deaths of several kar sevaks Hindus were urged by VHP to take revenge for these deaths resulting in riots against Muslims across Uttar Pradesh The BJP withdrew its support from the V P Singh government leading to fresh general elections The BJP further increased its tally to seats and won a majority in the Uttar Pradesh assembly br On December the RSS and its affiliates organised a rally involving more than VHP and BJP activists at the site of the mosque The rally developed into a frenzied attack that ended with the demolition of the mosque Over the following weeks waves of violence between Hindus and Muslims erupted all over the country killing over people The government briefly banned the VHP and many BJP leaders including Advani were arrested for making inflammatory speeches provoking the demolition Several historians have said that the demolition was the product of a conspiracy by the Sangh Parivar and not a spontaneous act In the parliamentary elections in the BJP capitalised on the communal polarisation that followed the demolition to win Lok Sabha seats making it the largest party in parliament Vajpayee was sworn in as Prime Minister but was unable to attain a majority in the Lok Sabha forcing the government to resign after days br A report authored by Justice Manmohan Singh Liberhan found that people were responsible for the demolition mostly leaders from the BJP Among those named were Vajpayee Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi The report also criticised Kalyan Singh Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh during the demolition He was accused of posting bureaucrats and police officers who would stay silent during the demolition In the Supreme Court of India acquitted all of the accused in the demolition including Advani and Joshi br Following the Supreme Court verdict the Government of India announced a trust to construct the Mandir On January the Ram Mandir was officially opened Prime Minister Narendra Modi led its consecration claiming it to be the start of a new era The temple is expected to be fully completed by December br br br Vajpayee era br br A coalition of regional parties formed the government in but this grouping was short lived and mid term polls were held in The BJP contested the elections leading a coalition called the National Democratic Alliance NDA which contained its existing allies like the Samata Party the Shiromani Akali Dal the Shiv Sena in addition to the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam AIADMK and the Biju Janata Dal Among these regional parties the Shiv Sena was the only one that had an ideology similar to the BJP Amartya Sen for example called the coalition an ad hoc grouping The NDA had a majority with outside support from the Telugu Desam Party TDP and Vajpayee returned as Prime Minister However the coalition ruptured in May when the leader of AIADMK J Jayalalithaa withdrew her support and fresh elections were held again br On October without the AIADMK the NDA won seats in parliament and thus an outright majority The BJP had its highest ever tally of Vajpayee became Prime Minister for the third time Advani became Deputy Prime Minister and Home Affairs Minister This NDA government lasted its full term of five years Its policy agenda included a more aggressive stance on defence and terror and neo liberal economic policies In Bangaru Laxman then the BJP president was filmed accepting a bribe in a sting operation He was compelled to resign and was subsequently prosecuted eventually being sentenced to four years in prison br br br Gujarat violence br br On February a train carrying Hindu pilgrims was burned outside the town of Godhra killing people The incident was seen as an attack upon Hindus and sparked off massive anti Muslim violence across the state of Gujarat that lasted several weeks The death toll estimated was as high as while were displaced Rape mutilation and torture were also widespread The then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and several high ranking government officials were accused of initiating and condoning the violence as were police officers who allegedly directed the rioters and gave them lists of Muslim owned properties In April a Special Investigation Team SIT was appointed by the Supreme Court to investigate and expedite the Gujarat riots cases In Modi was cleared of complicity in the violence by the SIT BJP MLA Maya Kodnani who later held a cabinet portfolio in the Modi government was convicted of having orchestrated one of the riots and sentenced to years imprisonment she was later acquitted by the Gujarat High Court Scholars such as Paul Brass Martha Nussbaum and Dipankar Gupta have said that there was a high level of state complicity in the incidents br br br In opposition br Vajpayee called for early elections in six months ahead of schedule The NDA s campaign was based on the slogan India Shining which sought to depict it as responsible for a rapid economic transformation of the country However the NDA unexpectedly suffered a heavy defeat winning only seats in the Lok Sabha compared to the of the Congress and its allies Manmohan Singh succeeded Vajpayee as Prime Minister as the head of the United Progressive Alliance The NDA s failure to reach out to rural Indians was provided as an explanation for its defeat as was its divisive policy agenda br In May the BJP won the state elections in Karnataka This was the first time that the party won assembly elections in any South Indian state In the general elections its strength in the Lok Sabha was reduced to seats It lost the Karnataka assembly election in br br br Modi era present br br br First Modi government br In the Indian general election the BJP won seats leading the NDA to a tally of seats in the seat Lok Sabha Narendra Modi was sworn in as the th prime minister of India on May The vote share of the BJP was of all votes cast a low figure relative to the number of seats it won This was the first instance since of a single party achieving an outright majority in the Indian Parliament and the first time that it achieved a majority in the Lok Sabha on its own strength Support was concentrated in the Hindi speaking belt in North central India The magnitude of the victory was not predicted by most opinion and exit polls br Political analysts have suggested several reasons for this victory including the popularity of Modi and the loss of support for the Congress due to the corruption scandals in its previous term The BJP was also able to expand its traditionally upper caste upper class support base and received significant support from middle class and Dalit people as well as among Other Backward Classes Its support among Muslims remained low only of Muslim voters voted for the BJP The BJP was also very successful at mobilizing its supporters and raising voter turnout among them br After winning the election the organisation of the BJP became more centralised with Modi at the helm People loyal to Modi were rewarded leadership positions across various states within India Amit Shah a close confidant of Modi was appointed as the president of the BJP in Contextually many veteran leaders of the party like Lal Krishna Advani Murli Manohar Joshi and Jaswant Singh amongst others were allegedly sidelined br In the BJP joined the International Democratic Union a grouping of various centre right and right wing political parties across the globe However as of the party is no longer a member the secretary general of the IDU Tina Mercep stated that they would welcome full membership of the BJP in their global network However BJP s youth organisation remains a member of the youth wing of the IDU br During Modi s first term as prime minister the BJP expanded its presence in several states where it had previously been a minor player and it regained power in other states where it had been in opposition for a considerable period Assam Tripura Arunachal Pradesh Uttar Pradesh Bihar Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir saw an increase in the BJP s influence and the party entered government in several of these states br br br Second Modi government br In the BJP won the general election with an increased majority Soon after returning to power on August the Modi administration revoked the special status or limited autonomy granted under Article of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir a region administered by India as a state This state consists of the larger part of Kashmir which has been the subject of a dispute among India Pakistan and China since br Later in the Modi administration introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act which was passed by the Parliament of India on December It amended the Citizenship Act by providing a path to Indian citizenship for illegal immigrants of Hindu Sikh Buddhist Jain Parsi or Christian religion who had fled persecution from Pakistan Bangladesh and Afghanistan before December Muslims from those countries were not given such eligibility The act was the first time religion had been overtly used as a criterion for citizenship under Indian law A report by the V Dem Institute described India as experiencing democratic backsliding due to the Modi era which is considered the most notable challenge to India s democracy since the authoritarian Emergency years of br br br Ideology and political positions br The party along the history has been widely described as a right wing party but has recently been described as far right one specifically is considered part of the radical right a subset of the far right that does not oppose democracy br br br Social policies and Hindutva br br The official philosophy of the BJP is Integral humanism a philosophy first formulated by Deendayal Upadhyaya in who described it as advocating an indigenous economic model that puts the human being at center stage It is committed to Hindutva an ideology articulated by Indian independence activist Vinayak Damodar Savarkar According to the party Hindutva is cultural nationalism favouring Indian culture over westernisation thus it extends to all Indians regardless of religion Scholars and political analysts describe Hindutva as seeking to redefine India and recast it as a Hindu country to the exclusion of other religions making the BJP a Hindu nationalist party in a general sense The BJP moderated its stance after the NDA was formed in due to the presence of parties with a broader set of ideologies br The BJP s Hindutva ideology has been reflected in many of its government policies It supports the construction of the Ram Mandir temple at the disputed site of the Babri Mosque This issue was its major poll plank in the general elections However the demolition of the mosque during a BJP rally in resulted in a backlash against it leading to a decline of the temple s prominence in its agenda The education policy of the NDA government reorganised the National Council of Educational Research and Training NCERT and tasked it with extensively revising the textbooks used in Indian schools Various scholars have stated that this revision especially in the case of history textbooks was a covert attempt to saffronise Indian history The NDA government introduced Hindu astrology as a subject in college curricula despite opposition from several leading scientists br Links between the BJP and the RSS grew stronger under the Modi administration The RSS provided organisational support to the BJP s electoral campaigns while the Modi administration appointed a number of individuals affiliated with the RSS to prominent government positions In Yellapragada Sudershan Rao who had previously been associated with the RSS became the chairperson of the Indian Council of Historical Research ICHR Historians and former members of the ICHR including those sympathetic to the BJP questioned his credentials as a historian and stated that the appointment was part of an agenda of cultural nationalism Over its first term the Modi administration appointed other RSS members to lead universities and research institutions and recruitment of faculty members favoring the RSS increased Scholars Nandini Sundar and Kiran Bhatty write that many of these appointees did not possess the qualifications for their positions The Modi administration also made numerous changes in government approved history textbooks These changes de emphasizing the role of Jawaharlal Nehru and glorifying that of Modi himself while also portraying Indian society as harmonious without conflict or inequity br The BJP supports a uniform civil code which would apply a common set of personal laws to every citizen regardless of their personal religion replacing the existing laws which vary by religious community Historian Yogendra Malik writes that this ignores the differential procedures required to protect the cultural identity of the Muslim minority The BJP favoured and in enacted the abrogation of Article of the Constitution of India which granted a greater degree of autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir in recognition of the unusual circumstances surrounding its accession to the Indian Union It simultaneously abrogated Jammu and Kashmir statehood reorganizing it into two union territories Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh br The BJP opposes illegal immigration into India from Bangladesh The party states that this migration mostly in the states of Assam and West Bengal threatens the security economy and stability of the country Academics have pointed out that the BJP refers to Hindu migrants from Bangladesh as refugees and reserves the term illegal for Muslim migrants Academic Michael Gillan perceived it as an attempt to use an emotive issue to mobilise Hindu sentiment in a region where the party has not been historically successful The party later became the party of government in Assam The Modi administration passed a citizenship law in which provided a pathway to Indian citizenship for persecuted religious minorities from Afghanistan Bangladesh and Pakistan who are Hindus Sikhs Buddhists Jains Parsis or Christians The law does not grant such eligibility to Muslims This was first time religion had been overtly used as a criterion for citizenship under Indian law it attracted global criticism and sparked widespread protests that were halted by the COVID pandemic Counter demonstrations against the protests developed into the Delhi riots caused chiefly by Hindu mobs attacking Muslims Of the people killed two thirds were Muslim br In the Supreme Court of India reinstated the controversial Section of the Indian Penal Code which among other things criminalises homosexuality There was a popular outcry although clerics including Muslim religious leaders stated that they supported the verdict BJP president Rajnath Singh said that the party supported Section because it believed that homosexuality was unnatural though the party softened the stance after its victory in the general elections The Modi government is opposed to same sex marriage stating in a legal affidavit that legalizing it would cause complete havoc with the delicate balance of personal laws in the country and that it was not comparable with Indian family unit concept of a husband wife children which necessarily presuppose a biological man as husband a biological woman as wife and children born out of union br br br Economic policies br br The BJP s economic policy has changed considerably since its founding There is a significant range of economic ideologies within the party In the s like the Jana Sangh it reflected the thinking of the RSS and its affiliates It supported swadeshi the promotion of indigenous industries and products and a protectionist export policy However it supported internal economic liberalisation and opposed the state driven industrialisation favoured by the Congress During the elections and later when it was in government the BJP shifted its stance away from protectionism and towards globalisation The tenure of the NDA saw an unprecedented influx of foreign companies in India This was criticised including by the BJP s affiliates the RSS and the Swadeshi Jagran Manch the RSS stated that the BJP was not being true to its swadeshi ideology br The two NDA governments in the period introduced significant deregulation and privatisation of government owned enterprises It also introduced tariff reducing measures These reforms built off of the initial economic liberalisation introduced by the P V Narasimha Rao led Congress government in the early s India s GDP growth increased substantially during the tenure of the NDA The campaign slogan India Shining was based on the party s belief that the free market would bring prosperity to all sectors of society After its unexpected defeat commentators said that it was punished for neglecting the needs of the poor and focusing too much on its corporate allies br This shift in the economic policies of the BJP was also visible in state governments especially in Gujarat where the BJP held power for years Modi s government in power from to followed a strongly neo liberal agenda presented as a drive towards development Its policies have included extensive privatisation of infrastructure and services as well as a significant rollback of labour and environmental regulations While this was praised by the business community commentators criticised it as catering to the BJP s upper class constituency instead of the poor br The economic policies of Modi s government focused on privatisation and liberalisation of the economy based on a neoliberal framework Modi liberalised India s foreign direct investment policies allowing more foreign investment in several industries including in defence and the railways Other proposed reforms included making it harder for workers to form unions and easier for employers to hire and fire them some of these proposals were dropped after protests The reforms drew strong opposition from unions on September eleven of the country s largest unions went on strike including one affiliated with the BJP The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh a constituent of the Sangh Parivar stated that the underlying motivation of labour reforms favoured corporations over labourers Modi has been described as taking a more economically populist approach on healthcare and agricultural policy Modi s government has also been described as taking a more protectionist turn on international trade during his second term withdrawing from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership talks and introducing the Atmanirbhar Bharat economic plan which emphasises national self sufficiency br br br Defence and counterterrorism br Compared to Congress the BJP takes a more aggressive and nationalistic position on defence policy and terrorism The Vajpayee led NDA government carried out nuclear weapons tests and enacted the Prevention of Terrorism Act which later came under heavy criticism It also deployed troops to evict infiltrators from Kargil and supported the United States War on Terror br Although previous Congress governments developed the capability for a nuclear weapons test the Vajpayee government broke with India s historical strategy of avoiding it and authorised Pokhran II a series of five nuclear tests in The tests came soon after Pakistan tested a medium range ballistic missile They were seen as an attempt to display India s military prowess to the world and a reflection of anti Pakistan sentiment within the BJP br The Vajpayee government ordered the Indian armed forces to expel the Pakistani soldiers occupying Kashmir territory later known as the Kargil War Although the government was later criticised for the intelligence failures that did not detect Pakistani presence it was successful in ousting them from the previously Indian controlled territory br After the terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament in December the NDA government passed the Prevention of Terrorism Act The aim of the act was to improve the government s ability to deal with terrorism It initially failed to pass in the Rajya Sabha therefore the NDA took the extraordinary step of convening a joint session of the Parliament where the numerical superior Lok Sabha allowed the bill to pass The act was subsequently used to prosecute hundreds of people accused of terrorism However it was criticised by opposition parties and scholars for being an infringement upon civil liberties and the National Human Rights Commission of India stated that it had been used to target Muslims It was later repealed by the Congress led UPA government in br The Modi government has conducted several strikes on territory controlled by neighbouring countries on counterterrorism grounds This included a Indian counter insurgency operation in Myanmar against the National Socialist Council of Nagaland the Indian Line of Control strike in Pakistan administered Kashmir and the Balakot airstrike in Pakistan It also militarily intervened in defence of Bhutan during the Doklam standoff with China br The Modi government considers national security to be one of their key focuses and has implemented many long standing defence reforms In August the Modi government established the post of the Chief of Defence Staff CDS to ensure better coordination between all three services a reform that was widely requested after the Kargil War The Department of Military Affairs was also established and put under the CDS br br br Foreign policy br The historical stance of the BJP towards foreign policy like the Bharatiya Jana Sangh was based on an aggressive Hindu nationalism combined with economic protectionism The Bharatiya Jana Sangh was founded with the explicit aim of reversing the partition of India as a result its official position was that the existence of Pakistan was illegitimate This antagonism toward Pakistan remains a significant influence on the BJP s ideology During the Cold War the party and its affiliates strongly opposed India s long standing policy of non alignment and instead advocated closeness to the United States In the post Cold War era the party has largely embraced the Indian foreign policy consensus of improving relations with the United States while stressing a desire for a more multipolar world order br The Vajpayee government s foreign policy in many ways represented a radical shift from BJP orthodoxy while maintaining some aspects of it Its policy also represented a significant change from the Nehruvian idealism of previous governments opting instead for realism His party criticised him for adopting a much more moderate stance with Pakistan In he made a landmark visit to Pakistan and inaugurated the Delhi Lahore Bus service Vajpayee signed the Lahore Declaration which was an attempt to improve Indo Pakistani relations that deteriorated after the nuclear tests However the presence of Pakistani soldiers and militants in the disputed Kashmir territory was discovered a few months later causing the Kargil War The war ended a couple of months later with the expulsion of the infiltrators two months later without any shift in the Line of Control that marked the de facto border between the two countries Despite the war Vajpayee continued to display a willingness to engage Pakistan in dialogue This was not well received among the BJP cadre who criticised the government for being weak This faction of the BJP asserted itself at the post Kargil Agra summit preventing any significant deal from being reached The Vajpayee government strongly opposed the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia with Vajpayee describing it as a dance of destruction br The Vajpayee administration also offered political support to the U S War on Terror in the hope of better addressing India s issues with terrorism and insurgency in Kashmir This led to closer defence ties with the US including negotiations for the sale of weapons However the BJP strongly condemned the invasion of Iraq stating that it deplores the unjustified military action resorted to by the United States Britain and their allies against Iraq The BJP also opposed the military intervention in Libya and urged the Lok Sabha to pass a unanimous resolution condemning it br The Modi government initially took a pragmatic stance towards Pakistan attempting to improve relations with Nawaz Sharif s government culminating in Modi visiting Pakistan in Relations subsequently deteriorated particularly after Sharif was ousted in The Modi government has since been described as taking a hardline approach on Pakistan and the BJP has accused the opposition Congress of collaborating with Pakistan through its criticism of government policy In the Modi government was accused by the Nepalese government of imposing an undeclared blockade on Nepal The Modi government expressed concern following the Myanmar coup d tat but maintained cordial relations with the military government abstaining from a United Nations Security Council resolution regarding the situation there The Modi government remained neutral on the Russo Ukrainian War abstaining from United Nations Security Council Resolution which condemned the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine The leadership of the Indian National Congress backed the government s stance br br br Organisation and structure br br The organisation of the BJP is strictly hierarchical with the president being the highest authority in the party Until the BJP constitution mandated that any qualified member could be national or state president for a single three year term This was amended to a maximum of two consecutive terms br Below the president is the National Executive which contains a variable number of senior leaders from across the country It is the higher decision making body of the party Its members are several vice presidents general secretaries treasurers and secretaries who work directly with the president An identical structure with an executive committee led by a president exists at the state regional district and local level br In April the BJP stated that it had more than million registered members which would make it the world s largest political party by primary membership As of September the party does not have a single Muslim representative in the parliament and state assemblies br The BJP is a cadre based party It has close connections with other organisations with similar ideologies such as the RSS ABVP BYSS VHP and other Sangh Parivar
