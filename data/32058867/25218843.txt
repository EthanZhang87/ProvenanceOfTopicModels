Mbed TLS previously PolarSSL is an implementation of the TLS and SSL protocols and the respective cryptographic algorithms and support code required It is distributed under the Apache License version Stated on the website is that Mbed TLS aims to be easy to understand use integrate and expand br br br History br The PolarSSL SSL library is the official continuation fork of the XySSL SSL library XySSL was created by the French white hat hacker Christophe Devine and was first released on November under GNU GPL v and BSD licenses In Christophe Devine was no longer able to support XySSL and allowed Paul Bakker to create the official fork named PolarSSL In November PolarSSL was acquired by ARM Holdings br In the Dutch government approved an integration between OpenVPN and PolarSSL which is named OpenVPN NL This version of OpenVPN has been approved for use in protecting government communications up to the level of Restricted br As of the release of version PolarSSL has been rebranded to Mbed TLS to better show its fit inside the Mbed ecosystem Starting from version the library was made available under both the GPL v and Apache License v br In Mbed TLS joined the TrustedFirmware project br br br Library br The core SSL library is written in the C programming language and implements the SSL module the basic cryptographic functions and provides various utility functions Unlike OpenSSL and other implementations of TLS Mbed TLS is like wolfSSL in that it is designed to fit on small embedded devices with the minimum complete TLS stack requiring under KB of program space and under KB of RAM It is also highly modular each component such as a cryptographic function can be used independently from the rest of the framework Versions are also available for Microsoft Windows and Linux Because Mbed TLS is written in the C programming language without external dependencies it works on most operating systems and architectures br Since version it has abstraction layers for memory allocation and threading to the core to support better integration with existing embedded operating systems br br br Design priorities br The Mbed TLS library expresses a focus on readability of the code documentation automated regression tests a loosely coupled design and portable code br br br Development documentation br The following documentation is available for developers br br High Level Design a high level description of the different modules inside the library with UML diagrams use cases and interactions in common scenarios br API documentation Doxygen generated documentation from the header files of the library br Source code documentation The source code of the library is documented to clarify structures decisions and code constructs br br br Automated testing br The automated testing of Mbed TLS includes br br A test framework is included with the source code that contains over automated tests based on the number of tests in version of the library to test for regressions and compatibility on different platforms br A compatibility script compat sh that tests compatibility of SSL communication with OpenSSL and GnuTLS br A continuous integration system based on Travis CI and Jenkins br br br Use br Mbed TLS is used as the SSL component in large open source projects br br OpenVPN and OpenVPN NL br Hiawatha br PowerDNS br Monkey HTTP Server br OpenWRT br br br Platforms br Mbed TLS is currently available for most Operating Systems including Linux Microsoft Windows OS X OpenWrt Android iOS RISC OS and FreeRTOS Chipsets supported at least include ARM x PowerPC MIPS br br br Algorithms br Mbed TLS supports a number of different cryptographic algorithms br br Cryptographic hash functions br br MD MD MD RIPEMD SHA SHA SHA br MAC modes br CMAC HMAC br Ciphers br br AES ARIA Blowfish Camellia ChaCha DES RC Triple DES XTEA br Cipher modes br ECB CBC CFB CTR OFB XTS br Authenticated encryption modes br CCM GCM NIST Key Wrap br ChaCha Poly br Key derivation br HKDF br Key stretching br PBKDF PKCS PBE PKCS key derivation br Public key cryptography br br RSA Diffie Hellman key exchange br Elliptic curve cryptography ECC Elliptic curve Diffie Hellman ECDH Elliptic Curve DSA ECDSA Elliptic curve J PAKE br br br See also br br Transport Layer Security br Comparison of TLS implementations br POSSE project br GnuTLS br Network Security Services br wolfSSL previously CyaSSL br MatrixSSL br OpenSSL br br br br br br External links br Official website
