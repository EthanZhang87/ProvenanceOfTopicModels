Oculus Rift is a discontinued line of virtual reality headsets developed and manufactured by Oculus VR a virtual reality company founded by Palmer Luckey that is widely credited with reviving the virtual reality industry It was the first virtual reality headset to provide a realistic experience at an accessible price utilizing novel technology to increase quality and reduce cost by orders of magnitude compared to earlier systems The first headset in the line was the Oculus Rift DK released on March The last was the Oculus Rift S discontinued in April br The Rift went through various pre production models prior to the release of the Oculus Rift CV the first Oculus Rift intended for use by the general public Two of these the DK in early and DK in mid were intended to provide content developers with a development kit platform to create content for the Rift s eventual consumer release However both development kits were purchased by many gaming enthusiasts who wished to get an early preview of the technology The Rift saw its official consumer release in March with the Oculus Rift CV and was eventually replaced in March by the Oculus Rift S The Oculus Rift software library is still compatible with its successor the Oculus Quest br br br History br br br Initial prototypes br Through Meant to be Seen MTBS s virtual reality and D discussion forums Palmer Luckey the founder of Oculus and longtime MTBS discussion forum moderator developed the idea of creating a new head mounted display that was both more effective than what was then on the market and inexpensive for gamers br The first prototype of the Oculus Rift was created in by Palmer Luckey then years old in his parents garage in Long Beach California Luckey had been building his own virtual reality headsets since but the prototype was the first to incorporate key technologies like geometric pre distortion and a wide stereoscopic field of view that would come to define all of his subsequent designs Luckey decided to drop out of college and start Oculus VR intending to turn his prototype into the world s first mass produced virtual reality headset br br Noted videogame pioneer John Carmack the founder of id Software had been doing extensive research into virtual reality technology leading Luckey to lend him a prototype Oculus Rift Carmack wrote a public review of the prototype calling it by far the most immersive HMD he had used noting that the targeted price would also make it the cheapest At the Electronic Entertainment Expo Id Software gave demonstrations of their games running on the prototype Oculus Rift and announced that their newest game Doom BFG Edition would be compatible with the Oculus Rift These early prototypes used a high speed IMU LCD and wide FOV optics to project a degrees horizontal and degrees vertical stereoscopic D view onto the retina of the user br br br Development Kit br br Two months after being formed as a company Palmer s Oculus VR launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign on August for their virtual reality headset named the Rift The main purpose of the Kickstarter was to get an Oculus Rift prototype now referred to as DK Development Kit into the hands of developers to begin integration of the device into their games The DK was given as a reward to backers who pledged or more on Kickstarter and was later sold publicly for on their website These kits sold at a rate of per minute for the first day before slowing down throughout the week br The Rift DK was released on March and uses a inch cm screen with a significantly faster pixel switching speed than the original prototype reducing latency and motion blur when turning one s head quickly The pixel fill is also better reducing the screen door effect and making individual pixels less noticeable The LCD is brighter and the color depth is bits per pixel br The inch screen also makes the stereoscopic D no longer overlapping the left eye seeing extra area to the left and the right eye seeing extra area to the right in which there is no D depth perception The field of view FOV is more than degrees horizontal degrees diagonal which is more than double the FOV of previous VR devices from other companies and is the primary strength of the device The resolution is aspect ratio which leads to an effective of per eye aspect ratio However since the device does not feature a overlap between the eyes the combined horizontal resolution is effectively greater than The image for each eye is shown in the panel as a barrel distorted image that is then corrected by pincushion effect created by lenses in the headset generating a spherical mapped image for each eye br Initial prototypes used a Hillcrest Labs DoF head tracker that is normally Hz with a special firmware requested by John Carmack that makes it run at Hz tracker latency being vital due to the dependency of virtual reality s realism on response time The latest version includes Oculus s new Hz Adjacent Reality Tracker which aims to provide much lower latency tracking than almost any other tracker It uses a combination of three axis gyros accelerometers and magnetometers which make it capable of absolute relative to Earth head orientation tracking without drift br The Development Kit also included interchangeable lenses that aim to allow for simple dioptric correction br The entire source for the Rift DK was released to the public in September including the firmware schematics and mechanicals for the device The firmware is released under a simplified BSD license while the schematics and mechanicals are released under a Creative Commons Attribution International License br br br HD and Crystal Cove prototypes br In June a prototype of the Rift that used a p LCD panel was shown at Electronic Entertainment Expo This step forwards to twice the number of pixels as DK significantly reduced the screen door effect and made objects in the virtual world more clear especially at a distance The poor resolution had been the main criticism of the DK br This HD prototype is the only prototype of the Rift shown to the public which did not turn into a publicly available developer kit br In January an updated prototype codenamed Crystal Cove was unveiled at Consumer Electronics Show which used a special low persistence of vision OLED display as well as a new motion tracking system that utilized an external camera to track infrared dots located on the headset The new motion tracking system would allow the system to detect actions such as leaning or crouching which was claimed to help alleviate sickness experienced by users when the software did not respond to these actions br br br Development Kit br br Oculus began shipping Development Kit DK in July This is a small refinement of the Crystal Cove prototype featuring several key improvements over the first development kit such as having a higher resolution per eye low persistence OLED display higher refresh rate of Hz positional tracking a detachable cable and the omission of the need for the external control box br A teardown of DK revealed that it incorporates a modified Samsung Galaxy Note smartphone display including the front panel from the device itself br In February Oculus announced that over DK units had been shipped up until that point br br br Crescent Bay prototype br In September Oculus once again presented an updated version of the Rift codenamed Crescent Bay This version has a greater resolution than the DK a lower weight built in audio and degree tracking thanks to the presence of tracking LEDs in the back of the headset Oculus has also licensed software library RealSpace D which is expected to provide the Rift with HRTF and reverb algorithms During a panel at SXSW titled Explore the Future of VR it was publicly announced for the first time that the prototype uses two screens instead of one as previously thought br br br First consumer version br br Oculus VR announced on May that the consumer version of the Rift would ship in the first quarter of and on March the first batch of headsets began shipping to consumers br In January Oculus announced that backers of the original Kickstarter who had pledged or more roughly users would be gifted a free Oculus Rift kit including the new headset a game controller and two VR games br The consumer version is an improved version of the Crescent Bay Prototype featuring per eye displays with a resolution running at Hz degree positional tracking integrated audio a vastly increased positional tracking volume and a heavy focus on consumer ergonomics and aesthetics br In March during the announcement of the Rift S it was said that the Rift S would replace the original Rift However Oculus VR stated that they planned to support the CV with software updates for the foreseeable future br br br Rift S br br On May Oculus began shipping a new VR headset known as Rift S The Rift S has a LCD Hz and slightly larger field of view than that of the CV but lacks mechanical IPD adjustment IPD adjustment is software only The Rift S tracks the position of itself and its controllers in D space using a system known as Oculus Insight which uses the cameras on the HMD to track points in the environment and infrared LEDs on the controllers information from accelerometers in both the HMD and controllers and computer vision to predict what path the HMD and controllers are most likely to take The Rift S uses a DisplayPort port and one USB port as opposed to the HDMI and USB port used on the Rift CV The Rift S targeted the same price point USD and hardware requirements as the Rift CV and has replaced the Rift CV since br During September it was announced that the Rift S would be discontinued in in order for Oculus to focus on the Oculus Quest In the Rift S was officially discontinued and was no longer available on the Oculus website effectively ending the Rift line br br br Software br br br Runtime br The Oculus Rift runtime officially supports Microsoft Windows macOS and Linux The installation package includes components such as the headset driver which includes Oculus Display driver and controller drivers Positional Tracking Sensor driver Oculus Service and Oculus Home Application The runtime service implements a number of processing techniques intended to minimize latency and in addition improve the smoothness of VR applications under weaker hardware These include direct mode asynchronous timewarp and asynchronous spacewarp br br br Oculus Home br When the user puts on the Rift and no other content is being outputted to the headset they are presented with Oculus Home This is the default environment of the Rift which presents them with a loft environment and a floating menu allowing the user to launch VR applications they own see if their friends are using the Rift and purchase virtual reality content on the Oculus Home store from the headset br An update to the base software called Core introduced a more interactive default environment allowing the user to navigate and customize it with imported D models However in Meta formerly known as Oculus closed Oculus Home and killed it off br br br Oculus Store br Oculus maintains a market place for applications for the headsets The listings are curated to only allow applications that run smoothly on the recommended hardware Most listings are also rated on their comfort level based on their likelihood of causing motion sickness or number of jump scares However developers do not have to use Oculus Home to distribute content for the Rift this being entirely optional The Store can be accessed from the VR based Oculus Home from its desktop app or on the Oculus web site under the section Experiences br br br Features br Listings on the registry include br br Age and content ratings br Comfort rating comfortable moderate intense assigned by Oculus br User ratings and reviews user can give a rating on a star scale and write a review br br br SDK br Content for the Rift is developed using the Oculus PC SDK a free proprietary SDK available for Microsoft Windows OSX and Linux support is planned for the future This is a feature complete SDK which handles for the developer the various aspects of making virtual reality content such as the optical distortion and advanced rendering techniques br The Oculus SDK is directly integrated with the popular game engines Unity Unreal Engine and Cryengine This allows for developers already familiar with these engines to create VR content with little to no VR specific code br The Rift is an open platform and thus developers do not need any approval or verification to develop distribute or sell content for it and do not have to pay any licensing fees The SDK however cannot be modified or reused for other purposes or hardware without permission br Content developed for the Development Kit using SDK version or above are compatible with the Rift however content developed for the Development Kit or with older versions of the SDK will have to be recompiled using the latest SDK version to be compatible br On December Oculus announced the release of their finalized Rift SDK combined with the start of shipping their final version of the Oculus Rift VR headset to developers br At Oculus s rd annual conference Oculus Connect it announced the new technology called Asynchronous Spacewarp ASW This technology allows the Rift to compensate for the dropped frames According to Oculus ASW reduces the minimum specs of a PC to run the Rift without any judder br br br System requirements br In May Oculus VR announced recommended hardware specifications for computers utilizing Oculus Rift specifying a CPU equivalent to an Intel Core i at least GB of RAM at least an AMD Radeon R or Nvidia GeForce GTX graphics card an HDMI output three USB ports and one USB port Oculus VR stated that these requirements would remain in force for the life of the first consumer model The company also stated that while upcoming discrete GPUs for laptops may be able to reach the required performance for Oculus Rift systems that switch between integrated and discrete graphics may not handle output in a manner that supports the device Oculus Rift only supports bit versions of Microsoft Windows SP or later Oculus VR stated that the device would initially support Windows only in order to focus on delivering a high quality consumer level VR experience support for Linux and macOS will be developed in the future br A hardware testing application is available and Oculus VR has also certified and promoted specific models of pre built computers that meet these recommendations from vendors such as Asus Alienware and Dell Inc as being Oculus Ready br On October Oculus VR announced lessened hardware recommendations now suggesting an Intel Core i or AMD FX CPU at least a GeForce GTX or equivalent graphics card two USB ports and one USB port and Windows or newer The company stated that these lower requirements were enabled by the adoption of motion interpolation on systems that cannot handle full frames per second rendering the drivers will allow software to render at FPS instead and generate frames based on differences between them to send to the headset to maintain its frame rate Oculus promoted that these changes lowered the average hardware cost of a PC meeting these specifications to US and would also enable certain laptops to run Oculus Rift br In June Oculus VR updated its recommended OS spec to Windows While Windows and Windows users would still be able to access the standard Rift experience newer features and apps might require an upgrade to Windows br br br Applications br br br Gaming br br Oculus has stated that the Rift is primarily a gaming device and that their main content focus is gaming br Existing games with a first person or fixed camera perspective can be ported to VR with some development effort However Oculus has stated that the best virtual reality experiences are those that are designed from the beginning for the Rift br A number of AAA games have added Rift support and can be played with the Development Kit including Project CARS Elite Dangerous Euro Truck Simulator and Dirt Rally as well as a number of indie games such as AaAaAA A Reckless Disregard for Gravity and Ether One Fans and hobbyists have also modded support for the Rift into several popular titles which allow for extensive low level modding including Minecraft and Flight Simulator X br At the release event for the Rift in June Oculus announced launch titles for the Rift including EVE Valkyrie by CCP and Edge of Nowhere by Insomniac Games It also announced that it was working with other developers including Final Fantasy developer Square Enix Rock Band developer Harmonix and The Order developer Ready at Dawn br In July Oculus revealed that it was fully funding more than second party high production value games made exclusively for the Rift one of these being Insomniac s Edge of Nowhere br In July Marvel announced in the Disney s D event that it will be bringing superheroes of theirs to VR with an Oculus exclusive game called Powers United VR br br br Non gaming br br br Media br Oculus is including Oculus Cinema as a free application which allows the Rift to be used to view conventional movies and videos from inside a virtual cinema environment giving the user the perception of viewing the content on a cinema sized screen Oculus Cinema will also have a networked mode in which multiple users can watch the same video in the same virtual space seeing each other as avatars and being able to interact and talk to one another while watching the video br The Rift also offers the opportunity to view new types of media that are impossible to view on regular monitors D videos and virtual reality movies an entirely new medium br Spherical videos commonly called videos can be viewed simply by the user moving their head around and the Rift opens up the possibility for stereoscopic spherical videos commonly called D videos In September NextVR announced that they would be using a camera rig to produce D content for the Rift including short films as well as live streaming live events such as sports or concerts in D In July Oculus announced a deal with Canadian film company Felix Paul Studios to produce D videos for the Rift br The Rift also supports a new medium of entertainment experiences which Oculus calls virtual reality movies Oculus has established Oculus Story Studio to develop this type of content for the Rift a team which has multiple former employees from major VFX companies such as PIXAR and ILM Oculus Story Studio showed off its first VR movie Lost at the Sundance Film Festival gaining positive reviews from attendees br The studio intends to have VR shorts released with the Rift at launch including Lost Bullfighter Henry Dear Angelica and Kabloom br br br Social br br Oculus believes that social applications will be the most popular virtual reality experiences in the long term A number of social applications for the Rift are in development and it is expected that there will be significant competition in the sector br In May AltspaceVR launched a public beta for DK owners to try out their social VR platform AltspaceVR allows people to inhabit a shared virtual space with spatial voice communications cast content from the Internet on virtual screens and interact with objects allowing activities such as playing chess or other board games It also supports extra hardware like eye tracking and body tracking br In Philip Rosedale the founder of Second Life left Linden Lab to work on a new virtual world designed for the Rift called High Fidelity which will link thousands of user hosted virtual environments together into a consistent virtual world br In May Linden Lab the company behind Second Life announced that they too were working on a new virtual world codenamed Project Sansar built for virtual reality headsets such as the Rift and Gear VR Like Second Life Sansar will be hosted on Linden s servers and lease virtual land to players on which they can build and sell virtual items and services which Linden will take a cut of Linden Lab hoped to release Sansar by the end of br br br Industrial and professional br As well as the consumer uses the Rift has attracted significant interest from industry and professional spheres for productivity enhancement visualization and advertising br A number of architecture firms have been experimenting with using the Rift for visualization and design With the right software the Rift allows architects to see exactly what their building will look like and get an understanding of the scale that is impossible on a traditional monitor br In early Audi started using Rift Developer Kit s at dealerships to help customers configure the car they are interested in as well as to see what driving a race in the car would be like br The Norwegian Army has been experimenting with the Rift Development Kit to allow for a greater situational awareness of armoured vehicle drivers and commanders br The use of Oculus Rift on an innovative virtual operator station assists the control of a teleoperated military mobile robot Tactical Robotic System TAROS Human operators can have intuitive control and mediate D view from stereovision cameras br Oculus Medium is a Painting Experience for Oculus Rift br Education br br The Oculus Rift is increasingly used in universities and schools as an educational tool The ability to provide an immersive engaging environment can assist a diverse range of students for learning In particular there appears to be benefits to medical health science and exercise students when utilising the Oculus Rift as a supplement for content provided in anatomy and physiology There is also increasing use of the Oculus Rift within curricula in other fields such as marketing architecture clinical education computer science and paramedics br br br Television br In October the television series Halcyon was released as a virtual reality series where some episodes are broadcast on conventional television and some as VR content for Oculus Rift It is a crime drama following the world s first VR Crimes Unit in br br br Sports br Fox Sports began producing content for the Oculus Rift and other virtual reality systems in fall Its initial content consisted mainly of Fox College Football coverage br br br Casinos br Some online casinos have started using Oculus Rift to provide a unique online casino experience allowing the user to play slots and experience the lobby of a casino through their VR headset br br br ZeniMax Facebook lawsuits br br ZeniMax Media the parent company of Bethesda Softworks which in turn owns Id Software presented a lawsuit against Facebook claiming the Oculus Rift was the product of intellectual property owned by ZeniMax developed by John Carmack during his time working for Id Software The jury ruled partially in favor of ZeniMax finding the defendants did not steal trade secrets but had violated a non disclosure agreement Facebook and some of the Oculus corporate officers were ordered to pay a total of US million On March it was revealed that Carmack was suing ZeniMax for US million it owed him from their purchase of Id Software br br br Reception br The Oculus Rift received generally positive reviews The Verge felt that the Rift was a remarkably well made and accessible device describing its hardware design as having succeeded in mak ing something so stereotypically geeky look relatively natural and the headset itself as being lighter and more comfortable than most of its competition once properly fitted to the user s head Its displays were considered to be bright and relatively clear albeit grainy in appearance The Rift was panned for not offering its own motion controller at launch like the HTC Vive and that the lack of support for room scale experiences with a single camera led to games where VR support felt like an addition not a transformation However the reviewer felt that the Rift s launch titles marked the first time they had played any VR game that could rival a decently made non VR computer game for polish and scope and the Vive and then upcoming Oculus Touch controllers showed a bigger potential for VR than the largely stationary experiences the Rift offered at launch It was argued that while acknowledging the cost limitations of the headset and the necessary computing hardware and its relentless focus on gaming the Oculus Rift makes a good case for seated VR and it lays a solid foundation for what s to come br In a post launch review PCMag felt that the Oculus Touch controllers improved support for room scale experiences and a recent price cut to US made the Rift more appealing than the more expensive HTC Vive concluding that it produces an immersive crisp virtual reality experience that will continue to improve with the development of new software which has been steadily coming out on both the Oculus store and SteamVR br br br br br br
