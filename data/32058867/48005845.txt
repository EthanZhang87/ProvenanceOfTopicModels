OMEMO is an extension to the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol XMPP for multi client end to end encryption developed by Andreas Straub According to Straub OMEMO uses the Double Ratchet Algorithm to provide multi end to multi end encryption allowing messages to be synchronized securely across multiple clients even if some of them are offline The name OMEMO is a recursive acronym for OMEMO Multi End Message and Object Encryption br It is an open standard based on the Double Ratchet Algorithm and the Personal Eventing Protocol PEP XEP br OMEMO offers future and forward secrecy and deniability with message synchronization and offline delivery br br br Features br In comparison with OTR the OMEMO protocol offers many to many encrypted chat offline messages queuing forward secrecy file transfer verifiability and deniability at the cost of slightly larger message size overhead br br br History br The protocol was developed and first implemented by Andreas Straub as a Google Summer of Code project in The project s goal was to implement a double ratchet based multi end to multi end encryption scheme into an Android XMPP based instant messaging client called Conversations br It was introduced in Conversations and submitted to the XMPP Standards Foundation XSF as a proposed XMPP Extension Protocol XEP in the autumn of and got accepted as XEP in December br In July the ChatSecure project announced that they would implement OMEMO in the next releases ChatSecure v supports OMEMO and was released on January br A first experimental release of an OMEMO plugin for the cross platform XMPP client Gajim was made available on December br In June the non profit computer security consultancy firm Radically Open Security published an analysis of the OMEMO protocol br br br Client support br Selected clients supporting OMEMO full list of clients also exists br br BeagleIM macOS br ChatSecure iOS br Conversations Android br Converse js Browser based br Dino Linux macOS br Gajim Linux Windows BSD br Kaidan Linux br Monal iOS br Movim Browser based br Psi via official plugin Linux Windows macOS br Psi via official plugin Linux Windows macOS Haiku FreeBSD br libpurple clients such as Pidgin or Finch via experimental plugin br Adium via an Xtra based on the libpurple plugin br Profanity via experimental plugin BSD Linux macOS Windows br SiskinIM iOS br br br Library support br Smack supports OMEMO using the two modules smack omemo and smack omemo signal br XMPPFramework macOS iOS tvOS supports OMEMO via the OMEMOModule extension when used in conjunction with the SignalProtocol ObjC library br br br br br br External links br Homepage br XEP OMEMO Encryption Experimental br Python library for implementing OMEMO in other clients br OMEMO protocol implementation in C br OMEMO Top OMEMO support toplist in instant message clients
