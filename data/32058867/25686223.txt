Symbian was a mobile operating system OS and computing platform designed for smartphones It was originally developed as a proprietary software OS for personal digital assistants in by the Symbian Ltd consortium Symbian OS is a descendant of Psion s EPOC and was released exclusively on ARM processors although an unreleased x port existed Symbian was used by many major mobile phone brands like Samsung Motorola Sony Ericsson and above all by Nokia It was also prevalent in Japan by brands including Fujitsu Sharp and Mitsubishi As a pioneer that established the smartphone industry it was the most popular smartphone OS on a worldwide average until the end of at a time when smartphones were in limited use when it was overtaken by iOS and Android It was notably less popular in North America br The Symbian OS platform is formed of two components one being the microkernel based operating system with its associated libraries and the other being the user interface as middleware which provides the graphical shell atop the OS The most prominent user interface was the S formerly Series platform built by Nokia first released in and powering most Nokia Symbian devices UIQ was a competing user interface mostly used by Motorola and Sony Ericsson that focused on pen based devices rather than a traditional keyboard interface from S Another interface was the MOAP S platform from carrier NTT DoCoMo in the Japanese market Applications for these different interfaces were not compatible with each other despite each being built atop Symbian OS Nokia became the largest shareholder of Symbian Ltd in and purchased the entire company in The non profit Symbian Foundation was then created to make a royalty free successor to Symbian OS Seeking to unify the platform S became the Foundation s favoured interface and UIQ stopped development The touchscreen focused Symbian or S th Edition was created as a result in Symbian based on MOAP was used by NTT DoCoMo one of the members of the Foundation for the Japanese market Symbian was released in as the successor to S th Edition by which time it became fully free software The transition from a proprietary operating system to a free software project is believed to be one of the largest in history Symbian received the Anna and Belle updates in br The Symbian Foundation disintegrated in late and Nokia took back control of the OS development In February Nokia by then the only remaining company still supporting Symbian outside Japan announced that it would use Microsoft s Windows Phone as its primary smartphone platform while Symbian would be gradually wound down Two months later Nokia moved the OS to proprietary licensing only collaborating with the Japanese OEMs and later outsourced Symbian development to Accenture Although support was promised until including two major planned updates by Nokia had mostly abandoned development and most Symbian developers had already left Accenture and in January Nokia stopped accepting new or changed Symbian software from developers The Nokia PureView in was officially the last Symbian smartphone from Nokia NTT DoCoMo continued releasing OPP S Operator Pack Symbian successor of MOAP devices in Japan which still act as middleware on top of Symbian Phones running this include the F F from Fujitsu and SH F from Sharp in br br br History br br Symbian originated from EPOC an operating system created by Psion in the s In June Psion Software became Symbian Ltd a major joint venture between Psion and phone manufacturers Ericsson Motorola and Nokia br Afterwards different software platforms were created for Symbian backed by different groups of mobile phone manufacturers They include S Nokia Samsung and LG UIQ Sony Ericsson and Motorola and MOAP S Japanese only such as Fujitsu Sharp etc br With no major competition in the smartphone OS then Palm OS and Windows Mobile were comparatively small players Symbian reached as high as of the global smartphone market share in br Despite its sizable market share then Symbian was at various stages difficult to develop for First at around early to mid s due to the complexity of then the only native programming languages Open Programming Language OPL and Symbian C and of the OS then the stubborn developer bureaucracy along with high prices of various integrated development environments IDEs and software development kits SDKs which were prohibitive for independent or very small developers and then the subsequent fragmentation which was in part caused by infighting among and within manufacturers each of which also had their own IDEs and SDKs All of this discouraged third party developers and served to cause the native app ecosystem for Symbian not to evolve to a scale later reached by Apple s App Store or Android s Google Play br By contrast iPhone OS renamed iOS in and Android had comparatively simpler design provided easier and much more centralized infrastructure to create and obtain third party apps offered certain developer tools and programming languages with a manageable level of complexity and having abilities such as multitasking and graphics to meet future consumer demands br Although Symbian was difficult to program for this issue could be worked around by creating Java Mobile Edition apps ostensibly under a write once run anywhere slogan This wasn t always the case because of fragmentation due to different device screen sizes and differences in levels of Java ME support on various devices br In June Nokia announced the acquisition of Symbian Ltd and a new independent non profit organization called the Symbian Foundation was established Symbian OS and its associated user interfaces S UIQ and MOAP S were contributed by their owners Nokia NTT DoCoMo Sony Ericsson and Symbian Ltd to the foundation with the objective of creating the Symbian platform as a royalty free Free software under the Free Software Foundation FSF and Open Source Initiative OSI approved Eclipse Public License EPL The platform was designated as the successor to Symbian OS following the official launch of the Symbian Foundation in April The Symbian platform was officially made available as Free software in February br Nokia became the major contributor to Symbian s code since it then possessed the development resources for both the Symbian OS core and the user interface Since then Nokia maintained its own code repository for the platform development regularly releasing its development to the public repository Symbian was intended to be developed by a community led by the Symbian Foundation which was first announced in June and which officially launched in April Its objective was to publish the source code for the entire Symbian platform under the EPL This was accomplished on February the Symbian Foundation reported this event to be the largest codebase moved to Free software in history br However some important components within Symbian OS were licensed from third parties which prevented the foundation from publishing the full source under EPL immediately instead much of the source was published under a more restrictive Symbian Foundation License SFL and access to the full source code was limited to member companies only although membership was open to any organisation Also the Free software Qt framework was introduced to Symbian in as the primary upgrade path to MeeGo which was to be the next mobile operating system to replace and supplant Symbian on high end devices Qt was by its nature free and very convenient to develop with Several other frameworks were deployed to the platform among them Standard C and C Python Ruby and Adobe Flash Lite IDEs and SDKs were developed and then released for free and application software app development for Symbian picked up br In November the Symbian Foundation announced that due to changes in global economic and market conditions and also a lack of support from members such as Samsung and Sony Ericsson it would transition to a licensing only organisation Nokia announced it would take over the stewardship of the Symbian platform Symbian Foundation would remain the trademark holder and licensing entity and would only have non executive directors involved br With market share sliding from in Q to in Q Symbian was losing ground to iOS and Android quickly eventually falling behind Android in Q Stephen Elop was appointed the CEO of Nokia in September and on February he announced a partnership with Microsoft that would see Nokia adopt Windows Phone as its primary smartphone platform and Symbian would be gradually phased out together with MeeGo As a consequence Symbian s market share fell and application developers for Symbian dropped out rapidly Research in June indicated that over of mobile developers using Symbian at the time of publication were planning to abandon the platform br By April Nokia ceased to make free any portion of the Symbian software and reduced its collaboration to a small group of preselected partners in Japan Source code released under the original EPL remains available in third party repositories including a full set of all public code from the project as of December br On June Nokia made an agreement with Accenture for an outsourcing program Accenture will provide Symbian based software development and support services to Nokia through The transfer of Nokia employees to Accenture was completed on September and Nokia employees became Accenture employees as of October br Nokia terminated its support of software development and maintenance for Symbian with effect from January thereafter refusing to publish new or changed Symbian applications or content in the Nokia Store and terminating its Symbian Signed program for software certification br br br Features br br br User interface br Symbian has had a native graphics toolkit since its inception known as AVKON formerly known as Series S was designed to be manipulated by a keyboard like interface metaphor such as the key augmented telephone keypad or the mini QWERTY keyboards AVKON based software is binary compatible with Symbian versions up to and including Symbian br Symbian includes the Qt framework which is now the recommended user interface toolkit for new applications Qt can also be installed on older Symbian devices br Symbian was planned to introduce a new GUI library framework specifically designed for a touch based interface known as UI Extensions for Mobile or UIEMO internal project name Orbit which was built on top of Qt Widget a preview was released in January however in October Nokia announced that Orbit UIEMO had been cancelled br Nokia later recommended that developers use Qt Quick with QML the new high level declarative UI and scripting framework for creating visually rich touchscreen interfaces that allowed development for both Symbian and MeeGo it would be delivered to existing Symbian devices as a Qt update When more applications gradually feature a user interface reworked in Qt the legacy S framework AVKON would be deprecated and no longer included with new devices at some point thus breaking binary compatibility with older S applications br br br Browser br br Symbian and earlier have a built in WebKit based browser Symbian was the first mobile platform to make use of WebKit in June Some older Symbian models have Opera Mobile as their default browser br Nokia released a new browser with the release of Symbian Anna with improved speed and an improved user interface br br br Multiple language support br Symbian had strong localization support enabling manufacturers and rd party application developers to localize Symbian based products to support global distribution Nokia made languages available in the device in language packs a set of languages which cover those commonly spoken in the area where a device variant is to be sold All language packs have in common English or a locally relevant dialect of it The last release Symbian Belle supports these languages with dialects and scripts br br Symbian Belle marks the introduction of Kazakh while Korean is no longer supported br br Japanese is only available on Symbian devices as they are made in Japan and on other Symbian devices Japanese is still supported with limitations br br br Application development br From Symbian switched to using standard C with Qt as the main SDK which can be used with either Qt Creator or Carbide c Qt supports the older Symbian S rd starting with Feature Pack a k a S and Symbian S th Edition a k a S b releases as well as the new Symbian platform It also supports Maemo and MeeGo Windows Linux and Mac OS X br Alternative application development can be done using Python see Python for S Adobe Flash Lite or Java ME br Symbian OS previously used a Symbian specific C version along with CodeWarrior and later Carbide c integrated development environment IDE as the native application development environment br Web Runtime WRT is a portable application framework that allows creating widgets on the S Platform it is an extension to the S WebKit based browser that allows launching multiple browser instances as separate JavaScript applications br br br Application development br br br Qt br As of the SDK for Symbian is standard C using Qt It can be used with either Qt Creator or Carbide the older IDE previously used for Symbian development A phone simulator allows testing of Qt apps Apps compiled for the simulator are compiled to native code for the development platform rather than having to be emulated Application development can either use C or QML br br br Symbian C br As Symbian OS is written in C using Symbian Software s coding standards it is possible to develop using Symbian C although it is not a standard implementation Before the release of the Qt SDK this was the standard development environment There were multiple platforms based on Symbian OS that provided software development kits SDKs for application developers wishing to target Symbian OS devices the main ones being UIQ and S Individual phone products or families often had SDKs or SDK extensions downloadable from the maker s website too br The SDKs contain documentation the header files and library files needed to build Symbian OS software and a Windows based emulator WINS Up until Symbian OS version the SDKs also included a version of the GNU Compiler Collection GCC compiler a cross compiler needed to build software to work on the device br Symbian OS and the Symbian platform use a new application binary interface ABI and needed a different compiler A choice of compilers is available including a newer version of GCC see external links below br Symbian C programming has a steep learning curve as Symbian C requires the use of special techniques such as descriptors active objects and the cleanup stack This can make even relatively simple programs initially harder to implement than in other environments It is possible that the techniques developed for the much more restricted mobile hardware and compilers of the s caused extra complexity in source code because programmers are required to concentrate on low level details instead of more application specific features As of these issues are no longer the case when using standard C with the Qt SDK br Symbian C programming is commonly done with an integrated development environment IDE For earlier versions of Symbian OS the commercial IDE CodeWarrior for Symbian OS was favoured The CodeWarrior tools were replaced during by Carbide c an Eclipse based IDE developed by Nokia Carbide c is offered in four different versions Express Developer Professional and OEM with increasing levels of capability Fully featured software can be created and released with the Express edition which is free Features such as UI design crash debugging etc are available in the other charged for editions Microsoft Visual Studio and are also supported via the Carbide vs plugin br br br Other languages br br Symbian devices can also be programmed using Python Java ME Flash Lite Ruby NET Web Runtime WRT Widgets and Standard C C br Visual Basic programmers can use NS Basic to develop apps for S rd Edition and UIQ devices br In the past Visual Basic Visual Basic NET and C development for Symbian were possible through AppForge Crossfire a plug in for Microsoft Visual Studio On March AppForge ceased operations Oracle purchased the intellectual property but announced that they did not plan to sell or provide support for former AppForge products Net a NET compact framework for Symbian which is developed by redFIVElabs is sold as a commercial product With Net VB NET and C and other source code is compiled into an intermediate language IL which is executed within the Symbian OS using a just in time compiler As of January RedFiveLabs has ceased development of Net with this announcement on their landing page At this stage we are pursuing some options to sell the IP so that Net may continue to have a future br There is also a version of a Borland IDE for Symbian OS Symbian development is also possible on Linux and macOS using tools and methods developed by the community partly enabled by Symbian releasing the source code for key tools A plug in that allows development of Symbian OS applications in Apple s Xcode IDE for Mac OS X was available br Java ME applications for Symbian OS are developed using standard techniques and tools such as the Sun Java Wireless Toolkit formerly the J ME Wireless Toolkit They are packaged as JAR and possibly JAD files Both CLDC and CDC applications can be created with NetBeans Other tools include SuperWaba which can be used to build Symbian and s programs using Java br Nokia S phones can also run Python scripts when the interpreter Python for S is installed with a custom made API that allows for Bluetooth support and such There is also an interactive console to allow the user to write Python scripts directly from the phone br br br Deployment br Once developed Symbian applications need to find a route to customers mobile phones They are packaged in SIS files which may be installed over the air via PC connect Bluetooth or on a memory card An alternative is to partner with a phone manufacturer and have the software included on the phone itself Applications must be Symbian Signed for Symbian OS x to make use of certain capabilities system capabilities restricted capabilities and device manufacturer capabilities Applications could be signed for free in br br br Architecture br br br Technology domains and packages br Symbian s design is subdivided into technology domains each of which comprises a set of software packages Each technology domain has its own roadmap and the Symbian Foundation has a team of technology managers who manage these technology domain roadmaps br Every package is allocated to exactly one technology domain based on the general functional area to which the package contributes and by which it may be influenced By grouping related packages by themes the Symbian Foundation hopes to encourage a strong community to form around them and to generate discussion and review br The Symbian System Model illustrates the scope of each of the technology domains across the platform packages br Packages are owned and maintained by a package owner a named individual from an organization member of the Symbian Foundation who accepts code contributions from the wider Symbian community and is responsible for package br br br Symbian kernel br The Symbian kernel EKA supports sufficiently fast real time response to build a single core phone around it that is a phone in which a single processor core executes both the user applications and the signalling stack The real time kernel has a microkernel architecture containing only the minimum most basic primitives and functionality for maximum robustness availability and responsiveness It has been termed a nanokernel because it needs an extended kernel to implement any other abstractions It contains a scheduler memory management and device drivers with networking telephony and file system support services in the OS Services Layer or the Base Services Layer The inclusion of device drivers means the kernel is not a true microkernel br br br Design br Symbian features pre emptive multitasking and memory protection like other operating systems especially those created for use on desktop computers EPOC s approach to multitasking was inspired by VMS and is based on asynchronous server based events br Symbian OS was created with three systems design principles in mind br br the integrity and security of user data is paramount br user time must not be wasted br all resources are scarce br To best follow these principles Symbian uses a microkernel has a request and callback approach to services and maintains separation between user interface and engine The OS is optimised for low power battery based devices and for read only memory ROM based systems e g features like XIP and re entrancy in shared libraries The OS and application software follows an object oriented programming design named model view controller MVC br Later OS iterations diluted this approach in response to market demands notably with the introduction of a real time kernel and a platform security model in versions and br There is a strong emphasis on conserving resources which is exemplified by Symbian specific programming idioms like descriptors and a cleanup stack Similar methods exist to conserve storage space Further all Symbian programming is event based and the central processing unit CPU is switched into a low power mode when applications are not directly dealing with an event This is done via a programming idiom called active objects Similarly the Symbian approach to threads and processes is driven by reducing overheads br br br Operating system br The All over Model contains the following layers from top to bottom br br UI Framework Layer br Application Services Layer br Java ME br OS Services Layer br generic OS services br communications services br multimedia and graphics services br connectivity services br Base Services Layer br Kernel Services Hardware Interface Layer br The Base Services Layer is the lowest level reachable by user side operations it includes the File Server and User Library a Plug In Framework which manages all plug ins Store Central Repository DBMS and cryptographic services It also includes the Text Window Server and the Text Shell the two basic services from which a completely functional port can be created without the need for any higher layer services br Symbian has a microkernel architecture which means that the minimum necessary is within the kernel to maximise robustness availability and responsiveness It contains a scheduler memory management and device drivers but other services like networking telephony and file system support are placed in the OS Services Layer or the Base Services Layer The inclusion of device drivers means the kernel is not a true microkernel The EKA real time kernel which has been termed a nanokernel contains only the most basic primitives and requires an extended kernel to implement any other abstractions br Symbian is designed to emphasise compatibility with other devices especially removable media file systems Early development of EPOC led to adopting File Allocation Table FAT as the internal file system and this remains but an object oriented persistence model was placed over the underlying FAT to provide a POSIX style interface and a streaming model The internal data formats rely on using the same APIs that create the data to run all file manipulations This has resulted in data dependence and associated difficulties with changes and data migration br There is a large networking and communication subsystem which has three main servers called ETEL EPOC telephony ESOCK EPOC sockets and C responsible for serial communication Each of these has a plug in scheme For example ESOCK allows different PRT protocol modules to implement various networking protocol schemes The subsystem also contains code that supports short range communication links such as Bluetooth IrDA and USB br There is also a large volume of user interface UI Code Only the base classes and substructure were contained in Symbian OS while most of the actual user interfaces were maintained by third parties This is no longer the case The three major UIs S UIQ and MOAP were contributed to Symbian in Symbian also contains graphics text layout and font rendering libraries br All native Symbian C applications are built up from three framework classes defined by the application architecture an application class a document class and an application user interface class These classes create the fundamental application behaviour The remaining needed functions the application view data model and data interface are created independently and interact solely through their APIs with the other classes br Many other things do not yet fit into this model for example SyncML Java ME providing another set of APIs on top of most of the OS and multimedia Many of these are frameworks and vendors are expected to supply plug ins to these frameworks from third parties for example Helix Player for multimedia codecs This has the advantage that the APIs to such areas of functionality are the same on many phone models and that vendors get a lot of flexibility But it means that phone vendors needed to do a great deal of integration work to make a Symbian OS phone br Symbian includes a reference user interface called TechView It provides a basis for starting customisation and is the environment in which much Symbian test and example code runs It is very similar to the user interface from the Psion Series personal organiser and is not used for any production phone user interface br br br Symbian UI variants platforms br Symbian as it advanced to OS version spun off into several different graphical user interfaces each backed by a certain company or group of companies Unlike Android OS s cosmetic GUIs Symbian GUIs are referred to as platforms due to more significant modifications and integrations Things became more complicated when applications developed for different Symbian GUI platforms were not compatible with each other and this led to OS fragmentation br User Interfaces platforms that run on or are based on Symbian OS include br br S Symbian also called Series It was backed mainly by Nokia There are several editions of this platform appearing first as S st Edition on Nokia It was followed by S nd Edition e g Nokia N S rd Edition e g Nokia N and S th Edition which introduced touch UI e g Nokia N The name S was changed to just Symbian after the formation of Symbian Foundation and subsequently called Symbian and br Series used by Nokia Communicators such as Nokia i br Series Touch and button based The only phone using this platform is Nokia br UIQ backed mainly by Sony Ericsson and then Motorola It is compatible with both buttons and touch stylus based inputs The last major release version is UIQ in on Sony Ericsson G It was discontinued after the formation of Symbian Foundation and the decision to consolidate different Symbian UI variants into one led to the adoption of S as the version going forward br MOAP Mobile Oriented Applications Platform Japan Only used by Fujitsu Mitsubishi Sony Ericsson and Sharp developed phones for NTT DoCoMo It uses an interface developed specifically for DoCoMo s FOMA Freedom of Mobile Access network brand and is based on the UI from earlier Fujitsu FOMA models The user cannot install new C applications Japan Only br OPP Japan Only successor of MOAP used on NTT DoCoMo s FOMA phone br br br Version comparison br br Manufactured by Fujitsu br Manufactured by Sharp br Software update service for Nokia Belle and Symbian S phones is discontinued at the end of December br br br Market share and competition br In Q million Symbian phones were shipped double the number as in Q Symbian Ltd was particularly impressed by progress made in Japan br million devices were shipped in Q a growth of compared to Q and market share growing from to However in the United States it was much less popular with a market share in Q well behind Palm OS and Windows Mobile This has been attributed to North American customers preferring wireless PDAs over smartphones as well as Nokia s low popularity there br On November the millionth smartphone running the OS was shipped As of July more than million devices running Symbian OS had been produced br In Symbian had of the smartphone market compared with of the market in the second quarter of br By the end of May million Symbian powered phones were sold in Japan representing of Symbian s total worldwide shipments of million By November the figure was million achieving a market share of by June in the Japanese market br Symbian has lost market share over the years as the market has dramatically grown with new competing platforms entering the market though its sales have increased during the same timeframe E g although Symbian s share of the global smartphone market dropped from in to in shipments of Symbian devices grew from million units to million units From Q to Q shipments of Symbian devices grew by million units from units to compared to an increase of million units for Android million units for RIM and million units for Apple br Prior reports on device shipments as published in February showed that the Symbian devices formed a share of the smart mobile devices shipped in with RIM having Apple having via iOS Microsoft having via Windows CE and Windows Mobile and Android having br In the number of smart mobile device sales Symbian devices were the market leaders for Statistics showed that Symbian devices formed a share of smart mobile devices sold with Android having RIM having and Apple having via iOS Some estimates indicate that the number of mobile devices shipped with the Symbian OS up to the end of Q is million br Over the course of Motorola Samsung LG and Sony Ericsson announced their withdrawal from Symbian in favour of alternative platforms including Google s Android Microsoft s Windows Phone br In Q according to IDC worldwide market share has dropped to an all time low of br br br Criticism br The users of Symbian in the countries with non Latin alphabets such as Russia Ukraine and others have been criticizing the complicated method of language switching for many years For example if a user wants to type a Latin letter they must call the menu click the languages item use arrow keys to choose for example the English language from among many other languages and then press the OK button After typing the Latin letter the user must repeat the procedure to return to their native keyboard This method slows down typing significantly In touch phones and QWERTY phones the procedure is slightly different but remains time consuming All other mobile operating systems as well as Nokia s S phones enable switching between two initially selected languages by one click or a single gesture br Early versions of the firmware for the original Nokia N running on Symbian Series th Edition have been heavily criticized as buggy also contributed by the low amount of RAM installed in the phone br In November Smartphone blog All About Symbian criticized the performance of Symbian s default web browser and recommended the alternative browser Opera Mobile Nokia s Senior Vice President Jo Harlow promised an updated browser in the first quarter of br There are many different versions and editions of Symbian which led to fragmentation Apps and software may be incompatible when installed across different versions of Symbian br br br Malware br br Symbian OS is subject to a variety of viruses the best known of which is Cabir Usually these send themselves from phone to phone by Bluetooth So far none have exploited any flaws in Symbian OS Instead they have all asked the user whether they want to install the software with somewhat prominent warnings that it can t be trusted although some rely on social engineering often in the form of messages that come with the malware rogue software purporting to be a utility game or some other application for Symbian br However with a view that the average mobile phone user shouldn t have to worry about security Symbian OS x adopted a Unix style capability model permissions per process not per object Installed software is theoretically unable to do damaging things such as costing the user money by sending network data without being digitally signed thus making it traceable Commercial developers who can afford the cost can apply to have their software signed via the Symbian Signed program Developers also have the option of self signing their programs However the set of available features does not include access to Bluetooth IrDA GSM CellID voice calls GPS and few others Some operators opted to disable all certificates other than the Symbian Signed certificates br Some other hostile programs are listed below but all of them still require the input of the user to run br br Drever A is a malicious SIS file trojan that attempts to disable the automatic startup from Simworks and Kaspersky Symbian Anti Virus applications br Locknut B is a malicious SIS file trojan that pretends to be a patch for Symbian S mobile phones When installed it drops a binary that will crash a critical system service component This will prevent any application from being launched in the phone br Mabir A is basically Cabir with added MMS functionality The two are written by the same author and the code shares many similarities It spreads using Bluetooth via the same routine as early variants of Cabir As Mabir A activates it will search for the first phone it finds and starts sending copies of itself to that phone br Fontal A is an SIS file trojan that installs a corrupted file which causes the phone to fail at reboot If the user tries to reboot the infected phone it will be permanently stuck on the reboot screen and cannot be used without disinfection that is the use of the reformat key combination which causes the phone to lose all data Being a trojan Fontal cannot spread by itself the most likely way for the user to get infected would be to acquire the file from untrusted sources and then install it to the phone inadvertently or otherwise br A new form of malware threat to Symbian OS in the form of cooked firmware was demonstrated at the International Malware Conference Malcon December by Indian hacker Atul Alex br br br Bypassing platform security br Symbian OS x devices can be hacked to remove the platform security introduced in OS onwards allowing users to execute unsigned code This allows altering system files and access to previously locked areas of the OS The hack was criticised by Nokia for potentially increasing the threat
