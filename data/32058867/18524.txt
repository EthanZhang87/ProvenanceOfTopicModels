title: Latin America
id: 18524
Latin America often refers to the regions in the Americas in which Romance languages are the main languages and the culture and Empires of its peoples have had significant historical ethnic linguistic and cultural impact It is commonly used to describe South America with the exception of Suriname Guyana and the Falkland islands plus Central America Mexico and most of the islands of the Caribbean In a narrow sense it refers to Spanish America and often it may also include Brazil Portuguese America The term Latin America may be used broader than Hispanic America which specifically refers to Spanish speaking countries and narrower than categories such as Ibero America a term that refers to both Spanish and Portuguese speaking countries from the Americas and sometimes from Europe It could also theoretically encompass Quebec or Louisiana where French is still spoken and are historical remnants of the French Empire in that region of the globe br The term Latin America was first used in Paris at a conference in called Initiative of America Idea for a Federal Congress of the Republics Iniciativa de la Am rica Idea de un Congreso Federal de las Rep blicas by the Chilean politician Francisco Bilbao The term was further popularized by French emperor Napoleon III s government of political strongman that in the s as Am rique latine to justify France s military involvement in the Second Mexican Empire and to include French speaking territories in the Americas such as French Canada Haiti French Louisiana French Guiana Martinique Guadeloupe and the French Antillean Creole Caribbean islands Saint Lucia and Dominica in the larger group of countries where Spanish and Portuguese languages prevailed br The region covers an area that stretches from Mexico to Tierra del Fuego and includes much of the Caribbean It has an area of approximately km sq mi almost of the Earth s land surface area In Latin America had a combined nominal GDP of US trillion and a GDP PPP of US trillion br br br Etymology and definitions br br br Origins br br The concept and term came into use in the mid nineteenth century Gobat states the idea did stem from the French concept of a Latin race which Latin American migr s in Europe helped spread to the other side of the Atlantic It was popularized in s France during the reign of Napoleon III The term Latin America was a part of his attempt to create a French empire in the Americas Research has shown that the idea that a part of the Americas has a linguistic and cultural affinity with the Romance cultures as a whole can be traced back to the s in the writing of the French Saint Simonian Michel Chevalier who postulated that a part of the Americas was inhabited by people of a Latin race and that it could therefore ally itself with Latin Europe ultimately overlapping the Latin Church in a struggle with Teutonic Europe and Anglo Saxon America with its Anglo Saxonism as well as Slavic Europe with its Pan Slavism br Historian John Leddy Phelan located the popularity of the term Latin America to be from the French occupation of Mexico His argument is that French imperialists used the concept of Latin America as a way to counter British imperialism as well as to challenge the German threat to France The idea of a Latin race was then taken up by Latin American intellectuals and political leaders of the mid and late nineteenth century who no longer looked to Spain or Portugal as cultural models but rather to France Napoleon III had a strong interest in extending French commercial and political power in the region He and his business promoter Felix Belly called it Latin America to emphasize the shared Latin background of France with the former viceroyalties of Spain and colonies of Portugal This led to Napoleon III s failed attempt to take military control of Mexico in the s br Scholarship has political origins of the term Two Latin American historians Uruguayan Arturo Ardao and Chilean Miguel Rojas Mix found evidence that the term Latin America was used earlier than Phelan claimed and the first use of the term was in fact in opposition to imperialist projects in the Americas Ardao wrote about this subject in his book G nesis de la idea y el nombre de Am rica latina Genesis of the Idea and the Name of Latin America and Miguel Rojas Mix in his article Bilbao y el hallazgo de Am rica latina Uni n continental socialista y libertaria Bilbao and the Finding of Latin America a Continental Socialist and Libertarian Union As Michel Gobat points out in his article The Invention of Latin America A Transnational History of Anti Imperialism Democracy and Race Arturo Ardao Miguel Rojas Mix and Aims McGuinness have revealed that the term Latin America had already been used in by Central Americans and South Americans protesting US expansion into the Southern Hemisphere Edward Shawcross summarizes Ardao s and Rojas Mix s findings in the following way Ardao identified the term in a poem by a Colombian diplomat and intellectual resident in France Jos Mar a Torres Caicedo published on February in a French based Spanish language newspaper while Rojas Mix located it in a speech delivered in France by the radical liberal Chilean politician Francisco Bilbao in June br By the late s the term was being used in California which had become a part of the United States in local newspapers such as El Clamor P blico by Californios writing about Am rica latina and latinoam rica and identifying as Latinos as the abbreviated term for their hemispheric membership in la raza latina br The words Latin and America were first found to be combined in a printed work to produce the term Latin America in at a conference by the Chilean politician Francisco Bilbao in Paris The conference had the title Initiative of the America The idea for a Federal Congress of Republics The following year Colombian writer Jos Mar a Torres Caicedo also used the term in his poem The Two Americas Two events related with the United States played a central role in both works The first event happened less than a decade before the publication of Bilbao s and Torres Caicedo s works the Invasion of Mexico or in the US the Mexican American War after which the United States annexed more than half of Mexico s territory The second event the Walker affair which happened the same year that both works were written the decision by US president Franklin Pierce to recognize the regime recently established in Nicaragua by American William Walker and his band of filibusters who ruled Nicaragua for nearly a year and attempted to reinstate slavery there where it had been already abolished for three decades br In both Bilbao s and Torres Caicedo s works the Mexican American War and William Walker s expedition to Nicaragua are explicitly mentioned as examples of dangers for the region For Bilbao Latin America was not a geographical concept as he excluded Brazil Paraguay and Mexico Both authors also asked for the union of all Latin American countries as the only way to defend their territories against further foreign US interventions Both also rejected European imperialism claiming that the return of European countries to non democratic forms of government was another danger for Latin American countries and used the same word to describe the state of European politics at the time despotism Several years later during the French invasion of Mexico Bilbao wrote another work Emancipation of the Spirit in America where he asked all Latin American countries to support the Mexican cause against France and rejected French imperialism in Asia Africa Europe and the Americas He asked Latin American intellectuals to search for their intellectual emancipation by abandoning all French ideas claiming that France was Hypocrite because she France calls herself protector of the Latin race just to subject it to her exploitation regime treacherous because she speaks of freedom and nationality when unable to conquer freedom for herself she enslaves others instead Therefore as Michel Gobat puts it the term Latin America itself had an anti imperial genesis and their creators were far from supporting any form of imperialism in the region or in any other place of the globe br In France the term Latin America was used with the opposite intention It was employed by the French Empire of Napoleon III during the French invasion of Mexico as a way to include France among countries with influence in the Americas and to exclude Anglophone countries It played a role in his campaign to imply cultural kinship of the region with France transform France into a cultural and political leader of the area and install Maximilian of Habsburg as emperor of the Second Mexican Empire The term was also used in by French scholars in La revue des races Latines a magazine dedicated to the Pan Latinism movement br br br Contemporary definitions br br Latin America is often used synonymously with Ibero America Iberian America where the populations speak Spanish or Portuguese and the dominant religion is Roman Catholic Puerto Rico the Spanish speaking Caribbean territory of the United States acquired from the Spanish Empire following its defeat in the Spanish American War is usually included This definition excludes the predominantly Protestant English speaking and Dutch speaking regions as well as French speaking predominantly Catholic regions Belize Guyana and Suriname as well as several French overseas departments are excluded from the definition br In another definition Latin America designates the set of countries in the Americas where a Romance language a language derived from Latin predominates Spanish Portuguese or French Thus it includes Mexico most of Central and South America and in the Caribbean Cuba the Dominican Republic and Haiti Latin America then comprises all of the countries in the Americas that were once part of the Spanish Portuguese and French Empires Puerto Rico although not a sovereign nation is often included br The term is sometimes used more broadly to refer to all of the Americas south of the United States thus including the Guianas French Guiana Guyana and Suriname the Anglophone Caribbean and Belize the Francophone Caribbean and the Dutch Caribbean This definition emphasizes a similar socioeconomic history of the region which was characterized by formal or informal colonialism rather than cultural aspects see for example dependency theory Some sources avoid this simplification by using the alternative phrase Latin America and the Caribbean as in the United Nations geoscheme for the Americas A number of academic area studies programs and centers of Latin American studies are titled Latin American and Caribbean studies such as the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies University of Michigan Archived February at the Wayback Machine New York University Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies CLACS Archived October at the Wayback Machine and University of Washington s Latin American and Caribbean Studies The Henry M Jackson School of International Studies Archived February at the Wayback Machine Although the U S acquired a large swath of territory from the Spanish Empire and called Spanish borderlands and nearly of the U S population identifies as Hispanic or Latino the U S is generally not classified as being part of Latin America However the significant demographic is sometimes brought under the umbrella of Latin American studies such as at University of Albany br The distinction between Latin America and Anglo America is a convention based on the predominant languages in the Americas by which Romance language and English speaking cultures are distinguished Neither area is culturally or linguistically homogeneous in substantial portions of Latin America e g highland Peru Bolivia Mexico Guatemala Native American cultures and to a lesser extent Amerindian languages are predominant and in other areas the influence of African cultures is strong e g the Caribbean basin including parts of Colombia and Venezuela br The term s meaning is contested and not without controversy Historian Mauricio Tenorio Trillo explores at length the allure and power of the idea of Latin America He remarks at the outset The idea of Latin America ought to have vanished with the obsolescence of racial theory But it is not easy to declare something dead when it can hardly be said to have existed going on to say The term is here to stay and it is important Following in the tradition of Chilean writer Francisco Bilbao who excluded Brazil Argentina and Paraguay from his early conceptualization of Latin America Chilean historian Jaime Eyzaguirre has criticized the term Latin America for disguising and diluting the Spanish character of a region i e Hispanic America with the inclusion of nations that according to him do not share the same pattern of conquest and colonization br The Francophone part of North America which includes Quebec Acadia and Louisiana is generally excluded from the definition of Latin America br br br Subregions and countries br Latin America can be subdivided into several subregions based on geography politics democracy demographics and culture The basic geographical subregions are North America Central America the Caribbean and South America the latter contains further politico geographical subdivisions such as the Southern Cone the Guianas and the Andean states It may be subdivided on linguistic grounds into Spanish America Portuguese America and French America br The term Latin America is defined to mean parts of Americas south of USA mainland where a Romance language a language derived from Latin predominates that is a language of Spanish Portuguese or French As is customary Puerto Rico is included and Dominica Grenada and Saint Lucia where French is spoken but not official language are excluded from Latin America br br Not a sovereign state br br br History br br Before the arrival of Europeans in the late th and early th centuries the region was home to many indigenous peoples including advanced civilizations most notably from South the Olmec Maya Muisca Aztecs and Inca The region came under control of the kingdoms of Spain and Portugal which established colonies and imposed Roman Catholicism and their languages Both brought African slaves to their colonies as laborers exploiting large settled societies and their resources The Spanish Crown regulated immigration allowing only Christians to travel to the New World The colonization process led to significant native population declines due to disease forced labor and violence They imposed their culture destroying native codices and artwork Colonial era religion played a crucial role in everyday life with the Spanish Crown ensuring religious purity and aggressively prosecuting perceived deviations like witchcraft br In the early nineteenth century nearly all of areas of Spanish America attained independence by armed struggle with the exceptions of Cuba and Puerto Rico Brazil which had become a monarchy separate from Portugal became a republic in the late nineteenth century Political independence from European monarchies did not result in the abolition of black slavery in the new nations it resulted in political and economic instability in Spanish America immediately after independence Great Britain and the United States exercised significant influence in the post independence era resulting in a form of neo colonialism where political sovereignty remained in place but foreign powers exercised considerable power in the economic sphere Newly independent nations faced domestic and interstate conflicts struggling with economic instability and social inequality br The th century brought U S intervention and the Cold War s impact on the region with revolutions in countries like Cuba influencing Latin American politics The late th and early st centuries saw shifts towards left wing governments followed by conservative resurgences and a recent resurgence of left wing politics in several countries br br br After br br In many countries in the early s left wing political parties rose to power known as the Pink tide The presidencies of Hugo Ch vez in Venezuela Ricardo Lagos and Michelle Bachelet in Chile Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff of the Workers Party PT in Brazil N stor Kirchner and his wife Cristina Fern ndez in Argentina Tabar V zquez and Jos Mujica in Uruguay Evo Morales in Bolivia Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua Rafael Correa in Ecuador Fernando Lugo in Paraguay Manuel Zelaya in Honduras removed from power by a coup d tat Mauricio Funes and Salvador S nchez Cer n in El Salvador are all part of this wave of left wing politicians who often declare themselves socialists Latin Americanists or anti imperialists often implying opposition to US policies towards the region An aspect of this has been the creation of the eight member ALBA alliance or The Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America Spanish Alianza Bolivariana para los Pueblos de Nuestra Am rica by some of these countries br br Following the pink tide there was a Conservative wave across Latin America In Mexico the rightwing National Action Party PAN won the presidential election of with its candidate Vicente Fox ending the year rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party He was succeed six years later by another conservative Felipe Calder n who attempted to crack down on the Mexican drug cartels and instigated the Mexican drug war Several right wing leaders rose to power including Argentina s Mauricio Macri and Brazil s Michel Temer following the impeachment of the country s first female president In Chile the conservative Sebasti n Pi era succeeded the socialist Michelle Bachelet in In center right Luis Lacalle Pou ended a year leftist rule in Uruguay after defeating the Broad Front candidate br Economically the s commodities boom caused positive effects for many Latin American economies Another trend was the rapidly increasing importance of their relations with China br However with the Great Recession beginning in there was an end to the commodity boom resulting in economic stagnation or recession resulted in some countries A number of left wing governments of the Pink tide lost support The worst hit was Venezuela which is facing severe social and economic upheaval br Charges of against a major Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht has raised allegations of corruption across the region s governments see Operation Car Wash This bribery ring has become the largest corruption scandal in Latin American history As of July the highest ranking politicians charged were former Brazilian President Luiz In cio Lula da Silva who was arrested and former Peruvian presidents Ollanta Humala and Alejandro Toledo who fled to the United States and was extradited back to Peru br The COVID pandemic proved a political challenge for many unstable Latin American democracies with scholars identifying a decline in civil liberties as a result of opportunistic emergency powers This was especially true for countries with strong presidential regimes such as Brazil br br br Inequality br br Wealth inequality in Latin America and the Caribbean remains a serious issue despite strong economic growth and improved social indicators A report released in by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs entitled Inequality Matters Report of the World Social Situation observed that Declines in the wage share have been attributed to the impact of labour saving technological change and to a general weakening of labour market regulations and institutions Such declines are likely to disproportionately affect individuals in the middle and bottom of the income distribution as they rely mostly on wages for income In addition the report noted that highly unequal land distribution has created social and political tensions and is a source of economic inefficiency as small landholders frequently lack access to credit and other resources to increase productivity while big owners may not have had enough incentive to do so br According to the United Nations ECLAC Latin America is the most unequal region in the world Inequality in Latin America has deep historical roots in the Latin European racially based Casta system instituted in Latin America during colonial times that has been difficult to eradicate because of the differences between initial endowments and opportunities among social groups have constrained the poorest s social mobility thus causing poverty to transmit from generation to generation and become a vicious cycle Inequality has been reproduced and transmitted through generations because Latin American political systems allow a differentiated access on the influence that social groups have in the decision making process and it responds in different ways to the least favored groups that have less political representation and capacity of pressure Recent economic liberalisation also plays a role as not everyone is equally capable of taking advantage of its benefits Differences in opportunities and endowments tend to be based on race ethnicity rurality and gender Because inequality in gender and location are near universal race and ethnicity play a larger more integral role in discriminatory practices in Latin America The differences have a strong impact on the distribution of income capital and political standing br One indicator of inequality is access to and quality of education During the first phase of globalization in Latin America educational inequality was on the rise peaking around the end of the th century In comparison with other developing regions Latin America then had the highest level of educational inequality which is certainly a contributing factor for its current general high inequality During the th century however educational inequality started decreasing br br br Standard of living br Latin America has the highest levels of income inequality in the world

and modernization in country s north has seen the growth of Monterrey in Nuevo Le n The following is a list of the ten largest metropolitan areas in Latin America Entries in bold indicate they are ranked the highest br br br Race and ethnicity br br Latin American populations are diverse with descendants of the Indigenous peoples Europeans Africans initially brought as slaves and Asians as well as new immigrants Mixing of groups was a fact of life at contact of the Old World and the New but colonial regimes established legal and social discrimination against non white populations simply on the basis of perceived ethnicity and skin color Social class was usually linked to a person s racial category with European born Spaniards and Portuguese on top During the colonial era with a dearth initially of European women European men and Indigenous women and African women produced what were considered mixed race children In Spanish America the so called Sociedad de castas or Sistema de castas was constructed by white elites to try to rationalize the processes at work In the sixteenth century the Spanish crown sought to protect Indigenous populations from exploitation by white elites for their labor and land The crown created the Rep blica de indios to paternalistically govern and protect Indigenous peoples It also created the Rep blica de Espa oles which included not only European whites but all non Indigenous peoples such as blacks mulattoes and mixed race castas who were not dwelling in Indigenous communities In the religious sphere the Indigenous were deemed perpetual neophytes in the Catholic faith which meant Indigenous men were not eligible to be ordained as Catholic priests however Indigenous were also excluded from the jurisdiction of the Inquisition Catholics saw military conquest and religious conquest as two parts of the assimilation of Indigenous populations suppressing Indigenous religious practices and eliminating the Indigenous priesthood Some worship continued underground Jews and other non Catholics such as Protestants all called Lutherans were banned from settling and were subject to the Inquisition Considerable mixing of populations occurred in cities while the countryside was largely Indigenous At independence in the early nineteenth century in many places in Spanish America formal racial and legal distinctions disappeared although slavery was not uniformly abolished br Significant black populations exist in Brazil and Spanish Caribbean islands such as Cuba and Puerto Rico and the circum Caribbean mainland Venezuela Colombia Panama as long as in the southern part of South America and Central America Honduras Costa Rica Nicaragua Ecuador and Peru a legacy of their use in plantations All these areas had small white populations In Brazil coastal Indigenous peoples largely died out in the early sixteenth century with Indigenous populations surviving far from cities sugar plantations and other European enterprises br Dominican Republic Puerto Rico Cuba and Brazil have dominate Mulatto Triracial populations Pardo in Brazil in Brazil and Cuba there is equally large white populations and smaller black populations while Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico are more Mulatto Triracial dominated with significant black and white minorities Parts of Central America and northern South America are more diverse in that they are dominated by Mestizos and whites but also have large numbers of Mulattos blacks and indigenous especially Colombia Venezuela and Panama The southern cone region Argentina Uruguay and Chile are dominated by whites and mestizos Haiti and other areas in the French Caribbean are dominated mostly by blacks The rest of Latin America including M xico northern Central America Guatemala El Salvador Honduras and central South America Peru Ecuador Bolivia Paraguay are dominated by mestizos but also have large white and indigenous minorities br In the nineteenth century a number of Latin American countries sought immigrants from Europe and Asia With the abolition of black slavery in the Brazilian monarchy fell in By then another source of cheap labor to work on coffee plantations was found in Japan Chinese male immigrants arrived in Cuba Mexico Peru and elsewhere With political turmoil in Europe during the mid nineteenth century and widespread poverty Germans Spaniards and Italians immigrated to Latin America in large numbers welcomed by Latin American governments both as a source of labor as well as a way to increase the size of their white populations In Argentina many Afro Argentines married Europeans br In twentieth century Brazil sociologist Gilberto Freyre proposed that Brazil was a racial democracy with less discrimination against blacks than in the U S Even if a system of legal racial segregation was never implemented in Latin America unlike the United States subsequent research has shown that in Brazil there s discrimination against darker citizens and that whites remain the elites in the country In Mexico the mestizo population was considered the true embodiment of the cosmic race according to Mexican intellectual Jos Vasconcelos thus erasing other populations There was considerable discrimination against Asians with calls for the expulsion of Chinese in northern Mexico during the Mexican Revolution and racially motivated massacres br In a number of Latin American countries Indigenous groups have organized explicitly as Indigenous to claim human rights and influence political power With the passage of anti colonial resolutions in the United Nations General Assembly and the signing of resolutions for Indigenous rights the Indigenous are able to act to guarantee their existence within nation states with legal standing br br br Language br br Spanish is the predominant language of Latin America It is spoken as first language by about of the population Portuguese is spoken by about and about speak other languages such as Quechua Mayan languages Guaran Aymara Nahuatl English French Dutch and Italian Portuguese is spoken mostly in Brazil the largest and most populous country in the region Spanish is the official language of most of the other countries and territories on the Latin American mainland as well as in Cuba Puerto Rico where it is co official with English and the Dominican Republic French is spoken in Haiti and in the French overseas departments of Guadeloupe Martinique and Guiana It is also spoken by some Panamanians of Afro Antillean descent Dutch is the official language in Suriname Aruba Cura ao and Bonaire As Dutch is a Germanic language the territories are not necessarily considered part of Latin America However the native language of Aruba Bonaire and Cura ao is Papiamento a creole language largely based on Portuguese and Spanish that has had a considerable influence from Dutch and the Portuguese based creole languages br br Amerindian languages are widely spoken in Peru Guatemala Bolivia Paraguay and Mexico and to a lesser degree in Panama Ecuador Brazil Colombia Venezuela Argentina and Chile In other Latin American countries the population of speakers of Indigenous languages tend to be very small or even non existent for example in Uruguay Mexico is possibly contains more Indigenous languages than any other Latin American country but the most spoken Indigenous language there is Nahuatl br In Peru Quechua is an official language alongside Spanish and other Indigenous languages in the areas where they predominate In Ecuador while Quichua holds no official status it is a recognized language under the country s constitution however it is only spoken by a few groups in the country s highlands In Bolivia Aymara Quechua and Guaran hold official status alongside Spanish Guaran like Spanish is an official language of Paraguay and is spoken by a majority of the population which is for the most part bilingual and it is co official with Spanish in the Argentine province of Corrientes In Nicaragua Spanish is the official language but on the country s Caribbean coast English and Indigenous languages such as Miskito Sumo and Rama also hold official status Colombia recognizes all Indigenous languages spoken within its territory as official though fewer than of its population are native speakers of these languages Nahuatl is one of the Native languages spoken by Indigenous people in Mexico which are officially recognized by the government as national languages along with Spanish br Other European languages spoken in Latin America include English by half of the current population in Puerto Rico as well as in nearby countries that may or may not be considered Latin American like Belize and Guyana and spoken by descendants of British settlers in Argentina and Chile German is spoken in southern Brazil southern Chile portions of Argentina Venezuela and Paraguay Italian in Brazil Argentina Venezuela and Uruguay Ukrainian Polish and Russian in southern Brazil and Argentina and Welsh in southern Argentina Non European or Asian languages include Japanese in Brazil Peru Bolivia and Paraguay Korean in Brazil Argentina Paraguay and Chile Arabic in Argentina Brazil Colombia Venezuela and Chile and Chinese throughout South America Countries like Venezuela Argentina and Brazil have their own dialects or variations of German and Italian br In several nations especially in the Caribbean region creole languages are spoken The most widely spoken creole language in Latin America and the Caribbean is Haitian Creole the predominant language of Haiti derived primarily from French and certain West African tongues with Amerindian English Portuguese and Spanish influences as well Creole languages of mainland Latin America similarly are derived from European languages and various African tongues br The Garifuna language is spoken along the Caribbean coast in Honduras Guatemala Nicaragua and Belize mostly by the Garifuna people a mixed race Zambo people who were the result of mixing between Indigenous Caribbeans and escaped Black slaves Primarily an Arawakan language it has influences from Caribbean and European languages br Archaeologists have deciphered over pre Columbian distinct writing systems from Mesoamerican societies Ancient Maya had the most sophisticated textually written language but since texts were largely confined to the religious and administrative elite traditions were passed down orally Oral traditions also prevailed in other major Indigenous groups including but not limited to the Aztecs and other Nahuatl speakers Quechua and Aymara of the Andean regions the Quich of Central America the Tupi Guaran in today s Brazil the Guaran in Paraguay and the Mapuche in Chile br br br Religion br br The vast majority of Latin Americans are Christians mostly Roman Catholics belonging to the Latin Church About of the Latin American population considers itself Catholic In Latin America constitutes in absolute terms the second world s largest Christian population after Europe br According to the detailed Pew multi country survey in of the Latin American population is Catholic and is Protestant Protestants are in Brazil and over in much of Central America More than half of these are converts from Roman Catholicism br br br Migration br br The entire hemisphere was settled by migrants from Asia Europe and Africa Native American populations settled throughout the hemisphere before the arrival of Europeans in the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and the forced migration of slaves from Africa br In the post independence period a number of Latin American countries sought to attract European immigrants as a source of labor as well as to deliberately change the proportions of racial and ethnic groups within their borders Chile Argentina and Brazil actively recruited labor from Catholic southern Europe where populations were poor and sought better economic opportunities Many nineteenth century immigrants went to the United States and Canada but a significant number arrived in Latin America Although Mexico tried to attract immigrants it largely failed As black slavery was abolished in Brazil in coffee growers recruited Japanese migrants to work in coffee plantations There is a significant population of Japanese descent in Brazil Cuba and Peru recruited Chinese labor in the late nineteenth century Some Chinese immigrants who were excluded from immigrating to the U S settled in northern Mexico When the U S acquired its southwest by conquest in the Mexican American War Latin American populations did not cross the border to the U S the border crossed them br In the twentieth century there have been several types of migration One is the movement of rural populations within a given country to cities in search of work causing many Latin American cities to grow significantly Another is international movement of populations often fleeing repression or war Other international migration is for economic reasons often unregulated or undocumented Mexicans immigrated to the U S during the violence of the Mexican Revolution and the religious Cristero War during World War II Mexican men worked in the U S in the bracero program Economic migration from Mexico followed the crash of the Mexican economy in the s br Spanish refugees fled to Mexico following the fascist victory in the Spanish Civil War with some exiles finding refuge at the invitation of President L zaro C rdenas Following World War II a larger wave of refugees to Latin America many of them Jews settled in Argentina Brazil Chile Cuba and Venezuela Some were only transiting through the region but others stayed and created communities A number of Nazis escaped to Latin America living under assumed names in an attempting to avoid attention and prosecution br In the aftermath of the Cuban Revolution middle class and elite Cubans moved to the U S particularly to Florida Some fled Chile for the U S and Europe after the military coup Colombians migrated to Spain and the United Kingdom during the region s political turmoil compounded by the rise of narcotrafficking and guerrilla warfare During the Central American wars of the s to the s many Salvadorans Guatemalans and Hondurans migrated to the U S to escape narcotrafficking gangs and poverty As living conditions deteriorated in Venezuela under Hugo Ch vez and Nicol s Maduro many left for neighboring Colombia and Ecuador In the s economic stress in Ecuador during the La D cada Perdida triggered considerable migration to Spain and to the U S br Some Latin American countries seek to strengthen links between migrants and their states of origin while promoting their integration in the receiving state These emigrant policies focus on the rights obligations and opportunities for participation of emigrated citizens who already live outside the borders of the country of origin Research on Latin America shows that the extension of policies towards migrants is linked to a focus on civil rights and state benefits that can positively influence integration in recipient countries In addition the tolerance of dual citizenship has spread more in Latin America than in any other region of the world br br br Education br br Despite significant progress education access and school completion remains unequal in Latin America The region has made great progress in educational coverage almost all children attend primary school and access to secondary education has increased considerably Quality issues such as poor teaching methods lack of appropriate equipment and overcrowding exist throughout the region These issues lead to adolescents dropping out of the educational system early Most educational systems in the region have implemented various types of administrative and institutional reforms that have enabled reach for places and communities that had no access to education services in the early s School meal programs are also employed to expand access to education and at least countries in the Latin America and Caribbean region have large scale school feeding activities altogether reaching of primary school age children in the region Compared to prior generations Latin American youth have seen an increase in their levels of education On average they have completed two more years of school than their parents br However there are still million children in the region between the ages of and outside of the formal education system Estimates indicate that of preschool age children ages do not attend school and for the most vulnerable populations the poor and rural this proportion exceeds percent Among primary school age children ages to attendance is almost universal however there is still a need to enroll five million more children in the primary education system These children mostly live in remote areas are Indigenous or Afro descendants and live in extreme poverty br Among people between the ages of and years only are full time students and only of these advance to secondary school These percentages are lower among vulnerable population groups only of the poorest youth between the ages of and years attend school Tertiary education has the lowest coverage with only of people between the ages of and years outside of the education system Currently more than half of low income or rural children fail to complete nine years of education br br br Crime and violence br br Latin America and the Caribbean have been cited by numerous sources to be the most dangerous regions in the world Studies have shown that Latin America contains the majority of the world s most dangerous cities Many analysts attribute this to social and income inequality in the region Many agree that the prison crisis will not be resolved until the gap between the rich and the poor is addressed br Crime and violence prevention and public security are now important issues for governments and citizens in Latin America and the Caribbean region Homicide rates in Latin America are the highest in the world From the early s through the mid s homicide rates increased by percent Latin America and the Caribbean experienced more than million murders between and There were a total of murders in Brazil in br The most frequent victims of such homicides are young men percent of them between the ages of and Countries with the highest homicide rate per year per inhabitants in were El Salvador Honduras Venezuela Jamaica Belize St Kitts and Nevis Guatemala Trinidad and Tobago the Bahamas Brazil Colombia the Dominican Republic St Lucia Guyana Mexico Puerto Rico Ecuador Grenada Costa Rica Bolivia Nicaragua Panama Antigua and Barbuda and Haiti Most of the countries with the highest homicide rates are in Africa and Latin America Countries in Central America like El Salvador and Honduras top the list of homicides in the world br Brazil has more overall homicides than any country in the world at

br br Indigenous cultures of the people who inhabited the continent prior to European colonization Ancient and advanced civilizations developed their own political social and religious systems The Maya the Aztec and the Inca are examples of these Indigenous legacies in music dance foods arts and crafts clothing folk culture and traditions are strong in Latin America Indigenous languages affected Spanish and Portuguese giving rise to loanwords like pampa taco tamale cacique br The culture of Europe was brought mainly by the colonial powers the Spanish Portuguese and French between the th and th centuries The most enduring European colonial influences are language institutions customs and Catholicism br Additional cultural influences came from the Europe during the th th and th centuries due to growing immigration from Germany Italy France Spain and Portugal as well as artistic ideological and technological developments of the time Due to the impact of Enlightenment ideals after the French revolution a certain number of Iberian American countries decriminalized homosexuality after France and French territories in the Americas did so in Some of the countries that abolished sodomy laws or banned state interference in consensual adult sexuality in the th century were Dominican Republic Brazil Peru Mexico Paraguay Argentina Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador Today same sex marriage is legal in Argentina Brazil Chile Colombia Costa Rica Ecuador Mexico Uruguay and French overseas departments South America experienced waves of immigration of Europeans especially Italians Spaniards Portuguese Germans Austrians Poles Ukrainians French Dutch Russians Croatians Lithuanians and Ashkenazi Jews With the end of colonialism French culture also exerted a direct influence in Latin America especially in the realms of high culture Independentism science and medicine This can be seen in the region s artistic traditions including painting literature and music and in the realms of science and politics br African cultures whose presence stems from a long history of the Atlantic slave trade People of African descent have influenced the ethno scapes of Latin America and the Caribbean This is manifested for instance in music dance and religion especially in countries like Brazil Puerto Rico Venezuela Colombia Panama Haiti Honduras Nicaragua Costa Rica Dominican Republic and Cuba br Asian cultures whose part of the presence derives from the long history of the coolies who mostly arrived during the th and th centuries most commonly Chinese workers in Peru and Venezuela but also from Japanese and Korean immigration especially headed to Brazil This has greatly affected cuisine and other traditions including literature art and lifestyles and politics Asian influences have especially affected Brazil Cuba Panama and Peru br The influence of the United States and globalization is present throughout the region with particular strength in northern Latin America especially Puerto Rico which is an American territory Prior to Cuba which fought for its independence with American aid in the Spanish American War also had a close political and economic relationship with the United States The United States also helped Panama become independent from Colombia and built the twenty mile long Panama Canal Zone in Panama which it held from the Panama Canal opened to transoceanic freight traffic in to when the Torrijos Carter Treaties restored Panamanian control of the Canal Zone br br br Art br br Beyond the tradition of Indigenous art the development of Latin American visual art owed much to the influence of Spanish Portuguese and French Baroque painting which in turn often followed the trends of the Italians In general artistic Eurocentrism began to wane in the early twentieth century with the increased appreciation for indigenous forms of representation br br From the early twentieth century the art of Latin America was greatly inspired by the Constructivist Movement The movement rapidly spread from Russia to Europe and then into Latin America Joaqu n Torres Garc a and Manuel Rend n have been credited with bringing the Constructivist Movement into Latin America from Europe br An important artistic movement generated in Latin America is muralism represented by Diego Rivera David Alfaro Siqueiros Jos Clemente

the most important artists of the th century in South America he is a precursor of Arte Povera and Happening In the s kinetic art emerged in Venezuela Its main representatives are Jes s Soto Carlos Cruz Diez Alejandro Otero and Gego br Colombian sculptor and painter Fernando Botero has gained regional and international recognition for his works which on first examination are noted for their exaggerated proportions and the corpulence of the human and animal figures br The Ecuadorian Oswaldo Guayasam n considered one of the most important and seminal artists in Ecuador and South America In his life he made over paintings and held more than exhibitions all over the world including Paris Barcelona New York Buenos Aires Moscow Prague and Rome He brought his unique style of expressionism and cubism to the collection of Ecuador artwork during the Age of Anger which relates to the period of the Cold War when the United States opposed communist presence in South America Social criticism of human and social inequality was central to his artwork br br br Film br br Latin American film is both rich and diverse Historically the main centers of production have been Mexico Argentina Brazil and Cuba Latin American film flourished after sound was introduced in cinema which added a linguistic barrier to the export of Hollywood film south of the border br br Mexican cinema began in the silent era from to and flourished in the Golden Era of the s It boasted a huge industry comparable to Hollywood at the time with stars such as Mar a F lix Dolores del R o and Pedro Infante In the s Mexico was the location for many cult horror and action movies More recently films such as Amores Perros and Y tu mam tambi n enjoyed box office and critical acclaim and propelled Alfonso Cuar n and

since the first half of the th century and today averages over full length titles yearly The industry suffered during the military dictatorship but re emerged to produce the Academy Award winner The Official Story in A wave of imported US films again damaged the industry in the early s though it soon recovered thriving even during the Argentine economic crisis around Many Argentine movies produced during recent years have been internationally acclaimed including Nueve reinas Son of the Bride El abrazo partido El otro the Foreign Language Academy Award winner El secreto de sus ojos Wild Tales and Argentina br In Brazil the Cinema Novo movement created a particular way of making movies with critical and intellectual screenplays clearer photography related to the light of the outdoors

Latin America is said that whilst Venezuelan cinema began sporadically in the s it only emerged as a national cultural movement in the mid s when it gained state support and auteurs could produce work International co productions with Latin America and Spain continued into this era and beyond and Venezuelan films of this time were counted among the works of New Latin American Cinema This period is known as Venezuela s Golden Age of cinema having massive popularity even though it was a time of much social and political upheaval br One of the most famous Venezuelan films even to date is the film Soy un delincuente by Clemente de la Cerda which won the Special Jury Prize at the Locarno International Film Festival Soy un delincuente was one of nine films for which the state gave substantial funding to produce made in the year after the Venezuelan state began giving financial support to cinema in The support likely came from increased oil wealth in the early s and the subsequent credit incentive policy At the time of its production the film was the most popular film in the country and took a decade to be usurped from this position even though it was only one in a string of films designed to tell social realist stories of struggle in the s and s Equally famous is the film El Pez que Fuma Rom n Chalbaud In FONCINE the Venezuelan Film Fund was founded and this year it provided even more funding to produce seventeen feature films A few years later in with Viernes Negro oil prices dropped and Venezuela entered a depression which prevented such extravagant funding but film production continued more transnational productions occurred many more with Spain due to Latin America s poor economic fortune in general and there was some in new cinema as well Fina Torres Oriana won the Cam ra d Or Prize at the Cannes Film Festival as the best first feature Film production peaked in with considered Venezuelan cinema s most successful year by the state thanks to over million admissions to national films according to Venezuelanalysis The Venezuelan capital of Caracas hosted the Ibero American Forum on Cinematography Integration in from which the pan continental IBERMEDIA was formed a union which provides regional funding br br br Literature br br Pre Columbian cultures were primarily oral although the Aztecs and Maya for instance produced elaborate codices Oral accounts of mythological and religious beliefs were also sometimes recorded after the arrival of European colonizers as was the case with the Popol Vuh Moreover a tradition of oral narrative survives to this day for instance among the Quechua speaking population of Peru and the Quich K iche of Guatemala br From the very moment of Europe s discovery of the continents early explorers and conquistadores produced written accounts and cr nicas of their experience such as Columbus s letters or Bernal D az del Castillo s description of the conquest of Mexico During the colonial period written culture was often in the hands of the church within which context Sor Juana In s de la Cruz wrote memorable poetry and philosophical essays Towards the end of the th century and the beginning of the th a distinctive criollo literary tradition emerged including the first novels such as Lizardi s El Periquillo Sarniento br The th century was a period of foundational fictions in critic Doris Sommer s words novels in the Romantic or Naturalist traditions that attempted to establish a sense of national identity and which often focussed on the Indigenous question or the dichotomy of civilization or barbarism for which see say Domingo Sarmiento s Facundo Juan Le n Mera s Cumand or Euclides da Cunha s Os Sert es The th century also witnessed the realist work of Machado de Assis who made use of surreal devices of metaphor and playful narrative construction much admired by critic Harold Bloom br At the turn of the th century modernismo emerged a poetic movement whose founding text was Nicaraguan poet Rub n Dar o s Azul This was the first Latin American literary movement to influence literary culture outside of the region and was also the first truly Latin American literature in that national differences were no longer so much at issue Jos Mart for instance though a Cuban patriot also lived in Mexico and the United States and wrote for journals in Argentina and elsewhere br However what really put Latin American literature on the global map was no doubt the literary boom of the s and s distinguished by daring and experimental novels such as Julio Cort zar s Rayuela that were frequently published in Spain and quickly translated into English The Boom s defining novel was Gabriel Garc a M rquez s Cien a os de soledad which led to the association of Latin American literature with magic realism though other important writers of the period such as the Peruvian Mario Vargas Llosa and Carlos Fuentes do not fit so easily within this framework Arguably the Boom s culmination was Augusto Roa Bastos s monumental Yo el supremo In the wake of the Boom influential precursors such as Juan Rulfo Alejo Carpentier and above all Jorge Luis Borges were also rediscovered br Contemporary literature in the region is vibrant and varied ranging from the best selling Paulo Coelho and Isabel Allende to the more avant garde and critically acclaimed work of writers such as Diamela Eltit Giannina Braschi Ricardo Piglia or Roberto Bola o There has also been considerable attention paid to the genre of testimonio texts produced in collaboration with subaltern subjects such as Rigoberta Mench Finally a new breed of chroniclers is represented by the more journalistic Carlos Monsiv is and Pedro Lemebel br The region boasts six Nobel Prize winners in addition to the two Chilean poets Gabriela Mistral and Pablo Neruda there is also the Guatemalan novelist Miguel ngel Asturias the Colombian writer Gabriel Garc a M rquez the Mexican poet and essayist Octavio Paz and the
