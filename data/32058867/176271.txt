was not provided as a component of Microsoft Office for Mac but instead made available to users from administrators or by download The final version was Outlook for Mac which was fairly similar to Outlook and apart from being exclusively for Exchange users br Microsoft Entourage was introduced as an Outlook like application for Mac OS in Office but it lacked Exchange connectivity Partial support for Exchange server became available natively in Mac OS X with Entourage Service Pack Entourage is not directly equivalent to Outlook in terms of design or operation rather it is a distinct application that has several overlapping features including Exchange client capabilities Somewhat improved Exchange support was added in Entourage Web Services Edition br br Entourage was replaced by Outlook for Mac which features greater compatibility and parity with Outlook for Windows than Entourage offered It is the first native version of Outlook for MacOS br Outlook initially supported Mac OS X s Sync Services only for contacts not events tasks or notes It also does not have a Project Manager equivalent to that in Entourage With Service Pack v published on April Outlook can now sync

in the fall of with a public Insider debut in October It requires macOS or greater and introduces a redesigned interface with significantly changed internals including native search within the client that no longer depends on macOS Spotlight Some Outlook features are still missing from the New Outlook client as it continues in development br To date the Macintosh client has never had the capability of syncing Contact Groups Personal Distribution Lists from Exchange Microsoft or Outlook com accounts something that the Windows and web clients have always supported A UserVoice post created in December suggesting that the missing functionality be added has shown a Planned tag since October br In March Microsoft announced that Outlook for Mac will be available for free This means that users no longer need a Microsoft subscription or an Office licence to use the program br br br Phones and tablets br First released in April by the venture capital backed startup Acompli the company was acquired by Microsoft in December On January Acompli was re branded as Outlook Mobile sharing its name with the Microsoft Outlook desktop personal information manager and Outlook com email service In January Microsoft released Outlook for phones and for tablets v build with Office br This was the first Outlook for these platforms with email calendar and contacts br On February Microsoft acquired Sunrise Calendar on September Sunrise ceased to operate and an update was released to Outlook Mobile that contained enhancements to its calendar functions br Similar to its desktop counterpart Outlook mobile offers an aggregation of attachments and files stored on cloud storage platforms a focused inbox highlights messages from frequent contacts and calendar events files and locations can be embedded in messages without switching apps The app supports a number of email platforms and services including Outlook com Microsoft Exchange and Google Workspace formerly G Suite among others br Outlook mobile is designed to consolidate functionality that would normally be found in separate apps on mobile devices similar to personal information managers on personal computers It is designed around four hubs for different tasks including Mail Calendar Files and People The People hub lists frequently and recently used contacts and aggregates recent communications with them and the Files hub aggregates recent attachments from messages and can also integrate with other online storage services such as Dropbox Google Drive and OneDrive To facilitate indexing of content for search and other features emails and other information are stored on external servers br Outlook mobile supports a large number of different e mail services and platforms including Exchange iCloud Gmail Google Workspace formerly G Suite Outlook com and Yahoo Mail The app supports multiple email accounts at once br Emails are divided into two inboxes the Focused inbox displays messages of high importance and those from frequent contacts All other messages are displayed within an Other section Files locations and calendar events can be embedded into email messages Swiping gestures can be used for deleting messages br Like the desktop Outlook Outlook mobile allows users to see appointment details respond to Exchange meeting invites and schedule meetings It also incorporates the three day view and Interesting Calendars features from Sunrise br Files in the Files tab are not stored offline they require Internet access to view br br br Security br br Outlook mobile temporarily stores and indexes user data including email attachments calendar information and contacts along with login credentials in a secure form on Microsoft Azure servers located in the United States On Exchange accounts these servers identify as a single Exchange ActiveSync user in order to fetch e mail Additionally the app does not support mobile device management nor allows administrators to control how third party cloud storage services are used with the app to interact with their users Concerns surrounding these security issues have prompted some firms including the European Parliament to block the app on their Exchange servers Microsoft maintains a separate pre existing Outlook Web Access app for Android and iOS br br br Outlook Groups br Outlook Groups was a mobile application for Windows Phone Windows Mobile Android and iOS that could be used with an Office domain Microsoft Account e g a work or school account It is designed to take existing email threads and turn them into a group style conversation The app lets users create groups mention their contacts share Office documents via OneDrive and work on them together and participate in an email conversation The app also allows the finding and joining of other Outlook Groups It was tested internally at Microsoft and launched September for Windows Phone and Windows Mobile users br After its initial launch on Microsoft s own platforms they launched the application for Android and iOS on September br Outlook Groups was updated on September that introduced a deep linking feature as well as fixing a bug that blocked the send button from working In March Microsoft added the ability to attach multiple images and the most recently used document to group messages as well as the option to delete conversations within the application programme br Outlook Groups was retired by Microsoft on May br The functionality was replaced by adding the Groups node to the folder list within the Outlook mobile app br br br Internet standards compliance br br br HTML rendering br Outlook was the first Outlook to switch from Internet Explorer rendering engine to Microsoft Word s This meant that HTML and Cascading Style Sheets CSS items not handled by Word were no longer supported On the other hand HTML messages composed in Word look as they appeared to the author This affects publishing newsletters and reports because they frequently use intricate HTML and CSS to form their layout For example forms can no longer be embedded in an Outlook email br br br Support of CSS properties and HTML attributes br Outlook for Windows has very limited CSS support compared to various other e mail clients Neither CSS nor CSS specifications are fully implemented and many CSS properties can only to be used with certain HTML elements for the desired effect Some HTML attributes help achieve proper rendering of e mails in Outlook but most of these attributes are already deprecated in the HTML specifications In order to achieve the best compatibility with Outlook most HTML e mails are created using multiple boxed tables as the table element and its sub elements support the width and height property in Outlook No improvements have been made towards a more standards compliant email client since the release of Outlook br br br Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format br br Outlook and Exchange Server internally handle messages appointments and items as objects in a data model which is derived from the old proprietary Microsoft Mail system the Rich Text Format from Microsoft Word and the complex OLE general data model When these programs interface with other protocols such as the various Internet and X protocols they try to map this internal model onto those protocols in a way that can be reversed if the ultimate recipient is also running Outlook or Exchange br This focus on the possibility that emails and other items will ultimately be converted back to Microsoft Mail format is so extreme that if Outlook Exchange cannot figure out a way to encode the complete data in the standard format it simply encodes the entire message item in a proprietary binary format called Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format TNEF and sends this as an attached file usually named winmail dat to an otherwise incomplete rendering of the mail item If the recipient is Outlook Exchange it can simply discard the incomplete outer message and use the encapsulated data directly but if the recipient is any other program the message received will be incomplete because the data in the TNEF attachment will be of little use without the Microsoft software for which it was created As a workaround numerous tools for partially decoding TNEF files exist br br br Calendar compatibility br Outlook does not fully support data and syncing specifications for calendaring and contacts such as iCalendar CalDAV SyncML and vCard Outlook claims to be fully iCalendar compliant however it does not support all core objects such as VTODO or VJOURNAL Also Outlook supports vCard and does not support multiple contacts in the vCard format as a single file Outlook has also been criticized for having proprietary Outlook extensions to these Internet standards br br br msg format br Outlook both the web version and recent non web versions promotes the usage of a proprietary msg format to save individual emails instead of the standard eml format Messages use msg by default when saved to disk or forwarded as attachments Compatibility with past or future Outlook versions is not documented nor guaranteed the format saw over versions released since version in br The standard eml format replicates the format of emails as used for transmission and is therefore compatible with any email client which uses the normal protocols Standard compliant email clients like Mozilla Thunderbird use additional headers to store software specific information related e g to the local storage of the email while keeping the file plain text so that it can be read in any text editor and searched or indexed like any document by any other software br br br Security concerns br As part of its Trustworthy Computing initiative Microsoft took corrective steps to fix Outlook s reputation in Office Outlook Among the most publicized security features are that Office Outlook does not automatically load images in HTML emails or permit opening executable attachments by default and includes a built in Junk Mail filter Service Pack has augmented these features and adds an anti phishing filter br br br Outlook add ins br Outlook add ins are small additional programs for the Microsoft Outlook application mainly purposed to add new functional capabilities into Outlook and automate various routine operations The term also refers to programs where the main function is to work on Outlook files such as synchronization or backup utilities Outlook add ins may be developed in Microsoft Visual Studio or third party tools such as Add in Express Outlook add ins are not supported in Outlook Web App br From Outlook on Exchange Client Extensions are supported in Outlook Outlook and later support specific COM components called Outlook Add Ins The exact supported features such as NET components for later generations were extended with each release br br br SalesforceIQ Inbox for Outlook br In March Salesforce announced that its relationship intelligence platform SalesforceIQ would be able to seamlessly integrate with Outlook SalesforceIQ works from inside the Outlook inbox providing data from CRM email and customer social profiles It also provides recommendations within the inbox on various aspects like appointment scheduling contacts responses etc br br br Hotmail Connector br br Microsoft Outlook Hotmail Connector formerly Microsoft Office Outlook Connector is a discontinued and defunct free add in for Microsoft Outlook and intended to integrate Outlook com formerly Hotmail into Microsoft Outlook It uses DeltaSync a proprietary Microsoft communications protocol that was formerly used by Hotmail br In version access to tasks and notes and online synchronization with MSN Calendar is only available to MSN subscribers of paid premium accounts Version released in December as an optional upgrade uses Windows Live Calendar instead of the former MSN Calendar This meant that calendar features became free for all users except for task synchronization which became unavailable In April version became a required upgrade to continue using the service as part of a migration from MSN Calendar to Windows Live Calendar br Microsoft Outlook and its newer versions have intrinsic support for accessing Outlook com and its calendar over the Exchange ActiveSync EAS protocol while older versions of Microsoft Outlook can read and synchronize Outlook com emails over the IMAP protocol br br br Social Connector br Outlook Social Connector was a free add in for Microsoft Outlook and by Microsoft that allowed integration of social networks such as Facebook LinkedIn and Windows Live Messenger into Microsoft Outlook It was first introduced on November Starting with Microsoft Office Outlook Social Connector is an integral part of Outlook br br br CardDAV and CalDAV Connector br Since Microsoft Outlook does not support CalDAV and CardDAV protocol along the way various third party software vendors developed Outlook add ins to enable users synchronizing with CalDAV and CardDAV servers CalConnect has a list of software that enable users to synchronize their calendars with CalDAV servers contacts with CardDAV servers br br br Importing from other email clients br Traditionally Outlook supported importing messages from Outlook Express and Lotus Notes In addition Microsoft Outlook supports POP and IMAP protocols enabling users to import emails from servers that support these protocols Microsoft Hotmail Connector add in described above helps importing emails from Hotmail accounts Outlook later integrated the functionality of this add in and added the ability to import email as well as a calendar through Exchange ActiveSync protocol br There are some ways to get the emails from Thunderbird the first is to use a tool that can convert a Thunderbird folder to a format that can be imported from Outlook Express This method must be processed folder by folder The other method is to use a couple of free tools that keep the original folder structure If Exchange is available an easier method is to connect the old mail client Thunderbird to Exchange using IMAP and upload the original mail from the client to the Exchange account br br br New Outlook for Windows br br In May Microsoft announced a preview release of new Outlook for Windows available initially to Office Insiders The new version of Outlook is a progressive web app based on Outlook com and offers several new features br The new Outlook for Windows preview later became available to all existing Outlook for Windows users and also users of the free Mail and Calendar app which is to be retired in favor of the new app br The new Outlook has been criticized for having worse performance compared to the previous native versions as well as lack of offline support br br br See also br Address book br Calendar Apple iCal br Comparison of email clients br Comparison of feed aggregators br Comparison of
