violence but may be an underlying driver that has allowed the rise to continue Rudd had denied that falling police numbers contributed to increased crime Yvette Cooper wrote This is shocking Surely

passed to the Guardian says the department has set a target of achieving enforced returns in and indicates that we have exceeded our target of assisted returns It adds that progress has been made on a path towards the increased performance on enforced returns which we promised the Home Secretary earlier this year The revelation contradicted Rudd s public pronouncements concerning what she was aware of the targets for enforcing the removal of immigrants The New Statesman said that the leaked memo gave in specific detail the targets set by the Home Office for the number of people to be removed from the United Kingdom It suggests that Rudd misled MPs on at least one occasion When questioned by Chair Yvette Cooper MP she told the Home Affairs Select Committee that the Home Office had no targets for removals then that she was unaware of these targets and that they would be scrapped Now it emerges that she saw the relevant targets herself Diane Abbott called for Rudd s resignation In

review She failed to appear in Parliament to defend her decision and was accused of having cruelly misled campaigners for justice in what they saw as her bitter betrayal br br br Plan to compel companies to disclose foreign workers br At the Conservative Party Conference Rudd suggested that companies should be forced to disclose how many foreign workers they employ The proposal was revealed as a key plank of a government drive to reduce net migration and encourage businesses to hire British staff However senior figures in the business world warned the plan would be a complete anathema to responsible employers would be divisive and would damage the British economy because foreign workers were hired to fill gaps in skills that British staff could not provide br Labour responded by saying that the plan would fan the flames of xenophobia and hatred in our communities and the SNP described it as the most disgraceful display of reactionary right wing politics in living memory br
