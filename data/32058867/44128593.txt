involves investigating the internal affairs of states br br br Ghana br In February Kaye representing UN experts and special rapporteurs cautioned the Ghanaian authorities that the global media s trust in government particularly in respect of the suppression of freedom of expression could only be rebuilt by an immediate and transparent investigation into the death of journalist Ahmed Hussein

press and media He stressed that labeling journalists as evil or dangerous and maligning their work affects their safety He maintained that the killing of the investigative journalist Hussein Suale
