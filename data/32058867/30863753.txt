LSI Logic Corporation was an American company founded in Santa Clara California was a pioneer in the ASIC and EDA industries It evolved over time to design and sell semiconductors and software that accelerated storage and networking in data centers mobile networks and client computing br In April LSI Logic merged with Agere Systems and rebranded the firm as LSI Corporation br On May LSI Corporation was acquired by Avago Technologies now known as Broadcom Inc for billion br br br History br br br br LSI Logic Corporation was incorporated in November by Wilfred J Corrigan and began operating in early using leased facilities in Santa Clara California Corrigan recruited co founders Bill O Meara VP Marketing and Sales Rob Walker VP Engineering and Mitchell Mick Bohn CFO as co founders Initial funding of million came from a consortium of venture capitalists including Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers II Institutional Venture Partners and Technical Development Capital Ltd A second round of million in funding from Sequoia Capital a group of investment bankers from the UK and First Interstate Bank came In March br The initial plan called for a line of CMOS gate arrays created from masterslices which were uncommitted transistors customized to a specific application by the deposition of unique metal interconnections The intention was to have the masterslices manufactured by external semiconductor companies and then do the metallization themselves In order to jump start the business they licensed an existing CMOS gate array design from California Devices Inc CDI and reverse engineered and improved on an ECL gate array design from Motorola br The first interactive CAD system was called LSI Design System LDS The initial EDA flow was based on simulation from TEGAS and place and route from Silvar Lisco integrated on Megatek hardware What made them unique from other ASIC vendors at the time was that they willing to ship the software to their customers rather than keeping it in house which was the strategy used by market leaders at the time In they started development of their own in house CAD tools and moved to Silicon Graphics hardware By the EDA industry had developed enough that customers wanted to be able to use rd party tools br Sales grew rapidly and they were able to launch a successful initial public offering on the Nasdaq exchange on
