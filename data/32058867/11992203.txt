Private Disk is a disk encryption application for the Microsoft Windows operating system developed by Dekart SRL It works by creating a virtual drive the contents of which is encrypted on the fly other software can use the drive as if it were a usual one br One of Private Disk s key selling points is in its ease of use which is achieved by hiding complexity from the end user e g data wiping is applied transparently when an encrypted image is deleted This simplicity does however reduce its flexibility in some respects e g it only allows the use of AES encryption br Although Private Disk uses a NIST certified implementation of the AES and SHA algorithms this certification is restricted to a single component of Private Disk the encryption hash library used and not to Private Disk as a complete system br br br Feature highlights br NIST certified implementation of AES bit and SHA Private Disk complies with FIPS and FIPS br CBC mode with secret IVs is used to encrypt the sectors of the storage volume br Disk Firewall an application level filter which allows only trusted programs to access the virtual drive br Ability to run directly from a removable drive requiring no local installation br Offers access to encrypted data on any system even if administrative privileges are not available br Encrypted images can be accessed on Windows Mobile and Windows CE handhelds this is achieved by making the encrypted container format compatible with containers used by SecuBox disk encryption software by Aiko Solutions br File wiping is applied when deleting an encrypted image br PD File Move a file migration tool which will locate the specified files on the system and securely move them to an encrypted disk br Compatibility with Windows x and Windows NT operating systems br Autorun and Autofinish automatically start a program or a script when a virtual disk is mounted or dismounted br Encrypted backup of an encrypted image br Password quality meter br Automatic backup of a disk s encryption key br Built in password recovery tool br Compatibility with bit platforms br Existing versions br There are multiple versions of Private Disk which provide a different feature set br br Private Disk hard disk encryption software that uses bit AES encryption is highly configurable offers application level protection USB disk portability etc br Private Disk Multifactor is a superset of Private Disk providing the same functionality adding support for biometric authentication as well as smart card or token based authentication br Private Disk Light is a free version it uses AES and comes with a restricted set of features br Private Disk SDK is a software development kit that can be used to build a custom application which provides data encryption facilities br br br See also br Disk encryption software br Comparison of disk encryption software br br br External links br Dekart company web page br Information about certified implementations of the cryptographic algorithms br Private Disk discussion forum br Release notes for the latest version br br br
