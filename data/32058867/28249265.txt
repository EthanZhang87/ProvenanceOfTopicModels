Bitcoin abbreviation BTC sign is the first decentralized cryptocurrency Nodes in the peer to peer bitcoin network verify transactions through cryptography and record them in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain without central oversight Consensus between nodes is achieved using a computationally intensive process based on proof of work called mining that guarantees the security of the bitcoin blockchain Mining consumes large quantities of electricity and has been criticized for its environmental effects br Based on a free market ideology bitcoin was invented in by Satoshi Nakamoto an unknown person Use of bitcoin as a currency began in with the release of its open source implementation ch In El Salvador adopted it as legal tender Bitcoin is currently used more as a store of value and less as a medium of exchange or unit of account It is mostly seen as an investment and has been described by many scholars as an economic bubble As bitcoin is pseudonymous its use by criminals has attracted the attention of regulators leading to its ban by several countries as of br br br History br br br Background br Before bitcoin several digital cash technologies were released starting with David Chaum s ecash in the s The idea that solutions to computational puzzles could have some value was first proposed by cryptographers Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor in The concept was independently rediscovered by Adam Back who developed Hashcash a proof of work scheme for spam control in The first proposals for distributed digital scarcity based cryptocurrencies came from cypherpunks Wei Dai b money and Nick Szabo bit gold in In Hal Finney developed the first currency based on reusable proof of work These various attempts were not successful Chaum s concept required centralized control and no banks wanted to sign on Hashcash had no protection against double spending while b money and bit gold were not resistant to Sybil attacks br br br Creation br br The domain name bitcoin org was registered on August On October a link to a white paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System was posted to a cryptography mailing list Nakamoto implemented the bitcoin software as open source code and released it in January Nakamoto s identity remains unknown All individual components of bitcoin originated in earlier academic literature Nakamoto s innovation was their complex interplay resulting in the first decentralized Sybil resistant Byzantine fault tolerant digital cash system that would eventually be referred to as the first blockchain Nakamoto s paper was not peer reviewed and was initially ignored by academics who argued that it could not work br On January the bitcoin network was created when Nakamoto mined the starting block of the chain known as the genesis block Embedded in this block was the text The Times Jan Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks which is the date and headline of an issue of The Times newspaper Nine days later Hal Finney received the first bitcoin transaction ten bitcoins from Nakamoto Wei Dai and Nick Szabo were also early supporters On May the first known commercial transaction using bitcoin occurred when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two Papa John s pizzas for in what would later be celebrated as Bitcoin Pizza Day br br br Early growth br Blockchain analysts estimate that Nakamoto had mined about one million bitcoins before disappearing in when he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository over to Gavin Andresen Andresen later became lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation an organization founded in September to promote bitcoin br After early proof of concept transactions the first major users of bitcoin were black markets such as the dark web Silk Road During its months of existence beginning in February Silk Road exclusively accepted bitcoins as payment transacting million worth about million br br br First regulatory actions br In March the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network FinCEN established regulatory guidelines for decentralized virtual currencies such as bitcoin classifying American bitcoin miners who sell their generated bitcoins as money services businesses subject to registration and other legal obligations In May US authorities seized the unregistered exchange Mt Gox In June the US Drug Enforcement Administration seized from a man attempting to use them to buy illegal substances This marked the first time a government agency had seized bitcoins The FBI seized about in October from Silk Road following the arrest of its founder Ross Ulbricht br In December the People s Bank of China prohibited Chinese financial institutions from using bitcoin After the announcement the value of bitcoin dropped and Baidu no longer accepted bitcoins for certain services Buying real world goods with any virtual currency had been illegal in China since at least br br br br Research produced by the University of Cambridge estimated that in there were to million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet most of them using bitcoin In August the SegWit software upgrade was activated Segwit was intended to support the Lightning Network as well as improve scalability SegWit opponents who supported larger blocks as a scalability solution forked to create Bitcoin Cash one of many forks of bitcoin br In December the first futures on bitcoin was introduced by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME br In February the price crashed after China imposed a complete ban on Bitcoin trading The percentage of bitcoin trading in the Chinese renminbi fell from over in September to less than in June During the same year Bitcoin prices were negatively affected by several hacks or thefts from cryptocurrency exchanges br br br present br br In some major companies and institutions started to acquire bitcoin MicroStrategy invested million in bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset Square Inc million and MassMutual million In November PayPal added support for bitcoin in the US br In February Bitcoin s market capitalization reached trillion for the first time In November the Taproot soft fork upgrade was activated adding support for Schnorr signatures improved functionality of smart contracts and Lightning Network Before Bitcoin only used a custom elliptic curve with the ECDSA algorithm to produce signatures In September Bitcoin became legal tender in El Salvador alongside the US dollar In October the first bitcoin futures exchange traded fund ETF called BITO from ProShares was approved by the SEC and listed on the CME br In May and June the bitcoin price fell following the collapses of TerraUSD a stablecoin and the Celsius Network a cryptocurrency loan company br In ordinals non fungible tokens NFTs on Bitcoin went live In January the first US spot bitcoin ETFs began trading offering direct exposure to bitcoin for the first time on American stock exchanges As of June River Financial estimated that Bitcoin had million users about of the global population br br br Design br br br Units and divisibility br The unit of account of the bitcoin system is the bitcoin It is most commonly represented with the symbol and the currency code BTC However the BTC code does not conform to ISO as BT is the country code of Bhutan and ISO requires the first letter used in global commodities to be X XBT a code that conforms to ISO though not officially part of it is used by Bloomberg L P br No uniform capitalization convention exists some sources use Bitcoin capitalized to refer to the technology and network and bitcoin lowercase for the unit of account The Cambridge Advanced Learner s Dictionary and the Oxford Advanced Learner s Dictionary use the capitalized and lowercase variants without distinction br One bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places ch Units for smaller amounts of bitcoin are the millibitcoin mBTC equal to bitcoin and the satoshi sat representing one hundred millionth bitcoin the smallest amount possible satoshis are one mBTC br br br Blockchain br br As a decentralized system bitcoin operates without a central authority or single administrator so that anyone can create a new bitcoin address and transact without needing any approval ch This is accomplished through a specialized distributed ledger called a blockchain that records bitcoin transactions br The blockchain is implemented as an ordered list of blocks Each block contains a SHA hash of the previous block chaining them in chronological order ch The blockchain is maintained by a peer to peer network Individual blocks public addresses and transactions within blocks are public information and can be examined using a blockchain explorer br Nodes validate and broadcast transactions each maintaining a copy of the blockchain for ownership verification A new block is created every minutes on average updating the blockchain across all nodes without central oversight This process tracks bitcoin spending ensuring each bitcoin is spent only once Unlike a traditional ledger that tracks physical currency bitcoins exist digitally as unspent outputs of transactions ch br br br Addresses and transactions br br In the blockchain bitcoins are linked to specific addresses that are hashes of a public key Creating an address involves generating a random private key and then computing the corresponding address This process is almost instant but the reverse finding the private key for a given address is nearly impossible ch Publishing a bitcoin address does not risk its private key and it is extremely unlikely to accidentally generate a used key with funds To use bitcoins owners need their private key to digitally sign transactions which are verified by the network using the public key keeping the private key secret ch br Bitcoin transactions use a Forth like scripting language ch involving one or more inputs and outputs When sending bitcoins a user specifies the recipients addresses and the amount for each output This allows sending bitcoins to several recipients in a single transaction To prevent double spending each input must refer to a previous unspent output in the blockchain Using multiple inputs is similar to using multiple coins in a cash transaction As in a cash transaction the sum of inputs can exceed the intended sum of payments In such a case an additional output can return the change back to the payer Unallocated input satoshis in the transaction become the transaction fee br Losing a private key means losing access to the bitcoins with no other proof of ownership accepted by the protocol For instance in a user lost valued at US million by accidentally discarding a hard drive with the private key It is estimated that around of all bitcoins are lost The private key must also be kept secret as its exposure such as through a data breach can lead to theft of the associated bitcoins ch As of December approximately had been stolen from cryptocurrency exchanges br br br Mining br br The mining process in Bitcoin involves maintaining the blockchain through computer processing power Miners group and broadcast new transactions into blocks which are then verified by the network Each block must contain a proof of work PoW to be accepted involving finding a nonce number that combined with the block content produces a hash numerically smaller than the network s difficulty target ch This PoW is simple to verify but hard to generate requiring many attempts ch PoW forms the basis of Bitcoin s consensus mechanism br The difficulty of generating a block is deterministically adjusted based on the mining power on the network by changing the difficulty target which is recalibrated every blocks approximately two weeks to maintain an average time of ten minutes between new blocks The process requires significant computational power and specialized hardware ch br Miners who successfully find a new block can collect transaction fees from the included transactions and a set reward in bitcoins To claim this reward a special transaction called a coinbase is included in the block with the miner as the payee All bitcoins in existence have been created through this type of transaction ch This reward is halved every blocks until million with new bitcoin issuance slated to end around Afterward miners will only earn from transaction fees These fees are determined by the transaction s size and the amount of data stored measured in satoshis per byte ch br The proof of work system and the chaining of blocks make blockchain modifications very difficult as altering one block requires changing all subsequent blocks As more blocks are added modifying older blocks becomes increasingly challenging In case of disagreement nodes trust the longest chain which required the greatest amount of effort to produce To tamper or censor the ledger one needs to control the majority of the global hashrate The high cost required to reach this level of computational power guarantees the security of the bitcoin blockchain br Bitcoin mining s environmental impact is controversial and has attracted the attention of regulators leading to restrictions or incentives in various jurisdictions As of a non peer reviewed study by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance CCAF estimated that bitcoin mining represented of global electricity consumption Another non peer reviewed commentary published in Joule estimated that bitcoin mining was responsible for of world greenhouse gas emissions About half of the electricity used is generated through fossil fuels Moreover mining hardware s short lifespan results in electronic waste The amount of electrical energy consumed and the e waste generated is comparable to that of Greece and the Netherlands respectively br br br Privacy and fungibility br Bitcoin is pseudonymous with funds linked to addresses not real world identities While the owners of these addresses are not directly identified all transactions are public on the blockchain Patterns of use like spending coins from multiple inputs can hint at a common owner Public data can sometimes be matched with known address owners Bitcoin exchanges might also need to collect personal data as per legal requirements For enhanced privacy users can generate a new address for each transaction br In the Bitcoin network each bitcoin is treated equally ensuring basic fungibility However users and applications can choose to differentiate between bitcoins While wallets and software treat all bitcoins the same each bitcoin s transaction history is recorded on the blockchain This public record allows for chain analysis where users can identify and potentially reject bitcoins from controversial sources For example in Mt Gox froze accounts containing bitcoins identified as stolen br br br Wallets br br Bitcoin wallets were the first cryptocurrency wallets enabling users to store the information necessary to transact bitcoins ch glossary The first wallet program simply named Bitcoin and sometimes referred to as the Satoshi client was released in by Nakamoto as open source software Bitcoin Core is among the best known clients Forks of Bitcoin Core exist such as Bitcoin Unlimited Wallets can be full clients with a full copy of the blockchain to check the validity of mined blocks ch or lightweight clients just to send and receive transactions without a local copy of the entire blockchain Third party internet services called online wallets store users credentials on their servers making them susceptible of hacks Cold storage protects bitcoins from such hacks by keeping private keys offline either through specialized hardware wallets or paper printouts ch br br br Scalability and decentralization challenges br Nakamoto limited the block size to one megabyte The limited block size and frequency can lead to delayed processing of transactions increased fees and a Bitcoin scalability problem The Lightning Network second layer routing network is a potential scaling solution ch br Research shows a trend towards centralization in bitcoin as miners join pools for stable income If a single miner or pool controls more than of the hashing power it would allow them to censor transactions and double spend coins In mining pool Ghash io reached mining power causing safety concerns but later voluntarily capped its power at for the benefit of the whole network A few entities also dominate other parts of the ecosystem such as the client software online wallets and simplified payment verification SPV clients br br br Economics and usage br br br Bitcoin s theoretical roots and ideology br br According to the European Central Bank the decentralization of money offered by bitcoin has its theoretical roots in the Austrian school of economics especially with Friedrich von Hayek s book The Denationalization of Money in which he advocates a complete free market in the production distribution and management of money to end the monopoly of central banks Sociologist Nigel Dodd citing the crypto anarchist Declaration of Bitcoin s Independence argues that the essence of the bitcoin ideology is to remove money from social as well as governmental control The Economist describes bitcoin as a techno anarchist project to create an online version of cash a way for people to transact without the possibility of interference from malicious governments or banks These philosophical ideas initially attracted libertarians and anarchists Economist Paul Krugman argues that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are only used by bank skeptics and criminals br br br Recognition as a currency and legal status br br Money serves three purposes a store of value a medium of exchange and a unit of account According to The Economist in bitcoin functions best as a medium of exchange In The Economist noted that bitcoins had three qualities useful in a currency they are hard to earn limited in supply and easy to verify However a assessment by The Economist stated that cryptocurrencies met none of these three criteria Per some researchers as of bitcoin functions more as a payment system than as a currency In economist Robert J Shiller wrote that bitcoin has potential as a unit of account for measuring the relative value of goods as with Chile s Unidad de Fomento but that Bitcoin in its present form doesn t really solve any sensible economic problem Fran ois R Velde Senior Economist at the Chicago Fed described bitcoin as an elegant solution to the problem of creating a digital currency David Andolfatto Vice President at the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis stated that bitcoin is a threat to the establishment which he argues is a good thing for the Federal Reserve System and other central banks because it prompts these institutions to operate sound policies br The legal status of bitcoin varies substantially from one jurisdiction to another Because of its decentralized nature and its global presence regulating bitcoin is difficult However the use of bitcoin can be criminalized and shutting down exchanges and the peer to peer economy in a given country would constitute a de facto ban The use of bitcoin by criminals has attracted the attention of financial regulators legislative bodies and law enforcement Nobel prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz says that bitcoin s anonymity encourages money laundering and other crimes This is the main justification behind bitcoin bans As of November nine countries applied an absolute ban Algeria Bangladesh China Egypt Iraq Morocco Nepal Qatar and Tunisia while another countries had an implicit ban Bitcoin is only legal tender in El Salvador br br br Use for payments br br As of Bitcoin is rarely used in transactions with merchants but it is popular to purchase illegal goods online Prices are not usually quoted in bitcoin and trades involve conversions into fiat currencies Commonly cited reasons for not using Bitcoin include high costs the inability to process chargebacks high price volatility long transaction times and transaction fees especially for small purchases Bloomberg reported that bitcoin was being used for large item purchases on the site Overstock com and for cross border payments to freelancers As of there was little sign of bitcoin use in international remittances despite high fees charged by banks and Western Union who compete in this market br In September the Bitcoin Law made bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador alongside the US dollar The adoption has been criticized both internationally and within El Salvador In particular in the International Monetary Fund IMF urged El Salvador to reverse its decision As of the use of Bitcoin in El Salvador remains low of businesses refused to accept it despite being legally required to In April the Central African Republic CAR adopted Bitcoin as legal tender alongside the CFA franc but repealed the reform one year later br Bitcoin is also used by some governments For instance the Iranian government initially opposed cryptocurrencies but later saw them as an opportunity to circumvent sanctions Since Iran has required local bitcoin miners to sell bitcoin to the Central Bank of Iran allowing the central bank to use it for imports Some constituent states also accept tax payments in bitcoin including Colorado US and Zug Switzerland As of the US government owned more than billion worth of seized bitcoin br br br Use for investment and status as an economic bubble br br As of the overwhelming majority of bitcoin transactions took place on cryptocurrency exchanges Since regulated bitcoin funds also allow exposure to the asset or to futures as an investment Individuals and companies such as the Winklevoss twins and Elon Musk s companies SpaceX and Tesla have massively invested in Bitcoin Bitcoin wealth is highly concentrated with holding of in circulation currency as of As of September El Salvador had million worth of bitcoin in its international reserves br In research published in the Journal of Monetary Economics concluded that price manipulation occurred during the Mt Gox bitcoin theft and that the market remained vulnerable to manipulation Research published in The Journal of Finance also suggested that trading associated with increases in the amount of the Tether cryptocurrency and associated trading at the Bitfinex exchange accounted for about half of the price increase in bitcoin in late br Bitcoin along with other cryptocurrencies has been described as an economic bubble by several economists including Nobel Prize in Economics laureates such as Joseph Stiglitz James Heckman and Paul Krugman Another recipient of the prize Robert Shiller argues that bitcoin is rather a fad that may become an asset class He describes its price growth as an epidemic driven by contagious narratives br According to research published in the International Review of Financial Analysis in Bitcoin as an asset is highly volatile and does not behave like any other conventional asset According to one analysis published in The Journal of Alternative Investments bitcoin was less volatile than oil silver US Treasuries and stocks in the S P during and after the stock market crash The term hodl was created in December for holding Bitcoin rather than selling it during periods of volatility br Economists investors and the central bank of Estonia have described bitcoin as a potential Ponzi scheme Legal scholar Eric Posner disagrees however as a real Ponzi scheme takes fraud bitcoin by contrast seems more like a collective delusion A World Bank report also concluded that bitcoin was not a deliberate Ponzi scheme br br
