A series of protests against the Cuban government and the Communist Party of Cuba began on July triggered by a shortage of food and medicine and the government s response to the resurgent COVID pandemic in Cuba The protests were the largest anti government demonstrations since the Maleconazo in Protesters motivations included resentment at the Cuban government s authoritarianism and curbs on civil liberties the government s COVID pandemic lockdown rules the government s failure to follow through on promised economic and political reforms Protesters were also angered by the poor state of the Cuban economy Cuban dissidents have placed the responsibility on the government s economic policies and human rights abuses br Many international figures called for dialogue asking that the Cuban authorities respect the protesters freedom of assembly and peaceful demonstrations Protesters abroad called for the United States to provide humanitarian aid One person was confirmed dead during a clash between protesters and police the dissident organization Cuba Decide estimated five deaths br The Cuban government responded to the demonstrations with a crackdown making hundreds of arrests and charging at least Cubans with crimes including sedition some demonstrators were given lengthy prison sentences in trials criticized by Amnesty International activists and families as unfair As a result of the protests the Cuban government lifted some import restrictions and the United States government imposed new sanctions on Cuban officials br br br Background br br In the economic situation in Cuba worsened The Cuban economy contracted by in and by in the first six months of The economic crises emerged from a combination of factors including reduced financial support subsidized fuel from Cuba s ally Venezuela the United States embargo against Cuba and United States sanctions tightened by the Trump administration in and the effect of the COVID pandemic which hit the industry of tourism in Cuba and led to a decrease in remittances from Cubans abroad Currency reform which limited Cuban pesos exchange for United States dollars because the government needed the reform package to finance imports led to soaring inflation with rates estimated to be The economic situation has been exacerbated by sanctions and some observers have blamed inefficiencies of Cuba s Soviet style centrally planned economy and a lack of reforms that other Communist states have taken Pavel Vidal a former Cuban central bank economist who teaches at Javeriana University in Colombia stated that reforms in Cuba do not depend on the embargo and the embargo should be eliminated unilaterally independently from reforms in Cuba Both cause problems The Cuban government has blamed the crisis on the trade embargo and its tightness as well as the fallout from the COVID pandemic According to Lillian Guerra professor of Cuban history at the University of Florida the food shortages and high prices were the result of government spending money on building hotels and tourists facilities According to The Guardian they were the result of United States sanctions and the COVID pandemic br Deteriorating economic conditions led to reductions in Cubans standard of living shortages of food and other basic products a shortage in hard currency and persistent power outages Promised economic reforms which according to NBC News Carmen Sesin were needed and were another cause of discontent alongside the embargo did not materialize in part because of the fallout from the COVID pandemic according to the Cuban government Cuba was not eligible for free COVID vaccines from the COVAX program since it was not considered a low income economy It decided not to buy vaccines from overseas and instead developed its own Soberana and Abdala The Miami Herald and The Wall Street Journal described the vaccine rollout process as delayed and slow and said it angered some Cubans and prompted their calls for more vaccines According to international trackers at the time the protests had broken out Cuba had administered doses per people the th highest rate in Latin America and about of the Cuban population was fully vaccinated In COVID cases began to surge especially in the Matanzas Province and the situation was further aggravated by the shortage of medicines and food Cuba responded by deploying more doctors to the province br For many Cuban Americans the protests were fuelled by dissatisfaction with lack of civil liberties such as freedom of expression in Cuba s tightly controlled government which The Washington Post s Anthony Faiola described as an authoritarian government struggling to cope with increasingly severe blackouts food shortages and a spiking coronavirus outbreak with protesters demanding an end to the year dictatorship according to The Wall Street Journal It exerts tight control using its intelligence police and security apparatus which has been described by analysts as a police state that has provided intelligence support to allied governments such as Nicaragua and Venezuela The government s curbs and clampdowns on Cubans civil liberties has prompted resentment For Sesin Cuba has received praise for providing its citizens of important primary care and basic needs but the government also limits their freedom in several ways such as controlling food internet and wages prices and having a lack of freedom of assembly freedom of expression and multi party elections Measures adopted by the government during the COVID pandemic such as closed borders and no tourism have also been praised for having reduced the number of COVID infections but were very strict and did not help the economy in such times of crisis br Increased use of social media also mobilized participants in the demonstrations internet access in Cuba began to surge in and G mobile phone service came to the island in leading to widespread adoption Earlier in USAid contactors began working on ZunZuneo a Cuban Twitter like social media network planning to encourage Cubans to organise smart mobs that could renegotiate the power balance between the state and society but the project was ended in The use of VPNs spread as people have used them to access anti Castro news websites blocked by the state but also to make payments via PayPal to send files through WeTransfer or to play Pok mon GO all services otherwise blocked by US sanctions br Due to the evolving crises a social media campaign using the hashtags SOSCUBA and SOSMATANZAS was initiated to collect money medical materials food and other supplies to be sent to Cuba Various international figures such as Don Omar Ricardo Montaner Alejandro Sanz Nicky Jam J Balvin Daddy Yankee Becky G and Mia Khalifa joined the request The Cuban government recognized the crisis describing it as very complex but rejected a proposed humanitarian corridor and described the campaign as an attempt to misrepresent the situation The Cuban government set up a bank account to receive aid and said that it was open to receive donations although the designated account is in a Cuban bank under United States sanctions According to the Miami Herald the Cuban government has historically refused or seized aid coming from Cuban exiles During the protests as the government shut down access to several social media websites over one million protesters began using the tool Psiphon br br br Protests br br br July br br On July at least two demonstrations emerged in San Antonio de los Ba os near Havana and Palma Soriano in the province of Santiago de Cuba singing the song Patria y Vida Homeland and Life which inspired the protests according to Nancy San Mart n and Mimi Whitefield Protests spread to at least cities across the country The song s name is an inversion of the Cuban Revolution motto Patria o Muerte Homeland or Death Videos of protesters singing slogans of Down with Communism also shouted by protesters in the United States Freedom and We are not afraid were broadcast on social networks in addition to protesters demanding vaccines and an end to repression which was aggravated by the economic crisis and the pandemic Opposition media outlets such as Radio y Televisi n Mart have published social media videos of protests in Malec n Havana Santiago de Cuba Santa Clara Ciego de vila Camag ey Bayamo Guant namo San Jos de las Lajas Holgu n and C rdenas According to Orlando Gutierrez Boronat an exiled dissident of the Assembly of the Cuban Resistance there were protests in more than fifteen cities and towns in Cuba Guti rrez asked the United States government to lead an international intervention to prevent protesters from being victims of a bloodbath ba o de sangre The San Isidro Movement called on the protesters to march to Malec n Writing in Slate Baruch College professor Ted Henken suggested that the Cuban demonstrators use of the Internet to mobilize and publicize the protests showed that the Internet can still be a force for democracy and wrote that in authoritarian contexts like Cuba where the government has long since monopolized the mass media and transformed journalism into political propaganda access to unfiltered channels of information and communication can indeed shift the balance of power in small but powerful ways br br Cuban president and First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba Miguel D az Canel said that the United States embargo against Cuba and economic sanctions were responsible for the conditions that led to the unrest He urged government supporting citizens to take to the streets in counter protest to respond to the demonstrations saying in a special television broadcast The order to fight has been given into the street revolutionaries The government called the protests counter revolutionary Younger Cubans comprised the majority of protesters while some members of older generations responded to demonstrations

the evening protests had dissipated br Cuban journalist Yoani S nchez reported that after the protests on July some were injured and there were hundreds of detentions Jos Miguel Vivanco director of the Human Rights Watch s Americas division said This is pretty massive My sense is that this is a combination of social unrest based on a lack of freedoms and covid and economic conditions The lack of access to electricity The blackouts People are screaming for freedom Cuban journalist Abraham Jim nez Enoa tweeted from Havana Cuba is an island ruled by the military for years Today there is no food no medicine and people are dying like flies from Covid People got tired This country is losing even fear The small class of private entrepreneurs in Cuba such as Nidialys Acosta said that protests in the middle of a pandemic were not the solution and do not agree with Diaz Canel inciting the revolutionaries to the streets either The Washington Post quoted Acosta as saying I could not believe the magnitude People are tired It has been aggravated in recent weeks by blackouts There are blackouts of six hours in a row in the countryside br br br July br On July more protests were reported in Cuba Camila Acosta a journalist from the Spanish newspaper ABC was arrested Internet watchdog NetBlocks reported that social media platforms in Cuba were censored beginning on July although virtual private

husbands children and relatives arrested or disappeared during the events of the previous day Faced with the accusations of missing persons D az Canel stated They have already come up with the fact that in Cuba we repress we murder Where are the Cuban murders Where is the Cuban repression Where are the disappeared in Cuba br br A meeting of the top leadership of the Communist Party of Cuba including former First Secretary Ra l Castro was held where the issue of the protests was addressed releasing a statement that the provocations orchestrated by counterrevolutionary elements organized and financed from the United States with destabilizing purposes were analyzed D az Canel accused the United States of using a policy of economic asphyxiation to cause social unrest in Cuba Foreign Minister Bruno Rodr guez Parrilla labeled the protesters as vandals Authorities blocked access to social media platforms such as WhatsApp Telegram Facebook and Instagram br Some Cuban exiles and Florida politicians have called for military United States foreign intervention Miami mayor Francis Suarez stated the United States should consider air strikes against Cuba Some international politicians and abroad Cubans blamed the United States embargo against Cuba The Cuban government blamed the protests on United States interference and U S financed counter revolutionaries exploiting hardship caused by the decades old U S trade embargo that Washington tightened in the midst of the pandemic pushing the Cuban economy to the brink br br br July br Cuba s Ministry of Interior stated that it mourns the death of a year old man named as Diubis Laurencio Tejeda who had taken part in the protests Diubis mother committed suicide few days later after his death The Cuban dissident organization Cuba Decide estimated a toll of five deaths during the protests br During a live interview with the Spanish television program Todo es mentira Cuban YouTuber and activist Dina Stars was detained by Cuban security officers She was later released after being accused of promoting protests in Cuba and stated that they didn t torture me or kidnap me In Miami Florida protesters temporarily blocked the Palmetto Expressway in both directions in order to show support for the Cuban protesters Some newspapers reported that the protesters were in violation of a Florida anti riot law however none of the protesters have been charged and Governor of Florida Ron DeSantis said he did not think the law applied br In response to protesters tired of hardship and wanting change former Cuban central bank economist Pavel Vidal stated There is a lack of credibility over the promised reforms It s not just the economic crisis People don t have hope in getting out of the crisis in a definitive way The United States State Department said that it was willing to provide humanitarian aid as it did in early by sending to Cuba chicken food worth million br br br July br Cuba s Ministry of Interior confirmed one dead and reported several injuries to citizens including some officers The web page CiberCuba released a video where allegedly a black beret wearing group the Cuban police break

and many remain in detention as of July Deputy Minister of the Interior Jes s Manuel Bur n Tabit questioned decision making within the ministry and the Security Council as well as what he called the excessive use of police force to repress the demonstrations the Cuban government denied that he resigned after his statements br In order to deal with the shortages the Cuban Chamber of Commerce lifted customs restrictions that limited imports of hygiene products medicine and food which one of the protesters demanded the government should do Travelers would be allowed to bring these products into Cuba between July and December without being subject to customs duties In addition directors of state owned enterprises would be given the authority to determine their employees salaries while small and medium sized privately owned businesses would be able to be organized The government announced that it would be improving on the electricity system of which problems ETECSA did not provide explanation until Foreign Minister Bruno Rodr guez Parrilla attribute them to power outages and difficulties with food or transportation Cuban official Carlos Fernandez de Cossio told the MSNBC that the government did not interrupt Internet service as a whole and that interruptions were sporadic or limited to specific services br Access to internet in Cuba was partially restored although with an unstable network of intermittent functionality while access to social media and instant messaging applications remained blocked According to Ted Henken who has written on the topic in works such as Cuba s Digital Revolution the decision to shut down internet access in Cuba even if temporary could prove very expensive for both education in Cuba and the Cuban economy Henken told The Guardian It s a cost that cannot be borne for more than a few days br The Cuban government shut off the internet making it impossible for pictures and videos of the protests and violence against protesters to be shared on social media br br br July br D az Canel stated that there are three kinds of protesters counter revolutionaries criminals and those with legitimate frustrations Earlier on July as reported by Reuters D az Canel said that many protesters were sincere but manipulated by U S orchestrated social media campaigns and mercenaries on the ground and warned that further provocations would not be tolerated calling on supporters to confront provocations In a national address on July D az Canel called on Cubans not to act with hate but also admitted some failures by the government explaining We have to gain experience from the disturbances We also have to carry out a critical analysis of our problems in order to act and overcome and avoid their repetition br Cuba s Foreign Affairs Minister Bruno Rodr guez Parrilla claimed to have irrefutable proof that the majority of those that took part in this internet campaign were in the United States and used automated systems to make content go viral without being penalized by Twitter which analysts spoken to by Agence France Presse AFP said was at best an exaggeration in an article published on July br br br July br In response to the anti government protests during the previous days there was a government organized demonstration which was attended by tens of thousands of supporters the Cuban government reported a turnout of about people D az Canel and Ra l Castro were present and held speeches In his speech during the rally D az Canel reiterated that most of blame for the unrest rested on the United States and the embargo which he described as the blockade aggression and terror as well as the impact of and fallout from the COVID pandemic and a social network campaign allegedly spread by dissident Cuban American groups Later in the day D az Canel acknowledged some responsibilities on the government s part About the protesters D az Canel was quoted as saying that there were four sectors involved in the protests radical supporters of the United States who waved that country s flag during the protests and demanded military intervention criminals who took advantage of the situation to loot people genuinely desperate due to the impact of the crisis on their daily lives and young people who felt disenfranchised br In response to some concessions by the government Jos Jasan Nieves director of the online newspaper El Toque stated The Cuban government has just shown that it could have allowed the entry of food and medicine without quantity limits or tariffs all along but chose not to do so for more than a year of the pandemic According to Cuban economist Omar Everleny P rez the concessions such as permits for private entrepreneurs to import goods without going through the state and allowing foreign companies to install retail markets or raising the ceiling for agricultural prices in order to increase supply were welcome but more was needed Everleny P rez stated Without affecting the ideology there is a lot of space in which the state can take action Observers such William M LeoGrande stated that there were many difficulties for Cuba with LeoGrande in particular stating I think the government is just trying to signal to people that it understands their desperation and that it s going to try to alleviate some of the misery that they re experiencing The problem is that the government just doesn t have much in the way of resources that it can devote to doing that br br br July br A group of Cuban exiles approached Havana by sea in private floats and launched flare lights and fireworks that were visible from land as a signal of support to the protests creating expectation among Cuban citizens who watched recorded and shared the images through social media The Cuban government immediately militarized the coast of Havana including El Malec n br br br July br The crackdown on the protests was followed by a heavy militarization of the streets and massive detentions According to human rights organizations an estimated of people were held by the government by the end of July According to Cuban government officials all investigations and detentions stemming from the July protests which included looting attacks on police officers and acts of vandalism have been conducted lawfully Independent journalist Maykel Gonzales who witnessed the detention and mistreatment of a group of protesters by civilian dressed police officers told to The New York Times Authorities intent was to punish to do harm br br br August br During a talk in Cuban television s informative Mesa Redonda the prime minister Manuel Marrero said Cienfuegos province is the same as the others with the lack of antigen tests the lack of medicines the same objective problems But there are more complaints of subjective problems than objective When you add up the lack of medicines this that and the other they re lower than the number of complaints and reports of abuse neglect lack of visits That s incredible Marrero s comments were criticized by medical personnel on social media Critics also complained on dealing with outnumbered health centers lacking adequate equipment medicine and sanitation some invited the minister himself to treat the patients personally as physicians do One of the doctors who complained about Cuba s pandemic response had a picture of Patria y Vida on his Facebook profile br br br August br The Cuban press published the enactment of the newly approved Decree Law which considers as crime the divulgation of fake news offensive messages and diffamation against the country s prestige among other complementary laws that introduce new felonies cataloguing cybersecurity crimes and their levels of dangerosity D az Canel wrote via his official Twitter account Our Decree goes against misinformation and the cyber lie sic The announcement caused outrage among Cuban citizens many of which argued that it greatly limits their freedom of expression on the Internet and social media even further Cuban analysts have compared the measure to the totalitarianism of Nineteen Eighty Four br br br November br More protests were to take place with the help of Yunior Garcia a Cuban playwright who has been a leader as of recently in these protests However Garcia was found to have fled the country to Spain in fear of being imprisoned Garcia believes he was not stopped because officials wanted him out of the country There have been mixed reactions to his fleeing and some commentators said they feel betrayed that he had left br br br Arrests and prosecutions br The Cuban government responded to the demonstrations with a crackdown making hundreds of arrests and charging at least Cubans with crimes including sedition vandalism theft and public disorder Amnesty International criticized the government for making arbitrary arrests en masse noting that the demonstrators were largely peaceful Amnesty wrote that the authorities default approach has been to criminalize nearly all those who participated in the protests including some children Amnesty named six detained Cubans as prisoners of conscience br Human rights groups condemned the trials of demonstrators as lacking fairness Cuba does not have freedom of assembly unauthorized public gatherings are illegal The government acknowledged for the first time that trials had occurred in January when the public prosecutor s office said people had already been tried and convicted Human rights group Justicia J said in January that sentences for demonstrators had ranged from four to years in jail br According to the Miami Herald various young protesters including minors were arrested by Cuban authorities and subjected to summary trials under the accusation of public disorder Cuban lawyer Laritza Diversent told the Miami Herald that summary trials in Cuba have been an express procedure for minor crimes since She added that there is almost no documentation of the whole process making any appeal difficult It is very arbitrary The Miami Herald also quoted a Cuban visual artist researching the protests as saying The fact that they are charging people with public disorder shows they were just peaceful protesters and did not commit any crimes br br br Disappeared persons br According to a report by the Spanish NGO Prisoners Defenders more than persons have disappeared during the protests in Cuba and have not had contact with their relatives and for whom no document on their location exists The alleged missing people include dissident and Patriotic Union of Cuba executive secretary Jos Daniel Ferrer dissident rap singer Luis Manuel Otero and dissident and human rights activist Guillermo Fari as The report mentioned journalist Camila Acosta who was covering the protests for the Spanish newspaper ABC however she was put under house arrest and published a report on the July describing her experiences The San Isidro Movement stated that Ferrer was moved to a high security prison same as Otero The UN Working Group against Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances has forwarded a request to the Permanent Representative of Cuba to the United Nations to take action regarding the disappearances br br br Analysis br Writing for the Associated Press at the height of the protests on July Andrea Rodr guez summarized that many protesters expressed anger over long lines and shortages of food and medicines as well as repeated electricity outages Some demanded a faster pace of vaccination against COVID But there were also calls for political change in a country governed by the Communist Party for some six decades Cuban authorities have stated that the United States government and its alleged enemies were organizing the protests through social networks such as Twitter and blamed most of the hardships on United States sanctions which are believed to have costed at least billion in the estimate is disputed by Cuba s critics who also blame the government s failure to reform the state run economy Cuba s tourism industry which is an important source of income has been wrecked by the COVID pandemic in Cuba while foreign aid from allies such as Venezuela declined as a result of the crisis in Venezuela which was further exacerbated by the pandemic in the country Cuban officials appeared on state television to analyze the events and Cuban leader Miguel D az Canel went to talk to citizens br Al Jazeera mentioned frustration with rising prices falling wages the United States embargo and the failings of the island s long standing communist government to address its economic challenges The Associated Press the BBC the Financial Times The Guardian The New York Times and Reuters also mentioned the United States embargo against Cuba and the impact that Donald Trump s tighter sanctions had on Cuba which the BBC described as having hit hard on Cuba According to The New York Times the embargo cuts off its access to financing and imports while remittances to Cuba are believed to be around billion to billion annually representing its third biggest source of dollars after the services industry and tourism and the United States may ease ban on remittances as part of Cuba review according to Reuters Sanctions exacerbated the economic crisis alongside inefficiencies and Soviet style one party rule which Reuters attributed to its detractors the COVID pandemic and the collapse of tourism and choked the economy in the Financial Times s words According to The Guardian sanctions and the COVID pandemic led to food shortages and high prices sparking one of the biggest such demonstrations in memory which were also caused by social media and a younger generation hungry for higher living standards br As reported by Reuters on August the anti government protests were expected to damage the Cuban struggling economy but could speed up economic reforms as relations with the United States deteriorated further when United States president Joseph Biden branded Cuba a failed state and sanctioned their military and police forces ending hopes of a return to the era of detente that begun under former president Barack Obama according to experts the protests may quicken the pace of reform such as several tweaks to the state dominated and centralized economy and long awaited regulations giving legal status to existing and future small and medium sized businesses Omar Everleny a Cuban economist and former University of Havana professor stated The negative result of the protests on July is that hopes the Biden administration would lift at least the Trump era sanctions were dashed The positive is that it signals we have to do what we have to do in terms of improving the economy without waiting for the United States Foreign executives expressed their worry that the anti government protests which tarnished the image of Cuba as a stable country would make it even more difficult to work with Cuba whose import dependent economy already under a nearly six decade U S trade embargo has been squeezed further by sanctions imposed by former U S President Donald Trump s administration and has been almost totally excluded from the international financial system by sanctions imposed by the United States according to Marc Frank br By August observers saw the protests as being mainly caused by the global COVID pandemic and compared them to other protests over responses to the COVID pandemic in the Caribbean and Latin America The Guardian stated that some protesters were marching against systems of different stripes Jair Bolsonaro s far right administration in Brazil and the communist dictatorship of Cuba But both were expressions of what many suspect is a new wave of Covid fuelled social and political turbulence that is starting to sweep the region in response to the ravages of a pandemic that has officially killed nearly million people in Latin America and the Caribbean br br br Misinformation br br The Cuban government promoted conspiracy theories blaming western countries including the United States of being responsible for the protests without evidence This misinformation was used by the government to demonize protesters during the government s crackdown as justification by the Cuban president for force to be used by government supporters against demonstrators and excessive prison sentences for protesters br Some media activist groups and pro regime conspiracy websites such as the Grayzone echoed the Cuban government s conspiracy theories during its violent response to the protests Stories were published amplifying the Cuban state media narrative blaming the US and downplaying support for the opposition in Cuba and the size of the protests These proved to be false News organizations such as CNN confirmed the scope of the demonstrations calling them the biggest since the revolution Thus providing evidence debunking the claim that the protests did not have much support in Cuba and that it was mostly overseas The Cuban government suppressed photographers and journalists reporting on the event and shut off the internet making it impossible for pictures and videos of the protests and violence against protesters to be shared on social media Limiting pictures and videos of the demonstrations that were being disputed by media sympathetic to the Cuban government br PolitiFact published an article stating that amid news surrounding protests in Cuba a widely shared Facebook post asserts U S sanctions on Cuba restrict the country from trading with other countries too PolitiFact determined the post was False on its Truth O Meter In their determination PolitiFact stated that experts and evidence shows that Cuba can and has traded with other countries While the nuances in the U S embargo can make it difficult for foreign companies to trade with Cuba there is no evidence that they can t br USA Today additionally rated the post as False In summation USA Today added that the claim that the U S blockade of Cuba means the island nation can t trade with any country or company is FALSE based on our research The embargo prevents most American companies from doing business with Cuba and vice versa Although the embargo creates disincentives for other countries and companies to trade with Cuba it does not compel them to cut economic ties with the island nation Many countries as well as some American companies do business in Cuba br Media outlets such as El Pa s the Financial Times Fox News La Naci n The New York Times RTVE La Sexta Voice of America and The Washington Times published photos of a pro government protest which they erroneously captioned as a photo as an anti government one CNN published an image of a Miami demonstration in a story about demonstrations in Cuba while only The Guardian amended a July article because the original caption on the image of people on the M ximo G mez monument described them as anti government protesters when they were in fact protesters in support of the government As reported by The Express Tribune journalists Ben Norton and Alan MacLeod were among the first to note the error and MacLeod suggested they may have simply copied and pasted the Associated Press s original photo caption replicating the error across multiple news outlets br Cuban political scientist Harold Cardenas stated that it would be a simplification to say it s a US campaign because there are obviously many other reasons behind the protests I know communists that were detained the other day for taking part in protests That s not to say that the United States has no responsibility in the unrest through its sanctions that intentionally asphyxiate the Cuban people Cardenas added that social networks have been used to create parallel realities specifically mentioning misinformation and fake images which were widely shared in the country during the anti government protests and t here has been an effort from abroad to create uncertainty in the country but criticized the Cuban government for attributing an exaggerated importance to Twitter as people were genuinely fed up and economically exhausted Macias Tovar agreed with Cardenas views stating Beyond this being a campaign orchestrated from abroad there are people who are mobilizing people who are demonstrating against the government people who have petitions what the Cuban government must do is respect the right to protest br br br Reactions br br br Cubans and Cuban Americans br The Cuban government mainly blamed the unrest on the United States and the embargo whose sanctions have restricted trade with Cuba since and were tightened under former US President Donald Trump in as stated by the BBC Cuban officials stated that online propaganda coupled with scarcity created by sanctions amounted to a destabilisation campaign and Carlos Fernandez de Cossio head of United States affairs at the Cuban foreign ministry stated that the internet is now being used as part of warfare against Cuba the government also acknowledged faults on its part br On July the BBC reported that on the government news website Cubadebate several readers laid the blame for the crisis on US sanctions which have contributed to the island s dire economic situation and shortages One reader said The only help that Cuba needs to ask for is for them the US to take away the blockade sanctions Another reader was quoted as saying I just want to point out that the indiscipline and the lack of responsibility and oversight is not the fault of the blockade or the Yankees It is ours alone Some Cuban Americans expressed their belief that shortages does not explain protests and that they were mainly about freedom As reported by NBC News while conservatives and Republicans are known for a more hard line stance against Cuba some progressives have been denouncing the Cuban government s tough stance against activists calls for greater freedom of expression In a Cuban dissident uncovered Operation Truth a secret state program described by the dissident as enlisting students to attack those criticizing the government online
