Uganda officially the Republic of Uganda is a landlocked country in East Africa It is bordered to the east by Kenya to the north by South Sudan to the west by the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the south west by Rwanda and to the south by Tanzania The southern part includes a substantial portion of Lake Victoria shared with Kenya and Tanzania Uganda is in the African Great Lakes region it lies within the Nile basin and has a varied equatorial climate As of it had a population of around million of which million live in the capital and largest city Kampala br Uganda is named after the Buganda kingdom which encompasses a large portion of the south including Kampala and whose language Luganda is widely spoken the official language is English The region was populated by various ethnic groups before Bantu and Nilotic groups arrived around years ago These groups established influential kingdoms such as the Empire of Kitara The arrival of Arab traders in the s and British explorers in the late th century marked the beginning of foreign influence The British established the Protectorate of Uganda in incorporating various kingdoms and setting the stage for future political dynamics Uganda gained independence in with Milton Obote as the first prime minister The Mengo Crisis marked a significant conflict with the Buganda kingdom Idi Amin s military coup in led to a brutal regime characterized by mass killings and economic decline until his overthrow in br Yoweri Museveni s National Resistance Movement NRM took power in after a six year guerrilla war This brought stability and growth but authoritarian practices and human rights abuses The abolition of presidential term limits allegations of electoral fraud and repression have raised concerns about Uganda s democratic future Museveni was elected president in the and general elections Human rights issues corruption and regional conflicts such as involvement in the Congo Wars and the struggle against the Lord s Resistance Army LRA continue to challenge Uganda Despite this it has made progress in education and health improving literacy and reducing HIV infection though challenges in maternal health and gender inequality persist The country s future depends on addressing governance and human rights while leveraging its natural and human resources for sustainable development br Geographically Uganda is diverse with volcanic hills mountains and lakes including Lake Victoria the world s second largest freshwater lake The country has significant natural resources including fertile agricultural land and untapped oil reserves contributing to its economic development The service sector dominates the economy surpassing agriculture Uganda s rich biodiversity with national parks and wildlife reserves attracts tourism a vital sector for the economy Uganda is a member of the United Nations the African Union G the East African Community and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation br br br History br br br Precolonial Uganda br br Much of Uganda was inhabited by Central sudanic and Kuliak speaking farmers and herders until years ago when Bantu speakers arrived in the south and Nilotic speakers arrived in the northeast By AD they had all been assimilated into Bantu speaking cultures south of Mount Elgon the Nile River and Lake Kyoga br According to oral tradition and archeological studies the Empire of Kitara covered an important part of the Great Lakes Area from the northern lakes Albert and Kyoga to the southern lakes Victoria and Tanganyika Kitara is claimed as the antecedent of the Tooro Ankole and Busoga kingdoms br Some Luo invaded Kitara and assimilated with the Bantu society there establishing the Biito dynasty of the current Omukama ruler of Bunyoro Kitara br Arab traders moved into the land from the Indian Ocean coast of East Africa in the s for trade and commerce In the late s Bunyoro in Mid Western Uganda found itself threatened from the north by Egyptian sponsored agents Unlike the Arab traders from the East African coast who sought trade these agents were promoting foreign conquest In Khedive Ismail Pasha of Egypt seeking to annex the territories north of the borders of Lake Victoria and east of Lake Albert and south of Gondokoro sent a British explorer Samuel Baker on a military expedition to the frontiers of Northern Uganda with the objective of suppressing the slave trade there and opening the way to commerce and civilization The Banyoro resisted Baker who had to fight a desperate battle to secure his retreat Baker regarded the resistance as an act of treachery and he denounced the Banyoro in a book Ismailia A Narrative Of The Expedition To Central Africa For The Suppression Of Slave Trade Organised By Ismail Khadive Of Egypt that was widely read in Britain Later the British arrived in Uganda with a predisposition against the kingdom of Bunyoro and sided with the kingdom of Buganda This would eventually cost Bunyoro half of its territory which was given to Buganda as a reward from the British Two of the numerous lost counties were restored to Bunyoro after independence br In the s while Arabs sought influence from the north British explorers searching for the source of the Nile arrived in Uganda They were followed by British Anglican missionaries who arrived in the kingdom of Buganda in and French Catholic missionaries in This situation gave rise to the death of the Uganda Martyrs in after the conversion of Muteesa I and much of his court and the succession of his anti Christian son Mwanga br The British government chartered the Imperial British East Africa Company IBEAC to negotiate trade agreements in the region beginning in br From there was a series of religious wars in Buganda initially between Muslims and Christians and then from between ba Ingleza Protestants and ba Fransa Catholics factions named after the imperial powers with which they were aligned Because of civil unrest and financial burdens IBEAC claimed that it was unable to maintain their occupation in the region British commercial interests were ardent to protect the trade route of the Nile which prompted the British government to annex Buganda and adjoining territories to create the Uganda Protectorate in br br br Uganda Protectorate br br The Protectorate of Uganda was a protectorate of the British Empire from to In the Imperial British East Africa Company transferred its administration rights of territory consisting mainly of the Kingdom of Buganda to the British government The IBEAC relinquished its control over Uganda after Ugandan internal religious wars had driven it into bankruptcy br In the Uganda Protectorate was established and the territory was extended beyond the borders of Buganda by signing more treaties with the other kingdoms Toro in Ankole in and Bunyoro in to an area that roughly corresponds to that of present day Uganda br The status of Protectorate had significantly different consequences for Uganda than had the region been made a colony like neighboring Kenya insofar as Uganda retained a degree of self government that would have otherwise been limited under a full colonial administration br In the s labourers from British India were recruited to East Africa under indentured labour contracts to construct the Uganda Railway Most of the surviving Indians returned home but decided to remain in East Africa after the line s completion Subsequently some became traders and took control of cotton ginning and sartorial retail br From to a sleeping sickness epidemic in the southern part of Uganda along the north shores of Lake Victoria killed more than people br World War II encouraged the colonial administration of Uganda to recruit soldiers to serve in the King s African Rifles They were seen in action in the Western Desert campaign the Abyssinian campaign the Battle of Madagascar and the Burma campaign br br br Independence to br Uganda gained independence from the UK on October with Queen Elizabeth II as head of state and Queen of Uganda In October Uganda became a republic but maintained its membership in the Commonwealth of Nations br The first post independence election held in was won by an alliance between the Uganda People s Congress UPC and Kabaka Yekka KY UPC and KY formed the first post independence government with Milton Obote as executive prime minister with the Buganda Kabaka King Edward Muteesa II holding the largely ceremonial position of president br br br Buganda crisis br br Uganda s immediate post independence years were dominated by the relationship between the central government and the largest regional kingdom Buganda br From the moment the British created the Uganda protectorate the issue of how to manage the largest monarchy within the framework of a unitary state had always been a problem Colonial governors had failed to come up with a formula that worked This was further complicated by Buganda s nonchalant attitude to its relationship with the central government Buganda never sought independence but rather appeared to be comfortable with a loose arrangement that guaranteed them privileges above the other subjects within the protectorate or a special status when the British left This was evidenced in part by hostilities between the British colonial authorities and Buganda prior to independence br Within Buganda there were divisions between those who wanted the Kabaka to remain a dominant monarch and those who wanted to join with the rest of Uganda to create a modern secular state The split resulted in the creation of two dominant Buganda based parties the Kabaka Yekka Kabaka Only KY and the Democratic Party DP that had roots in the Catholic Church The bitterness between these two parties was extremely intense especially as the first elections for the post Colonial parliament approached The Kabaka particularly disliked the DP leader Benedicto Kiwanuka br Outside Buganda a soft spoken politician from Northern Uganda Milton Obote had forged an alliance of non Buganda politicians to form the Uganda People s Congress UPC The UPC at its heart was dominated by politicians who wanted to rectify what they saw as the regional inequality that favoured Buganda s special status This drew in substantial support from outside Buganda The party however remained a loose alliance of interests but Obote showed great skill at negotiating them into a common ground based on a federal formula br br At Independence the Buganda question remained unresolved Uganda was one of the few colonial territories that achieved independence without a dominant political party with a clear majority in parliament In the pre Independence elections the UPC ran no candidates in Buganda and won of the directly elected seats outside Buganda The DP won seats outside Buganda The special status granted to Buganda meant that the Buganda seats were elected by proportional representation reflecting the elections to the Buganda parliament the Lukikko KY won a resounding victory over DP winning all seats br The UPC reached a high at the end of when the leader of the DP in parliament Basil Kiiza Bataringaya crossed the parliamentary floor with five other MPs leaving DP with only nine seats The DP MPs were not particularly happy that the hostility of their leader Benedicto Kiwanuka towards the Kabaka was hindering their chances of compromise with KY The trickle of defections turned into a flood when KY members crossed the floor when they realised the formal coalition with the UPC was no longer viable Obote s charismatic speeches across the country were sweeping all before him and the UPC was winning almost every local election held and increasing its control over all district councils and legislatures outside Buganda The response from the Kabaka was mute probably content in his ceremonial role and symbolism in his part of the country However there were also major divisions within his palace that made it difficult for him to act effectively against Obote By the time Uganda had become independent Buganda was a divided house with contending social and political forces There were however problems brewing inside the UPC As its ranks swelled the ethnic religious regional and personal interests began to shake the party The party s apparent strength was eroded in a complex sequence of factional conflicts in its central and regional structures And by the UPC was tearing itself apart The conflicts were further intensified by the newcomers who had crossed the parliamentary floor from DP and KY br The UPC delegates arrived in Gulu in for their delegates conference Here was the first demonstration as to how Obote was losing control of his party The battle over the Secretary General of the party was a bitter contest between the new moderate s candidate Grace Ibingira and the radical John Kakonge Ibingira subsequently became the symbol of the opposition to Obote within the UPC This is an important factor when looking at the subsequent events that led to the crisis between Buganda and the Central government For those outside the UPC including KY supporters this was a sign that Obote was vulnerable Keen observers realised the UPC was not a cohesive unit br The collapse of the UPC KY alliance openly revealed the dissatisfaction Obote and others had about Buganda s special status In the government responded to demands from some parts of the vast Buganda Kingdom that they were not the Kabaka s subjects Prior to colonial rule Buganda had been rivalled by the neighbouring Bunyoro kingdom Buganda had conquered parts of Bunyoro and the British colonialists had formalised this in the Buganda Agreements Known as the lost counties the people in these areas wished to revert to being part of Bunyoro Obote decided to allow a referendum which angered the Kabaka and most of the rest of Buganda The residents of the counties voted to return to Bunyoro despite the Kabaka s attempts to influence the vote Having lost the referendum KY opposed the bill to pass the counties to Bunyoro thus ending the alliance with the UPC br The tribal nature of Ugandan politics was also manifesting itself in government The UPC which had previously been a national party began to break along tribal lines when Ibingira challenged Obote in the UPC The North South ethnic divide that had been evident in economic and social spheres now entrenched itself in politics Obote surrounded himself with mainly northern politicians while Ibingira s supporters who were subsequently arrested and jailed with him were mainly from the South In time the two factions acquired ethnic labels Bantu the mainly Southern Ibingira faction and Nilotic the mainly Northern Obote faction The perception that the government was at war with the Bantu was further enhanced when Obote arrested and imprisoned the mainly Bantu ministers who backed Ibingira br br These labels brought into the mix two very powerful influences First Buganda the people of Buganda are Bantu and therefore naturally aligned to the Ibingira faction The Ibingira faction further advanced this alliance by accusing Obote of wanting to overthrow the Kabaka They were now aligned to opposing Obote Second the security forces the British colonialists had recruited the army and police almost exclusively from Northern Uganda due to their perceived suitability for these roles At independence the army and police was dominated by northern tribes mainly Nilotic They would now feel more affiliated to Obote and he took full advantage of this to consolidate his power In April Obote passed out eight hundred new army recruits at Moroto of whom seventy percent came from the Northern Region br At the time there was a tendency to perceive central government and security forces as dominated by northerners particularly the Acholi who through the UPC had significant access to government positions at national level In northern Uganda there were also varied degrees of anti Buganda feelings particularly over the kingdom s special status before and after independence and all the economic and social benefits that came with this status Obote brought significant numbers of northerners into the central state both through the civil service and military and created a patronage machine in Northern Uganda However both Bantu and Nilotic labels represent significant ambiguities The Bantu category for example includes both Buganda and Bunyoro historically bitter rivals The Nilotic label includes the Lugbara Acholi and Langi all of whom have bitter rivalries that were to define Uganda s military politics later Despite these ambiguities these events unwittingly brought to fore the northerner southerner political divide which to some extent still influences Ugandan politics br The UPC fragmentation continued as opponents sensed Obote s vulnerability At local level where the UPC dominated most councils discontent began to challenge incumbent council leaders Even in Obote s home district attempts were made to oust the head of the local district council in A more worrying fact for the UPC was that the next national elections loomed in and without the support of KY who were now likely to back the DP and the growing factionalism in the UPC there was the real possibility that the UPC would be out of power in months br Obote went after KY with a new act of parliament in early that blocked any attempt by KY to expand outside Buganda KY appeared to respond in parliament through one of their few remaining MPs the terminally ill Daudi Ochieng Ochieng was an irony although from Northern Uganda he had risen high in the ranks of KY and become a close confidant to the Kabaka who had gifted him with large land titles in Buganda In Obote s absence from Parliament Ochieng laid bare the illegal plundering of ivory and gold from the Congo that had been orchestrated by Obote s army chief of staff Colonel Idi Amin He further alleged that Obote Onama and Neykon had all benefited from the scheme Parliament overwhelmingly voted in favour of a motion to censure Amin and investigate Obote s involvement This shook the government and raised tensions in the country br KY further demonstrated its ability to challenge Obote from within his party at the UPC Buganda conference where Godfrey Binaisa the Attorney General was ousted by a faction believed to have the backing of KY Ibingira and other anti Obote elements in Buganda Obote s response was to arrest Ibingira and other ministers at a cabinet meeting and to assume special powers in February In March Obote also announced that the offices of President and vice president would cease to exist effectively dismissing the Kabaka Obote also gave Amin more power giving him the Army Commander position over the previous holder Opolot who had relations to Buganda through marriage possibly believing Opolot would be reluctant to take military action against the Kabaka if it came to that Obote abolished the constitution and effectively suspended elections due in a few months Obote went on television and radio to accuse the Kabaka of various offences including requesting foreign troops which appears to have been explored by the Kabaka following the rumours of Amin plotting a coup Obote further dismantled the authority of the Kabaka by announcing among other measures br br The abolition of independent public service commissions for federal units This removed the Kabaka s authority to appoint civil servants in Buganda br The abolition of the Buganda High Court removing any judicial authority the Kabaka had br The bringing of Buganda financial management under further central control br Abolition of lands for Buganda chiefs Land is one of the key sources of Kabaka s power over his subjects br The lines were now drawn for a show down between Buganda and the Central government Historians may argue about whether this could have been avoided through compromise This was unlikely as Obote now felt emboldened and saw the Kabaka as weak Indeed by accepting the presidency four years earlier and siding with the UPC the Kabaka had divided his people and taken the side of one against the other Within Buganda s political institutions rivalries driven by religion and personal ambition made the institutions ineffective and unable to respond to the central government moves The Kabaka was often regarded as aloof and unresponsive to advice from the younger Buganda politicians who better understood the new post Independence politics unlike the traditionalists who were ambivalent to what was going on as long as their traditional benefits were maintained The Kabaka favoured the neo traditionalists br In May the Kabaka made his move He asked for foreign help and the Buganda parliament demanded that the Uganda government leave Buganda including the capital Kampala In response Obote ordered Idi Amin to attack the Kabaka s palace The battle for the Kabaka s palace was fierce the Kabaka s guards putting up more resistance than had been expected The British trained Captain the Kabaka with about armed men kept Idi Amin at bay for twelve hours It is estimated that up to people died in the battle which ended when the army called in heavier guns and overran the palace The anticipated countryside uprising in Buganda did not materialise and a few hours later a beaming Obote met the press to relish his victory The Kabaka escaped over the palace walls and was transported into exile in London by supporters He died there three years later br br br before the coup br In following a power struggle between the Obote led government and King Muteesa Obote suspended the constitution and removed the ceremonial president and vice president In a new constitution proclaimed Uganda a republic and abolished the traditional kingdoms Obote was declared the president br br br after the coup end of Amin regime br br After a military coup on January Obote was deposed from power and General Idi Amin seized control of the country Amin ruled Uganda as dictator with the support of the military for the next eight years He carried out mass killings within the country to maintain his rule An estimated Ugandans died during his regime Aside from his brutalities he forcibly removed the entrepreneurial Indian minority from Uganda In June Palestinian terrorists hijacked an Air France flight and forced it to land at Entebbe airport One hundred of the passengers originally on board were held hostage until an Israeli commando raid rescued them ten days later Amin s reign was ended after the Uganda Tanzania War in in which Tanzanian forces aided by Ugandan exiles invaded Uganda br br br present br br In the Ugandan Bush War broke out resulting in Yoweri Museveni became president since his forces toppled the previous regime in January br Political parties in Uganda were restricted in their activities beginning that year in a measure ostensibly designed to reduce sectarian violence In the non party Movement system instituted by Museveni political parties continued to exist but they could operate only a headquarters office They could not open branches hold rallies or field candidates directly although electoral candidates could belong to political parties A constitutional referendum cancelled this nineteen year ban on multi party politics in July br In Pope John Paul II visited Uganda during his day pastoral trip to urge Ugandans to seek reconciliation During mass celebrations he paid homage to the slain Christian martyrs br In the mid to late s Museveni was lauded by western countries as part of a new generation of African leaders br His presidency has been marred however by invading and occupying the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the Second Congo War resulting in an estimated million deaths since and by participating in other conflicts in the Great Lakes region of Africa He has struggled for years in the civil war against the Lord s Resistance Army which has been guilty of numerous crimes against humanity including child slavery the Atiak massacre and other mass murders Conflict in northern Uganda has killed thousands and displaced millions br Parliament abolished presidential term limits in allegedly because Museveni used public funds to pay US to each member of parliament who supported the measure Presidential elections were held in February Museveni ran against several candidates the most prominent of them being Kizza Besigye br On February the Uganda Electoral Commission declared the incumbent president Yoweri Kaguta Museveni the winning candidate of the elections that were held on February The opposition however were not satisfied with the results condemning them as full of sham and rigging According to the official results Museveni won with percent of the votes This easily topped his nearest challenger Besigye who had been Museveni s physician and told reporters that he and his supporters downrightly snub the outcome as well as the unremitting rule of Museveni or any person he may appoint Besigye added that the rigged elections would definitely lead to an illegitimate leadership and that it is up to Ugandans to critically analyse this The European Union s Election Observation Mission reported on improvements and flaws of the Ugandan electoral process The electoral campaign and polling day were conducted in a peaceful manner However the electoral process was marred by avoidable administrative and logistical failures that led to an unacceptable number of Ugandan citizens being disfranchised br Since August hacktivist group Anonymous has threatened Ugandan officials and hacked official government websites over its anti gay bills Some international donors have threatened to cut financial aid to the country if anti gay bills continue br Indicators of a plan for succession by the president s son Muhoozi Kainerugaba have increased tensions br President Yoweri Museveni has ruled the country since and he was latest re elected in January presidential elections According to official results Museveni won the elections with of the vote while popstar turned politician Bobi Wine had The opposition challenged the result because of allegations of widespread fraud and irregularities Another opposition candidate was year old John Katumba br br br Geography br br Uganda is located in southeast Africa between S and N latitude and between E and E longitude Its geography is very diverse consisting of volcanic hills mountains and lakes The country sits at an average of meters above sea level Both the eastern and western borders of Uganda have mountains The Ruwenzori mountain range contains the highest peak in Uganda which is named Alexandra and measures meters br br br Lakes and rivers br Much of the south of the country is heavily influenced by one of the world s biggest lakes Lake Victoria which contains many islands The most important cities are located in the south near this lake including the capital Kampala and the nearby city of Entebbe Lake Kyoga is in the centre of the country and is surrounded by extensive marshy areas br Although landlocked Uganda contains many large lakes Besides Lakes Victoria and Kyoga there are Lake Albert Lake Edward and the smaller Lake George It lies almost completely within the Nile basin The Victoria Nile drains from Lake Victoria into Lake Kyoga and thence into Lake Albert on the Congolese border It then runs northwards into South Sudan An area in eastern Uganda is drained by the Suam River part of the internal drainage basin of Lake Turkana The extreme north eastern part of Uganda drains into the Lotikipi Basin which is primarily in Kenya br br br Biodiversity and conservation br br Uganda has protected areas including ten national parks Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and Rwenzori Mountains National Park both UNESCO World Heritage Sites Kibale National Park Kidepo Valley National Park Lake Mburo National Park Mgahinga Gorilla National Park Mount Elgon National Park Murchison Falls National Park Queen Elizabeth National Park and Semuliki National Park br Uganda is home to a vast number of species including a population of mountain gorillas in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park gorillas and golden monkeys in the Mgahinga Gorilla National Park and hippos in the Murchison Falls National Park br Jackfruit can also be found throughout the country br The country had a Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of ranking it th globally out of countries br br br Government and politics br The President of Uganda is both head of state and head of government The president appoints a vice president and a prime minister to aid him in governing br The parliament is formed by the National Assembly which has members These include constituency representatives district woman representatives representatives of the Uganda Peoples Defense Forces representatives of the youth representatives of workers representatives of persons with disabilities and ex officio members br br br Foreign relations br Uganda is a member of the East African Community EAC along with Kenya Tanzania Rwanda Burundi and South Sudan According to the East African Common Market Protocol of the free trade and free movement of people is guaranteed including the right to reside in another member country for purposes of employment This protocol however has not been implemented because of work permit and other bureaucratic legal and financial obstacles Uganda is a founding member of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development IGAD an eight country bloc including governments from the Horn of Africa Nile Valley and the African Great Lakes Its headquarters are in Djibouti City Uganda is also a member of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation br br br Military br br In Uganda the Uganda People s Defence Force serves as the military The number of military personnel in Uganda is estimated at soldiers on active duty The Uganda army is involved in several peacekeeping and combat missions in the region with commentators noting that only the United States Armed Forces is deployed in more countries Uganda has soldiers deployed in the northern and eastern areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in the Central African Republic Somalia and South Sudan br br br Corruption br br Transparency International has rated Uganda s public sector as one of the most corrupt in the world In Uganda ranked st best out of and had a score of on a scale from perceived as most corrupt to perceived as clean br The World Bank s Worldwide Governance Indicators ranked Uganda in the worst percentile of all countries According to the United States Department of State s Human Rights Report on Uganda The World Bank s most recent Worldwide Governance Indicators reflected corruption was a severe problem and that the country annually loses billion shillings million to corruption br Ugandan parliamentarians in earned times what was earned by most state employees and they sought a major increase This caused widespread criticism and protests including the smuggling of two piglets into the parliament in June to highlight corruption amongst members of parliament The protesters who were arrested used the word MPigs to highlight their grievance br A specific scandal which had significant international consequences and highlighted the presence of corruption in high level government offices was the embezzlement of million of donor funds from the Office of the Prime Minister in These funds were earmarked as crucial support for rebuilding northern Uganda ravaged by a year war and Karamoja Uganda s poorest region This scandal prompted the EU the United Kingdom Germany Denmark Ireland and Norway to suspend aid br Widespread grand and petty corruption involving public officials and political patronage systems have also seriously affected the investment climate in Uganda One of the high corruption risk areas is the public procurement in which non transparent under the table cash payments are often demanded from procurement officers br What may ultimately compound this problem is the availability of oil The Petroleum Bill passed by parliament in and touted by the NRM as bringing transparency to the oil sector has failed to please domestic and international political commentators and economists For instance Angelo Izama a Ugandan energy analyst at the US based Open Society Foundation said the new law was tantamount to handing over an ATM cash machine to Museveni and his regime According to Global Witness in a non governmental organisation devoted to international law Uganda now has oil reserves that have the potential to double the government s revenue within six to ten years worth an estimated US billion per year br The Non Governmental Organizations Amendment Act passed in has stifled the productivity of NGOs through erecting barriers to entry activity funding and assembly within the sector Burdensome and corrupt registration procedures i e requiring recommendations from government officials annual re registration unreasonable regulation of operations i e requiring government notification prior to making contact with individuals in NGO s area of interest and the precondition that all foreign funds be passed through the Bank of Uganda among other things are severely limiting the output of the NGO sector Furthermore the sector s freedom of speech has been continually infringed upon through the use of intimidation and the recent Public Order Management Bill severely limiting freedom of assembly will only add to the government s stockpile of ammunition br br br Human rights br br There are many areas which continue to attract concern when it comes to human rights in Uganda br Conflict in the northern parts of the country continues to generate reports of abuses by both the rebel Lord s Resistance Army LRA led by Joseph Kony and the Ugandan Army A UN official accused the LRA in February of appalling brutality in the Democratic Republic of Congo br The number of internally displaced persons is estimated at million Torture continues to be a widespread practice amongst security organisations Attacks on political freedom in the country including the arrest and beating of opposition members of parliament have led to international criticism culminating in May in a decision by the British government to withhold part of its aid to the country The arrest of the main opposition leader Kizza Besigye and the siege of the High Court during a hearing of Besigye s case by heavily armed security forces before the February elections led to condemnation br Child labour is common in Uganda Many child workers are active in agriculture Children who work on tobacco farms in Uganda are exposed to health hazards Child domestic servants in Uganda risk sexual abuse Trafficking of children occurs Slavery and forced labour are prohibited by the Ugandan constitution br The US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants reported several violations of refugee rights in including forcible deportations by the Ugandan government and violence directed against refugees br Torture and extrajudicial killings have been a pervasive problem in Uganda in recent years For instance according to a US State Department report the African Center for Treatment and Rehabilitation for Torture Victims registered allegations of torture against police against the UPDF against military police against the Special Investigations Unit against unspecified security personnel and against prison officials between January and September br In September Museveni refused Kabaka Muwenda Mutebi the Baganda king permission to visit some areas of Buganda Kingdom particularly the Kayunga district Riots occurred and over people were killed while others still remain imprisoned Furthermore more people were killed during the April Walk to Work demonstrations According to the Humans Rights Watch World Report on Uganda the government has failed to investigate the killings associated with both of these events br br br LGBT rights br br In a newspaper the Red Pepper published a list of allegedly gay men many of whom suffered harassment as a result br On October the Ugandan newspaper Rolling Stone published a front page article titled Pictures of Uganda s Top Homos Leak that listed the names addresses and photographs of homosexuals alongside a yellow banner that read Hang Them The paper also alleged homosexual recruitment of Ugandan children The publication attracted international attention and criticism from human rights organisations such as Amnesty International No Peace Without Justice and the International Lesbian Gay Bisexual Trans and Intersex Association According to gay rights activists many Ugandans have been attacked since the publication On January gay rights activist David Kato was murdered br In the Ugandan parliament considered an Anti Homosexuality Bill which would have broadened the criminalisation of homosexuality by introducing the death penalty for people who have previous convictions or are HIV positive and engage in same sex sexual acts The bill included provisions for Ugandans who engage in same sex sexual relations outside of Uganda asserting that they may be extradited back to Uganda for punishment and included penalties for individuals companies media organisations or non governmental organizations that support legal protection for homosexuality or sodomy On October MP David Bahati submitted the private member s bill and was believed to have had widespread support in the Uganda parliament The hacktivist group Anonymous hacked into Ugandan government websites in protest of the bill In response to global condemnation the debate of the bill was delayed but it was eventually passed on December and President Museveni signed it on February The death penalty was dropped in the final legislation The law was widely condemned by the international community Denmark the Netherlands and Sweden said they would withhold aid On February the World Bank said it would postpone a US million loan while the United States said it was reviewing ties with Uganda On August the Constitutional Court of Uganda ruled the bill invalid as it was not passed with the required quorum A August news report said that the Ugandan attorney general had dropped all plans to appeal per a directive from President Museveni who was concerned about foreign reaction to the bill and who also said that any newly introduced bill should not criminalise same sex relationships between consenting adults As of progress on the African continent was slow but progressing with South Africa being the only country where same sex marriages are recognised br br br Anti Homosexuality Act br br On March the Ugandan parliament passed a bill that would make identifying as homosexual punishable by life in prison and the death penalty for anyone found guilty of aggravated homosexuality br br On March Asuman Basalirwa a member of parliament since from the opposition representing Bugiri Municipality on Justice Forum party ticket tabled a proposed law which seeks out to castigate gay sex and the promotion or recognition of such relations and he made remarks that In this country or in this world we talk about human rights But it is also true that there are human wrongs I want to submit that homosexuality is a human wrong that offends the laws of Uganda and threatens the sanctity of the family the safety of our children and the continuation of humanity through reproduction The speaker of parliament Annet Anita Among referred the bill to a house committee for scrutiny the first step in an accelerated process to pass the proposal into law The parliament speaker had earlier noted that We want to appreciate our promoters of homosexuality for the social economic development they have brought to the country in reference to western countries and donors But we do not appreciate the fact that they are killing morals We do not need their money we need our culture during a prayer service held in parliament and attended by several religious leaders The Speaker vowed to pass the bill into law at whatever cost to shield Uganda s culture and its sovereignty br On March parliament rapidly passed the anti homosexuality bill with overwhelming support br The United States strongly condemned the bill During a White House Press briefing on March Karine Jean Pierre stated Human rights are universal No one should be attacked imprisoned or killed simply because of who they are or whom they love In the following days further criticism came from the United Kingdom Canada Germany and the European Union br br br Administrative divisions br br As of Uganda is divided into four Regions of Uganda and districts Rural areas of districts are subdivided into sub counties parishes and villages Municipal and town councils are designated in urban areas of districts br Political subdivisions in Uganda are officially served and united by the Uganda Local Governments Association ULGA a voluntary and non profit body which also serves as a forum for support and guidance for Ugandan sub national governments br Parallel with the state administration five traditional Bantu kingdoms have remained enjoying some degrees of mainly cultural autonomy The kingdoms are Toro Busoga Bunyoro Buganda and Rwenzururu Furthermore some groups attempt to restore Ankole as one of the officially recognised traditional kingdoms to no avail yet Several other kingdoms and chiefdoms are officially recognised by the government including the union of Alur chiefdoms the Iteso paramount chieftaincy the paramount chieftaincy of Lango and the Padhola state br br br Economy and infrastructure br br The Bank of Uganda is the central bank of Uganda and handles monetary policy along with the printing of the Ugandan

compares to percent real growth in fiscal year vii br The country has largely untapped reserves of both crude oil and natural gas While agriculture accounted for percent of the economy in with coffee as its main export it has now been surpassed by the services sector which accounted for percent of GDP in In the s the British colonial regime encouraged some subsistence farmers to join co operatives Since the government with the support of foreign countries and international agencies has acted to rehabilitate an economy devastated during the regime of Idi Amin and the subsequent civil war br In the World Bank still listed Uganda on the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries list br Economic growth has not always led to poverty reduction Despite an average annual growth of percent between and poverty levels increased by percent during that time This has highlighted the importance of avoiding jobless growth and is part of the rising awareness in development circles of the need for equitable growth not just in Uganda but across the developing world br br With the Uganda securities exchanges established in several equities have been listed The government has used the stock market as an

of the planned East African Federation br Uganda has a large diaspora residing mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom This diaspora has contributed enormously to Uganda s economic growth

small scale entrepreneurial activities such as rearing and selling local breeds of animals Nonetheless because of their heavy workload they have little time for these income generating activities The poor cannot support their children at school and in most cases girls drop out of school to help out in domestic work or to get married Other girls engage in sex work As a result young women tend to have older and more sexually experienced partners and this puts women at a disproportionate risk of getting affected by HIV accounting for about per cent of all adults living with HIV in Uganda br

of private sector investment presents a unique opportunity to deliver on Power Africa goals Uganda is one of the few sub Saharan African countries to have liberalized and financially viable energy markets with generation transmission and supply segments unbundled since There is an independent Electricity Regulatory Authority that undertakes sector regulation and oversight The largest distribution company UMEME is privately owned and has a year concession for distribution and retail The country however is divided into rural service territories and of these are being managed by small distribution companies Independent power producers IPPs currently account for nearly of generation capacity Issues with integrated planning and the financial ecosystem persist br br br Water

from the poorest percent of the population This policy has been cited as a key factor in helping Uganda achieve its Millennium Development Goals and as an example of the importance of equity in achieving those goals Despite this policy many users are denied care if they do not provide their own medical equipment as happened in the highly publicised case of Jennifer Anguko Poor communication within hospitals low satisfaction with health services and distance to health service providers undermine the provision of quality health care to people living in Uganda and particularly for those in poor and elderly headed households The provision of subsidies for poor and rural populations along with the extension of public private partnerships have been identified as important provisions to

constitution was amended in Although Swahili has not been favoured by the Bantu speaking populations of the south and south west of the country it is an important lingua franca in the northern regions It is also widely used in the police and military forces which may be a historical result of the disproportionate recruitment of northerners into the security forces during the colonial period The
