title: Digital Markets Act
id: 66230371
The Digital Markets Act DMA is an EU regulation that aims to make the digital economy fairer and more contestable The regulation entered into force on November and became applicable for the most part on May br The DMA aims at ensuring a higher degree of competition in European digital markets by preventing large companies from abusing their market power and by allowing new players to enter the market This regulation targets the largest digital platforms operating in the European Union They are also known as gatekeepers due to the durable market position in some digital sectors and because they also meet certain criteria related to the number of users their turnovers or capitalisation Twenty two services across six companies deemed gatekeepers Alphabet Amazon Apple ByteDance Meta and Microsoft were identified as core platform services by the EU in September br These companies had until March to comply with all of the Act s provisions br The list of obligations includes prohibitions on combining data collected from two different services belonging to the same company e g in the case of Meta its social network Facebook and its communication platform WhatsApp provisions for the protection of platforms business users including advertisers and publishers legal instruments against the self preferencing methods used by platforms for promoting their own products e g preferential results for Google s products or services when using Google Search provisions concerning the pre installation of some services e g Android provisions related to bundling practices and provisions for ensuring interoperability portability and access to data for businesses and end users of platforms Non compliance may lead to sanctions including fines of up to of the worldwide turnover br According to the European Commission the main objective of this regulation is to regulate the behaviour of the so called Big Tech firms within the European Single Market and beyond The Commission aims to guarantee a fair level of competition level playing field on the highly concentrated digital European markets which are often characterised by a winner takes all configuration br The DMA covers eight different sectors which it refers to as Core Platforms Services CPS Due to the presence of gatekeepers who to a certain degree affect the market contestability the CPS are considered problematic by the European Commission br br online search engines e g Google Search br online intermediation services e g Google Play Store Apple s App Store br social networks e g Facebook br video sharing platforms e g YouTube br communication platforms e g WhatsApp Gmail br advertising services e g Google Ads br operating systems e g Android iOS br cloud services e g Amazon Web Services br In April Reuters reported on data from six companies which showed that in the first month after the regulations were implemented independent browsers had seen a spike in users The Cyprus based Aloha Browser said users in the EU jumped in March Norway based Vivaldi Germany based Ecosia and United States based Brave have also seen user numbers rise following the new regulation br br br Background br br br EU Competition policy rules br The present rules applied within the European Union with regard to digital markets are derived from European and national legislation Under these circumstances the basis for competition rules in the EU is established by Articles and of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union TFEU Article addresses anti competitive agreements and concerted practices that may affect trade between members states or reduce competition in the common market Article aims to tackle the abuse of dominant positions All players operating in the common market are therefore subject to these provisions European and national authorities have identified the need to strengthen the current legislation given the structural problems that are not covered br br br Digital policy in the EU br The Digital Markets Act is in line with the legislative developments undertaken by the Juncker Commission between and br One of the most important pieces of EU digital legislation is represented by the EU copyright rules This has led to the protection payment and recognition of workers in thirty three sectors and it aims to reward creativity stimulate investment in the creative sector Another relevant achievement can be considered the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR in This regulation sets out the new European framework for the use and circulation of personal data and has a significant impact on the major digital players In addition the regulation on platform to business trading practices P B has been established to create a fair transparent and predictable business environment for smaller businesses and traders on online platforms This regulation has applied in July and prevents market distortion encourages healthy competition and prohibits unfair practices br br br Legislative procedure br The Digital Markets Act proposal was submitted by the European Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council of the European Union on December Along with the Digital Services Act DSA the DMA is part of the Commission s European Digital Strategy entitled Shaping Europe s Digital Future The proposals were presented by the Executive Vice President of the European Commission for A Europe Fit for the Digital Age Margrethe Vestager and by the European Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton as members of the Von der Leyen Commission br On November the Parliament s Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection IMCO adopted its position on the DMA proposal and the text was adopted in plenary session of the European Parliament on December The approved text became the Parliament s mandate for negotiations with the Council which started under the French presidency of the Council in the first half of On November the Council agreed its negotiating position providing the Presidency with a mandate for the discussions br On March the Parliament and the Council meeting in the trilogue format together with the Commission reached a political agreement on the DMA The negotiators reached a consensus on the interoperability provisions for large messaging platforms the said obligations will make it possible for users to communicate between different platforms giving them more choice against the increasing dominance of certain companies The choice is expanded also through provisions that guarantee users free choice as regards browsers virtual assistants or search engines while no interoperability obligation for social networks has been decided upon yet In the political agreement platforms with a market capitalization of billion or turnover in the European Economic Area equal to or above billion have been included in the rules scope An agreement was reached for penalties which will be amounting from of annual worldwide turnover due to non compliance for first infringements up to in the case of repeated infringements The text of the DMA provisionally agreed in March was made publicly available by the European institutions only on May br The DMA was formally adopted by the Parliament on July and by the Council on July and it was signed into law on September by Presidents of the Parliament and the Council which concluded the legislative procedure The adopted text was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on October setting it to come into force twenty days after the publication on November br The May months later the regulation started applying and the potential gatekeepers had months to report to the commission to be identified as gatekeepers This process would take up to days and after being identified as gatekeepers they would have months to come into compliance at the latest the March From March gatekeepers must comply with the DMA br br br Objective br The DMA specifically targets Big Tech companies br The DMA proposed to classify certain platforms according to their number of users capitalisation market power or turnover probably including Apple Google Facebook and Amazon as Gatekeepers making them subject to new obligations br br It aims at preventing large companies from abusing their market power and to allow smaller and new players to enter the market br br br Rationale br In December the European Commission released a legislative proposal that intends to protect consumer welfare and to restore a level playing field in the European Union s digital market At the moment the economy is being driven to a large extent by the activities conducted through online platforms A small number of online platforms have come to play a crucial role in the lives of millions of individuals and companies They intermediate a significant portion of transactions between consumers and businesses leading to extreme dependencies of many businesses on these important platforms br In the table below it can be observed that EU digital markets face a high level of concentration with companies such as Google or Facebook controlling almost the entirety of a specific market segment br br The term gatekeeper refers to the ability of intermediary platforms to act as the main bottleneck to a large number of market participants that are not reachable elsewhere Behind this development are market forces that encompass important economies of scale on the supply side strong direct and indirect network effects on the demand side data driven competitive advantage high rate of innovation and development of conglomerates that structure entire ecosystems In addition the combination of these elements can lead to market dynamics that follow the winner takes most scenarios br During the last years serious concerns have been expressed by authorities across the world with regard to the economic power of some digital giants In Europe the European Commission backed by years of enforcement experience in EU competition law has pointed out that a part of those intermediary platforms may be considered Gatekeeper or structuring platforms in their respective market segments Moreover it has also expressed the concern that Big Tech companies might unlawfully take advantage of their market and bargaining powers in order to lock in dominant positions i e in the existing markets to increase their level of influence and to obtain leading positions in new sectors of activity Hence this can be interpreted as providing unfair advantages to the incumbents present in core and ancillary services as distorting the competition and as harming the consumers in the long run through either increased prices or reduced options Under EU competition law reaching a dominant position is by no mean considered illegal nor is the idea of a winner takes most scenario However practices that lock in dominant positions or that impose unfair conditions terms to third parties might be treated as unlawful br br br The DMA rules br br br General framework br The Digital Markets Act sets up a list of conducts that should be outlawed on the one hand and obligations that platforms identified as gatekeepers should respect on the other hand The list is divided in two different parts the general blacklisted actions Article and the case by case assessment that needs to be specified Article br br br Criteria defining Gatekeepers br The DMA combines quantitative and qualitative criteria in the process of designating gatekeepers There are three criteria in the legislation br br Criteria relating to the size of the companies a a turnover of the company of at least billion euro in the European Economic Area for three years at least or b a market capitalization or equivalent of at least billion euro br Criteria relating to the place of the company in controlling access of other businesses to final customers the company needs to have a more than million monthly active end users in the EU and b more than yearly active business in the EU br An entrenched durable position which is a qualitative criterion which the regulator considers met if the numbers of active users in the second criterion are met for three years in a row br br br Sectors concerned Core Platforms Services br The DMA covers eight different sectors also known as Core Platforms Services CPS The European Commission considers them problematic because the Gatekeepers presence prevents market contestability to a certain extent As of September the designated Gatekeepers and their services are br br Apple s iPadOS was initially excluded from the list as it does not meet the required quantitative thresholds In April following a EU Commission market investigation iPadOS has been deemed a gatekeeper core platform service for posing an important gateway for business users to reach end users br Other services that were under investigation include Microsoft s Bing Edge and Microsoft Advertising and Apple s iMessage br On February the European Commission announced their decision that Bing Edge Microsoft Advertising and iMessage don t qualify as gatekeeper services The European Commission didn t go into detail on their decision other than stating that it was the result of a thorough assessment of all arguments taking into account input by relevant stakeholders and after hearing the Digital Markets Advisory Committee Despite the lack of detail provided by the European Commission on their decision multiple outlets speculated that the decision was based on the services not meeting the threshold necessary to be classified as a gatekeeper service This speculation was based in part on an article by the Financial Times from September that reported that both Microsoft and Apple made appeals on the grounds that there wasn t a big enough user base in Europe for the services under review The Financial Times received this information from two sources with direct knowledge on the matter br br br Obligations of gatekeepers br br It may prevent practices known as self preferencing applied by companies like Google for better displaying their products among the results of Google search br Gatekeeper companies could also be prohibited from reusing people s personal data For example Facebook could be forbidden from using the data obtained from its subsidiary WhatsApp br The proposal ensures rights to the platform s business users For example it could prohibit Apple from imposing a commission on all the transactions concluded via App Store br Gatekeepers platforms may also be prohibited from requiring business users to offer their best deals on the platform for example Amazon required e book publishers to apply their best conditions on the Amazon e book marketplace br There are also device neutrality rules regarding the rights to delete pre installed applications as in the case of Apple iOS or Google Android for example and to install apps from other sources br Protection rights for business users of platforms including advertisers and publishers br Prohibition of some bundling practices br Provisions for ensuring a higher degree of data portability interoperability and access to data for the platform s business and end users br Companies that do not comply with the new obligations may risk fines up to on their worldwide turnover br The two following sections detail each rule individually and mention when it is the case the concrete example that determined the commission to include them br br br Forbidden actions br This list comprises seven obligations and prohibitions for addressing the unfair trading practices All the identified gatekeepers will have to respect these provisions br br a Prevents Gatekeepers to combine personal data coming from Core Platforms Services CPS with data collected through other services of the same Gatekeepers or from a third party Also it prevents end users being signed in to other services offered by the Gatekeepers However this can be done only if the choice has been presented to the end user and consent given br Combining personal data from different sources was ruled illegal by the German Federal Cartel Office in in a case against Facebook The company was also fined million in May for notifying the Commission that it would not be possible to combine data coming from Facebook and WhatsApp at the time of the acquisition of WhatsApp in However the Commission found that this practice constituted a possibility since given the fact that WhatsApp inserted this option in its terms of services privacy policy in br br b allow business users to offer the same products or services to end users through third party online intermediation services at prices or conditions that are different from those offered through the online intermediation services of the Gatekeeper br This has already been considered illegal in a competition law case concerning Amazon e books In its contracts with the publishers of E books Amazon required them to offer at least the best price or conditions that they proposed to any other competitors This article also derives from the cases concerning online travel agencies such as Booking com or Expedia br br c allow business users to promote offers to end users acquired via the core platform service and to conclude contracts with these end users regardless of whether for that purpose they use the core platform services of the gatekeeper or not allow end users to access and use through the core platform services of the gatekeeper content subscriptions features or other items by using the software application of a business user where these items have been acquired by the end users from the relevant business user without using the core platform services of the gatekeeper br The legal character of this kind of practices is currently investigated by the European Commission in a case concerning the App Store of Apple and the commission that they charged to all the subscriptions made through the App Store br br d refrain from preventing or restricting business users from raising issues with any relevant public authority relating to any practice of gatekeepers br This is a general practice that does not come from the case law but it guarantees the right of business users to raise possible concerns to public authorities such as the European Commission br br e refrain from requiring business users to use offer or interoperate with an identification service of the gatekeeper in the context of services offered by the business users using the core platform services of that gatekeeper br Also known as a bundling practice it prevents gatekeepers from forcing business users to use the ID of the Core Platform Services when they offer their services Thus it is often related to advertisers or publishers issues such as Google and their methods of collecting data br br f Prevents the bundling of different CPSs of the platform that are identified as gatekeeper br For this bundling practice in Google was fined with billion by the Commission in a decision on Android The company breached the antitrust rules of the EU by forcing Android s users to pre install its own services such as Google search and Google Chrome This way Google secured its dominant position in terms of internet search br br g provide advertisers and publishers to which it supplies advertising services upon their request with information concerning the price paid by the advertiser and publisher as well as the amount or remuneration paid to the publisher for the publishing of a given ad and for each of the relevant advertising services provided by the gatekeeper br This last obligation is linked to the investigation of the European Commission on Google s data and advertising practices br br br Case by case assessment br Article of the DMA contains a second list of eleven obligations and prohibitions for gatekeepers These obligations are specified individually by the European Commission after consulting the gatekeepers concerned br br a refrain from using in competition with business users any data not publicly available which is generated through activities by those business users including by the end users of these business users of its core platform services or provided by those business users of its core platform services or by the end users of these business users br The potential ban of this practice derives from the Amazon Marketplace case that is under investigation by the European Commission The Commission claimed that Amazon breached antitrust rules by using non public data from their business users in order to compete with them br br b To guarantee the possibility for end users to uninstall pre installed applications on its CPS br This obligation derives from the cases on Microsoft Internet Explorer and Google Android where the European Commission forced them to allow end users to uninstall pre installed app from their core platforms services br br c allow the installation and effective use of third party software applications or software application stores using or interoperating with operating systems of that gatekeeper and allow these software applications or software application stores to be accessed by means other than the core platform services of that gatekeeper br The practice is currently investigated in the Apple App Store case The Commission considers that Apple does not let its competitors inform users about the possibility to buy their products on other platforms than the App store at potential cheaper prices br br d refrain from treating more favourably in ranking services and products offered by the gatekeeper itself or by any third party belonging to the same undertaking compared to similar services or products of third party and apply fair and non discriminatory conditions to such ranking br This practice has already been prohibited in the case of Google Shopping and is currently investigated in the Amazon Buy Box case Mainly it refers to self preferencing own products at the expense of competitors in the search results of a certain marketplace br br e refrain from technically restricting the ability of end users to switch between and subscribe to different software applications and services to be accessed using the operating system of the gatekeeper br This can be seen as deriving from the conflict between Spotify and Apple on the restrictions imposed to use Spotify on Apple devices that had the purpose of promoting Apple music services br br f allow business users and providers of ancillary services access to and interoperability with the same operating system hardware or software features that are available or used in the provision by the gatekeeper of any ancillary services br br This provision can be illustrated for example by practices currently analysed in the Apple Pay case By favouring its devices and its own method of payment Apple Pay at the expense of its competitors Apple is currently scrutinized by the commission br Interoperability requirement is a key demand by civil society and the open source community br br g provide advertisers and publishers upon their request and free of charge with access to the performance measuring tools of the gatekeeper and the information necessary for advertisers and publishers to carry out their own independent verification of the ad inventory br This article would help business users of platforms especially advertisers to have access to the data related to the ads and publications posted on the Gatekeeper s platforms Facebook and Google are potentially the main targets of this article and maybe Amazon br br h provide effective portability of data generated through the activity of a business user or end user and shall in particular provide tools for end users to facilitate the exercise of data portability in line with GDPR Regulation EU including by the provision of continuous and real time access br The abovementioned provision has a more general scope and it is not built around specific cases Seen as complementing the GDPR regulation it gives more precision regarding the scope of data portability by adding that the data access should be continuous and real time In practical terms this guarantees both access to users including business users and benefits in terms of up to date data portability generated by the platform br br i provide business users or third parties authorised by a business user free of charge with effective high quality continuous and real time access and use of aggregated or non aggregated data that is provided for or generated in the context of the use of the relevant core platform services by those business users and the end users engaging with the products or services provided by those business users for personal data provide access and use only where directly connected with the use effectuated by the end user in respect of the products or services offered by the relevant business user through the relevant core platform service and when the end user opts in to such sharing with a consent in the sense of the GDPR Regulation EU br As article h this article does not derive from an individual case and complements the GDPR It guarantees more rights to business and end users regarding the interoperability of the data generated on platforms This is meant to make data generated by different platforms compatible and usable by different systems br br j provide to any third party providers of online search engines upon their request with access on fair reasonable and non discriminatory terms to ranking query click and view data in relation to free and paid search generated by end users on online search engines of the gatekeeper subject to anonymisation for the query click and view data that constitutes personal data br This article is especially meant to ensure a higher degree of competition in the online search engines market by providing more rights to the new competitors It gives providers of online search engines access to data generated by the Gatekeeper in the sector presumably Google Search at the moment as it concentrates of the market share in this sector This is also related to the Google Search case and to Article d or the blacklisted actions of the DMA see above br br k apply fair and non discriminatory general conditions of access for business users to its software application store br This provision targets the store application of Gatekeepers App Store Google Play and has the aim to protect the rights of app developers and of business users br br br Other obligations for gatekeepers br Under Art Gatekeepers have to notify the Commission their intended future merger and acquisition br Under Art Gatekeepers have to notify the Commission when they meet the thresholds to be considered as gatekeepers see above the section related to the criteria br Under Art when designated as gatekeepers the firm has to conduct an independent audit about their profiling technique of consumers and submit it to the commission br br br European Commission s investigation powers and sanctions mechanisms br The Digital Markets Act will allow the European Commission to have regulatory and market investigation powers Under these circumstances market investigations will be mainly designated to br br Conduct markets investigation so as to specify the obligations imposed on Gatekeepers and monitor compliance Art br Conduct markets investigation in order to designate gatekeepers Art br Conduct market investigations to identify new services and practices that can be subject to the obligations listed in Art and Art Art br Chapter V of the proposal gives the commission a certain number of rights in order to conduct these investigations br Sanctions for gatekeepers in case of non compliance or systematic non compliance are represented by fines up to of the Gatekeeper s worldwide turnover br br br Relationship to national competition law enforcement br Art of the Digital Markets Act states that Member States are prohibited from imposing on gatekeepers further obligations by way of laws regulations or administrative action for the purpose of ensuring contestable and fair markets Obligations that are unrelated to the relevant undertakings having a status of gatekeeper within the meaning of the Digital Markets Act are exempted from this prohibition br On March the European Court of Justice ruled in the joint cases C Bpost and C Nordzucker that investigators can start antitrust scrutiny of companies that have already been probed under sector regulation such as the Digital Markets Act so long as the two cases are conducted in a sufficiently coordinated manner within a proximate timeframe and the overall penalties imposed must correspond to the seriousness of the offenses committed br This opens up a path for parallel national prosecution of gatekeepers for example as Germany has done under the German competition law amendment Section a The German Federal Cartel Office has in opened multiple proceedings against large tech firms that would be considered gatekeepers under the Digital Markets Act including Facebook now Meta Amazon Apple and Google Section a cases may involve coordination among the German Federal Cartel Office and the European Commission and other national competition authorities Legally it has been proposed by the Federal Cartel Office that Section a must be seen as an expansion of competition law meaning that it could be applied parallel to the Digital Markets Act The trilogue negotiations on the Digital Markets Act have not yielded a common position on the matter br br br Identified gatekeepers br br As of September the list of gatekeepers was revealed to be Alphabet Amazon Apple ByteDance Meta and Microsoft br The twenty two core products listed as gatekeeping products were br br Alphabet Google Search Google Maps Google Play Google Shopping Google Ads Chrome Android YouTube br Amazon Amazon Marketplace Amazon Product Advertising br Apple App Store Safari iOS br Bytedance TikTok br Meta Facebook Instagram Facebook Marketplace WhatsApp Messenger br Microsoft LinkedIn Microsoft Windows br br br Alphabet br Alphabet Inc is the parent company of Google The tensions between Alphabet Google and the European Union have been generated by sanctions applied to unfair practices related to advertising mobile operating system or shopping strategies Several fines were imposed by the European Commission to Google because of breaches of competition law but taking into account that despite the CJEU s rulings inefficient market outcomes in terms of higher prices lower quality less choice and innovation still emerged the DMA aims to better regulate this area br As the main focus of the Digital Markets Act is represented by operators that provide search engines social networks cloud computing services and operating systems Google was one of the companies that officially presented its position In an interview Google s President of Business and Operations for the EMEA region Matt Brittin stated that It s so important to get the rules right for European consumers to have more choice to support the kind of jobs we ll need in the future and to support European businesses br Even though not specifically named Google is one of the companies that will be affected by the stringent rules because the legislation will be applied to firms with European revenues of at least bn or at least million users across Europe Nevertheless as subject to potential fines of up to of its global revenue for breaking the rules Google is highly incentivized to continue influencing the legislators and lobbying in Brussels for obtaining better conditions under the Digital Market Act br The rhetoric of Google and its attempts to contour an official position relied mainly on the risks that might emerge from the legislative act namely barriers as Europeans will only have access to less choice and to more costly alternatives Nevertheless the big tech has also tried to highlight the weaknesses of the Digital Market Act and they labelled it a blacklist whose implications in terms of interoperability might not generate innovation in the future but incentives for lowest common denominator br In November the French news magazine Le Point published Google s leaked lobby strategy on the Digital Market Act thus several practices and intentions have been uncovered For example there were made references to br br Lobby at Parliament Commission and member state level br Re frame the political narrative around costs to the economy and consumers br Mobilise third parties such as think tanks and academics to echo Google s message br Mobilise the US Government br Create pushback against Commissioner Breton who was seen as supporting potential break ups br Create conflict between Commission departments br As far as the cost of these lobbying practices is concerned according to the Transparency Register Google spent more than million euros on lobbying in the first half of Even though the sum of money allocated by Google has already reached significant levels the numbers presented above do not comprise all the transactions related to academic partnerships law firms or activities conducted in individual Member States br Corporate Europe Observatory investigated the fight of EU tech regulation and according to its findings meetings were registered since the Von der Leyen Commission took office meetings that involved organisations mostly companies and lobby groups Only actors had at least or more meetings logged on these issues Google stands out with the most meetings with Microsoft and Facebook trailing close behind Apple and Amazon have also lobbied on the DMA and or DSA although they rank lower overall with two and one meeting respectively However one of the limitations faced is represented by the fact that the endeavours with the officials responsible for drafting the legislation are not mentioned as only the official meetings with high representatives are declared or announced br Despite the fact that the proposal has been published on December the lobbying practices still represent an ongoing process because they have been transferred from the commission to the European Parliament and Council However comparing the data obtained on the meetings of the European Commission with the information made available by the other institutions it can be observed that transparency is even less stringent br In October the German cartel office said Alphabet unit Google had agreed to change its user data practices to end a German antitrust investigation aimed at curbing its data driven market power br Alphabet responded by br br Creating the Data Portability API an API that allows to transfer content of Chrome browser Google Maps Play Store Google Search Google Shopping and YouTube to another service but is only available in all EEA countries only and the United Kingdom br Added additional data for EEA advertisers br Launching a program to have external payment in Google Play Store br Android supports seamless updating on third party app stores worldwide br Added a settings panel to unlink data between most Google services br Added EU choice screens to Android which are randomly ordered br Added dedicated chips to link to external services for flights and other stuff br br br Amazon br Amazon welcomed the DMA and according to its position the company has not been as concerned about it as the other GAFAM members This can be explained by the fact that compared to Google s and Apple s case the Digital Markets Act could affect Amazon only in three aspects br br Amazon might be obliged to allow business users to offer the same products or services to end users at prices or conditions that are different from those offered by Amazon DMA Article b br Amazon might be obliged not to use data from competitors that is not public DMA Article a br Amazon might be obliged not to treat the services and the products it offers more favourably DMA Article d br The prohibition on using non public data from competitors it hosts on its platform and the prohibition on ranking its product before the ones offered by competitors may impact Amazon if the proposal for the DMA is adopted under its current form Moreover these aspects caused Amazon to negotiate the final version of the regulation taking into account that it spent million on lobbying practices and that it became a member of several think tanks br br br Apple br The new European draft legislation has also targeted Apple s App Store with regard to its practices and preinstalled applications One of the main changes that will be brought to their current business model is represented by the removal of the self preferencing strategy As a result of the proposal on the Digital Markets Act Apple would be forced to change the manner in which its apps are displayed in the App Store searches so as to give the chance to smaller developers to have their software downloaded by consumers Moreover Apple will have to allow its customers to uninstall preloaded first party apps from the devices procured Thus both Google and Apple will be constrained and their practices more regulated According to the DMA final proposal these big tech companies will be compelled to share performance metrics for free with advertisers and publishers br Before the official release of the DMA proposal some companies including Apple tried to change their behaviour taking into account the reactions generated by the commission s intent to regulate the digital market As far as Apple is concerned in October a group of French publishers led by italicno APIG highlighted its concern with regard to the App Store s terms of service For example one of their requirements was related to the economic dependence on Apple Content publishers are in a situation of absolute economic dependence on Apple for the distribution of their content on the iPhone since the only store available on this device is the AppStore In addition Apple was criticised for the commission on sales that it makes through apps on the platform thus the APIG showed its concern vis a vis the further concentration on the market The reaction of Apple to these allegations was focused especially on a reduction of its commission rate to for app developers with less than million in annual net sales but this did not impede the European Commission to continue advocating for the Digital Markets Act br Similar to Google s case Apple also seeks to limit the influence of the commission and to escape the definition of gatekeeper so as not to become subject to further obligations However as Brussels still wants to outlaw gatekeepers ability to ban others from accessing their marketplaces firms like Spotify and Facebook that believe Apple has set unfair conditions on those companies apps within App Store seem to support the commission s proposal br The strategy of Apple to limit the influence of the DMA is not as clear or well structured as in Google s case However there can be observed some practices engaged in by the company to ensure that its objectives are taken into account by the European officials According to a research conducted by the Corporate Europe Observatory it seems that Apple Google and Facebook used to work with several associations that declared themselves independent without disclosing their linkages For example the Center for European Reform has featured on its website a list of its corporate donors one of them being Apple but Apple does not specify this information on the Transparency Register entry Under these circumstances it can be observed the network created around interests groups companies NGOs and think tanks as all of them seek to shape the legislative process in Brussels in their favour br When it comes to lobby spending despite the limited and incomplete information it can be observed that Apple is in the top individual corporate lobby spenders in Brussels at numbers with over million In comparison with Google that has allocated a budget of million Apple still invests a considerable sum of money on access to European officials so as to present its demands br On June Apple became the first company to be charged under the DMA with regulators alleging that the company s Apple Store policies are illegal br br br ByteDance br ByteDance is the one non American company on the list of Gatekeepers Its major service offering is the video hosting social network TikTok br ByteDance responded by launching a Data Portability API for EEA users later to provide increased access to the API improving the Download Your Data tool s speed and adding the ability to partially export TikTok data by allowing selections of categories to export A webform for future DMA compliance was created br br br Meta br Considering that the Digital Markets Act aims to limit the influence of large companies by allowing alternative players to emerge Meta has also been targeted by the legislative proposal As in the other companies cases once the DMA is adopted unfair practices will be highly discouraged and even prohibited so as to stop the harm they bring to competition br However apart from Google Apple and Amazon Meta seems to support the EU rules that have been published last year In its official declarations Meta claimed that it hopes that the European Union will set boundaries for Apple Nevertheless in this context there were not observed solely tensions between the Commission and the Big Tech companies but even between GAFAM taking into account their statements and the objectives they advocate for br The controversies between Meta and Apple started with the privacy feature used by Apple that allows consumers to block advertisers from tracking them across different applications Thus Meta a company that earns revenue from advertising began to retaliate and showed its discontent It has also added that Apple controls an entire ecosystem from device to app store and apps and uses this power to harm developers and consumers as well as large platforms like Facebook The reaction of Apple was quite harsh and accused Meta of invasive tracking Therefore the discussions around the Digital Markets Act started to create more tensions between Big Tech firms and to deviate from the scope of the proposal as the companies focused on criticising their competitors of illegal practices br br br Microsoft br Microsoft was identified as gatekeeper The consultant Cristina Caffarra and professor Fiona Scott Morton presented the view that the only obligation that might affect Microsoft under the DMA was to enable end users to delete any software applications pre installed It is unclear whether Scott Morton was consulting already for Microsoft at the time of making such statements her consulting work for Microsoft became known during the Fiona Scott Morton affair br Microsoft complied by allowing worldwide users to uninstall Camera Photos and Cortana and EEA users to uninstall Bing Web Search and Microsoft Edge APIs for custom search engines and widget feeds were created for EEA exclusive users EEA users will also be prompted about syncing a PC s data to Microsoft A registry hack was shortly created to get these changes without living in an EEA country or having to move to an EEA country EEA users are no longer advertised about Microsoft Edge br br br Non Gatekeeper firms br br br Airbnb and Booking com br Due to their important positions on the short term accommodation market Airbnb and Booking com became potential targets for the legislation Indeed above of the homes designated for short terms stay are listed on AirBnB and approximatively on Booking com Therefore their possible labelling as gatekeepers has been long debated leading the companies to defend themselves and explain why they should not be considered included in this category Moreover Booking com insisted on the fact that it is one of the only European companies that is a global success and that as they are not the most dominant actor in this sector they should not be disincentivized while competing with bigger companies br br br Spotify br With approximately of the market share in in the music subscription market Spotify is by far the dominant actor in this sector as Apple Music comes in second position with around of market share However Spotify does not seem to meet the criteria set by the European Commission according to the analysis of Vox EU Dirk Auer an economist of the American think tank ICLE qualified this piece of legislation as a way to protect the European firms and that the criteria are on purpose excluding major European tech firms notably Spotify Even if it is true that SAP would probably be the only European firm targeted by the legal act there are also American big platforms like Twitter or Uber not targeted by the legislation despite their important market position br br br Samsung br Although Samsung had appeared earlier on a list of possible gatekeepers it was not on the final list br br br Reaction within the European Union br br br France br The French Government expressed its ambition for imposing stricter enforcement on competition rules so as to prevent giant tech firms favouring their own services ousting rivals or maintaining their dominant positions br Nevertheless France would like to rely on the possibility of adapting the rules through the Digital Markets Act in order to respond to the constant
