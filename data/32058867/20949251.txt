Milpitas Spanish for little milpas is a city in Santa Clara County California in Silicon Valley As of the census the city population was The city s origins lie in Rancho Milpitas granted to Californio ranchero Jos Mar a Alviso in Milpitas incorporated in and has become home to numerous high tech companies as part of Silicon Valley br br br History br Milpitas was first inhabited by Tamien people a subgroup of the Ohlone people who had resided in the San Francisco Bay Area for thousands of years The Ohlone Indians lived a traditional life based on everyday hunting and gathering Some of the Ohlone lived in various villages within what is now Milpitas including sites underneath what are now the Calvary Assembly of God Church and Higuera Adobe Park Archaeological evidence gathered from Ohlone graves at the Elmwood Correctional Facility in revealed a rich trade with other tribes from Sacramento to Monterey br During the Spanish expeditions of the late th century several missions were founded in the San Francisco Bay Area During the mission period Milpitas served as a crossroads between Mission San Jos de Guadalupe in present day Fremont and Mission Santa Clara de Asis in present day Santa Clara The land of modern day Milpitas was divided between the acre km Rancho Rincon de Los Esteros Spanish for corner of the wetlands granted to Ignacio Alviso the acre km Rancho Milpitas Spanish for little corn fields granted to Jos Mar a Alviso and the acre km Rancho Los Tularcitos Spanish for little tule marshes granted to Jos Higuera Jose Maria Alviso was the son of Francisco Xavier Alviso and Maria Bojorquez both of whom arrived in San Francisco as children with the de Anza Expedition Jos Mar a Alviso is considered to be the founder of Milpitas Due to Jose Maria Alviso s descendants difficulty securing his claims to the Rancho Milpitas property portions of his land were either swindled from the Alviso family or were sold to American settlers to pay for legal fees br br Both landowners had built prominent adobe homes on their properties Today both adobes still exist and are the oldest structures in Milpitas The seriously eroded walls of the Jose Higuera Adobe now in Higuera Adobe Park are encapsulated in a brick shell built c by Marian Weller a descendant of pioneer Joseph Weller br The Alviso Adobe can be seen mostly in its original form with one kitchen addition made by the Cuciz family after they purchased the adobe from the Gleason family in Prior to the city acquiring the Alviso Adobe in it was the oldest continuously occupied adobe house in California dating from the Mexican period and today is still gradually being restored and undergoing seismic upgrades by the City of Milpitas br In the s large numbers of Americans of English German and Irish descent arrived to farm the fertile lands of Milpitas The Burnett Rose Dempsey Jacklin Trimble Ayer Parks Wool Weller Minnis and Evans families are among the early settlers of Milpitas Today many schools streets and parks have been named in honor of these families These early settlers farmed the land that was once the ranchos Some set up businesses on what was then called Mission Road now called Main Street between Calaveras Road now called Carlo Street and the Alviso Milpitas Road now called Serra Way By the late th century this area became known as the Midtown district Yet another influx of immigration came in the s and s as Portuguese sharecroppers from the Azores came to farm the Milpitas hillsides Many of the Azoreans had such locally well known surnames as Coelho Covo Mattos Nunes Spangler Serpa and Silva br There is a local legend that in when the U S Postal Service wanted to locate a Post Office in Frederick Creighton s store near the intersection of Mission Road and Alviso Milpitas Road to serve the newly created Township there was some support for naming it Penitencia after the small Roman Catholic confessional building that had served local Indians and ranchers and had once stood several miles south of the village near Penitencia Creek which ran just west of the Mission Road A local farmer and first Assistant Postmaster Joseph Weller felt the Spanish word Penitencia might be confused with the English word penitentiary Instead of choosing Penitencia he suggested another popular name for the area Milpitas after the name of Alviso s property Rancho Milpitas Thus was born Milpitas Township br For over a century Milpitas served as a popular rest stop for travelers on the old Oakland San Jose Highway At the north side of the intersection of that road with the Milpitas Alviso Road for many years stood French s Hotel that had been originally built by Alex Anderson prior to when Alfred French bought it from Austin M Thompson South of the site of French s Hotel was a saloon dating from at least when Agustus Rathbone purchased the land and improvements from Richard Greenham The first murder in Milpitas was committed in the early s in Rathbone s Saloon alas the murderer escaped Later the saloon was replaced by a hotel that is shown on the Sanborn Fire Insurance Map as Goodwin s Hotel perhaps the same Henry K Goodwin who in loaned money to prominent local rancher Marshall Pomeroy Presumably this hotel burned down and Smith s Corner which still stands was built in by John Smith as a saloon that served beer and wine to thirsty travelers for a century before becoming a restaurant in Around this central core grocery and dry goods stores blacksmithies service stations and in the s one of America s earliest fast food chain restaurants The Fat Boy opened nearby Another of Milpitas s most popular restaurants was the Kozy Kitchen established in by the Carlo family in the former Central Market building Kozy Kitchen was demolished soon after Jimmy Carlo sold the restaurant in Even in the early s Milpitas served a farming community of people who walked a mere one or two blocks to work br On January faced with getting swallowed up by a rapidly expanding San Jose Milpitas residents incorporated as a city that included the recently built Ford Auto Assembly plant When San Jose attempted to annex Milpitas barely seven years later the Milpitas Minutemen were quickly organized to oppose annexation and keep Milpitas independent An overwhelming majority of Milpitas registered voters voted No to annexation in the election as a result of a vigorous anti annexation campaign Following the election the anti annexation committee who had compared themselves to the Revolutionary War Minutemen who fought the British on Lexington Green a role filled in this case by the neighboring city of San Jose adopted the image of Daniel Chester French s Minuteman statue that stands near the site of the Old North Bridge in Concord MA as part of the official city seal In the s the city approved the construction of the Calaveras overpass Formerly at a junction with the Union Pacific railroad Calaveras Boulevard had a bridge passing over six sets of railroad tracks after the construction was completed Though the result was that local residents could now drive over the train tracks without waiting for a slow freight to pass it resulted in the loss of the historical residential area Here houses owned by city leaders had to be purchased by the city at full market value and either moved or demolished br Starting in with the construction of the Ford Motor Assembly Plant and accelerating in the s and s extensive residential and retail development took place Hayfields in Milpitas rapidly disappeared as industries and residential housing developments spread Soon the once rural town of Milpitas found itself a San Jose suburb The population jumped from about in to in Several local farmers and businessmen who had chipped in from to to file for incorporation had become millionaires within ten years Most of them then moved away br According to the book The Color of Law by Richard Rothstein when the Ford plant moved from Richmond to Milpitas in the town incorporated in order to pass laws that would exclude African American workers from residing there Union leaders met with Ford Executives and negotiated an agreement permitting all Richmond plant workers including the approximately African Americans to transfer to the new facility Once Ford s plans became known Milpitas residents incorporated the town and passed an emergency ordinance permitting the newly installed city council to ban apartment construction and allow only single family homes The Federal Housing Administration approved subdivision plans that met their specifications in Milpitas and guaranteed mortgages to qualified buyers One of the specifications for mortgages insured in Milpitas as in the rest of the country at that time was an openly stated prohibition on sales to African Americans Because Milpitas had no apartments and houses in the area were off limits to black workers though their incomes and economic circumstances were like those of whites on the assembly line African Americans had to choose between giving up the good industrial jobs moving to apartments in a segregated neighborhood of San Jose or enduring lengthy commutes between North Richmond and Milpitas br In Ben F Gross a civil rights activist became Milpitas s first black city councilman with the backing of the UAW This election was recognized nationally and received attention from Look and Life magazines In Ben F Gross became California s first black mayor when he was elected by the city s residents and the only black mayor of a predominantly white town in California Mayor Gross was reelected in and continued fighting against Milpitas s annexation by San Jose br The Ford San Jose Assembly Plant closed in later being converted into a shopping mall known as the Great Mall of the Bay Area which opened in br In the early st century the Milpitas light rail transit system station was added making it the northeastern most light rail destination in the region On January the city celebrated the th anniversary of its incorporation and issued the book Milpitas Five Dynamic Decades to commemorate years of Milpitas s history as a busy exciting crossroads community br br br Etymology br The name Milpitas is the plural diminutive of milpa Mexican Spanish for cornfield The name means Place of little cornfields The word milpa is derived from the Nahuatl words milli meaning agricultural field and pan meaning on br The name Milpitas perhaps used by Jose Maria Alviso to name his land grant Rancho de las Milpitas may have meant that there had been small Native American gardens nearby because of the rich alluvial soils of the area br The first deed of property sale in Milpitas is found in the Santa Clara County Records General Index K and is dated February It is Juana Galindo Alviso widow of Jose Maria Alviso to Michael and Ellen Hughes for acres km of land today the Main Street area south of Carlo Street although the deed gives the name of the Rancho as Rancho San Miguel rather than as Milpitas br br br Geography br Milpitas lies in the northeastern corner of the Santa Clara Valley which is south of San

Berryessa Creek flows through Milpitas br br br Pollution br Milpitas occasionally experiences odorous air traveling downwind from bay salt marshes from the Newby Island landfill from the anaerobic digestion facility at Zero Waste Energy Development Company and from the San Jose sewage treatment plant s percolation ponds Most malodorous during the autumn it is especially pungent west of Interstate because of its close location to the San Francisco Bay and the direction of the prevailing winds out of the north northwest The City of Milpitas would like to remedy this air quality problem to the extent it can and encourages its residents to file odor complaints br Local creeks and the nearby San Francisco Bay suffer somewhat from water pollution originating from street water runoff and industrial wastes The creeks in Milpitas especially Calera Scott and Berryessa Creeks used to be prime fishing spots for native steelhead until pollutants from urban development and industry killed the fish starting in the s While small populations of steelhead and even salmon still may be seen in area streams these cannot legally be fished and consumption of legal catches is limited by mercury contamination br The I corridor has experienced relatively elevated levels of air pollution from freeway traffic For example eight hour standards for carbon monoxide have been near to maximum levels for the last two decades br br br Climate br br Set within a warm Mediterranean climate zone in Santa Clara County Milpitas enjoys warm sunny weather with few extreme temperatures
