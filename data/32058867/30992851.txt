Retroshare is a free and open source peer to peer communication and file sharing app based on a friend to friend network built by GNU Privacy Guard GPG Optionally peers may exchange certificates and IP addresses to their friends and vice versa br br br History br Retroshare was founded in by Mark Fernie An unofficial build for the single board computer Raspberry Pi named PiShare since br On November Retroshare scored out of points on the Electronic Frontier Foundation s secure messaging scorecard which is now out of date It lost a point because there had not been a recent independent code audit br In August Retroshare repository was migrated from SourceForge to GitHub In Linux Magazine reviewed security gaps in Retroshare and described it as a brave effort but in the end an ineffective one br br br Design br Retroshare is an instant messaging and file sharing network that uses a distributed hash table for address discovery Users can communicate indirectly through mutual friends and request direct connections br br br Features br br br Authentication and connectivity br After initial installation the user generates a pair of GPG cryptographic keys with Retroshare After authentication and exchanging an asymmetric key OpenSSL is used to establish a connection and for end to end encryption Friends of friends cannot connect by default but they can see each other if the users allow it IPv was released in November of br br br File sharing br It is possible to share folders between friends File transfer is carried on using a multi hop swarming system inspired by the Turtle Hopping feature from the Turtle F F project but implemented differently In essence data is only exchanged between friends although it is possible that the ultimate source and destination of a given transfer are multiple friends apart A search function performing anonymous multi hop search is another source of finding files in the network br Files are represented by their SHA hash value and HTTP compliant file and links may be exported copied and pasted into out of Retroshare to publish their virtual location into the Retroshare network br br br Communication br Retroshare offers the following services for communication br br a private chat br a private mailing system that allows secure communication between known friends and distant friends br public and private multi user chat lobbies br a forum system allowing both anonymous and authenticated forums which distributes posts from friends to friends br a channel system offers the possibility to auto download files posted in a given channel to every subscribed peer similar to RSS feeds br a posted links system where links to important information can be shared br VoIP calls br Video calls since version br Tor and I P networks support for further anonymisation since version br br br User interface br The core of the Retroshare software is based on an offline library into which two executables are plugged br br a command line interface executable which offers nearly no control but it is useful to run headless on a server br a graphical user interface written in Qt is the one most users use In addition to functions quite common to other file sharing software such as a search tab and visualization of transfers Retroshare gives users the potential to manage their network by collecting optional information about neighbouring friends and visualizing it as a trust matrix or as a dynamic network graph The appearance can be changed by choosing one of several available style sheets br br br Anonymity br The friend to friend structure of the Retroshare network makes it difficult to intrude and hardly possible to monitor from an external point of view The degree of anonymity may be improved further by deactivating the DHT and IP certificate exchange services making the Retroshare network a real dark net br Friends of friends may not connect directly with each other however a user may enable the anonymous sharing of files with friends of friends Search access and both upload and download of these files are made by routing through a series of friends This means that communication between the source of data the up loader and the destination of the data the down loader is indirect through mutual friends Although the intermediary friends cannot determine the original source or ultimate destination they can see their very next links in the communication chain their friends Since the data stream is encrypted only the original source and ultimate destination are able to see what data is transferred br br br Caveats br While Retroshare s encryption makes it virtually impossible for an ISP or another external observer to know what one is downloading or uploading this limitation does not apply to members of the user s Retroshare circle of trust adding untrusted people to it may be a potential risk br In a German Court granted an injunction against a user of Retroshare for sharing copyrighted music files Retroshare derives its security from the fact that all transfers should go through trusted friends whom users add In this case the defendant added the anti piracy monitoring company as a friend which allowed him to be traced through aggregation of bad Opsec br br br See also br br Comparison of file sharing applications br br br br br br
