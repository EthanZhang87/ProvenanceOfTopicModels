governor According to The Atlantic the race featured a rumor that she was a lesbian along with a rare instance of such a tactic s making it into the public record when a regional chairman of the Bush

the size of the military cutting taxes improving education and aiding minorities By early the race had centered on Bush and Arizona Senator John McCain br Bush won the Iowa caucuses and although heavily favored to win the New Hampshire primary trailed McCain by percent and lost Despite this he regained momentum and effectively became the front runner after the South Carolina primary which

he selected Dick Cheney a former White House chief of staff U S representative and secretary of defense to be his running mate At the time Cheney was serving as head of Bush s vice presidential search committee Soon after at the Republican National Convention Bush and Cheney were officially nominated by the Republican Party br Bush continued to campaign across the country and touted his record as

reaching the U S Supreme Court On December in the controversial Bush v Gore ruling the Court reversed a Florida Supreme Court decision that had ordered a third count and stopped an ordered statewide hand recount based on the argument that the use of different standards among Florida s counties violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment The machine recount showed that Bush had won the Florida vote by a margin of votes out of six million casts Although he had received fewer individual nationwide votes than Gore Bush won the election receiving electoral votes to Gore s

attacked Bush on the Iraq War and accused him of failing to stimulate the economy and job growth The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and increase the size of government The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry s seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror br Following the resignation of CIA director George Tenet in Bush nominated Porter Goss to head the agency The White House ordered Goss to purge agency officers who were disloyal to the administration After Goss appointment many of the CIA s senior agents were fired or quit The CIA has been accused of deliberately leaking classified information to undermine the election br In the

domestic agenda but his priorities were significantly altered following the September attacks Wars were begun in Afghanistan and Iraq and there were significant domestic debates regarding immigration healthcare Social Security economic policy and treatment of terrorist detainees Over an eight year period Bush s once high approval ratings steadily declined while his disapproval numbers increased significantly In the United States entered the longest post World War II recession br br br Domestic policy br br br Economic policy br br Bush took office during a period of economic recession in the wake of the bursting of the dot com bubble The September terrorist attacks also impacted the economy br His administration increased federal government spending from trillion to trillion percent while revenues increased from trillion to trillion from to Individual income tax revenues increased by percent corporate tax revenues by percent and customs and duties by percent Discretionary defense spending was increased by percent discretionary domestic spending by percent Medicare spending by percent social security by percent and income security spending by percent Cyclically adjusted revenues rose by percent and spending by percent The increase in spending was more than under any predecessor since Lyndon B Johnson The number of economic regulation governmental workers increased by br The surplus in fiscal year was billion the third consecutive surplus and the largest surplus ever In Bush s budget estimated that there would be a trillion surplus over the next ten years Facing congressional opposition Bush held town hall style meetings across the U S to increase public support for his plan for a trillion tax cut program one of the largest tax cuts in U S history Bush argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers saying the surplus is not the government s money The surplus is the people s money Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warned of a recession and Bush stated that a tax cut would stimulate the economy and create jobs Treasury Secretary Paul H O Neill opposed some of the tax cuts on the basis that they would contribute to budget deficits and undermine Social Security O Neill disputes the claim made in Bush s book Decision Points that he never openly disagreed with him on planned tax cuts By the economy showed signs of improvement though job growth remained stagnant Another tax cut was passed that year br Between and GDP grew at an average annual rate of percent less than for past business cycles Bush entered office with the Dow Jones Industrial Average at and the average peaked in October at over When Bush left office the average was at one of the lowest levels of his presidency Only four other U S presidents have left office with the stock market lower than when they began br br Unemployment originally rose from percent in January to percent in June but subsequently dropped to percent in July Adjusted for inflation median household income dropped by between and while Professor Ken Homa of Georgetown University has noted that Median real after tax household income went up two percent The poverty rate increased from percent in to percent in after peaking at percent in By October due to increases in spending the national debt had risen to trillion more than doubling it since Most debt was accumulated as a result of what became known as the Bush tax cuts and increased national security spending In March then Senator Barack Obama said when he voted against raising the debt ceiling The fact that we are here today to debate raising America s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure By the end of Bush s presidency unemployment climbed to percent br br br financial crisis br In December the United States entered the longest post World War II recession caused by a housing market correction a subprime mortgage crisis soaring oil prices and other factors In February jobs were lost a five year record and in November over jobs were lost which marked the largest loss of jobs in the United States in years The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in the last four months of million jobs were lost By the end of the U S had lost million jobs br To aid with the situation Bush signed a billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in and after two years the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate Many Republican senators as well as influential members of the Bush Administration feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector s risky practices In September the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for billion br Many economists and world governments determined that the situation had become the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression Additional regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial according to former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan Bush meanwhile proposed a financial rescue plan to buy back a large portion of the U S mortgage market Vince Reinhardt a former Federal Reserve economist now at the American Enterprise Institute said it would have helped for the Bush administration to empower the folks at Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the FDIC to look at these issues more closely and additionally that it would have helped for Congress to have held hearings br br br Education and public health br Bush undertook many educational agendas such as increasing the funding for the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health in his first years of office and creating education programs to strengthen the grounding in science and mathematics for American high school students Funding for the NIH was cut in the first such cut in years due to rising inflation br br One of the administration s early major initiatives was the No Child Left Behind Act which aimed to measure and close the gap between rich and poor student performance provide options to parents with students in low performing schools and target more federal funding to low income schools This landmark education initiative passed with broad bipartisan support including that of Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts It was signed into law by Bush in early Many contend that the initiative has been successful as cited by the fact that students in the U S have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since Bush signed No Child Left Behind into law Critics argue that it is underfunded and that NCLBA s focus on high stakes testing and quantitative outcomes is counterproductive br On November Bush launched a National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza which culminated in an implementation plan published by the Homeland Security Council in May br After being re elected Bush signed into law a Medicare drug benefit program that according to Jan Crawford resulted in the greatest expansion in America s welfare state in forty years the bill s costs approached trillion In Bush opposed and vetoed State Children s Health Insurance Program SCHIP legislation which was added by the Democrats onto a war funding bill and passed by Congress The SCHIP legislation would have significantly expanded federally funded healthcare benefits and plans to children of some low income families It was to be funded by an increase in the cigarette tax Bush viewed the legislation as a move toward socialized health care and asserted that the program could benefit families making as much as per year who did not need the help br On May Bush signed into law the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act aimed to protect Americans against health insurance and employment discrimination based on a person s genetic information The issue had been debated for years before it finally became law The measure is designed to protect citizens without hindering genetic research br br br Social services and Social Security br Following Republican efforts to pass the Medicare Act of Bush signed the bill which included major changes to the Medicare program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits The retired persons lobby group AARP worked with the Bush Administration on the program and gave their endorsement Bush said the law estimated to cost billion over the first ten years would give the elderly better choices and more control over their health care br Bush began his second term by outlining a major initiative to reform Social Security which was facing record deficit projections beginning in Bush made it the centerpiece of his domestic agenda despite opposition from some in the U S Congress In his State of the Union Address Bush discussed the potential impending bankruptcy of the program and outlined his new program which included partial privatization of the system personal Social Security accounts and options to permit Americans to divert a portion of their Social Security tax FICA into secured investments Democrats opposed the proposal to partially privatize the system br Bush embarked on a day national tour campaigning for his initiative in media events known as Conversations on Social Security in an attempt to gain public support Nevertheless public support for the proposal declined and the House Republican leadership decided not to put Social Security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their legislative agenda The proposal s legislative prospects were further diminished by autumn due to political fallout from the response to Hurricane Katrina br br br Environmental policies br br Upon taking office in Bush stated his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions citing that the treaty exempted percent of the world s population and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year He also cited that the Senate had voted in on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol br In May Bush signed an executive order to create an interagency task force to streamline energy projects and later signed two other executive orders to tackle environmental issues br In Bush proposed the Clear Skies Act of which aimed at amending the Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution through the use of emissions trading programs Many experts argued that this legislation would have weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of pollutants than were previously legal The initiative was introduced to Congress but failed to make it out of committee br Later in Bush declared the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands a national monument creating the largest marine reserve to date The Papah naumoku kea Marine National Monument comprises million acres km and is home to species of fish birds and other marine animals many of which are specific to only those islands The move was hailed by conservationists for its foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible area br Bush has said he believes that global warming is real and has noted that it is a serious problem but he asserted there is a debate over whether it s man made or naturally caused The Bush Administration s stance on global warming remained controversial in the scientific and environmental communities Critics have alleged that the administration misinformed the public and did not do enough to reduce carbon emissions and deter global warming br br br Energy policies br In his State of the Union Address Bush declared America is addicted to oil and launched his Advanced Energy Initiative to increase energy development research br br In his State of the Union Address Bush renewed his pledge to work toward diminished reliance on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production Amid high gasoline prices in Bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling However the move was largely symbolic because there was still a federal law banning offshore drilling Bush said This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U S Congress Bush had said in June In the long run the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells In the short run the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil And that means we need to increase supply especially here at home So my administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production br In his State of the Union Address Bush committed billion over the next three years to a new international fund to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change saying Along with contributions from other countries this fund will increase and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner more efficient technologies in developing nations like India and China and help leverage substantial private sector capital by making clean energy projects more financially attractive He also presented plans to reaffirm the United States commitment to work with major economies and through the UN to complete an international agreement that will slow stop and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases he stated This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride br br br Stem cell research and first veto br Federal funding for medical research involving the creation or destruction of human embryos through the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health has been forbidden by law since the passage of the Dickey Wicker Amendment in Bush has said he supports adult stem cell research and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research However Bush did not support embryonic stem cell research On August Bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the existing lines of stem cells but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned Testing can be done on only of the original lines and all approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines On July Bush used his veto power for the first time in his presidency to veto the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act The bill would have repealed the Dickey Wicker Amendment thereby permitting federal money to be used for research where stem cells are derived from the destruction of an embryo br br br Immigration br br Nearly eight million immigrants came to the United States from to more than in any other five year period in the nation s history Almost half entered illegally In Bush urged Congress to allow more than twelve million illegal immigrants to work in the United States with the creation of a temporary guest worker program Bush also urged Congress to provide additional funds for border security and committed to deploying National Guard troops to the Mexico United States border From May to June Bush strongly supported the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of which was written by a bipartisan group of Senators with the active participation of the Bush administration The bill envisioned a legalization program for illegal immigrants with an eventual path to citizenship establishing a guest worker program a series of border and worksite enforcement measures a reform of the green card application process and the introduction of a point based merit system for green cards elimination of chain migration and of the Diversity Immigrant Visa and other measures Bush argued that the lack of legal status denies the protections of U S laws to millions of people who face dangers of poverty and exploitation and penalizes employers despite a demand for immigrant labor Bush contended that the proposed bill did not amount to amnesty br A heated public debate followed which resulted in a substantial rift within the Republican Party most conservatives opposed it because of its legalization or amnesty provisions The bill was eventually defeated in the Senate on June when a cloture motion failed on a vote Bush expressed disappointment upon the defeat of one of his signature domestic initiatives The Bush administration later proposed a series of immigration enforcement measures that do not require a change in law br On September former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said that Bush offered to accept Palestinian refugees as American citizens if a permanent settlement had been reached between Israel and the Palestinian Authority br br br Hurricane Katrina br br Hurricane Katrina struck early in Bush s second term and was one of the most damaging natural disasters in U S history Katrina formed in late August during the Atlantic hurricane season and devastated much of the north central Gulf Coast of the United States particularly New Orleans br Bush declared a state of emergency in Louisiana on August and in Mississippi and Alabama the following day The eye of the hurricane made landfall on August and New Orleans began to flood due to levee breaches later that day Bush declared a major disaster in Louisiana officially authorizing FEMA to start using federal funds to assist in the recovery effort br On August DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff declared it an incident of national significance triggering the first use of the newly created National Response Plan Three days later on September National Guard troops first entered the city of New Orleans The same day Bush toured parts of Louisiana Mississippi and Alabama and declared that the success of the recovery effort up to that point was not enough br As the disaster in New Orleans intensified Bush received widespread criticism for downplaying his administration s role in the inadequate response Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA notably Michael D Brown federal resources to respond were also limited as a result of being allocated to the Iraq War and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods Bush responded to mounting criticism by claiming to accept full responsibility for the federal government s failures in its handling of the emergency It has been argued that with Katrina Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover br br br Midterm dismissal of U S attorneys br br During Bush s second term a controversy arose over the Justice Department s midterm dismissal of seven United States Attorneys The White House maintained that they were fired for poor performance Attorney General Alberto Gonzales later resigned over the issue along with other senior members of the Justice Department The House Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas for advisers Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten to testify regarding this matter but Bush directed Miers and Bolten not to comply with those subpoenas invoking his right of executive privilege Bush maintained that all his advisers were covered under a broad executive privilege protection to receive candid advice The Justice Department determined that the President s order was legal br Although Congressional investigations focused on whether the Justice Department and the White House were using the U S Attorney positions for political advantage no official findings have been released On March the Congress filed a federal lawsuit to enforce their issued subpoenas On July a United States district court judge ruled that Bush s top advisers were not immune from Congressional subpoenas br In all twelve Justice Department officials resigned rather than testify under oath before Congress They included Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and his chief of staff Kyle Sampson Gonzales liaison to the White House Monica Goodling aide to the president Karl Rove and his senior aide Sara Taylor In addition legal counsel to the president Harriet Miers and deputy chief of staff to the president Joshua Bolten were both found in contempt of Congress br In the Justice Department investigator concluded that though political considerations did play a part in as many as four of the attorney firings the firings were inappropriately political but not criminal According to the prosecutors there was insufficient evidence to pursue prosecution for any criminal offense br br br Foreign policy br br During his presidential campaign Bush s foreign policy platform included support for stronger economic and political relationships with Latin America especially Mexico and a reduction of involvement in nation building and other small scale military engagements The administration pursued a national missile defense Bush was an advocate of China s entry into the World Trade Organization br Bush began his second term with an emphasis on improving strained relations with European nations He appointed long time adviser Karen Hughes to oversee a global public relations campaign Bush lauded the pro democracy struggles in Georgia and Ukraine br In March Bush visited India in a trip focused particularly on areas of nuclear energy counter terrorism co operation and discussions that would eventually lead to the India United States Civil Nuclear Agreement This was in stark contrast to decades of U S policy such as the stance taken by his predecessor Bill Clinton whose approach and response to India after the nuclear tests has been characterized as sanctions and hectoring br Midway through Bush s second term questions arose whether Bush was retreating from his freedom and democracy agenda which was highlighted in policy changes toward some oil rich former Soviet republics in central Asia br br Bush signed the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty with Russia He withdrew U S support for several international agreements including in the Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty ABM with Russia This marked the first time in post World War II history that the United States had withdrawn from a major international arms treaty Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that American withdrawal from the ABM Treaty was a mistake br Bush emphasized a careful approach to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians he denounced Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat for his support of violence but sponsored dialogues between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas Bush supported Sharon s unilateral disengagement plan and lauded the democratic elections held in Palestine after Arafat s death br Bush also expressed U S support for the defense of Taiwan following the stand off in April with China over the Hainan Island incident when an EP E Aries II surveillance aircraft collided with a People s Liberation Army Air Force jet leading to the detention of U S personnel From to Bush authorized U S military intervention in Haiti and Liberia to protect U S interests Bush condemned the militia attacks Darfur and denounced the killings in Sudan as genocide Bush said an international peacekeeping presence was critical in Darfur but he opposed referring the situation to the International Criminal Court br On June Bush met with Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha and became the first president to visit Albania He later voiced his support for the independence of Kosovo br In early Bush vowed full support for admitting Ukraine and Georgia into NATO despite Russia s opposition to the further enlargement of NATO During the Russo Georgian diplomatic crisis Bush condemned Russia for recognizing the separatist government of South Ossetia When Russian troops invaded Georgia later that summer Bush said Bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the st century br br br September attacks br br The September terrorist attacks were a major turning point in Bush s presidency That evening he addressed the nation from the Oval Office promising a strong response to the attacks He also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims Three days after the attacks Bush visited Ground Zero and met with Mayor Rudy Giuliani firefighters police officers and volunteers Bush addressed the gathering via a megaphone while standing on rubble I can hear you The rest of the world hears you And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon br br In a September speech Bush condemned Osama bin Laden and his organization al Qaeda and issued an ultimatum to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan where bin Laden was operating to hand over the terrorists or share in their fate The Taliban s leader Mullah Omar refused to hand over bin Laden br The continued presence of U S troops in Saudi Arabia after the Gulf War was one of the stated motivations behind the September attacks In the U S withdrew most of its troops from Saudi Arabia br br br War on terror br br In Bush s September speech he declared that our war on terror begins with Al Qaeda but it does not end there In his January State of the Union Address he asserted that an axis of evil consisting of North Korea Iran and Ba athist Iraq was arming to threaten the peace of the world and pose d a grave and growing danger The Bush Administration asserted both a right and the intention to wage preemptive war or preventive war This became the basis for the Bush Doctrine which weakened the unprecedented levels of international and domestic support for the United States which had followed the September attacks br Dissent and criticism of Bush s leadership in the War on Terror increased as the war in Iraq continued The Iraq war sparked many protests and riots in different parts of the world In a National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the Iraq War had become the cause c l bre for jihadists br br br Afghanistan invasion br br On October U S and British forces initiated bombing campaigns that led to the arrival of Northern Alliance troops in Kabul on November The main goals of the war were to defeat the Taliban drive al Qaeda out of Afghanistan and capture key al Qaeda leaders In December the Pentagon reported that the Taliban had been defeated but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening Taliban and al Qaeda leaders Later that month the UN had installed the Afghan Transitional Administration chaired by Hamid Karzai br Efforts to kill or capture al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden failed as he escaped a battle in December in the

State of the Union address Bush began publicly focusing attention on Iraq which he labeled as part of an axis of evil allied with terrorists and posing a grave and growing danger to U S interests through possession of weapons of mass destruction br In the latter half of CIA reports contained assertions of Saddam Hussein s intent of reconstituting nuclear weapons programs not properly accounting for Iraqi biological and chemical weapons and that some Iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the UN sanctions Contentions that the Bush Administration manipulated or exaggerated the threat and evidence of Iraq s weapons of mass destruction capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the president br In late and early Bush urged the United Nations to enforce Iraqi disarmament mandates precipitating a diplomatic crisis In November Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei led UN weapons inspectors in Iraq but were advised by the U S to depart the country four days prior to the U S invasion despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks The U S initially sought a UN Security Council resolution authorizing the use of military force but dropped the bid for UN approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries The Bush administration s claim that the Iraq War was part of the War on Terror had been questioned and contested by political analysts br More than nations most notably the United Kingdom designated the coalition of the willing joined the United States in invading Iraq They launched the invasion on March The Iraqi military was quickly defeated The capital Baghdad fell on April On May Bush declared the end of major combat operations in Iraq The initial success of U S operations increased his popularity but the U S and allied forces faced a growing insurgency led by sectarian groups Bush s Mission Accomplished speech was later criticized as premature From until the situation in Iraq deteriorated further with some observers arguing that there was a full scale civil war in Iraq Bush s policies met with criticism including demands domestically to set a timetable to withdraw troops from Iraq The report of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group led by James Baker concluded that the situation in Iraq was grave and deteriorating While Bush admitted there were strategic mistakes made in regard to the stability

President s Surveillance Program The new directive allowed the National Security Agency to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the U S and parties within the U S without obtaining a warrant which previously had been required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act As of the other provisions of the program remained highly classified Once the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel questioned its original legal opinion that FISA did not apply in a time of war the program was subsequently re authorized by the President on the basis that the warrant requirements of FISA were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists The program proved to be controversial critics of the administration and organizations such as the American Bar Association argued that it was illegal In August a U S district court judge ruled that the NSA electronic surveillance program was unconstitutional but on July that ruling was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing On January Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed U S Senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the President but would be subjected to judicial oversight Later in the NSA launched a replacement for the program

Guardian emerged in June br br br Interrogation policies br br Bush authorized the CIA to use waterboarding and several other enhanced interrogation techniques that several critics including Barack Obama would label as torture Between and the CIA considered certain enhanced interrogation techniques such as waterboarding to be legal based on secret Justice Department legal opinions arguing that

the technique on certain key terrorist suspects under authority given to it in the Bybee Memo from the Attorney General though that memo was later withdrawn While not permitted by the U S Army Field Manuals which assert that harsh interrogation tactics elicit unreliable information the Bush administration believed these enhanced interrogations provided critical information to preserve American lives Critics such as former CIA officer Bob Baer have stated that information was suspect you can get anyone to confess to anything if the torture s bad enough br On October Bush signed the Military Commissions Act of into law The new rule was enacted in the wake of the Supreme Court s decision in Hamdan v Rumsfeld U S which allowed the U S government to prosecute unlawful enemy combatants by military commission rather than a standard trial The law also denied the detainees access to habeas corpus and barred the torture of prisoners The provision of the law allowed the president to determine what constitutes torture br On March Bush vetoed H R a bill that would have expanded congressional oversight over the intelligence community and banned the use of waterboarding as well as other forms of interrogation not permitted under the United States Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations saying that the bill Congress sent me would take away one of the most valuable tools in the War on Terror In April the ACLU sued and won release of the secret memos that had authorized the Bush administration s interrogation tactics One memo detailed specific interrogation tactics including a footnote that described waterboarding as torture as well as that the form of waterboarding used by the CIA was far more intense than authorized by the Justice Department br br br North Korea condemnation br br Bush publicly condemned Kim Jong il of North Korea and identified North Korea as one of three states in an axis of evil He said that the United States of America will not permit the world s most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world s most destructive weapons Within months both countries had walked away from their respective

was a result of a series of three way talks initiated by the United States and including China On September North Korea agreed to disclose and dismantle all its nuclear programs by the end of By May

resources on personal luxuries and nuclear weapons programs br br br Syria sanctions br Bush expanded economic sanctions on Syria In Bush signed the Syria Accountability Act which expanded sanctions
