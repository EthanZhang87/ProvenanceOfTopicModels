San Carlos Spanish for St Charles is a city in San Mateo County California United States The population is per the census br br br History br br br Native Americans br br Prior to the Spanish arrival in the land of San Carlos was occupied by a group of Native Americans who called themselves the Lamchins While they considered themselves to have a separate identity from other local tribes modern scholars consider them to be a part of the Ohlone or Costanoan tribes that inhabited the Bay Area br The Lamchins referred to the area of their primary residence probably on the north bank of Pulgas creek as Cachanihtac which included their word for vermin When the Spanish arrived they translated this as the fleas or las Pulgas giving many places and roads their modern names br The Native American life was one of traditional hunting and gathering There was plentiful game and fowl available and fish could be caught in the San Francisco Bay There were also grasses plants and oak trees for acorns and archaeological finds of mortars and pestles indicate that these source were processed for food No doubt they also participated in the regional trading networks for goods that could not be gathered or grown locally br The Lamchin permanent village is thought to have been between the modern streets of Alameda de las Pulgas and Cordilleras Avenue near San Carlos Avenue br br br Spanish colonial era br br In Gaspar de Portol was the first westerner to reach the San Francisco Bay While early historians placed his approach to the Bay from the Pacific Ocean as coming over the San Carlos hills present researchers believe this discovery actually occurred in present day Belmont br The Spanish with overwhelming military and economic advantages over the native population quickly dominated the Bay Area Initially the missionaries invited local people to join them at Mission San Francisco de As s Mission Dolores and convert to Christianity Facing the end of their way of life the local population had little choice but to seek assistance from the missions and convert to Christianity Traditional trade routes and alliances fell apart The Lamchin were one of the first local peoples to move to the mission The first Lamchin were baptized at the mission in and last A total of Lamchin people appear in the mission s baptismal records br Afterward the land was deeded in large ranchos or ranches to prominent and wealthy Spaniards with no concern for the native populations that lived on them The new ranch owners raised cattle on the lands displacing the native game populations and disrupting the food supply of the indigenous population As well the Spanish strongly discouraged the Native Americans from their periodic controlled burns which helped maintain the grasslands br The land now occupied by the city of San Carlos was deeded as a single large rancho to Don Jos Dar o Arg ello He and his family did not live there but rather raised cattle and crops for money on Rancho Cachinetac a Spanish derivation of Cachanihtac Jos s son Luis Arg ello was the first California born governor of the state and after his death in the remaining family moved to the ranch now known as Rancho de las Pulgas The family abode was located at the present day intersection of Magnolia and Cedar streets br br br Late th century br br While the California Gold Rush of found no gold nearby disappointed Sierra Nevada prospectors made their way to the region bringing the first non Spanish western settlers The Arg ello family retained deed to their ranch through the transfer of governments to the United States and in the s began selling parcels of it through their agent S M Mezes br While the port of Redwood City to the south and the town of Belmont to the north both grew quickly in the late th century San Carlos growth was much slower Major portions were purchased by the Brittan Family the Hull Family the Ralston family and Timothy Guy Phelps br br Timothy Phelps a wealthy politician made an early attempt to further develop the San Carlos area He paid for significant improvements such as sewer lines and street grading and began to promote lot sales in what he immodestly called The Town of Phelps br Phelps sales were largely unsuccessful and he eventually sold much of his land to Nicholas T Smith s San Carlos Land Development Company Other developers were not overly fond of Phelps eponymous efforts and decided to rename the town Some maps are existent referring to the area as Lomitas little hills in Spanish but eventually due to historical legend the name San Carlos was chosen As noted previously it was believed that Portol had first seen the San Francisco Bay on November from the San Carlos hills November is the feast day of St Charles As well the Spanish king at the time was Carlos III and the first ship to sail into San Francisco bay was the San Carlos br The newly named region not yet incorporated received a boost with the construction of the Peninsula Railroad Corridor in and the addition of a station at San Carlos in br Growth remained slow through the turn of the th century with most residents enjoying the short minute train ride to San Francisco while living in a rural setting The Hull family operated a dairy located at the modern intersection of Hull and Laurel Many of the other residents which were not involved in agriculture were wealthy business and professional men who worked with the railroad or in San Francisco br Despite the efforts of the developers growth was very slow in this period and San Carlos ended the th century with fewer than one hundred houses and families br br br br br The turn of the th century saw the layout of the initial town streets While Old County Road east of the railroad track had been in use as a stage line since at least the present day layout west of the railroad track was constructed in the first years of Cedar Elm Laurel Magnolia Maple renamed El Camino Real and Walnut were put down in this time br Growth remained slow through the first fifteen years of the new century but in the town had grown enough to build a school at Elm Street One year previously Frederick Drake The Father of San Carlos had purchased acres hectares of real estate in San Carlos in foreclosure and began marketing it Growth came quickly and the early s saw Drake build an office at the southwest corner of Cypress now San Carlos Ave and El Camino Real which is still existent and as of May is home to Drake s Restaurant dedicated to Frederick Drake br In the early s the cypresses along Cypress Ave were removed and the street widened and renamed San Carlos Ave In the growing municipality founded a fire station and in the founders voted to incorporate br The Great Depression affected families in San Carlos as it did everywhere but growth continued and population grew from approximately at incorporation in to in br While services such as stores increased in this period by the beginning of World War II San Carlos was still known in the Bay Area as a rural community Most of the land in the municipality was still used for agricultural purposes and photographs of the time show a landscape with few houses separated by large fields br br br br br br War Dogs br During World War II not long after the attack on Pearl Harbor the American Kennel Club and a new group calling itself Dogs for Defense mobilized dog owners across the country to donate quality animals to the Quartermaster Corps Dogs donated by a patriotic public to the Army saved the lives of a number of soldiers in combat br In October the US Army and Dogs for Defense came to San Carlos The acre site at the top of today s Club and Crestview Drives which was locally known as the H and H Ranch was selected to become the US Army War Dog Reception and Training Center also known as Western Remount Area Reception and Training Center It was established between October and November br The first enlisted men for the army post were temporarily housed in the San Carlos Fire Station located on Laurel Street between San Carlos Ave and Holly St from December to Each dog handler was given four dogs to train and at the end of the
