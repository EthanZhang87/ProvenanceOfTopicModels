Applied Materials Inc is an American corporation that supplies equipment services and software for the manufacture of semiconductor integrated circuit chips for electronics flat panel displays for computers smartphones televisions and solar products The company also supplies equipment to produce coatings for flexible electronics packaging and other applications The company is headquartered in Santa Clara California and is the second largest supplier of semiconductor equipment in the world based on revenue behind ASML of Netherlands br br br History br Founded in by Michael A McNeilly and others Applied Materials went public in In subsequent years the company diversified until James C Morgan became CEO in and returned the company s focus to its core business of semiconductor manufacturing equipment By sales increased by br In Applied Materials became the first U S semiconductor equipment manufacturer to open its own technology center in Japan and the first semiconductor equipment company to operate a service center in China In Applied introduced a chemical vapor deposition CVD machine called the Precision which differed from existing machines by incorporating diverse processes into a single machine that had multiple process chambers br In the corporation settled a lawsuit with three former employees for an estimated The suit complained that the employees were driven out of the company after complaining about the courses Applied Scholastics had been hired to teach there br In the Applied Materials Precision was inducted into the Smithsonian Institution s permanent collection of Information Age technology br In November Applied Materials acquired two Israeli companies for an aggregate amount of million Opal Technologies and Orbot Instruments for million and million in cash respectively Orbot produces systems for inspecting patterned silicon wafers for yield enhancement during the semiconductor manufacturing process as well as systems for inspecting masks used during the patterning process Opal develops and manufactures high speed metrology systems used by semiconductor manufacturers to verify critical dimensions during the production of integrated circuits br In Etec Systems Inc was purchased The following year on June Applied Materials acquired Israeli company Oramir Semiconductor Equipment Ltd a supplier of laser cleaning technologies for semiconductor wafers in a purchase business combination for million in cash br In January Applied Materials purchased Baccini an Italian company and designer of tools used in manufacturing solar cells br In Applied Materials opened its Solar Technology Center the world s largest commercial solar energy research and development facility in Xi an China br Applied Materials acquired Semitool Inc in December and announced its acquisition of Varian Semiconductor in May Applied Materials then announced a planned merger with Tokyo Electron on September If approved by government regulators the combined company to be called Eteris would be the world s largest supplier of semiconductor processing equipment with a total market value of billion However on April Applied Materials announced that its merger with Tokyo Electron has been scrapped due to antitrust concerns and fears of dominating the semiconductor equipment industry br In Applied Materials left the solar wafer sawing and the solar ion implantation businesses br Applied Materials was named among FORTUNE World s Most Admired Companies in br In Applied Materials announced its intention to buy semiconductor equipment manufacturer and former Hitachi group member Kokusai Electric Corporation from private equity firm KKR for billion but terminated the deal in March citing delays in getting approval from China s regulator br In November Applied Materials was reported to be under criminal investigation by the United States Department of Justice for routing equipment to Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation via South Korea in violation of US sanctions br br br Finances br For the fiscal year Applied Materials reported earnings of US billion with an annual revenue of US billion a increase over the previous fiscal Applied Materials market capitalization was valued at over US billion in November br br br Organization br Applied is organized into three major business sectors Semiconductor Products Applied Global Services and Display and Adjacent Markets Applied Materials also operates a venture investing arm called Applied Ventures br br br Semiconductor Products br The company develops and manufactures equipment used in the wafer fabrication steps of creating a semiconductor device including atomic layer deposition ALD chemical vapor deposition CVD physical vapor deposition PVD rapid thermal processing RTP chemical mechanical polishing CMP etch ion implantation and wafer inspection The company acquired Semitool for this group in late In Applied Materials agreed to buy semiconductor manufacturer Kokusai for Billion br br br Applied Global Services br The Applied Global Services AGS group offers equipment installation support and warranty extended support as well as maintenance support AGS also offers new and refurbished equipment as well as upgrades and enhancements for installed base equipment This sector also includes automation software for manufacturing environments br br br Display and Adjacent Markets br AGS combined an existing business unit with the display business of Applied Films Corporation acquired in mid br The manufacturing process for TFT LCDs thin film transistor liquid crystal displays commonly employed in computer monitors and televisions is similar to that employed for integrated circuits In cleanroom environments both TFT LCD and integrated circuit production use photolithography chemical and physical vapor deposition and testing br br br Energy and Environmental Solutions former sector br In the company acquired Applied Films a glass coating and web coating business Also in Applied announced it was entering the solar manufacturing equipment business The solar glass and web businesses were organized into the company s Energy and Environmental Solutions EES sector br In Applied Materials announced the Applied SunFab thin film photovoltaic module production line with single or tandem junction capability SunFab applies silicon thin film layers to glass substrate that then produce electricity when exposed to sunlight In the company s SunFab line was certified by the International Electrotechnical Commission IEC In Applied announced that it was abandoning the thin film market and closing down their SunFab division Also in the company acquired privately held Switzerland based HCT Shaping Systems SA a specialist in wafer sawing tools for both solar and semiconductor wafer manufacture paying approximately million br In Applied acquired privately held Italy based Baccini SpA for M company that worked in the metallization steps of solar cell manufacturing The company was listed at the top of VLSI Research s list of supplier of photovoltaic manufacturing equipment for with sales of M br Since July the Energy and Environmental Solutions sector is no longer reported separately Remaining solar business activities have been included in Corporate and Others br br br
