Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol XMPP originally named Jabber is an open communication protocol designed for instant messaging IM presence information and contact list maintenance Based on XML Extensible Markup Language it enables the near real time exchange of structured data between two or more network entities Designed to be extensible the protocol offers a multitude of applications beyond traditional IM in the broader realm of message oriented middleware including signalling for VoIP video file transfer gaming and other uses br Unlike most commercial instant messaging protocols XMPP is defined in an open standard in the application layer The architecture of the XMPP network is similar to email anyone can run their own XMPP server and there is no central master server This federated open system approach allows users to interoperate with others on any server using a JID user account similar to an email address XMPP implementations can be developed using any software license and many server client and library implementations are distributed as free and open source software Numerous freeware and commercial software implementations also exist br Originally developed by the open source community the protocols were formalized as an approved instant messaging standard in and have been continuously developed with new extensions and features Various XMPP client software are available on both desktop and mobile platforms and devices by the protocol was used by over ten million people worldwide on the network according to the XMPP Standards Foundation br br br Protocol characteristics br br br Decentralization br br The XMPP network architecture is reminiscent of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP a client server model clients do not talk directly to one another as it is decentralized anyone can run a server By design there is no central authoritative server as there is with messaging services such as AIM WLM WhatsApp or Telegram Some confusion often arises on this point as there is a public XMPP server being run at jabber org to which many users subscribe However anyone may run their own XMPP server on their own domain br br br Addressing br br Every user on the network has a unique XMPP address called JID for historical reasons XMPP addresses are often called Jabber IDs The JID is structured like an email address with a username and a domain name or IP address for the server where that user resides separated by an at sign for example alice example com here alice is the username and example com the server with which the user is registered br Since a user may wish to log in from multiple locations they may specify a resource A resource identifies a particular client belonging to the user for example home work or mobile This may be included in the JID by appending a slash followed by the name of the resource For example the full JID of a user s mobile account could be username example com mobile br Each resource may have specified a numerical value called priority Messages simply sent to username example com will go to the client with highest priority but those sent to username example com mobile will go only to the mobile client The highest priority is the one with largest numerical value br JIDs without a username part are also valid and may be used for system messages and control of special features on the server A resource remains optional for these JIDs as well br The means to route messages based on a logical endpoint identifier the JID instead of by an explicit IP Address present opportunities to use XMPP as an Overlay network implementation on top of different underlay networks br br br XMPP via HTTP br The original and native transport protocol for XMPP is Transmission Control Protocol TCP using open ended XML streams over long lived TCP connections As an alternative to the TCP transport the XMPP community has also developed an HTTP transport for web clients as well as users behind restricted firewalls In the original specification XMPP could use HTTP in two ways polling and binding The polling method now deprecated essentially implies messages stored on a server side database are being fetched and posted regularly by an XMPP client by way of HTTP GET and POST requests The binding method implemented using Bidirectional streams Over Synchronous HTTP BOSH allows servers to push messages to clients as soon as they are sent This push model of notification is more efficient than polling where many of the polls return no new data br Because the client uses HTTP most firewalls allow clients to fetch and post messages without any hindrances Thus in scenarios where the TCP port used by XMPP is blocked a server can listen on the normal HTTP port and the traffic should pass without problems Various websites let people sign into XMPP via a browser Furthermore there are open public servers that listen on standard http port and https port ports and hence allow connections from behind most firewalls However the IANA registered port for BOSH is actually not br br br Extensibility br The XMPP Standards Foundation or XSF formerly the Jabber Software Foundation is active in developing open XMPP extensions so called XEP However extensions can also be defined by any individual software project or organization To maintain interoperability common extensions are managed by the XSF XMPP applications beyond IM include chat rooms network management content syndication collaboration tools file sharing gaming remote systems control and monitoring geolocation middleware and cloud computing VoIP and identity services br Building on its capability to support discovery across local network domains XMPP is well suited for cloud computing where virtual machines networks and firewalls would otherwise present obstacles to alternative service discovery and presence based solutions Cloud computing and storage systems rely on various forms of communication over multiple levels including not only messaging between systems to relay state but also the migration or distribution of larger objects such as storage or virtual machines Along with authentication and in transit data protection XMPP can be applied at a variety of levels and may prove ideal as an extensible middleware or Message oriented middleware MOM protocol br br br Current limitations br At the moment XMPP does not support Quality of Service QoS assured delivery of messages has to be built on top of the XMPP layer There are two XEPs proposed to deal with this issue XEP Message delivery receipts which is currently a draft standard and XEP Chat Markers which is considered experimental br Since XML is text based normal XMPP has a higher network overhead compared to purely binary solutions This issue was being addressed by the experimental XEP Efficient XML Interchange EXI Format where XML is serialized in an efficient binary manner especially in schema informed mode This XEP is currently deferred br In band binary data transfer is limited Binary data must be first base encoded before it can be transmitted in band Therefore any significant amount of binary data e g file transfers is best transmitted out of band using in band messages to coordinate The best example of this is the Jingle XMPP Extension Protocol XEP br br br Features br br br Peer to peer sessions br Using the extension called Jingle XMPP can provide an open means to support machine to machine or peer to peer communications across a diverse set of networks This feature is mainly used for IP telephony VoIP br br br Multi user chat br XMPP supports conferences with multiple users using the specification Multi User Chat MUC XEP From the point of view of a normal user it is comparable to Internet Relay Chat IRC br br br Security and encryption br XMPP servers can be isolated e g on a company intranet and secure authentication SASL and point to point encryption TLS have been built into the core XMPP specifications as well as br Off the Record Messaging OTR is an extension of XMPP enabling encryption of messages and data It has since been replaced by a better extension multi end to multi end encryption OMEMO XEP end to end encryption between users This gives a higher level of security by encrypting all data from the source client and decrypting again at the target client the server operator cannot decrypt the data they are forwarding br Messages can also be encrypted with OpenPGP for example with the software Gajim br br br Service discovery br While several service discovery protocols exist today such as zeroconf or the Service Location Protocol XMPP provides a solid base for the discovery of services residing locally or across a network and the availability of these services via presence information as specified by XEP DISCO br br br Connecting to other protocols br br One of the original design goals of the early Jabber open source community was enabling users to connect to multiple instant messaging systems especially non XMPP systems through a single client application This was done through entities called transports or gateways to other instant messaging protocols like ICQ AIM or Yahoo Messenger but also to protocols such as SMS IRC or email Unlike multi protocol clients XMPP provides this access at the server level by communicating via special gateway services running alongside an XMPP server Any user can register with one of these gateways by providing the information needed to log on to that network and can then communicate with users of that network as though they were XMPP users Thus such gateways function as client proxies the gateway authenticates on the user s behalf on the non XMPP service As a result any client that fully supports XMPP can access any network with a gateway without extra code in the client and without the need for the client to have direct access to the Internet However the client proxy model may violate terms of service on the protocol used although such terms of service are not legally enforceable in several countries and also requires the user to send their IM username and password to the third party site that operates the transport which may raise privacy and security concerns br Another type of gateway is a server to server gateway which enables a non XMPP server deployment to connect to native XMPP servers using the built in interdomain federation features of XMPP Such server to server gateways are offered by several enterprise IM software products including br br HCL Sametime Premium br Skype for Business Server formerly named Microsoft Lync Server and Microsoft Office Communications Server OCS br br br Software br XMPP is implemented by many clients servers and code libraries These implementations are provided under a variety of software licenses br br br Servers br Numerous XMPP server software exist some well known ones include ejabberd and Prosody br br br Clients br br A large number of XMPP client software exist on various modern and legacy platforms including both graphical and command line based clients According to the XMPP website some of the most popular software include Conversations Android Dino BSD Windows Unix Linux Converse js web browser Linux Windows macOS Gajim Windows Linux Monal macOS iOS and Swift IM macOS Windows Linux br Other clients include Bombus ChatSecure Coccinella Miranda NG Pidgin Psi Tkabber Trillian and Xabber br br br Deployment and distribution br There are thousands of XMPP servers worldwide many public ones as well as private individuals or organizations running their own servers without commercial intent Numerous websites show a list of public XMPP servers where users may register at for example on the XMPP net website br Several large public IM services natively use or used XMPP including LiveJournal s LJ Talk Nimbuzz and HipChat Various hosting services such as DreamHost enable hosting customers to choose XMPP services alongside more traditional web and email services Specialized XMPP hosting services also exist in form of cloud so that domain owners need not directly run their own XMPP servers including Cisco Webex Connect Chrome pl Flosoft biz i pobox net and hosted im br XMPP is also used in deployments of non IM services including smart grid systems such as demand response applications message oriented middleware and as a replacement for SMS to provide text messaging on many smartphone clients br br br Non native deployments br Some of the largest messaging providers use or have been using various forms of XMPP based protocols in their backend systems without necessarily exposing this fact to their end users One example is Google which in August introduced Google Talk a combination VoIP and IM system that uses XMPP for instant messaging and as a base for a voice and file transfer signaling protocol called Jingle The initial launch did not include server to server communications Google enabled that feature on January Google later added video functionality to Google Talk also using the Jingle protocol for signaling In May Google announced XMPP compatibility would be dropped from Google Talk for server to server federation although it would retain client to server support Google Talk has since been dropped from Google s line of products br In January AOL introduced experimental XMPP support for its AOL Instant Messenger AIM service allowing AIM users to communicate using XMPP However in March this service was discontinued As of May AOL offers limited XMPP support br In February the social networking site Facebook opened up its chat feature to third party applications via XMPP Some functionality was unavailable through XMPP and support was dropped in April Similarly in December Microsoft released an XMPP interface to its Microsoft Messenger service Skype its de facto successor also provided limited XMPP support Apache Wave is another example br XMPP is the de facto standard for private chat in gaming related platforms such as Origin and PlayStation as well as the now discontinued Xfire and Raptr Two notable exceptions are Steam and Xbox LIVE both use their own proprietary messaging protocols br br br History and development br br Jeremie Miller began working on the Jabber technology in and released the first version of the jabberd server on January The early Jabber community focused on open source software mainly the jabberd server but its major outcome proved to be the development of the XMPP protocol br The Internet Engineering Task Force IETF formed an XMPP working group in to formalize the core protocols as an IETF instant messaging and presence technology The early Jabber protocol as developed in and formed the basis for XMPP as published in RFC and RFC in October the primary changes during formalization by the IETF s XMPP Working Group were the addition of TLS for channel encryption and SASL for authentication The XMPP Working group also produced specifications RFC and RFC In RFC and RFC were superseded by RFC and RFC respectively with RFC specifying the XMPP address format In RFC was superseded by RFC In addition to these core protocols standardized at the IETF the XMPP Standards Foundation formerly the Jabber Software Foundation is active in developing open XMPP extensions br The first IM service based on XMPP was Jabber org which has operated continuously and offered free accounts since From until February the service used jabberd as its server software at which time it migrated to ejabberd both of which are free software application servers In January the service migrated to the proprietary M Link server software produced by Isode Ltd br In September Cisco Systems acquired Jabber Inc the creators of the commercial product Jabber XCP br The XMPP Standards Foundation XSF develops and publishes extensions to XMPP through a standards process centered on XMPP Extension Protocols XEPs previously known as Jabber Enhancement Proposals JEPs The following extensions are in especially wide use br br Data Forms br Service Discovery br Multi User Chat br Publish Subscribe and Personal Eventing Protocol br XHTML IM br File Transfer br Entity Capabilities br HTTP Binding br Jingle for voice and video br br br Internet of Things br XMPP features such as federation across domains publish subscribe authentication and its security even for mobile endpoints are being used to implement the Internet of Things Several XMPP extensions are part of the experimental implementation Efficient XML Interchange EXI Format Sensor Data Provisioning Control Concentrators Discovery br These efforts are documented on a page in the XMPP wiki dedicated to Internet of Things and the XMPP IoT mailing list br br br Specifications and standards br The IETF XMPP working group has produced a series of Request for Comments RFC documents br br RFC superseded

JIDs Currently JIDs use PRECIS as defined in RFC for handling of Unicode characters outside the ASCII range br br br Competing standards br XMPP has often been regarded as a competitor to SIMPLE based on Session Initiation Protocol SIP as the standard protocol for instant messaging and presence notification br The XMPP extension for multi user chat can be seen as a competitor to Internet Relay Chat IRC although IRC is far simpler has far fewer features and is far more widely used br The XMPP extensions for publish subscribe provide many of the same features as the Advanced Message Queuing
