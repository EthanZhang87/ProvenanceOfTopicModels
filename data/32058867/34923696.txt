mother and sister were both fighting breast cancer at the time and Young created two pages to promote cancer awareness She quickly amassed over friends by sending friend invites to others supportive of the cancer cause and by receiving requests from strangers who were interested in and concerned about her cancer patient support efforts Young then came across a page praying for the death of U S President Barack Obama and she spoke out against the page She was then subjected to hatred violence discrimination threats pornography kkk violence and personal attacks sic In conjunction with her public opposition of the hate page and her allegedly spammy activity her profile was disabled br Young then traveled from Maryland to Facebook s headquarters in California and sought reactivation of her account In testimony she stated that she did not receive human interaction with a Facebook account representative at Facebook s offices and had to provide a written message to a receptionist for forwarding to an unknown recipient She filled out a complaint form and was not allowed to speak with a Facebook account representative Later she received Facebook email stating her account was reactivated but she was not provided any opportunity to discuss her account details so she traveled back to Maryland Shortly thereafter Young again found her account disabled According to Facebook Young had engaged in activity that violated Facebook s statement of rights and responsibilities although Young states she did nothing to prompt the second disabling of her account which resulted in permanent termination of her account Young then drove back to California to file a lawsuit in the Northern District of California br br br Original complaint and motion to dismiss br Young claimed six causes of action in her first complaint against Facebook a violation of her First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights a breach of contract a breach of implied covenant of faith and fair dealing negligence and fraud br br br Civil rights violation br Young argued that Facebook deprived her of equal protection under the law by terminating her account and she sought to state this claim under U S C She pointed out her disability She claimed that Facebook was a government actor and acted under color of state law She stated that Facebook hosted the profiles of several State and government departments demonstrating a contract between Facebook and the state br However Facebook argued that it was a private entity and the court agreed arguing that Young shows no relationship between Facebook s government contracts and the particular actions that she alleges violated her rights br br br Breach of contract br Young referenced Facebook s own statement of rights and responsibilities that forbids users against posting content that is hateful threatening or pornographic incites violence or contains nudity and claimed that Facebook acted in deliberate indifference to the rights of the Plaintiff br However Facebook has long held a policy against any policing of content in its statement of rights and responsibilities The court agreed and stated while these provisions place restrictions on users behavior they do not create affirmative obligations br br br Breach of implied covenant of faith and fair dealing br Young claimed that Facebook broke the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by failing to provide the adequate safety services it advertised and by ultimately deactivating the account without human interaction br Facebook claimed that it never agreed to provide safety services and that the covenant of good faith could not alter that fact Furthermore Facebook was also protected under Section of the Communications Decency Act which provides immunity for internet service providers who publish information generated by third parties br The court sided with Facebook on this point as well stating that Facebook had sent Young an email notifying her of the account termination in accordance with its policies upholding its contract br br br Negligence and fraud br The plaintiff alleged negligence and fraud on the part of Facebook However the court found that the plaintiff did not show that Facebook had a duty on which to base the negligence claim and that the plaintiff s claim of fraud lacked enough specificity to proceed with legal pleading br br br Holding br Given the rationale Judge Jeremy Fogel of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted Facebook s motion to dismiss the claim with leave to amend br br br Motion to dismiss amended complaint br The plaintiff amended her complaint to include claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act and related state laws Facebook moved to dismiss the plaintiff s complaints and Judge Fogel granted the motion on May finding that Facebook was not a physical place for the purpose of the Americans with Disabilities Act despite its frequent use of terms such as posts and walls Judge Fogel denied leave to amend br br br Reception br Eric Goldman an internet law professor at Santa Clara University noted that Section of the Communications Decency Act could well apply to at least some of Young s claims from the second complaint br br br See also br National Federation of the Blind v Target Corporation br Ouellette v
