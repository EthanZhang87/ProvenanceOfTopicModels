br Length br A short con or small con is a fast swindle which takes just minutes possibly seconds It typically aims to rob the victim of his money or other valuables which they carry on their person or are guarding A long con or big con also chiefly British English long game is a scam that unfolds over several days or weeks it may involve a team of swindlers and even props sets extras costumes and scripted lines It aims to rob the victim of a huge amount of money or other valuables often by getting them to empty out banking accounts and borrow from family members br br br History br The shell game dates back at least to Ancient Greece William Thompson was the original confidence man Thompson was a clumsy swindler who asked his victims to express confidence in him by giving him money or their watch rather than gaining their confidence in a more nuanced way A few people trusted Thompson with their money and watches Thompson was arrested in July Reporting about this arrest James Houston a reporter for the New York Herald publicized Thompson by naming him the Confidence Man Although Thompson was an unsuccessful scammer he gained the reputation as a genius operator mostly because Houston s satirical tone was not understood as such The National Police Gazette coined the term confidence game a few weeks after Houston first used the name confidence man br br br Stages br In Confessions of a Confidence Man Edward H Smith lists the six definite steps or stages of growth of a confidence game He notes that some steps may be omitted It is also possible some can be done in a different order than the one shown or carried out simultaneously br br Foundation work br Preparations are made in advance of the game including the hiring of any assistants required and studying the background knowledge needed for the role br Approach br The victim is approached or contacted br Build up br The victim is given an opportunity to profit from participating in a scheme The victim s greed is encouraged such that their rational judgment of the situation might be impaired br Pay off or convincer br The victim receives a small payout as a demonstration of the scheme s purported effectiveness This may be a real amount of money or faked in some way including physically or electronically In a gambling con the victim is allowed to win several small bets In a stock market con the victim is given fake dividends br The hurrah br A sudden manufactured crisis or change of events forces the victim to act or make a decision immediately This is the point at which the con succeeds or fails With a financial scam the con artist may tell the victim that the window of opportunity to make a large investment in the scheme is about to suddenly close forever br The in and in br A conspirator in on the con but assumes the role of an interested bystander puts an amount of money into the same scheme as the victim to add an appearance of legitimacy This can reassure the victim and give the con man greater control when the deal has been completed br In addition some games require a corroboration step particularly those involving a fake but purportedly rare item of great value This usually includes the use of an accomplice who plays the part of an uninvolved initially skeptical third party who later confirms the claims made by the con man br br br Vulnerability factors br Confidence tricks exploit characteristics such as greed dishonesty vanity opportunism lust compassion credulity irresponsibility desperation and na vety As such there is no consistent profile of a confidence trick victim the common factor is simply that the victim relies on the good faith of the con artist Victims of investment scams tend to show an incautious level of greed and gullibility and many con artists target the elderly and other people thought to be vulnerable using various forms of confidence tricks Researchers Huang and Orbach argue br br Cons succeed for inducing judgment errors chiefly errors arising from imperfect information and cognitive biases In popular culture and among professional con men the human vulnerabilities that cons exploit are depicted as dishonesty greed and gullibility of the marks Dishonesty often represented by the expression you can t cheat an honest man refers to the willingness of marks to participate in unlawful acts such as rigged gambling and embezzlement Greed the desire to get something for nothing is a shorthand expression of marks beliefs that too good to be true gains are realistic Gullibility reflects beliefs that marks are suckers and fools for entering into costly voluntary exchanges Judicial opinions occasionally echo these sentiments br br br Online fraud br br Fraud has rapidly adapted to the Internet The Internet Crime Complaint Center IC of the FBI received reports in with a reported loss of money of billion in the US alone The Global Anti Scam Alliance annual Global State of Scam Report stated that
