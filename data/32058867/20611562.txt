The Indian subcontinent is a physiographical region in Southern Asia mostly situated on the Indian Plate projecting southwards into the Indian Ocean from the Himalayas Geographically it spans the countries of Bangladesh Bhutan the British Indian Ocean Territory United Kingdom India Maldives Nepal Pakistan and Sri Lanka Although the terms Indian subcontinent and South Asia are often used interchangeably to denote the region the geopolitical term of South Asia frequently includes Afghanistan which is not considered a part of the subcontinent while excluding the British Indian Ocean Territory which is geologically associated with the subcontinent Apart from Maritime Southeast Asia Maritime South Asia is the only subregion of Asia that lies partly within the Southern Hemisphere the British Indian Ocean Territory and two out of atolls of Maldives lie entirely within the Southern Hemisphere br Geologically the subcontinent originates from Insular India an isolated landmass that rifted from the supercontinent of Gondwana during the Cretaceous and merged with the landmass of Eurasia nearly million years ago forming the Himalayas It is one of the most populated regions in the world holding roughly percent of the global population Geographically the peninsular region in Southern Asia is located below the Third Pole delineated by the Himalayas in the north the Hindu Kush in the west and the Indo Burman Ranges in the east The neighboring geographical regions around the subcontinent include the Tibetan Plateau to the north the Indochinese Peninsula to the east the Iranian Plateau to the west and the Indian Ocean to the south br br br Name br Historically the region surrounding and southeast of the Indus River was often simply referred to as India in many historical sources Even today historians use this term to denote the entire Indian subcontinent when discussing history up until the era of the British Raj Over time however India evolved to refer to a distinct political entity that eventually became a nation state br According to the Oxford English Dictionary the term subcontinent signifies a subdivision of a continent which has a distinct geographical political or cultural identity and also a large land mass somewhat smaller than a continent Its use to signify the Indian subcontinent is evidenced from the early twentieth century when most of the territory was either part of the British Empire or allied with them It was a convenient term to refer to the region comprising both British India and the princely states br The term has been particularly common in the British Empire and its successors while the term South Asia is the more common usage in Europe and North America According to historians Sugata Bose and Ayesha Jalal the Indian subcontinent has come to be known as South Asia in more recent and neutral parlance Indologist Ronald B Inden argues that the usage of the term South Asia is becoming more widespread since it clearly distinguishes the region from East Asia While South Asia a more accurate term that reflects the region s contemporary political demarcations is replacing the Indian subcontinent a term closely linked to the region s colonial heritage as a cover term the latter is still widely used in typological studies br Since the Partition of India citizens of Pakistan which became independent of British India in and Bangladesh which became independent of Pakistan in often perceive the use of the Indian subcontinent as offensive and suspicious because of the dominant placement of India in the term As such it is being increasingly less used in those countries Meanwhile many Indian analysts prefer to use the term because of the socio cultural commonalities of the region The region has also been called the Asian subcontinent the South Asian subcontinent as well as India or Greater India in the classical and pre modern sense br br br Geology br br The Indian subcontinent was formerly part of Gondwana a supercontinent formed during the late Neoproterozoic and early Paleozoic Gondwana began to break up during the Mesozoic with Insular India separating from Antarctica million years ago and Madagascar around million years ago during the Cretaceous Insular India subsequently drifted northeastwards colliding with the Eurasian Plate nearly million years ago during the Eocene forming the Indian subcontinent The zone where the Eurasian and Indian subcontinent plates meet remains geologically active prone to major earthquakes br Physiographically it is a peninsular region in South Asia delineated by the Himalayas in the north the Hindu Kush in the west and the Arakanese in the east It extends southward into the Indian Ocean with the Arabian Sea to the southwest and the Bay of Bengal to the southeast Most of this region rests on the Indian Plate and is isolated from the rest of Asia by large mountain barriers Laccadive Islands Maldives and the Chagos Archipelago are three series of coral atolls cays and Faroes on the Indian Plate along with the Chagos Laccadive Ridge a submarine ridge that was generated by the northern drift of the Indian Plate over the R union hotspot during the Cretaceous and early Cenozoic times The Maldives archipelago rises from a basement of volcanic basalt outpourings from a depth of about m forming the central part of the ridge between Laccadives and the Great Chagos Bank br br br Geography br br According to anthropologist Patrap C Dutta the Indian subcontinent occupies the major landmass of South Asia According to historian B N Mukherjee The subcontinent is an indivisible geographical entity According to geographer Dudley Stamp There is perhaps no mainland part of the world better marked off by nature as a region or a realm by itself than the Indian subcontinent br This natural physical landmass in South Asia is the dry land portion of the Indian Plate which has been relatively isolated from the rest of Eurasia The Himalayas from Brahmaputra River in the east to Indus River in the west Karakoram from Indus River in the east to Yarkand River in the west and the Hindu Kush mountains from Yarkand River westwards form its northern boundary In the west it is bounded by parts of the mountain ranges of Hindu Kush Sp n Ghar Safed Koh Sulaiman Mountains Kirthar Mountains Brahui range and Pab range among others with the Western Fold Belt along the border between the Sulaiman Range and the Chaman Fault is the western boundary of the Indian Plate where along the Eastern Hindu Kush lies the Afghanistan Pakistan border In the east it is bounded by Patkai Naga Lushai and Chin hills The Indian Ocean Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea form the boundary of the Indian subcontinent in the south south east and south west br br Given the difficulty of passage through the Himalayas the sociocultural religious and political interaction of the Indian subcontinent has largely been through the valleys of Afghanistan in its northwest the valleys of Manipur in its east and by maritime routes More difficult but historically important interaction has also occurred through passages pioneered by the Tibetans These routes and interactions have led to the spread of Buddhism out of the subcontinent into other parts of Asia The Islamic expansion arrived into the subcontinent in two ways through Afghanistan on land and to the Indian coast through the maritime routes on the Arabian Sea br br br Geopolitics br In terms of modern geopolitical boundaries the subcontinent constitutes Bangladesh Bhutan India Nepal and Pakistan besides by convention the island country of Sri Lanka and other nearby island nations of the Indian Ocean such as Maldives and the British Indian Ocean Territory Unlike South Asia sometimes the expression Indian subcontinent may exclude the islands of Maldives and Sri Lanka According to Pawan Budhwar Arup Varma and Manjusha Hirekhan India Pakistan Bangladesh Sri Lanka Nepal and Bhutan constitute the Indian subcontinent Budhwar Varma and Hirekhan also maintain that with Afghanistan and Maldives included the region is referred to as South Asia The periphery of the subcontinent including Bangladesh Pakistan and the island chains of Maldives features large Muslim populations while the heartland including most of India Nepal and Sri Lanka are overwhelmingly Hindu or Buddhist Since most of these countries are located on the Indian Plate a continuous landmass the borders between countries are often either a river or a no man s land br The precise definition of an Indian subcontinent in a geopolitical context is somewhat contested as there is no globally accepted definition on which countries are a part of South Asia or the Indian subcontinent Whether called the Indian subcontinent or South Asia the definition of the geographical extent of this region varies Afghanistan despite often considered as a part of South Asia is usually not included in the Indian subcontinent Maldives an island country consisting of a small archipelago southwest of the peninsula while largely considered a part of the Indian subcontinent sometimes is mentioned by sources including the International Monetary Fund as a group of islands away from the Indian subcontinent in a south western direction br br br See also br Arabian Peninsula br Hindustan br South Asian Association for Regional
