attractive to auction sellers most of which were individuals or small businesses that were unable to accept credit cards and for consumers as well In fact many sellers could not qualify for a credit

disbursed are kept in commercial interest bearing checking accounts br In the United States PayPal is licensed as a money transmitter on a state by state basis But state laws vary as do their definitions of banks narrow banks money services businesses and money transmitters Although PayPal is not classified as a bank the company is subject to some of the rules and regulations governing the financial industry including Regulation E consumer protections and the USA PATRIOT Act The most analogous regulatory source of law for PayPal transactions comes from peer to peer P P payments using credit and debit cards Ordinarily a credit card transaction specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder is governed by the Truth in Lending Act TILA U S C f as implemented by Regulation Z C F R TILA Z TILA Z requires specific procedures for billing errors dispute resolution and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges Similarly the legal relationship between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the Electronic Funds Transfer Act EFTA U S C r as implemented by Regulation E C F R EFTA E EFTA E is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures However because PayPal is a payment intermediary and not otherwise regulated directly TILA Z and EFTA E do not operate exactly as written once the credit debit card transaction occurs via PayPal Basically unless a PayPal transaction is funded with a credit card the consumer has no recourse in the event of fraud by the seller br In PayPal Europe was granted a Luxembourg banking license which under European Union law allows it to conduct banking business throughout the EU It is therefore regulated as a bank by Luxembourg s banking supervisory authority the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier CSSF All of the company s European accounts were transferred to PayPal s bank in Luxembourg in July Prior to the move PayPal had been registered in the United Kingdom as PayPal Europe Ltd an entity which was licensed as an Electronic Money Issuer with the UK s Financial Services Authority FSA from This ceased in when the company moved to Luxembourg br In India as of January PayPal has no cross border money transfer authorization In The New York Times article India s Central Bank Stops Some PayPal Services Reserve Bank of India spokesman Alpana Killawalla stated Providers of cross border money transfer service need prior authorization from the Reserve Bank under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act PayPal does not have our authorization PayPal is not listed in the Certificates of Authorisation issued by the Reserve Bank of India under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act for Setting up and Operating Payment System in India br PaisaPay is an Indian sister service to PayPal It is also owned by eBay PaisaPay makes possible payments from abroad by PayPal account holders to Indian sellers on eBay in br In Australia PayPal is licensed as an authorised deposit taking institution ADI and is thus subject to Australian banking laws and regulations In Singapore PayPal holds a stored value facility that does not require the approval of the Monetary Authority of Singapore br br br Safety and protection policies br The PayPal Buyer Protection Policy states that customers may file a buyer complaint for not receiving an item or if the purchased item was significantly not as described The customer can open a dispute within days from the date of payment and escalate it to a claim within days from opening the dispute Buyers using a credit card might get a refund via chargeback from their credit card company However in the UK where such a purchaser is entitled to specific statutory protections that the credit card company is a second party to the purchase and is therefore equally liable in law if the other party defaults or goes into liquidation under Section Consumer Credit Act the purchaser loses this legal protection if the card payment is processed via PayPal br Also the Financial Ombudsman Service for the U K position is that section protection does not apply where PayPal or any eMoney service becomes involved in the credit card transaction This leaves consumers with no recourse to pursue their complaint with the Financial Ombudsman Service They only would have recourse in the courts but in any event they cannot because PayPal is incorporated in Luxembourg and since the UK has left the EU is now no longer within the jurisdiction of any UK Courts The key issues that determine the applicability of section are identified very clearly in Office of Fair Trading v Lloyds TSB Bank Plc and others EWCA Civ and the Bank of Scotland v Alfred Truman a firm EWHC QB This is a legal authority that section protection does exist where one has paid on a credit card for a product via an eMoney service br According to PayPal it protects sellers in a limited fashion via the Seller Protection Policy In general the Seller Protection Policy is intended to protect the seller from certain kinds of chargebacks or complaints if the seller meets certain conditions including proof of delivery to the buyer PayPal states the Seller Protection Policy is designed to protect sellers against claims by buyers of unauthorized payments and against claims of non receipt of any merchandise The policy includes a list of Exclusions which itself includes Intangible goods Claims for receipt of goods not as described and Total reversals over the annual limit There are also other restrictions in terms of the sale itself the payment method and the destination country the item is shipped to simply having a tracking mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee the Seller Protection Policy is in effect The PayPal Seller Protection Policy does not provide the additional consumer protection afforded by UK consumer legislation most notably the Consumer Rights Act and in addition it cannot be enforced in the Courts because PayPal operates from Luxembourg outside all three of the UK legal jurisdictions br br br Security br br br Security token br br In early PayPal introduced an optional security key as an additional precaution against fraud A user account tied to a security key has a modified login process Account holders enter their login ID and password as normal but are then prompted to enter a six digit code provided by a credit card sized hardware security key or a text message sent to the account holder s mobile phone For convenience users may append the code generated by the hardware key to their password in the login screen This way they are not prompted for it on another page This method is required for some services such as when using PayPal through the eBay application on iPhone br This two factor authentication is intended to make it difficult for an account to be compromised by a malicious third party without access to the physical security key although it does not prevent the so called Man in the Browser MITB attacks However the user or malicious third party can alternatively authenticate by providing the credit card or bank account number listed on their account Thus the PayPal implementation does not offer the security of true two factor authentication br br br MTAN br It is also possible to use a mobile phone to receive an mTAN Mobile Transaction Authentication Number via SMS Use of a security code that is sent to the account holder s mobile phone is currently free br br br Fraud br As early as PayPal had substantial problems with online fraud especially international hackers who were hacking into PayPal accounts and transferring small amounts of money out of multiple accounts Standard solutions for merchant and banking fraud might use government criminal sanctions to pursue the fraudsters But with PayPal losing millions of dollars each month to fraud while experiencing difficulties with using the FBI to pursue cases of international fraud PayPal developed a fraud monitoring system to detect potentially fraudulent transactions This development of fraud monitoring software at PayPal led Peter Thiel to create Palantir a big data security company whose original mission was to reduce terrorism while preserving civil liberties br br br PayPal cards frozen br In Spanish cardholders had their funds frozen in an apparent fraud case involving a PayPal service provider Younique Money which was the de facto administrator of the cards Previously PayPal had charged to all its card users without authorization users As of March most funds had not been returned br br br Criticism and controversies br br In PayPal voluntarily ceased serving as a payment intermediary between gambling websites and their online customers At the time of this cessation it was the largest payment processor for online gambling transactions In PayPal resumed accepting such transactions but only in those countries where online gambling is legal and only for sites which are properly licensed to operate in said jurisdictions Since at least PayPal has maintained an Acceptable Use policy which disallows transactions involving items that are considered obscene or certain sexually oriented materials or services Their enforcement of the policy has been a constant source of controversy between PayPal and people within or related to the sex industry In PayPal notified subscription service provider Patreon that it was moving to cease integration with Patreon as a platform as the result of Patreon permitting adult content on their platform Patreon then removed access to PayPal services for creators who produced sexual content br If an account is subject to fraud or unauthorized use PayPal puts the Limited Access designation on the account PayPal has had several notable cases in which the company has frozen the account of users such as Richard Kyanka owner of the website Something Awful in September Cryptome in March or April Winchell the owner of Regretsy in December The account was reinstated and PayPal apologized and donated to her cause br In September PayPal froze the account of

its know your customer guidelines The Chelsea Manning Support Network claimed the backdown was a reaction to a petition to the company to reinstate the account In May PayPal declined to pay a reward offered in its Bug Bounty Program to a year old German student who had reported a cross site scripting flaw on its site The company wrote that the vulnerability had been previously reported and chastised the youth for disclosing the issue to the public but uniquely sent him a Letter of recognition for the discovery br In August entrepreneurs who had used PayPal to collect the funds they raised on crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo reported difficulty in being able to withdraw the money Actors included Ouya GlassUp a rival to Google Glass and Mailpile This also extended to crowdfunded games like Yatagarasu Attack on Cataclysm Skullgirls and Dreamfall Chapters In May PayPal blocked the account of a Russian human rights organisation RosUznik which supported political prisoners arrested at Bolotnaya Square br As of January a class action lawsuit against PayPal was filed in Israel claiming that they arbitrarily froze accounts and held funds for up to days without paying interest and thereby directly profited from it In the examples given in the lawsuit PayPal had received complaints against small vendors which were later resolved but the PayPal account was closed The lawsuit requests that PayPal be declared a monopoly and thus regulated accordingly In April The Guardian reported that PayPal had blocked the account of London based human rights group Justice for Iran br In May PayPal blocked an account intended to raise money for the distribution of Boris Nemtsov s report Putin War The explanation by PayPal was that PayPal does not offer the opportunity to use its system for collecting funds to finance the activities of political parties or for political aims in Russia though PayPal s Acceptable Use Policy does not mention financing for political goals Non governmental organization Freedom House issued a statement that PayPal should immediately lift this ban to help rather than hinder press freedom in Russia br In September PayPal

Greenblatt stated that this initiative is meant to help mitigat e extremist threats In September PayPal shut the accounts of the British social commentator Toby Young and two connected organisations the Free Speech Union and The Daily Sceptic website PayPal said that the accounts were closed because of breaches of its acceptable use policy apparently because of alleged misinformation about COVID
