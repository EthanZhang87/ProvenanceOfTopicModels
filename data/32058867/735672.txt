A cellular network or mobile network is a telecommunications network where the link to and from end nodes is wireless and the network is distributed over land areas called cells each served by at least one fixed location transceiver typically three cell sites or base transceiver stations These base stations provide the cell with the network coverage which can be used for transmission of voice data and other types of content A cell typically uses a different set of frequencies from neighboring cells to avoid interference and provide guaranteed service quality within each cell br When joined together these cells provide radio coverage over a wide geographic area This enables numerous portable transceivers e g mobile phones tablets and laptops equipped with mobile broadband modems pagers etc to communicate with each other and with fixed transceivers and telephones anywhere in the network via base stations even if some of the transceivers are moving through more than one cell during transmission br Cellular networks offer a number of desirable features br br More capacity than a single large transmitter since the same frequency can be used for multiple links as long as they are in different cells br Mobile devices use less power than a single transmitter or satellite since the cell towers are closer br Larger coverage area than a single terrestrial transmitter since additional cell towers can be added indefinitely and are not limited by the horizon br Capability of utilizing higher frequency signals and thus more available bandwidth faster data rates that are not able to propagate at long distances br With data compression and multiplexing several video including digital video and audio channels may travel through a higher frequency signal on a single wideband carrier br Major telecommunications providers have deployed voice and data cellular networks over most of the inhabited land area of Earth This allows mobile phones and mobile computing devices to be connected to the public switched telephone network and public Internet access Private cellular networks can be used for research or for large organizations and fleets such as dispatch for local public safety agencies or a taxicab company as well as for local wireless communications in enterprise and industrial settings such as factories warehouses mines power plants substations oil and gas facilities and ports br br In a cellular radio system a land area to be supplied with radio service is divided into cells in a pattern dependent on terrain and reception characteristics These cell patterns roughly take the form of regular shapes such as hexagons squares or circles although hexagonal cells are conventional Each of these cells is assigned with multiple frequencies f f which have corresponding radio base stations The group of frequencies can be reused in other cells provided that the same frequencies are not reused in adjacent cells which would cause co channel interference br The increased capacity in a cellular network compared with a network with a single transmitter comes from the mobile communication switching system developed by Amos Joel of Bell Labs that permitted multiple callers in a given area to use the same frequency by switching calls to the nearest available cellular tower having that frequency available This strategy is viable because a given radio frequency can be reused in a different area for an unrelated transmission In contrast a single transmitter can only handle one transmission for a given frequency Inevitably there is some level of interference from the signal from the other cells which use the same frequency Consequently there must be at least one cell gap between cells which reuse the same frequency in a standard frequency division multiple access FDMA system br Consider the case of a taxi company where each radio has a manually operated channel selector knob to tune to different frequencies As drivers move around they change from channel to channel The drivers are aware of which frequency approximately covers some area When they do not receive a signal from the transmitter they try other channels until finding one that works The taxi drivers only speak one at a time when invited by the base station operator This is a form of time division multiple access TDMA br br The history of cellular phone technology began on December with an internal memo written by Douglas H Ring a Bell Labs engineer in which he proposed development of a cellular telephone system by AT T br The first commercial cellular network the G generation was launched in Japan by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone NTT in initially in the metropolitan area of Tokyo Within five years the NTT network had been expanded to cover the whole population of Japan and became the first nationwide G network It was an analog wireless network The Bell System had developed cellular technology since and had cellular networks in operation in Chicago and Dallas prior to but commercial service was delayed by the breakup of the Bell System with cellular assets transferred to the Regional Bell Operating Companies br The wireless revolution began in the early s leading to the transition from analog to digital networks This was enabled by advances in MOSFET technology The MOSFET originally invented by Mohamed M Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in was adapted for cellular networks by the early s with the wide adoption of power MOSFET LDMOS RF amplifier and RF CMOS RF circuit devices leading to the development and proliferation of digital wireless mobile networks br The first commercial digital cellular network the G generation was launched in This sparked competition in the sector as the new operators challenged the incumbent G analog network operators br br To distinguish signals from several different transmitters frequency division multiple access FDMA used by analog and D AMPS systems time division multiple access TDMA used by GSM and code division multiple access CDMA first used for PCS and the basis of G were developed br With FDMA the transmitting and receiving frequencies used by different users in each cell are different from each other Each cellular call was assigned a pair of frequencies one for base to mobile the other for mobile to base to provide full duplex operation The original AMPS systems had channel pairs each for the CLEC A system and ILEC B system The number of channels was expanded to pairs per carrier but ultimately the number of RF channels limits the number of calls that a cell site could handle FDMA is a familiar technology to telephone companies which used frequency division multiplexing to add channels to their point to point wireline plants before time division multiplexing rendered FDM obsolete br With TDMA the transmitting and receiving time slots used by different users in each cell are different from each other TDMA typically uses digital signaling to store and forward bursts of voice data that are fit into time slices for transmission and expanded at the receiving end to produce a somewhat normal sounding voice at the receiver TDMA must introduce latency time delay into the audio signal As long as the latency time is short enough that the delayed audio is not heard as an echo it is not problematic TDMA is a familiar technology for telephone companies which used time division multiplexing to add channels to their point to point wireline plants before packet switching rendered FDM obsolete br The principle of CDMA is based on spread spectrum technology developed for military use during World War II and improved during the Cold War into direct sequence spread spectrum that was used for early CDMA cellular systems and Wi Fi DSSS allows multiple simultaneous phone conversations to take place on a single wideband RF channel without needing to channelize them in time or frequency Although more sophisticated than older multiple access schemes and unfamiliar to legacy telephone companies because it was not developed by Bell Labs CDMA has scaled well to become the basis for G cellular radio systems br Other available methods of multiplexing such as MIMO a more sophisticated version of antenna diversity combined with active beamforming provides much greater spatial multiplexing ability compared to original AMPS cells that typically only addressed one to three unique spaces Massive MIMO deployment allows much greater channel reuse thus increasing the number of subscribers per cell site greater data throughput per user or some combination thereof Quadrature Amplitude Modulation QAM modems offer an increasing number of bits per symbol allowing more users per megahertz of bandwidth and decibels of SNR greater data throughput per user or some combination thereof br br The key characteristic of a cellular network is the ability to reuse frequencies to increase both coverage and capacity As described above adjacent cells must use different frequencies however there is no problem with two cells sufficiently far apart operating on the same frequency provided the masts and cellular network users equipment do not transmit with too much power br The elements that determine frequency reuse are the reuse distance and the reuse factor The reuse distance D is calculated as br br br br br D br br R br br br br N br br br br br displaystyle D R sqrt N br br br where R is the cell radius and N is the number of cells per cluster Cells may vary in radius from to kilometres to mi The boundaries of the cells can also overlap between adjacent cells and large cells can be divided into smaller cells br The frequency reuse factor is the rate at which the same frequency can be used in the network It is K or K according to some books where K is the number of cells which cannot use the same frequencies for transmission Common values for the frequency reuse factor are and or and depending on notation br In case of N sector antennas on the same base station site each with different direction the base station site can serve N different sectors N is typically A reuse pattern of N K denotes a further division in frequency among N sector antennas per site Some current and historical reuse patterns are North American AMPS Motorola NAMPS and GSM br If the total available bandwidth is B each cell can only use a number of frequency channels corresponding to a bandwidth of B K and each sector can use a bandwidth of B NK br Code division multiple access based systems use a wider frequency band to achieve the same rate of transmission as FDMA but this is compensated for by the ability to use a frequency reuse factor of for example using a reuse pattern of In other words adjacent base station sites use the same frequencies and the different base stations and users are separated by codes rather than frequencies While N is shown as in this example that does not mean the CDMA cell has only one sector but rather that the entire cell bandwidth is also available to each sector individually br Recently also orthogonal frequency division multiple access based systems such as LTE are being deployed with a frequency reuse of Since such systems do not spread the signal across the frequency band br inter cell radio resource management is important to coordinate resource allocation between different cell sites and to limit the inter cell interference There are various means of inter cell interference coordination ICIC already defined in the standard Coordinated scheduling multi site MIMO or multi site beamforming are other examples for inter cell radio resource management that might be standardized in the future br br Cell towers frequently use a directional signal to improve reception in higher traffic areas In the United States the Federal Communications Commission FCC limits omnidirectional cell tower signals to watts of power If the tower has directional antennas the FCC allows the cell operator to emit up to watts of effective radiated power ERP br Although the original cell towers created an even omnidirectional signal were at the centers of the cells and were omnidirectional a cellular map can be redrawn with the cellular telephone towers located at the corners of the hexagons where three cells converge Each tower has three sets of directional antennas aimed in three different directions with degrees for each cell totaling degrees and receiving transmitting into three different cells at different frequencies This provides a minimum of three channels and three towers for each cell and greatly increases the chances of receiving a usable signal from at least one direction br The numbers in the illustration are channel numbers which repeat every cells Large cells can be subdivided into smaller cells for high volume areas br Cell phone companies also use this directional signal to improve reception along highways and inside buildings like stadiums and arenas br br Practically every cellular system has some kind of broadcast mechanism This can be used directly for distributing information to multiple mobiles Commonly for example in mobile telephony systems the most important use of broadcast information is to set up channels for one to one communication between the mobile transceiver and the base station This is called paging The three different paging procedures generally adopted are sequential parallel and selective paging br The details of the process of paging vary somewhat from network to network but normally we know a limited number of cells where the phone is located this group of cells is called a Location Area in the GSM or UMTS system or Routing Area if a data packet session is involved in LTE cells are grouped into Tracking Areas Paging takes place by sending the broadcast message to all of those cells Paging messages can be used for information transfer This happens in pagers in CDMA systems for sending SMS messages and in the UMTS system where it allows for low downlink latency in packet based connections br In LTE G the Paging procedure is initiated by the MME when data packets need to be delivered to the UE br Paging types supported by the MME are br br Basic br SGs CS and SGs PS br QCI through QCI br br In a primitive taxi system when the taxi moved away from a first tower and closer to a second tower the taxi driver manually switched from one frequency to another as needed If communication was interrupted due to a loss of a signal the taxi driver asked the base station operator to repeat the message on a different frequency br In a cellular system as the distributed mobile transceivers move from cell to cell during an ongoing continuous communication switching from one cell frequency to a different cell frequency is done electronically without interruption and without a base station operator or manual switching This is called the handover or handoff Typically a new channel is automatically selected for the mobile unit on the new base station which will serve it The mobile unit then automatically switches from the current channel to the new channel and communication continues br The exact details of the mobile system s move from one base station to the other vary considerably from system to system see the example below for how a mobile phone network manages handover br br The most common example of a cellular network is a mobile phone cell phone network A mobile phone is a portable telephone which receives or makes calls through a cell site base station or transmitting tower Radio waves are used to transfer signals to and from the cell phone br Modern mobile phone networks use cells because radio frequencies are a limited shared resource Cell sites and handsets change frequency under computer control and use low power transmitters so that the usually limited number of radio frequencies can be simultaneously used by many callers with less interference br A cellular network is used by the mobile phone operator to achieve both coverage and capacity for their subscribers Large geographic areas are split into smaller cells to avoid line of sight signal loss and to support a large number of active phones in that area All of the cell sites are connected to telephone exchanges or switches which in turn connect to the public telephone network br In cities each cell site may have a range of up to approximately mile km while in rural areas the range could be as much as miles km It is possible that in clear open areas a user may receive signals from a cell site miles km away In rural areas with low band coverage and tall towers basic voice and messaging service may reach miles km with limitations on bandwidth and number of simultaneous calls br Since almost all mobile phones use cellular technology including GSM CDMA and AMPS analog the term cell phone is in some regions notably the US used interchangeably with mobile phone However satellite phones are mobile phones that do not communicate directly with a ground based cellular tower but may do so indirectly by way of a satellite br There are a number of different digital cellular technologies including Global System for Mobile Communications GSM General Packet Radio Service GPRS cdmaOne CDMA Evolution Data Optimized EV DO Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution EDGE Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications DECT Digital AMPS IS TDMA and Integrated Digital Enhanced Network iDEN The transition from existing analog to the digital standard followed a very different path in Europe and the US As a consequence multiple digital standards surfaced in the US while Europe and many countries converged towards the GSM standard br br A simple view of the cellular mobile radio network consists of the following br br A network of radio base stations forming the base station subsystem br The core circuit switched network for handling voice calls and text br A packet switched network for handling mobile data br The public switched telephone network to connect subscribers to the wider telephony network br This network is the foundation of the GSM system network There are many functions that are performed by this network in order to make sure customers get the desired service including mobility management registration call set up and handover br Any phone connects to the network via an RBS Radio Base Station at a corner of the corresponding cell which in turn connects to the Mobile switching center MSC The MSC provides a connection to the public switched telephone network PSTN The link from a phone to the RBS is called an uplink while the other way is termed downlink br Radio channels effectively use the transmission medium through the use of the following multiplexing and access schemes frequency division multiple access FDMA time division multiple access TDMA code division multiple access CDMA and space division multiple access SDMA br br Small cells which have a smaller coverage area than base stations are categorised as follows br br Microcell less than kilometres br Picocell less than metres br Femtocell around metres br Attocell metres br br As the phone user moves from one cell area to another cell while a call is in progress the mobile station will search for a new channel to attach to in order not to drop the call Once a new channel is found the network will command the mobile unit to switch to the new channel and at the same time switch the call onto the new channel br With CDMA multiple CDMA handsets share a specific radio channel The signals are separated by using a pseudonoise code PN code that is specific to each phone As the user moves from one cell to another the handset sets up radio links with multiple cell sites or sectors of the same site simultaneously This is known as soft handoff because unlike with traditional cellular technology there is no one defined point where the phone switches to the new cell br In IS inter frequency handovers and older analog systems such as NMT it will typically be impossible to test the target channel directly while communicating In this case other techniques have to be used such as pilot beacons in IS This means that there is almost always a brief break in the communication while searching for the new channel followed by the risk of an unexpected return to the old channel br If there is no ongoing communication or the communication can be interrupted it is possible for the mobile unit to spontaneously move from one cell to another and then notify the base station with the strongest signal br br The effect of frequency on cell coverage means that different frequencies serve better for different uses Low frequencies such as MHz NMT serve very well for countryside coverage GSM MHz is suitable for light urban coverage GSM GHz starts to be limited by structural walls UMTS at GHz is quite similar in coverage to GSM br Higher frequencies are a disadvantage when it comes to coverage but it is a decided advantage when it comes to capacity Picocells covering e g one floor of a building become possible and the same frequency can be used for cells which are practically neighbors br Cell service area may also vary due to interference from transmitting systems both within and around that cell This is true especially in CDMA based systems The receiver requires a certain signal to noise ratio and the transmitter should not send with too high transmission power in view to not cause interference with other transmitters As the receiver moves away from the transmitter the power received decreases so the power control algorithm of the transmitter increases the power it transmits to restore the level of received power As the interference noise rises above the received power from the transmitter and the power of the transmitter cannot be increased anymore the signal becomes corrupted and eventually unusable In CDMA based systems the effect of interference from other mobile transmitters in the same cell on coverage area is very marked and has a special name cell breathing br One can see examples of cell coverage by studying some of the coverage maps provided by real operators on their web sites or by looking at independently crowdsourced maps such as Opensignal or CellMapper In certain cases they may mark the site of the transmitter in others it can be calculated by working out the point of strongest coverage br A cellular repeater is used to extend cell coverage into larger areas They range from wideband repeaters for consumer use in homes and offices to smart or digital repeaters for industrial needs br br The following table shows the
