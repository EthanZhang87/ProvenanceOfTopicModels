who came up with the idea tended to dominate the Ring Combination Its influence was greatest because its reserved territories were larger or of greater news importance than most others It also had

managing editor for North America Desmond Maberly br br br Policy of objective language br br Reuters has a policy of taking a value neutral approach which extends to not using the word terrorist in its stories The practice attracted criticism following the September attacks Reuters editorial policy states Reuters may refer without attribution to terrorism and counterterrorism in general but do not refer to specific events as terrorism Nor does Reuters use the word terrorist without attribution to qualify specific individuals groups or events By contrast the Associated Press does use the term terrorist in reference to non governmental organizations who carry out attacks on civilian populations In Reuters asked CanWest Global Communications a Canadian newspaper chain to remove Reuters bylines as the chain had edited Reuters articles to insert the word terrorist A spokesman for Reuters stated My goal is to protect my reporters and protect our editorial integrity br br br Climate change reporting br In July David Fogarty former Reuters climate change correspondent in Asia resigned after a career of almost years with the company and wrote that progressively getting any climate change themed story published got harder following comments from then deputy editor in chief Paul Ingrassia that he was a climate change sceptic In his comments Fogarty stated br br By mid October I was informed that climate change just wasn t a big story for the present but that it would be if there was a significant shift in global policy such as the US introducing an emissions cap and trade system Very soon after that conversation I was told my climate change role was abolished br Ingrassia formerly Reuters managing editor previously worked for The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones for years Reuters responded to Fogarty s piece by stating Reuters has a number of staff dedicated to covering this story including a team of specialist reporters at Point Carbon and a columnist There has been no change in our editorial policy br Subsequently climate blogger Joe Romm cited a Reuters article on climate as employing false balance and quoted Stefan Rahmstorf co chair of Earth System Analysis at the Potsdam Institute that s imply a lot of unrelated climate sceptics nonsense has been added to this Reuters piece In the words of the late Steve Schneider this is like adding some nonsense from the Flat Earth Society to a report about the latest generation of telecommunication satellites It is absurd Romm opined We can t know for certain who insisted on cramming this absurd and non germane climate sceptics nonsense into the piece but we have a strong clue If it had been part of the reporter s original reporting you would have expected direct quotes from actual sceptics because that is journalism The fact that the blather was all inserted without attribution suggests it was added at the insistence of an editor br br br Photograph controversies br According to Ynetnews Reuters was accused of bias against Israel in its coverage of the Israel Lebanon conflict after the wire service used two doctored photos by a Lebanese freelance photographer Adnan Hajj In August Reuters announced it had severed all ties with Hajj and said his photographs would be removed from its database br In Reuters was criticised again by Haaretz for anti Israeli bias when it cropped the edges of photos removing commandos knives held by activists and a naval commando s blood from photographs taken aboard the Mavi Marmara during the Gaza flotilla raid a raid that left nine Turkish activists dead It has been alleged that in two separate photographs knives held by the activists were cropped out of the versions of the pictures published by Reuters Reuters said it is standard operating procedure to crop photos at the margins and replaced the cropped images with the original ones after it was brought to the agency s attention br br br Indian man falsely accused of cyber crime br On June three Reuters journalists Jack Stubbs Raphael Satter and Christopher Bing incorrectly used the image of an Indian herbal medicine entrepreneur in an exclusive story titled Obscure Indian cyber firm spied on politicians investors worldwide Indian local media picked up the report and the man whose image was wrongly used was invited and interrogated for nine hours by Indian police Reuters admitted to the error but Raphael Satter claimed that they had mistaken the man for the suspected hacker Sumit Gupta because both men share same business address A check by local media however showed that both men were in different buildings and not as claimed by Raphael Satter As the report of the inaccurate reporting trickled out to the public Reuters senior director of communication Heather Carpenter contacted media outlets asking them to take down their posts br br br Accusations of pro Fernando Henrique Cardoso bias br In March the Brazilian affiliate of Reuters released an excerpt from an interview with Brazilian ex president Fernando Henrique Cardoso about Operation Car Wash Portuguese Opera o Lava Jato In several politicians from Brazil were found to be involved in corruption by accepting bribes from different corporations in exchange for Government contracts After the scandal the excerpt from Brazil s president Fernando Henrique s interview was released br One paragraph by a former Petrobras manager mentioned a comment in which he suggested corruption in the company may date back to Cardoso s presidency Attached was a comment between parenthesis Podemos tirar se achar melhor we can take it out if you think better which was removed from the current version of the text This had the effect of confusing readers and suggests that the former president was involved in corruption and the comment was attributed to him Reuters later confirmed the error and explained that the comment originating from one of the local editors was actually intended for the journalist who wrote the original text in English and that it should not have been published br br br Funding by the UK Government br In November the UK Foreign Office released archive documents confirming that it had provided funding to Reuters during the s and s so that Reuters could expand its coverage in the Middle East An agreement was made between the Information Research Department IRD and Reuters for the UK Treasury to provide over four years to fund Reuters expansion The UK government had already been funding the Latin American department of Reuters through a shell company however this method was discounted for the Middle East operation due to the accounting of the shell company looking suspicious with the IRD stating that the company already looks queer to anyone who might wish to investigate why such an inactive and unprofitable company continues to run Instead the BBC was used to fund the project by paying for enhanced subscriptions to the news organisation for which the Treasury would reimburse the BBC at a later date The IRD acknowledged that this agreement would not give them editorial control over Reuters although the IRD believed it would give them political influence over Reuters work stating this influence would flow at the top level from Reuters willingness to consult and to listen to views expressed on the results of its work br br br Partnership with TASS br On June Reuters announced that Russian news agency TASS had joined its Reuters Connect programme comprising a then total of partner agencies Reuters president Michael Friedenberg said he was delighted that TASS and Reuters are building upon our valued partnership Two years later TASS s membership in Reuters Connect came under scrutiny in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine Politico reported that Reuters staff members were frustrated and embarrassed that their agency had not suspended its partnership with TASS br On March Reuters removed TASS from its content marketplace Matthew Keen interim CEO of Reuters said we believe making TASS content available on Reuters Connect is not aligned with the Thomson
