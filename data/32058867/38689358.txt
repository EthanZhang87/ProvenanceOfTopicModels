Salman ascended the throne Mohammed was appointed minister of defence and secretary general of the royal court In addition he retained his post as the minister of state br The political unrest in Yemen which began escalating in rapidly became a major issue for the newly appointed minister of defence with Houthis taking control of northern Yemen in late followed by the resignation of President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi and his cabinet Mohammed s first move as minister was to mobilise a pan GCC coalition to intervene following a series of suicide bombings in the Yemeni capital Sana a via air strikes against Houthis and impose a naval blockade In March Saudi Arabia began leading a coalition of countries allied against the Houthi rebels While there was agreement among those Saudi princes heading security services regarding the necessity of a response to the Houthis seizure of Sana a which had forced the Yemeni government into exile Mohammed launched the intervention without full coordination across security services Saudi National Guard minister Mutaib bin Abdullah Al Saud who was out of the country was left out of the loop of operations While Mohammed sold the war as a quick win on Houthi rebels in Yemen and a way to put President Hadi back in power however it became a long war of attrition br In April King Salman appointed his nephew Muhammad bin Nayef as crown prince and his son Mohammed as deputy crown prince In late at a meeting between his father and Barack Obama Mohammed bin Salman broke protocol to deliver a monologue criticising US foreign policy When he announced an anti terrorist military alliance of Islamic countries in December some countries involved said they had not been consulted br Regarding his role in the military intervention Mohammed gave his first on the record interview on January to The Economist which had called him the architect of the war in Yemen Denying the title he explained the mechanism of the decision making institutions actually holding stakes in the intervention including the council of security and political affairs and the ministry of foreign affairs from the Saudi side He added that the Houthis usurped power in Sana a before he was minister of defence br br In response to the threat from ISIL Mohammed established the Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition IMCTC a Saudi led Islamic alliance against terrorism in December The IMCTC s first meeting took place in Riyadh in November and involved defence ministers and officials from countries br br br Crown prince br Mohammed was appointed crown prince on June following the King s decision to depose Muhammad bin Nayef and make his own son the heir to the throne The change of succession had been predicted in December by an unusually blunt and public memo published by the German Federal Intelligence Service which was subsequently rebuked by the German government br On the day Mohammed bin Salman became crown prince Donald Trump the then President of the United States called him to congratulate him on his recent elevation Trump and Mohammed pledged close cooperation on security and economic issues according to the White House and the two leaders also discussed the need to cut off support for terrorism the recent diplomatic dispute with Qatar and the push to secure peace between Israel and the Palestinians br Mohammed told The Washington Post in April that without America s cultural influence on Saudi Arabia we would have ended up like North Korea br br br purge br br In May Mohammed launched a purge against competing Saudi business and political elites under the auspices of anti corruption He said no one will survive in a corruption case whoever he is even if he s a prince or a minister In November he ordered some wealthy businessmen and princes to be placed under house arrest in The Ritz Carlton Riyadh On November the Saudi press announced the arrest of the Saudi prince and billionaire Al Waleed bin Talal a frequent English language news commentator and a major shareholder in Citi News Corp and Twitter as well as over princes and government ministers at the behest of the Crown Prince on corruption and money laundering charges Others arrested or fired in the purge included Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah head of the Saudi Arabian National Guard Minister of Economy and Planning Adel Fakeih and the commander of the Royal Saudi Navy Admiral Abdullah bin Sultan bin Mohammed Al Sultan br Those arrested in the Ritz Carlton were the subject of what became called the night of beating Most were beaten and some were tied to walls in stress positions as part of torture by Saudi agents The interrogators knew very little outside of the victims assets within Saudi Arabia and wanted to know more about their off shore holdings while the victims did not know why they were detained The detainees were threatened with blackmail At one point the interrogators told the victims to contact their bank managers in Geneva and elsewhere and ask for large sums of money and were surprised due to their inexpertise that the assets were not entirely in cash Swiss banks identified some of the transactions as under duress and were able to stop some of them During the proceedings there was no due process nor plea bargains US officials described the actions as coercion abuse and torture Detainees were denied sleep had their heads covered and were beaten Seventeen had to be hospitalised After many days the remaining detainees were moved to Al Ha ir Prison while some released are banned from travelling abroad br The purge helped centralize political powers in the hands of Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman and undermine the pre existing structure of consensus based governance among Saudi elites The arrests resulted in the final sidelining of the faction of King Abdullah and Mohammed bin Salman s complete consolidation of control of all three branches of the security forces It also cemented bin Salman s supremacy over business elites in Saudi Arabia and resulted in a mass seizure of assets by the bin Salman regime br The New York Times wrote br br The sweeping campaign of arrests appears to be the latest move to consolidate the power of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman the favorite son and top adviser of King Salman The king had decreed the creation of a powerful new anticorruption committee headed by the crown prince only hours before the committee ordered the arrests Writing for The Huffington Post University of Delaware professor of Islam and Global Affairs Muqtedar Khan speculated as to whether the removal of Al Waleed bin Talal a critic of Donald Trump amounted to a coup BBC correspondent Frank Gardner was quoted as saying that Prince Mohammed is moving to consolidate his growing power while spearheading a reform programme Yet i t is not clear what those detained are suspected of br Another hypothesis was that the purge was part of a move towards reform Steven Mufson of The Washington Post argues that Mohammed knows that only if he can place the royal family under the law and not above as it was in the past can he ask the whole country to change their attitudes relative to taxes and subsidies An analysis from the CBC claimed that the clampdown against corruption resonates with ordinary Saudis who feel that the state has been asking them to accept belt tightening while at the same time they see corruption and the power elite accumulating more wealth Mohammed s reform agenda is widely supported by Saudi Arabia s burgeoning youth population but faces resistance from some of the old guard more comfortable with the kingdom s traditions of incremental change and rule by consensus According to a former British ambassador to Riyadh Mohammed is the first prince in modern Saudi history whose constituency has not been within the royal family it s outside it It s been young Saudis particularly younger Saudi men in the street br Robert W Jordan former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia said that certainly Saudi Arabia has had a corruption problem for many years I think the population especially has been very unhappy with princes coming in and grabbing business deals with public funds going to flood control projects that never seem to get built I would also say it s a classical power grab move sometimes to arrest your rivals your potential rivals under the pretext of corruption br Trump expressed support for the move and confidence in the Saudi Arabian leaders tweeting Some of those they are harshly treating have been milking their country for years French president Emmanuel Macron who visited Riyadh days after the purge when asked about the purge stated this is not the role of a president and similarly I would not expect a leader of a foreign country to come and infringe on domestic matters br On January the Saudi government announced the conclusion of the Anti Corruption Committee s work As many as people were rounded up in the sweep Saudi Arabian banks froze more than domestic accounts as part of the crackdown According to The Wall Street Journal the Saudi government targeted cash and assets worth up to billion The Saudi authorities claimed that amount was composed of assets worth around billion to billion that they can prove was linked to corruption br br br Prime minister br On September Mohammed was appointed as prime minister of Saudi Arabia by King Salman Traditionally the king has held the title of prime minister br br br Administration br br br Ideology br Mohammed s ideology has been described as nationalist and populist with a conservative attitude towards politics and a liberal stance on economic and social issues It has been heavily influenced by the views of his former adviser Saud al Qahtani and the ruler of Abu Dhabi Mohammed bin Zayed His style of ruling has been described as extremely brutal by journalist Rula Jebreal and authoritarian by Jamal Khashoggi and Theodor Winkler Mohammed bin Salman has also been championing an Arab nationalist ideology domestically and through foreign policy with a focus on opposing Islamist movements br br br Authoritarianism br Mohammed heads a repressive authoritarian government in Saudi Arabia Human rights activists and women s rights activists in Saudi Arabia have faced abuse and torture by the regime Critics journalists and former insiders are tortured and killed The government has targeted Saudi dissidents who are located abroad Jamal Khashoggi a columnist of The Washington Post was murdered by the regime Mohammed has justified the mass arrests of human rights activists as being as necessary for enacting reforms in Saudi Arabia and for establishing a state based on Arab nationalism br Mohammed has increasingly consolidated power in Saudi Arabia during his tenure as leader He significantly restricted the powers of the Saudi religious police On January Mohammed was named the chair of the newly established Council for Economic and Development Affairs replacing the disbanded Supreme Economic Commission In April Mohammed was given control over Saudi Aramco by royal decree following his appointment as deputy crown prince br br br Domestic policies br br br Religious policy br According to David Ottaway of the Wilson Center o f all Mohammed s domestic reforms the most consequential has been his work limiting the influence of Saudi Wahhabi clergy who still command millions of followers in the country and beyond Mohammed s inviting of a constant stream of Western male and female singers bands dancers and even American female wrestlers to perform in Saudi Arabia is in complete conflict with religious conservatives who have spoken against the opening up of the kingdom to secular Western culture Under Mohammed the Saudi government has promoted a new Saudi identity and nationalist history that downplays religious heritage and restricts Islamic influence in the cultural sphere Journalist Graeme Wood writes it is hard to exaggerate how drastically this sidelining of Islamic law will change Saudi Arabia Gabriella Perez argues that the new social changes implemented by MBS are oriented towards secularist repression with the potential to adversely impact freedom of religion in the country br br In a interview with The Atlantic editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg Mohammed stated regarding his basic approach to religion in Saudi Arabian society We believe we have in Saudi Arabia Sunni and Shiite We believe we have within Sunni Islam four schools of thought and we have the ulema the religious authorities and the Board of Fatwas which issues religious rulings our laws are coming from Islam and the Qur an but we have the four schools Hanbali Hanafi Shafi i Maliki and they argue about interpretation And you will find a Shiite in the cabinet you will find Shiites in government the most important university in Saudi Arabia is headed by a Shiite So we believe that we are a mix of Muslim schools and sects br br br Restrictions on religious police br In Mohammed took steps to drastically curtail the powers of the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice CPVPV or Islamic religious police The feared CPVPV which had thousands of officers on the streets and powers to arrest detain and interrogate those suspected of violating of sharia was banned from pursuing questioning asking for identification arresting and detaining anyone suspected of a crime Cinema industry was reinstated social liberties were expanded gender mixing and dating have been normalised by the state in public sphere Schmidt Feuerheerd argues that the new state policies are also accompanied by an increasing clampdown on political and religious activities independent of the government br br br Changes to legal system br Mohammed has stated that in Islamic law the head of the Islamic establishment is wali al amr Arabic the ruler While Saudi rulers have historically stayed away from religion and outsourced issues of theology and religious law to the big beards traditionally conservative and orthodox religious scholars Mohammed has a law degree from King Saud University and flaunts his knowledge and dominance over the clerics according to Graeme Wood He is probably the only leader in the Arab world who knows anything about Islamic epistemology and jurisprudence according to American historian Professor Bernard Haykel In an interview televised in Saudi Arabia on April Mohammed criticised the devotion of Saudi religious leaders to Wahhabi doctrines in language never before used by a Saudi monarch saying there are no fixed schools of thought and there is no infallible person and that fatwas should be based on the time place and mindset in which they are issued rather than regarded as immutable br br In interviews with Wood Mohammedexplained that Islamic law is based on two textual sources the Quran and the Sunnah or the example of the Prophet Muhammad gathered in many tens of thousands of fragments from the Prophet s life and sayings Certain rules not many come from the unambiguous legislative content of the Quran he said and he cannot do anything about them even if he wants to But those sayings of the Prophet called Hadith he explained do not all have equal value as sources of law and he said he is bound by only a very small number whose reliability years later is unimpeachable Every other source of Islamic law he said is open to interpretation and he is therefore entitled to interpret them as he sees fit The effect of this maneuver is to chuck about percent of Islamic law into the sandpit of Saudi history and leave MBS free to do whatever he wants He s short circuiting the tradition Haykel said That leaves him to determine what is in the interest of the Muslim community If that means opening movie theaters allowing tourists or women on the beaches on the Red Sea then so be it br As of early Mohammed has ordered a codification of Saudi laws that would end the power of individual Wahhabi judges to implement their own interpretation of Sharia According to Wood many conservative clerics strongly appear to have succumbed to good old fashioned intimidation by the government to reverse their religious positions and supporting the government line on issues such as the opening of cinemas and mass layoffs of Wahhabi imams br br br Abaya ban br In December Saudi Arabia s Education and Training Evaluation Commission ETEC declared a governmental ban on Muslim female students from wearing the traditional abaya clothing to examination centres insisting that students should wear only school uniforms A later clarification from ETEC reported by The Milli Chronicle stated that the ban on abayas was restricted only for all female examination centres run by the ETEC br br br Economic policy br br br Vision br br Mohammed took the leadership in the restructuring of Saudi Arabia s economy which he officially announced in April when he introduced Vision the country s strategic orientation for the next years Vision plans to reform Saudi Arabia s economy towards a more diversified and privatised structure It details goals and measures in various fields from developing non oil revenues and privatisation of the economy to e government and sustainable development br One of the major motives behind this economic restructure through Vision can be traced back to Saudi Arabia s reliance on a rentier economy as a limit on oil resources makes its sustainability a problem in the future While the country claims to own a proven reserve of billion barrels of crude oil the energy analyst Matthew R Simmons estimates the true number to be far less as the last non Saudi report by the General Accounting Office in only mentioned billion barrels br At the inaugural Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh in October Mohammed announced plans for the creation of Neom a billion economic zone to cover an area of square kilometres on Saudi Arabia s Red Sea coast extending into Jordan and Egypt Neom aims to attract investment in sectors including renewable energy biotechnology especially genetically modified agriculture robotics and advanced manufacturing The announcement followed plans to develop a square kilometre area across a lagoon of islands on Saudi Arabia s Red Sea coastline into a luxury tourism destination with laws on a par with international standards In a further effort to boost the tourism industry in November it was announced that Saudi Arabia would start issuing tourist visas for foreigners beginning in br Mohammed s biggest bet was his plan to restore Saudi dominance in global oil markets by driving the new competition into bankruptcy by keeping the oil price low enough for a long enough period Saudi Arabia persuaded OPEC to do the same A few small players went bankrupt but American frackers only shut down their less profitable operations temporarily and waited for oil prices to go up again Saudi Arabia which had been spending billion a year to keep services and subsidies going had to admit defeat in November It then cut production significantly and asked its OPEC partners to do the same br In the last week of September Mohammed inaugurated the much awaited bn high speed railway line connecting Mecca and Medina the two holiest cities of Islam The Haramain Express is km line travelling up to km h that can transport around million passengers annually The commercial operations of the railway began on October br br In October Mohammed announced that the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia s assets were approaching billion and would pass billion by br Mohammed announced a project to build Saudi Arabia s first nuclear reactor in November The kingdom aims to build nuclear facilities over the next years Efforts to diversify the Saudi energy sector also include wind and solar including a gigawatt solar plant announced in the same month as part of a long term project in partnership with SoftBank br br br Saudi petroleum industry br Saudi Arabia OPEC s largest producer has the second largest amount of oil reserves in the world On September Joe Biden s national security adviser Jake Sullivan met with Mohammed in Saudi Arabia to discuss the high oil prices In October in protest of Saudi Arabia cutting oil production US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Saudi Arabia knew the cut would increase Russian revenues and blunt the effectiveness of sanctions and accused Saudi Arabia of coercing other oil producing countries to agree The record high energy prices were driven by a global surge in demand as the world quit the economic recession caused by COVID particularly due to strong energy demand in Asia br The relations between Russia and Saudi Arabia evolved under Mohammed granting the two nations the ability to conspire in oil export decisions br br br Sport sector br Mohammed has presided over unprecedented spending on sport since becoming Saudi Arabia s de facto ruler in He has also been assiduous in striking deals to bring top sports events to Saudi including the FIFA Club World Cup in and the Asian Games in In Mohammed said this approach is central to the country s goal of becoming one of the world s top tourist destinations stating When you want to diversify an economy you have to work in all sectors mining infrastructure manufacturing transportation logistics all this Part of it is tourism and if you want to develop tourism part of it is culture part of it is your sport sector because you need to create a calendar br br br Domestic reforms br Mohammed established an entertainment authority that began hosting comedy shows professional wrestling events and monster truck rallies In he shared his idea for Green cards for non Saudi foreigners with Al Arabiya journalist Turki Aldakhil In the Saudi cabinet approved a new residency scheme Premium Residency for foreigners The scheme will enable expatriates to permanently reside own property and invest in the Kingdom br The first measures undertaken in April included new taxes and cuts in subsidies a diversification plan the creation of a trillion Saudi sovereign wealth fund and a series of strategic economic reforms called the National Transformation Programme Mohammed s plans to raise capital for the sovereign wealth fund included selling off shares of Saudi Aramco the state owned petroleum and natural gas company with the capital to be re invested in other sectors such as to implement the diversification plans In October the plan for Aramco s IPO listing was criticised by The Economist which called it a mess Mohammed slashed the state budget freezing government contracts and reducing the pay of civil employees as part of drastic austerity measures br In April Mohammed announced a project to build one of the world s largest cultural sports and entertainment cities in Qiddiya southwest of Riyadh The plans for a square kilometre city include a safari and a Six Flags theme park br br In October Mohammed said that the ultra conservative Saudi state had not been normal for the past years blaming rigid doctrines that had governed society in a reaction to the Iranian Revolution which successive leaders didn t know how to deal with He stated that he aimed to have Saudi Arabia start returning to what we were before a country of moderate Islam that is open to all religions and to the world This amounted to telling the country s clerics that the deal the royal family struck with them after the Grand Mosque seizure was to be renegotiated Building an industrial culture was seen as incompatible with Wahhabism The Wahhabis were committed to fixed social and gender relationships These were consistent with an economy built on oil sales but industrialization requires a dynamic culture with social relations constantly shifting The regime s commitment to moderate Islam and secularization drive through repressive methods has been questioned br Further cultural transformations followed in December with Saudi Arabia s first public concert by a female singer and in January a sports stadium in Jeddah became the first in the Kingdom to admit women In April the first public cinema opened in Saudi Arabia after a ban of years with plans to have more than screens running by br In an interview with a CBS Minutes that aired on September Mohammed invited people to visit the kingdom to see the transformation asking for people to meet Saudi citizens for themselves br On April the Supreme Judicial Council of Saudi Arabia abolished flogging as a punishment in the country stating that the decision was an extension of the human rights reforms introduced under the direction of King Salman and the direct supervision of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman The following day the Human Rights Commission of Saudi Arabia reported the enactment of a royal decree abolishing the death penalty for crimes committed by minors br br br Human rights br br Early in his leadership tenure Mohammed sought to cultivate an image of Saudi Arabia as implementing various reforms Human rights groups say that repression has worsened under his tenure According to human rights groups arrests of human rights activists have risen under Mohammed He has reportedly created the Tiger Squad a team of assassins that act as a death squad to target Saudi critics inside and outside Saudi Arabia Among those detained in a wave of arrests in September were Abdulaziz al Shubaily a founding member of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association ACPRA Mustafa al Hassan an academic and novelist and Essam al Zamel an entrepreneur Ahead of the lifting of the ban on women driving in June women s rights activists were arrested including the women to drive and anti male guardianship campaigner Loujain al Hathloul Eight of the were subsequently released Hatoon al Fassi an associate professor of women s history at King Saud University was arrested shortly afterwards br In August that year the human rights activist Israa al Ghomgham and her husband both arrested in were put under legal threat of beheading Human Rights Watch warned that the al Ghomgham case set a dangerous precedent for other women activists currently detained HRW s Middle East director Sarah Leah Whitson said Any execution is appalling but seeking the death penalty for activists like Israa al Ghomgham who are not even accused of violent behaviour is monstrous Every day the Saudi monarchy s unrestrained despotism makes it harder for its public relations teams to spin the fairy tale of reform to allies and international business On April people mostly Shia human rights activists involved in the Qatif conflict were executed in one of the largest mass executions of the minority sect in the kingdom s history br In August Loujain al Hathloul s brother Walid informed that his sister was offered release on denying the human rights abuses committed against her in Saudi prison Walid wrote on Twitter that the Saudi state security laid a proposal for Loujain to sign a document and appear on camera to deny that she had been tortured and sexually harassed in jail He stated that Loujain mentioned to the family that she had been whipped beaten electrocuted in a chair and harassed by

Mohammed has rejected all allegations the Saudi embassy called al Jabri a discredited former government official with a long history of fabrication br br br Foreign policy br br br Interventions in Syria and Yemen br br Some have called Mohammed the architect of the war in Yemen On January The Independent reported that the BND the German intelligence agency portrayed Saudi defence minister and

impact dismissing the Gulf emirate as smaller than a Cairo street In August a report by The Intercept cited unnamed sources claiming that former US secretary of state Rex Tillerson had in June intervened to stop a Saudi Emirati plan to invade Qatar resulting in increased pressure from Saudi Arabia and the UAE for his removal from office br On January Qatar and Saudi Arabia agreed to a

over the recent arrest of Samar Badawi a human rights activist and sister of imprisoned Saudi blogger Raif Badawi and called for the release of human rights activists In response to Canada s criticism Saudi Arabia expelled Canada s ambassador and froze trade with Canada The Toronto Star reported that the consensus among analysts indicated that the actions taken by Mohammed were a warning to the world and to Saudi human rights activists that his Saudi Arabia is not to be trifled with The diplomatic ties were restored on May br br br Assassination of Jamal Khashoggi br br In October Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi a critic of Mohammed went missing after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul Turkish officials reportedly believe that Khashoggi was murdered at the consulate claiming to have specific video and audio recordings proving that he was first tortured and then murdered and that a medical forensics expert was part of the man Saudi team seen entering and leaving the consulate at the time of the journalist s disappearance Saudi Arabia denied the accusations and days later Mohammed invited Turkish authorities to search the building as they have nothing to hide Saudi officials said they are working to search for him The Washington Post reported that Mohammed had earlier sought to lure Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia and detain him br According to Middle East Eye seven of the fifteen men suspected of killing Khashoggi are members of Mohammed s personal bodyguard John Sawers a former head of the British MI stated that in his judgment of the evidence it is very likely that Mohammed ordered the killing of Khashoggi br In the aftermath of Khashoggi s death multiple commentators referred to Mohammed as Mister Bone Saw a play on the initials MBS The name refers to the alleged use of a bone saw to dispose of Khashoggi s remains br Mohammed has denied any involvement in the murder and blamed the assassination on rogue operators However Western countries are not convinced and believe this could not have happened without Mohammed s knowledge or approval Donald Trump described the Saudi response to the killing as one of the worst in the history of cover ups Trump also believes that Mohammed at least knew about the plan saying that the prince is running things over there more so at this stage br After the murder Mohammed s close confidant Ahmad Asiri was sacked as was former advisor Saud al Qahtani br The recording of Khashoggi s killing collected by Turkish intelligence reportedly reveals that one of the members of the kill team instructed

Abdulaziz Mutreb a security officer who is frequently seen travelling with the prince br Seven weeks after Khashoggi s death Saudi Arabia in order to distance Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman from the grisly murder stated it would pursue the death penalty for five suspects charged with ordering and executing the crime br On November it was reported that the Central Intelligence Agency CIA had concluded with high confidence that Mohammed ordered Khashoggi s murder The CIA based its conclusion on several pieces of evidence including an intercepted conversation in which Mohammed s brother Khalid offered Khashoggi assurances that it would be safe for the journalist to enter Saudi Arabia s consulate in Istanbul Although the CIA reportedly had not determined whether Khalid had any foreknowledge of Khashoggi s ultimate fate upon entering the consulate it believed that Khalid conveyed this message to Khashoggi at Mohammed s behest In the CIA s analysis the killing was most likely motivated by Mohammed s privately stated belief that Khashoggi was an Islamist with problematic connections to the Muslim Brotherhood a perception that differs markedly from the Saudi government s public remarks on Khashoggi s death br On December a group of United States senators were briefed by CIA director Gina Haspel on the murder of Khashoggi After the briefing the senators were more than certain that Mohammed played a major role in the killing Senator Lindsey Graham said You have to be willfully blind not to come to the conclusion that this was orchestrated and organised by people under the command of MBS and that he was intrinsically involved in the demise of Mr Khashoggi Senator Bob Corker said that the prince ordered monitored the killing and If he were in front of a jury he would be convicted of murder in about minutes On December UN Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet asked for an international investigation to determine who was behind Khashoggi s murder br A former

June article The Guardian claimed that after Khashoggi s assassination the media group became a target of hacking attempts made by a Saudi cybersecurity subdivision as per an internal order document obtained by the group with Saud al Qahtani undersigned According to an interview in a PBS documentary film recorded in December and parts released in September Mohammed bears responsibility for the killing of Khashoggi since it happened under his watch but he denies any knowledge of the murder in advance He denied in an interview with CBS Minutes aired on September any personal involvement in the killing adding that once charges are proven against someone regardless of their rank it will be taken to court no exception made but said that he had to take full responsibility for what happened br On February the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a declassified report approved by Director Avril Haines The report Assessing the Saudi Government s Role in the Killing of

Interpol notices to bring back Saad al Jabri who was the US anti terrorism contact in the Middle East and was staying in Canada since The Interpol notice against al Jabri was removed citing that he

was the closest adviser to Mohammed s chief rival Muhammad bin Nayef The squad was identified and returned by Canadian authorities Following the lawsuit the US District Court for the District of Columbia issued the summons against Mohammed bin Salman along with other people The summons stated that a judgement would be taken by default against the concerned parties if they fail to respond
