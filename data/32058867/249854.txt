Ampex Data Systems Corporation is an American electronics company founded in by Alexander M Poniatoff as a spin off of Dalmo Victor The name AMPEX is a portmanteau created by its founder which stands for Alexander M Poniatoff Excellence Ampex operates as Ampex Data Systems Corporation a subsidiary of Delta Information Systems and consists of two business units The Silicon Valley unit known internally as Ampex Data Systems ADS manufactures digital data storage systems capable of functioning in harsh environments The Colorado Springs Colorado unit referred to as Ampex Intelligent Systems AIS serves as a laboratory and hub for the company s line of industrial control systems cyber security products and services and its artificial intelligence machine learning technology br Ampex s first great success was a line of reel to reel tape recorders developed from the German wartime Magnetophon system at the behest of Bing Crosby Ampex quickly became a leader in audio tape technology developing many of the analog recording formats for both music and movies that remained in use into the s Starting in the s the company began developing video tape recorders and later introduced the helical scan concept that made home video players possible They also introduced multi track recording slow motion and instant playback television and a host of other advances Ampex s tape business was rendered obsolete during the s and the company turned to digital storage products br Ampex moved into digital storage for DoD Flight Test Instrumentation FTI with the introduction of the first true all digital flight test recorder Ampex supports numerous major DoD programs with the US Air Force US Army US Marines US Navy and other government entities NASA DHS and national labs Ampex also works with all major DoD primes and integrators including Boeing General Atomics Lockheed Northrop Raytheon and many others br Currently Ampex is attempting to do more with the data stored on its network attached storage NAS devices This includes adding encryption for secure data storage algorithms focused on control system cyber security for infrastructure and aerospace platforms and artificial intelligence machine learning for automated entity identification and data analytics br br br Origin br Russian American inventor Alexander Matthew Poniatoff established the company in San Carlos California in as the Ampex Electric and Manufacturing Company The company name came from his initials plus ex to avoid using the name AMP already in use by Aircraft and Marine Products During World War II Ampex was a subcontractor to Dalmo Victor manufacturing high quality electric motors and generators for radars that used alnico magnets from General Electric Ampex was initially set up in an abandoned loft space above the Dalmo Victor plant eventually they would have offices at Laurel Street San Carlos California at the intersection of Howard Avenue and Laurel Street br Near the end of the war while serving in the U S Army Signal Corps Major Jack Mullin was assigned to investigate German radio and electronics experiments He discovered the Magnetophons with AC biasing on a trip to Radio Frankfurt The device produced much better fidelity than shellac records The technological processes in tape recording and equipment developed by German companies before and during the war were subject to patents which were effectively voided after Germany s surrender and defeat Mullin acquired two Magnetophon recorders and reels of BASF Type L tape and brought them to America where he produced modified versions He demonstrated them to the Institute of Radio Engineers in San Francisco on May br Bing Crosby a big star on radio at the time was receptive to the idea of pre recording his radio programs He disliked the regimentation of live broadcasts and much preferred the relaxed atmosphere of the recording studio He had already asked the NBC network to let him pre record his series on transcription discs but the network refused so Crosby had withdrawn from live radio for a year and returned this time to the recently created ABC for the season only reluctantly br In June Mullin who was pitching the technology to the major Hollywood movie studios got the chance to demonstrate his modified tape recorders to Crosby When Crosby heard a demonstration of Mullin s tape recorders he immediately saw the potential of the new technology and commissioned Mullin to prepare a test recording of his radio show Ampex was finishing its prototype of the Model tape recorder and Mullin used the first two models as soon as they were built After a successful test broadcast ABC agreed to allow Crosby to pre record his shows on tape Crosby immediately appointed Mullin as his chief engineer and placed an order for worth of the new recorders so that Ampex then a small six man concern could develop a commercial production model from the prototypes br Crosby Enterprises was Ampex s West Coast representative until br br br Early tape recorders br br The company s first tape recorder the Ampex Model A was first shipped in April The first two units serial numbers and were used to record Bing Crosby s show The American Broadcasting Company used these recorders along with M Scotch gamma ferric oxide coated acetate tape for the first ever U S delayed radio broadcast of Bing Crosby s Philco Radio Time Ampex tape recorders revolutionized the radio and recording industries because of their superior audio quality and ease of operation over audio disk cutting lathes br The firm s earliest production of multichannel machines wasn t aimed at music recording it noted in that Ampex began the commercial production of multitrack tape recorders about four years ago for those interested in telemetered information from guided missiles and the like These equipments provided any number of simultaneous channels up to It was a simple step therefore to make stereophonic tape recorders with two or more channels br During the early s Ampex began marketing one and two track machines using inch mm tape In May the firm announced production of two and three track machines on inch tape The line soon expanded into three and four track models using inch mm tape In the early s Ampex moved to Redwood City California Ampex acquired Orradio Industries in which became the Ampex Magnetic Tape Division headquartered in Opelika Alabama This made Ampex a manufacturer of both recorders and tape By the end of that decade Ampex products were much in demand by top recording studios worldwide br In movie producer Mike Todd asked Ampex to develop a high fidelity movie sound system using sound magnetically recorded on the film itself as contrasted with the technology of the time which used magnetic tracks on a separate celluloid base film later commonly known as mag stock The result of this development was the CinemaScope Todd AO motion picture sound system which was first used in movies such as The Robe in mm and Oklahoma in mm and also in mm In the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded Ampex an Oscar for technical achievement as a result of this development br Les Paul a friend of Crosby and a regular guest on his shows had already been experimenting with overdubbed recordings on disc He received an early portable Ampex Model from Crosby Using this machine Les Paul invented Sound on Sound recording technology He placed an additional playback head located before the conventional erase record playback heads This allowed Paul to play along with a previously recorded track both of which were mixed together on to a new track This was a destructive process because the original recording was recorded over br br br Professional track recorders br br Ampex built a handful of multitrack machines during the late s that could record as many as eight tracks on inch mm tape The project was overseen by Ross Snyder Ampex manager of special products To make the multitrack recorder work Snyder invented the Sel Sync process which used some tracks on the head for playback and other tracks on the head for recording This made the newly recorded material be in sync with the existing recorded tracks The first of these machines cost and was installed in Les Paul s home recording studio by David Sarser br In Ampex responded to demand by stepping up production of their track machines with the production model MM Like earlier track machines of this era it used inch tape br br br and track recorders br In Ampex built their first track recorder the model AG at the request of Mirasound Studios in New York City In Ampex introduced a track version of the MM which was the world s first track professional tape recorder put into mass production Both used a inch mm tape transport design adapted from the video recording division The track MM quickly became legendary for its tremendous flexibility reliability and outstanding sound quality This brought about the golden age of large format analog multitrack recorders which would last into the mid s MCI built the first track recorder using inch tape in which was installed at TTG Studios in Los Angeles Later machines built by Ampex starting in would have as many as tracks on inch tape In addition to this the introduction of SMPTE time code allowed studios to run multiple machines in perfect synchronization making the number of available tracks virtually unlimited br By the s Ampex faced tough competition from the Swiss company Studer and Japanese manufacturers such as Otari and Sony who also purchased the MCI brand in In Ampex introduced their most advanced track recorder the model ATR The ATR was ruggedly constructed and had audio specifications that nearly rivaled the first digital recording machines However sales of the ATR were slow due to the machine s high price tag Ampex sold only about or ATR machines and withdrew from the professional audio tape recorder market entirely in br br br The s br By the s Ampex focused more on video recorders instrumentation recorders and data recorders In Ampex sold their professional audio recorder line to Sprague Magnetics The Ampex Recording Media Corporation spun off in as Quantegy Inc that company has ceased producing recording tape br br Consumer models br br br br br br br br br br br Video technology br br br Video processing br br While AMPEX are well recognized for their contribution to magnetic tape recording they also had a huge impact on developments the whole video signal chain br They did rebadge some specialist low volume OEM products to complete the package but their in house teams developed industry leading products in the following categories br br br Digital optics br ADO Ampex Digital Optics provided comprehensive frame manipulation in and dimensions Adjusting the aspect size and rotation of the image was performed continuously in real time An optional digital combiner was available to perform the foreground layering and priority switching to reduce the burden on the vision mixer with multi channel effects br br br Video switching and effects br AVC The AVC range of vision mixers ranged from small single buss devices up to the high end Century Series with multiple Mix Effect busses infinite re entry and powerful keying and control software br br br Editing controllers br The product line evolved quickly from manual editing on the actual VTRs themselves to incorporate SMPTE timecode providing advanced timeline control br The RA and EDM were fully functional early products but soon evolved to the extremely powerful ACE family to compete with CMX and other edit controller brands br br br Quadruplex two inch tape br br Starting in the early s RCA Bing Crosby and others tried to record analog video on very fast moving magnetic tape As early as Ampex developed prototype video tape recorders that used a spinning head and relatively slow moving tape In early a team produced the first videotape recorder A young year old engineer Ray Dolby was also part of the team Ampex demonstrated the VR which was the first of Ampex s line of inch Quadruplex videotape recorders on April at the National Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters in Chicago The first magnetically recorded time delayed television network program using the new Ampex Quadruplex recording system was CBS s Douglas Edwards and the News on November br The Quad head assembly rotates at rpm NTSC The four head pieces quad are switched successively so that recorded stripes cross the video portion most of the tape middle audio is on one edge control track is on the other so that head to tape write speed is well in excess of the inch per second cm s physical motion They wrote the video vertically across the width of a tape that was inches mm wide and ran at inches cm per second This allowed hour long television programs to be recorded on one reel of tape In one reel of tape cost and Ampex advertised the cost of the recorder as A inch per second cm s version was released later and this required a new narrower headwheel This vertical writing facilitated mechanical editing once the control track was developed to display the pulse that indicates where a frame ends and the next one begins Later Ampex developed electronic editing br The National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences awarded Ampex its first Emmy in for this development Ampex received a total of Emmys for its technical video achievements br In Richard Nixon then Vice President and Nikita Khrushchev held discussions at the Moscow Trade Fair which became known as the Kitchen Debate because they were mostly held in the kitchen of a suburban model house These discussions were recorded on an Ampex color videotape recorder and during the debate Nixon pointed this out as one of the many American technological advances br br In Ampex introduced the Ampex VR portable broadcast video recorder which revolutionized the recording of broadcast quality television in the field without the need for long cables and large support vehicles Broadcast quality images could now be shot anywhere including from airplanes helicopters and boats br The Quadruplex format dominated the broadcast industry for a quarter of a century The format was licensed to RCA for use in their television tape recorders Ampex s invention revolutionized the television production industry by eliminating the kinescope process of time shifting television programs which required the use of motion picture film For archival purposes the kinescope method continued to be used for some years film was still preferred by archivists The Ampex broadcast video tape recorder facilitated time zone broadcast delay so that networks could air programming at the same hour in various time zones Ampex had trademarked the name video tape so competitor RCA called the medium TV tape or television tape The terms eventually became genericized and videotape is commonly used today br While the quadruplex recording system per se is no longer in use the principle evolved into the helical scanning technique used in virtually all video tape machines such as those using the consumer formats of VHS Sony Betamax and Video Sony Betacam was successful as a professional format but operated with a different recording system and faster tape speed than Betamax br One of the key engineers in the development of the Quadruplex video recorder for Ampex was Ray Dolby who worked under Charlie Ginsburg and went on to form Dolby Laboratories a pioneer in audio noise reduction systems Dolby s contribution to the videotape system was limited to the mathematics behind the reactance tube FM modulator as videotape then used FM modulation for the video portion Another contributor designed the FM modulator itself Dolby left Ampex to seek a PhD in physics in England which is where Dolby Labs was later founded before moving back to San Francisco Dolby s brother Dale was also an engineer at Ampex br br br VR and VR br In Ampex introduced the first inch helical scan video recorders the Ampex inch helical VTRs which recorded video using helical scan recording technology on tape br br br Ampex inch helical VTR br br Ampex inch helical VTRs were manufactured from to Model VR for home The VR for Broadcast television systems industrial companies educational institutions and a few for In flight entertainment The VR and VR found service at educational institutions especially due to their relatively low cost vs inch mm quadruplex VTRs These machines were simple to operate reliable small in size and produced for their time very good video without the complexity of the larger and much more complex Quad machines br br br HS and HS slo mo disc recorder br br In March Ampex introduced the HS video disc recorder The system was developed by Ampex at the request of the American Broadcasting Company ABC for a variety of sports broadcast uses It was first demonstrated on the air on March when ABC s Wide World of Sports televised the World Series of Skiing from Vail Colorado The video was recorded on analog magnetic disc The disc weighed pounds kg and rotated at rps rpm rps in PAL One NTSC unit could record seconds of video PAL units seconds The video could then be played back in slow motion stop action to freeze frame br A more deluxe version the HS was introduced in April and provided a large control console with variable speed playback This made it ideal for instant replay for sports events and precise timing control in post production service CBS TV was the first to use the technique during live sportscasts though it was quickly adopted by all American TV networks The HS which was an HS connected to a control console had greater precise frame and timing control capability lending itself to post production applications like special effects and titles The HS had a frame accurate timing computer that enabled frame accurate cuts and dissolve transitions by way of a two input video switcher Slow motion sequences could likewise be programmed and could be triggered to begin via an external control pulse such as might come from an external VTR editor like the Ampex VR VTR with Editec The HS was the first system capable of single frame video animation recording using magnetic discs as opposed to videotape The HS also provided a readout with specific frame numbers showing from the frames available NTSC version Sequences could be triggered to start from any of these frames with frame accurate repeatability for creative fine tuning of sequence start and end points br br br Type A br br inch type A videotape designated Type A by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers SMPTE was an open reel helical scan videotape format developed by Ampex in one of the first standardized open reel videotape formats in the inch mm width most others of that size at that time were proprietary br br br Type C br br inch type C videotape designated Type C by SMPTE was a professional open reel videotape format co developed and introduced by Ampex and Sony in It became the replacement in the professional video and television broadcast industries for the then incumbent Quadruplex br br br D br br D is a digital video tape format created by Ampex and other manufacturers through a standards group of SMPTE and introduced at the NAB National Association of Broadcasters convention as a lower cost alternative to the D format Like D D video is uncompressed however it saves bandwidth and other costs by sampling a fully encoded NTSC or PAL composite video signal and storing it directly to magnetic tape rather than sampling component video This is known as digital composite br br br DCT and DST br br Digital Component Technology DCT and Data Storage Technology DST are VTR and data storage devices respectively created by Ampex in Both were similar to the D and D VTR formats using a millimetre in width with the DCT format using DCT discrete cosine transform video compression also its namesake br The DCT and DST formats yielded relatively high capacity and speed for data and video Double density DST data storage was introduced in The final generation of these products were quad density introduced in resulting in a large cartridge holding GB of data br br br Milestones br In the first tape delayed U S radio program was broadcast by using an Ampex Model tape recorder br In May Model introduced improvements in audio head tape drive and tape path br In Model introduced lower cost professional quality audio recorder soon to be replaced by the Model A which was the logical precursor of the Model br In Ampex introduced the first dedicated instrumentation recorder Model built for the U S Navy br In April Model introduced audio recorder to replace the Model Model A The Model had more simplicity and durability Ampex released the mm four track CinemaScope stereo reproduction system br In May Model introduced mastering quality audio portable recorder Models high speed duplicators also introduced br In in a recording studio equipped with an Ampex reel to reel audio tape recording machine an unknown truck driver named Elvis Presley recorded his historic first single That s All Right at Sun Studios in Memphis Also that year Ampex introduced the first multi track audio recorder derived from multi track data recording technology br In Ampex released the mm and mm six track and four track Todd AO system and an improved mm four track system br On March The Ampex VRX later renamed the Mark IV videotape recorder is introduced at the National Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters in Chicago This is the first practical videotape recorder and is hailed as a major technological breakthrough CBS goes on air with the first videotape delayed broadcast Douglas Edwards and The News on November from Los Angeles California using the Ampex Mark IV br In March Ampex won an Emmy award for the invention of the Video Tape Recorder VTR br In NASA selected Ampex data recorders and magnetic tape It has been used for virtually all U S space missions since br In the Nixon Khrushchev Kitchen Debate was recorded on Ampex videotape The fact that the debate was being videotaped was mentioned by Nixon as an example of American technological development br In The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented Ampex with an Oscar for technical achievement br January Helical scan recording was invented by Ampex The technology behind the worldwide consumer video revolution it is used in all home video tape recorders br In Ampex technology was used to show replays of the live assassination of Lee Harvey Oswald br In Ampex introduced EDITEC electronic video editing allowing broadcast television editors frame by frame recording control simplifying tape editing and the ability to make animation effects possible This was the basis for all subsequent editing systems br On December Instant Replay is used for the first time during the live transmission of the Army Navy Game by its inventor director Tony Verna br In April Ampex introduced the VR high band videotape recorder the first ever to be capable of color fidelity required for high quality color broadcasting br February introduced VR and VR closed circuit video tape recorder br May introduced AG first all transistorized audio recorder br July introduced VR B VTR advanced version of VR replaces VR and VR br November introduced VR compact portable closed circuit video tape recorder br During Ampex FR data drives were used to record the first images of the Earth from the Moon as part of the Lunar Orbiter program Two drives were refurbished to recover the images as part of the Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery Project LOIRP br br In ABC used the Ampex HS disk recorder for slow motion playback of downhill skiing on the program World Series of Skiing in Vail Colorado This was the first use of slow motion instant replay in sporting events br In the introduction of the Ampex VR revolutionizes video recording the first truly portable VTR It is used at the Summer Olympics in Mexico City to follow the world s cross country runners for the first time in Broadcast history br In Ampex introduced Videofile still in use at Scotland Yard for the electronic storage and retrieval of fingerprints br In Ampex introduced the ACR the first automated robotic library system for the recording and playback of television commercials Each commercial was recorded on an individual cartridge These cartridges were then loaded into a large rotating carousel Using sophisticated mechanics and vacuum pneumatics the carts were loaded into and extracted from the machine with an second cycle time for spots under seconds This freed TV stations from loading individual machines with spots in real time or preparing spot reels in advance of a broadcast The TV newsroom also began to use the ACR to run news stories because of its random access capability The ACR used AVR signal servo and timebase systems and a machine programming control bay designed by Ampex engineer E Stanley Busby Both machines had a lockup time of milliseconds as distinct from the industry standard second pre roll This was accomplished with optical vacuum reel servos providing the vacuum capstan negligible inertial mass to control and predictive digital servos that could re frame vertically at horizontal rate as well as timebase correction with a window exceeding microseconds compared to the VR s window of less than microseconds br Also in Ampex started its own record label Ampex Records Its biggest hit was We Gotta Get You A Woman by Todd Rundgren as Runt reaching No on the charts in br In the Ampex Video Art AVA video graphics system is used by artist LeRoy Neiman on air during Super Bowl XII AVA the first video paint system allows the graphic artist using an electronic pen to illustrate in a new medium video This innovation paved the way for high quality electronic graphics such as those used in video games br In Ampex introduced DST high performance computer mass storage products able to store half the Library of Congress in square feet m of floor space and DCT the first digital component postproduction system using image compression technology to produce high quality images br In Ampex introduced the DCRS digital cassette recorder offering compact cassette storage with the equivalent of digital or DDR instrumentation reels on one cassette Also Partial Response Maximum Likelihood PRML data decoding technology has its first use in Ampex s DCRsi recorders This technology is commonly used in high performance computer disk drives and other high density magnetic data storage devices br In Ampex introduced the DIS i and DIS i dual port data instrumentation recorders These made it possible for the first time to capture real time instrumentation data and then utilize the same recorder to process the data in a computer environment through its second port using SCSI protocol br In Ampex received its th Emmy award for its invention of slow motion color recording and playback Also honored with Lifetime Achievement Awards were the members of the engineering team that created the videotape recorder when they worked for Ampex Charles Andersen Ray Dolby Shelby Henderson Fred Pfost and the late Charles Ginsburg and Alex Maxey br br br Sticky shed syndrome br Some master tapes and other recordings predominantly from the s and s have degraded due to the so called sticky shed syndrome When sticky shed syndrome occurs the binding agent deteriorates resulting in the magnetic coating coming off the base and either sticking to the backing of the tape layer wound on top of it resulting in dropout or being scraped off and deposited on the tape heads while lifting the head off the tape degrading the treble br br The problem has been reported on a number of makes of tape usually back coated tapes including Ampex tapes br Ampex filed U S patent for a baking process A typical temperature used is C F and a typical time is hours to attempt to recover such tapes allowing them to be played once more and the recordings transferred to new media The problems have been reported on tapes of type br br br Branding br In Ampex acquired Orradio Industries and it became the Ampex Magnetic Tape Division br In Ampex divested this division then called the Ampex Recording Media Corporation This became Quantegy Inc which later changed its name to the current Quantegy Recording Solutions br In January having previously filed for bankruptcy protection Quantegy closed its manufacturing facility in Opelika br In October Ampex Data Systems Corporation was sold to Delta Information Systems but retains the rights to the Ampex name br In Ampex established a second business unit Ampex Intelligent Systems AIS in Colorado Springs Colorado and branded its Silicon Valley business unit Ampex Data Systems ADS br br br Record labels br Ampex Records was started in Its biggest hit was We Gotta Get You A Woman by Todd Rundgren as Runt reaching No on the Billboard Hot chart in Ampex also originated three subsidiary labels Bearsville Big Tree and Lizard Ampex Records ceased operations around Bearsville and Big Tree switched distribution respectively to Warner Bros Records and Bell Records and Lizard became an independent entity Later on Big Tree was picked up by Atlantic Records br br br Legal history br In iNEXTV a wholly owned subsidiary of respondent Ampex Corporation brought a defamation lawsuit against a poster on an Internet message board who posted messages critical of them Ampex Corp v Cargle Cal App th The poster a former employee responded with an anti SLAPP suit and eventually recovered his attorney fees The case was unique in that it involved the legality of speech in an electronic public forum br br br Present Day Since br After becoming part of Delta Information Systems in two former subsidiaries of Ampex Corporation continued business as part of the Ampex legacy Ampex Data Systems Corporation ADSC headquartered in Silicon Valley and its subsidiary Ampex Japan Ltd are the only two Ampex businesses that still trade as more than in name only entities br Ampex Data Systems operates out of main three locations in the USA the headquarters in Hayward CA about a dozen miles from the Redwood City location in Silicon Valley a program office in Colorado Springs CO and an engineering center in Las Cruces NM as well as from the main Delta HQ in Horsham PA Ampex continues to produce rugged data storage products used by government military and commercial customers world wide br Since joining Delta Ampex has grown in revenue and headcount employing significantly more people in than were employed under the previous management structure br
