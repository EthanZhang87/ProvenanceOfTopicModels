negotiate and document the transaction br br br Stages in a venture round br Introduction Investors and companies seek each other out through formal and informal business networks personal connections paid or unpaid finders researchers and advisers and the like Because there are no public exchanges listing their securities private companies meet venture capital firms and other private equity investors in several ways including warm referrals from the investors trusted sources and other business contacts investor conferences and symposia and summits where companies pitch directly to investor groups in face to face meetings including a variant known as Speed Venturing which is akin to speed dating for capital where the investor decides within minutes whether s he wants a follow up meeting br Offering The company provides the investment firm a confidential business plan to secure initial interest br Private placement memorandum A PPM prospectus is generally not used in the Silicon Valley model br Negotiation of terms Non binding term sheets letters of intent and the like are exchanged back and forth as negotiation documents Once the parties agree on terms they sign the term sheet as an expression of commitment br Signed term sheet These are usually non binding and commit the parties only to good faith attempts to complete the transaction on specified terms but may also contain some procedural promises of limited to day duration like confidentiality exclusivity on the part of the company i e the company will not seek funding from other sources and stand still provisions e g the company will not undertake any major business changes or enter agreements that would make the transaction infeasible br Definitive transaction documents A drawn out usually weeks process of negotiating and drafting a series of contracts and other legal papers used to implement the transaction In theory these simply follow the terms of the term sheet In practice they contain many important details that are beyond the scope of the major deal terms Definitive transaction documents are not required in all situations Specifically where the parties have entered into a separate agreement that does not require that the parties execute all such documents br Definitive documents the legal papers that document the final transaction Generally includes br Stock purchase agreements the primary contract by which investors exchange money for newly minted shares of preferred stock br Buy sell agreements co sale agreements right of first refusal etc agreements by which company founders and other owners of common stock agree to limit their individual ability to sell their shares in favor of the new investors br Investor rights agreements covenants the company makes to the new investors generally include promises with respect to board seats negative covenants not to obtain additional financing sell the company or make other specified business and financial decisions without the investors approval and positive covenants such as inspection rights and promises to provide ongoing financial disclosures br Amended and restated articles of incorporation formalize issues like authorization and classes of shares and certain investor protections br Due diligence Simultaneously with negotiating the definitive agreements the investors examine the financial statements and books and records of the company and all aspects of its operations They may require that certain matters be corrected before agreeing to the transaction e g new employment contracts or stock vesting schedules for key executives At the end of the process the company offers representations and warranties to the investors concerning the accuracy and sufficiency of the company s disclosures as well as the existence of certain conditions subject to enumerated exceptions as part of the stock purchase agreement br Final agreement occurs when the parties execute all of the transaction documents This is generally when the funding is announced and the deal considered complete although there are often rumors and leaks br Closing occurs when the investors provide the funding and the company provides stock certificates to the investors Ideally this would be simultaneous and contemporaneous with the final agreement However conventions in the venture community are fairly lax with respect to timing and formality of closing and generally depend on the goodwill of the parties and their attorneys To reduce cost and speed up transactions formalities common in other industries such as escrow of funds signed original documents and notarization are rarely required This creates some opportunity for incomplete and erroneous paperwork Some transactions have rolling closings or multiple closing dates for different investors Others are tranched meaning the investors only give part of the funds at a time with the remainder disbursed over time subject to the company meeting specified milestones br Post closing After the closing a few things may occur br Conversion of convertible notes If there are outstanding notes they may convert at or after closing br securities filing with relevant state and or federal regulators br Filing of amended Articles of Incorporation br Preparation of closing binder contains documentation of entire transaction br br br Rights and privileges br Venture investors obtain special privileges that are not granted to holders of common stock These are embodied in the various transaction documents Common rights include br br Anti dilution protection if the company ever sells a significant amount of stock at a price lower than the investor paid then to protect investors against stock dilution they are issued additional shares usually by changing the conversion ratio used to calculate their liquidation preference br Guaranteed board seats br Positive and negative covenants by the company br Registration right the investors have special rights to demand registration of their stock on public exchanges and to participate in an initial public offering and subsequent public offerings br Representations and warranties as to the state of the company br Liquidation preferences in any liquidation event such as a merger or acquisition the investors get their money back often with interest and or at a multiple before common stock is paid any funds from liquidation The preference may be participating in which case the investors get their preference and their proportionate share of the surplus or non participating in which case the preference is a floor br Dividends dividend amounts are usually stated but not mandatory on the part of the company except that the investors will get their dividends before any dividends may be declared for common stock Most venture backed start ups are initially unprofitable so dividends are rarely paid Unpaid dividends are generally forgiven but they may be accumulated and are added to the liquidation
