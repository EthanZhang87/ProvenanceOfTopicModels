Altera Corporation is a manufacturer of programmable logic devices PLDs headquartered in San Jose California It was founded in and acquired by Intel in before becoming independent once again in as a company focused on development of Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA technology and system on a chip FPGAs br The company was founded in by semiconductor veterans Rodney Smith Robert Hartmann James Sansbury and Paul Newhagen with in seed money The name of the company was a play on alterable the type of chips the company created In Altera became a public company via an initial public offering IPO br On December the company was acquired by Intel and became a newly formed business unit called Programmable Solutions Group PSG In October Intel announced it would be spinning off PSG into a separate company at the start of while maintaining majority ownership and intending to seek an IPO within three years In February Intel announced that the newly independent company would reestablish the Altera name and branding br br br Products br br br FPGAs br br The main product lines from Altera are the Agilex FPGA product lines and their predecessors the high end Stratix series mid range Arria series and lower cost Cyclone series as well as the MAX series non volatile FPGAs br br br Semiconductor intellectual property cores br Altera and its partners offer an array of semiconductor intellectual property cores that serve as building blocks that design engineers can drop into their system designs to perform specific functions IP cores eliminate some of the time consuming tasks of creating every block in a design from scratch In Altera acquired Designpro and Northwest Logic providers of IP cores in order to expand its design capabilities and move towards delivery of complete system on chip solutions br br br System on a chip FPGAs br Beginning in December the company announced the shipment of its first system on a chip FPGA devices using a fully depleted silicon on insulator FDSOI nm chip manufacturing process These are the Cyclone V SoC devices which have a dual core ARM architecture Cortex A processor system with FPGA logic on a single chip These devices integrated FPGAs with full hard processor systems based around ARM architecture onto a single device As of the majority of Altera s FPGA devices are available as an SoC variant with an ARM hard processor system integrated with the FPGA as a single system on a chip br These SoCs are targeted for use in wireless communications industrial video surveillance automotive and medical equipment markets With these SoCs devices users were able to create custom field programmable SoC variants for power board space performance and cost optimization br Cyclone V SoC Arria V SoC and Arria SoC product families are system on a chip FPGAs based upon a hard ARM Cortex A dual core processor system br Stratix SoC and Agilex SoC product families are system on a chip FPGAs based upon a hard ARM Cortex A quad core processor system br The Agilex SoC product family are system on a chip FPGAs based upon a hard ARM Cortex A A quad core processor system br br br Soft Processor cores br Altera offers the Nios V embedded soft processor cores based on the RISC V instruction set architecture Previously Altera had offered their own proprietary Nios II embedded soft processor the Freescale ColdFire v core and the ARM Cortex M processor br br br Design software br br All of Altera s devices are supported by a common design environment the Quartus Prime design software which is a multi platform development environment that includes various tools needed to design FPGAs SoC FPGAs and CPLDs br In May Altera made available SDK for OpenCL enabling software programmers to access the high performance capabilities of programmable logic devices br Altera also support high level synthesis using SYCL extensions to ANSI C C br br br Intel Partnership Acquisition and Ownership br In the company formed a long running design partnership with Intel In Altera acquired the PLD business of Intel for million br br br Intel nm technology br In February Altera announced an agreement to use Intel s foundry services to produce its nm node for the future manufacturing of its FPGAs based on Intel s nm tri gate transistor technology in place of Altera s ongoing agreement with TSMC The Stratix product family was the first such product line br br br Acquisition and Ownership by Intel br In December Intel acquired Altera for billion in cash Altera became Intel s newly formed business unit called the Programmable Solutions Group PSG br In October Intel announced it would be spinning off PSG into a separate company at the start of while maintaining majority ownership and intending to seek an IPO within three years In February Intel announced that the newly independent company would reestablish the Altera name and branding br br br Restatement of financial results br On June after an investigation by the U S Securities and Exchange Commission the company restated its financial results from to to correct accounting errors related to options backdating The chief financial officer of the company resigned Altera filed a petition to overturn related regulations but was under Intel denied in br br br See also br Xilinx br Intel br AMD br br br
