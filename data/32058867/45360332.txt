In March Adi Soffer Teeni was appointed CEO of Facebook Israel br In an email dated June Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg directed engineers at Facebook to find a method of obtaining reliable analytics about Snapchat which he noted that Facebook lacked due to Snapchat s network traffic being encrypted The solution Facebook engineers proposed to Zuckerberg s directive was to use Onavo which allowed the company to read network traffic on a device prior to its being encrypted thereby giving the company the ability to measure detailed in app activity and to collect analytics on Snapchat app usage from devices on which Onavo was installed It did this by creating fake digital certificates to impersonate trusted Snapchat YouTube and Amazon analytics servers to redirect and decrypt secure traffic from those apps for Facebook s strategic analysis The program which was named Project Ghostbusters in reference to Snapchat s ghost shaped logo was later expanded to include Amazon and YouTube br In February it was reported that Facebook had begun to include advertising for the Onavo Protect app within the Facebook app for iOS users in the United States This led to denouncements of the app by media outlets who classified Onavo as spyware because it is used by Facebook to monetize usage habits within a privacy focused environment and because the app listing did not contain a prominent disclosure of Facebook s ownership The app s listings were later amended to disclaim that Onavo Protect may collect information on app and website usage to improve Facebook products and services br In

disclose how Onavo would be used to collect data as well as A to cover the ACCC s legal fees br In Jordana Cutler who had previously served as the director of Ambassador Ron Dermer s office and as an advisor to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was appointed as Public Policy Director for Facebook Israel br In September Israel s Minister of Justice Ayelet Shaked and Minister of Internal Security

Dubbed the Facebook Law by the media the proposal garnered widespread support within the government Between and it passed through various stages of approval first gaining endorsement from the Ministerial Committee for Legislation then advancing through preliminary and first readings in the Knesset Plenum making it eligible for consideration in the Constitution Law and Justice Committee In July the committee greenlit the bill for its second and third readings setting the stage for final ratification by the Knesset plenary However at the eleventh hour Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unexpectedly intervened to halt the process In response Nissan Slomiansky chairman of the Constitution Law and Justice Committee asserted that the sudden reversal was prompted by pressure from large forces with vested interests Media reports speculated that Jordana Cutler Netanyahu s former advisor who serves as Facebook s Public Policy Director in Israel played a pivotal role in influencing the Prime Minister s decision to block the legislation Lawyer Itai Leshem claimed during his campaign in the Israeli Labor Party leadership election that this was part of an ongoing alleged bribe between PM Netanyahu and Facebook br br br Products br Onavo maintained consumer oriented utility apps including Onavo Count which tracked bandwidth usage by apps as well as Onavo Extend and Onavo Protect

Ghostbusters an allusion to Snapchat s logo and the film franchise br In August The Wall Street Journal reported that since the acquisition of Onavo by Facebook the company had been using the company s data to monitor Snapchat and other startups that are performing unusually well This data influenced Facebook to acquire WhatsApp in and plan a video chat app to rival Houseparty in br br br Facebook

Facebook Research is administered by third party beta testing services including Applause and BetaBound and requires users to install a Facebook root certificate on their phone On iOS this is prohibited by Apple s Enterprise Developer License Agreement as the methods used are intended solely for use by a company s employees for use cases such as internal software specific to their environment and internal pre release versions of apps br br br Responses br Facebook initially responded by claiming that Facebook Research did not violate Apple s developer license agreement and

eagerness to engage in anti competitive behavior Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey announced that he would introduce a bill to strengthen the Children s Online Privacy Protection Act COPPA and said that it is inherently manipulative to offer teens money in exchange for their personal information when younger users don t have a clear understanding how much data they re handing over and how sensitive
