Cryptocat is a discontinued open source desktop application intended to allow encrypted online chatting available for Windows OS X and Linux It uses end to end encryption to secure all communications to other Cryptocat users Users are given the option of independently verifying their buddies device lists and are notified when a buddy s device list is modified and all updates are verified through the built in update downloader br Cryptocat was created by Nadim Kobeissi and further developed along with a community of open source contributors and is published under the terms of the GPLv license although it has since been discontinued br br br History br Cryptocat was first launched on May as a web application br In June Kobeissi said he was detained at the U S border by the DHS and questioned about Cryptocat s censorship resistance He tweeted about the incident afterwards resulting in media coverage and a spike in the popularity of the software br In June security researcher Steve Thomas pointed out a security bug that could be used to decrypt any group chat message that had taken place using Cryptocat between September and April Private messages were not affected and the bug had been resolved a month before In response Cryptocat issued a security advisory requested that all users ensure that they had upgraded and informed users that past group conversations may have been compromised br In February an audit by iSec Partners criticized Cryptocat s authentication model as insufficient In response Cryptocat made improvements to user authentication making it easier for users to authenticate and detect man in the middle attacks br In February citing dissatisfaction with the project s current state after months of non maintenance Kobeissi announced that he would be taking Cryptocat temporarily offline and discontinuing the development of its mobile application pending a complete rewrite and relaunch of the software In March Kobeissi announced the re release of Cryptocat rewritten completely as desktop software instead of the original web application software as a public beta and the resumption of the service The new desktop centric approach allowed Cryptocat to benefit from stronger desktop integration in a style similar to Pidgin br In February it was announced that Cryptocat would be discontinued As of December the cryptocat domain is for sale and links to the site for the Wire messenger br br br Features br Cryptocat allows its users to set up end to end encrypted chat conversations Users can exchange one to one messages encrypted files photos as well as create and share audio video recordings All devices linked to Cryptocat accounts will receive forward secure messages even when offline br All messages files and audio video recordings sent over Cryptocat are end to end encrypted Cryptocat users link their devices to their Cryptocat account upon connection and can identify each other s devices via the client s device manager in order to prevent man in the middle attacks Cryptocat also employs a Trust on first use mechanism in order to help detect device identity key changes br Cryptocat also includes a built in auto update mechanism that automatically performs a signature check on downloaded updates in order to verify authenticity and employs TLS certificate pinning in order to prevent network impersonation attacks br Originally in Cryptocat offered the ability to connect to Facebook Messenger to initiate encrypted chatting with other Cryptocat users According to the developers the feature was meant to help offer an alternative to the regular Cryptocat chat model which did not offer long term contact lists This feature was disconnected in November br br br Reception and usage br In June Cryptocat was used by journalist Glenn Greenwald while in Hong Kong to meet NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden for the first time after other encryption software failed to work br In November Cryptocat was banned in Iran shortly after the election of Iran s new president Hassan Rouhani who had promised more open Internet laws br Cryptocat was listed on the Electronic Frontier Foundation s Secure Messaging Scorecard from November until March During that time Cryptocat had a score of out of points on the scorecard It had received points for having communications encrypted in transit having communications encrypted with keys the provider did not have access to end to end encryption making it possible for users to independently verify their correspondent s identities having past communications secure if the keys were stolen forward secrecy having its code open to independent review open source having its security designs well documented and having completed an independent security audit br br br Architecture br br br Encryption br Cryptocat uses a Double Ratchet Algorithm in order to obtain forward and future secrecy across messages after a session is established using a four way Elliptic curve Diffie Hellman handshake The handshake mixes in long term identity keys an intermediate term signed pre key and a one time use pre key The approach is similar to the encryption protocol adopted for encrypted messaging by the Signal mobile application Cryptocat s goal is for its messages to obtain confidentiality integrity source authenticity forward and future secrecy and indistinguishability even over a network controlled by an active attacker The forward secrecy features of the protocol that Cryptocat uses are similar to those first introduced by Off the Record Messaging br Cryptocat uses the Advanced Encryption Standard in Galois Counter Mode for authenticated encryption Curve for Elliptic curve Diffie Hellman shared secret agreement HMAC SHA for key derivation and Ed for signing In order to limit the effect of a long term identity key compromise long term keys are used exclusively once for the initial Authenticated Key Exchange and once for signing a newly generated intermediate term signed pre key br For the transport layer Cryptocat adopts the OMEMO Multi End Message and Object Encryption standard which also gives Cryptocat multi device support and allows for offline messaging br br br Network br Cryptocat s network relies on a XMPP configuration served over WebSockets According to the project s mission statement Cryptocat s network only relays encrypted messages and does not store any data In addition to the Cryptocat client s end to end encryption protocol client server communication is protected by TLS br br br Distribution br From March until March Cryptocat was officially distributed through the Google Chrome Web Store the Apple App Store and other official channels controlled by targeted platforms After Cryptocat s re write into desktop software in March the software became distributed exclusively through Cryptocat s own servers which also handle signed update delivery br br br See also br br
