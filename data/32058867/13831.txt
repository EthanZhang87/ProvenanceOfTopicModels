id: 13831
Human rights are moral principles or norms for standards of human behaviour and are regularly protected as substantive rights in substantive law municipal and international law They are commonly understood as inalienable fundamental rights to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being and which are inherent in all human beings regardless of their age ethnic origin location language religion ethnicity or any other status They are applicable everywhere and at every time in the sense of being universal and they are egalitarian in the sense of being the same for everyone They are regarded as requiring empathy and the rule of law and imposing an obligation on persons to respect the human rights of others it is generally considered that they should not be taken away except as a result of due process based on specific circumstances br The doctrine of human rights has been highly influential within international law and global and regional institutions The precise meaning of the term right is controversial and is the subject of continued philosophical debate While there is consensus that human rights encompass a wide variety of rights such as the right to a fair trial protection against enslavement prohibition of genocide free speech or a right to education there is disagreement about which of these particular rights should be included within the general framework of human rights some thinkers suggest that human rights should be a minimum requirement to avoid the worst case abuses while others see it as a higher standard br Many of the basic ideas that animated the human rights movement developed in the aftermath of the Second World War and the events of the Holocaust culminating in the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Paris by the United Nations General Assembly in Ancient peoples did not have the same modern day conception of universal human rights The true forerunner of human rights discourse was the concept of natural rights which first appeared as part of the medieval natural law tradition and developed in new directions during the European Enlightenment with such philosophers as John Locke Francis Hutcheson and Jean Jacques Burlamaqui and which featured prominently in the political discourse of the American Revolution and the French Revolution From this foundation the modern human rights arguments emerged over the latter half of the th century possibly as a reaction to slavery torture genocide and war crimes br br br History br br Many of the basic ideas that animated the human rights movement developed in the aftermath of the Second World War and the events of the Holocaust culminating in the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Paris by the United Nations General Assembly in br Ancient peoples did not have the same modern day conception of universal human rights However the concept has in some sense existed for centuries although not in the same way as today br The true forerunner of human rights discourse was the concept of natural rights which first appeared as part of the medieval natural law tradition It developed in new directions during the European Enlightenment with such philosophers as John Locke Francis Hutcheson and Jean Jacques Burlamaqui and featured prominently in the political discourse of the American Revolution and the French Revolution From this foundation the modern human rights arguments emerged over the latter half of the th century possibly as a reaction to slavery torture genocide and war crimes br The medieval natural law tradition was heavily influenced by the writings of St Paul s early Christian thinkers such as St Hilary of Poitiers St Ambrose and St Augustine Augustine was among the earliest to examine the legitimacy of the laws of man and attempt to define the boundaries of what laws and rights occur naturally based on wisdom and conscience instead of being arbitrarily imposed by mortals and if people are obligated to obey laws that are unjust br Spanish scholasticism insisted on a subjective vision of law during the th and th centuries Luis de Molina Domingo de Soto and Francisco Vitoria members of the School of Salamanca defined law as a moral power over one s own Although they maintained at the same time the idea of law as an objective order they stated that there are certain natural rights mentioning both rights related to the body right to life to property and to the spirit right to freedom of thought dignity The jurist V zquez de Menchaca starting from an individualist philosophy was decisive in the dissemination of the term iura naturalia This natural law thinking was supported by contact with American civilizations and the debate that took place in Castile about the just titles of the conquest and in particular the nature of the indigenous people In the Castilian colonization of America it is often stated measures were applied in which the germs of the idea of Human Rights are present debated in the well known Valladolid Debate that took place in and The thought of the School of Salamanca especially through Francisco Vitoria also contributed to the promotion of European natural law br From this foundation the modern human rights arguments emerged over the latter half of the th century Magna Carta is an English charter originally issued in which influenced the development of the common law and many later constitutional documents related to human rights such as the English Bill of Rights the United States Constitution and the United States Bill of Rights br th century English philosopher John Locke discussed natural rights in his work identifying them as being life liberty and estate property and argued that such fundamental rights could not be surrendered in the social contract In Britain in the English Bill of Rights and the Scottish Claim of Right each made a range of oppressive governmental actions illegal Two major revolutions occurred during the th century in the United States and in France leading to the United States Declaration of Independence and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen respectively both of which articulated certain human rights Additionally the Virginia Declaration of Rights of encoded into law a number of fundamental civil rights and civil freedoms br br We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among these are Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness br br br to World War I br br Philosophers such as Thomas Paine John Stuart Mill and Hegel expanded on the theme of universality during the th and th centuries In William Lloyd Garrison wrote in a newspaper called The Liberator that he was trying to enlist his readers in the great cause of human rights so the term human rights probably came into use sometime between Paine s The Rights of Man and Garrison s publication In a contemporary Henry David Thoreau wrote about human rights in his treatise On the Duty of Civil Disobedience which was later influential on human rights and civil rights thinkers United States Supreme Court Justice David Davis in his opinion for Ex Parte Milligan wrote By the protection of the law human rights are secured withdraw that protection and they are at the mercy of wicked rulers or the clamor of an excited people br Many groups and movements have managed to achieve profound social changes over the course of the th century in the name of human rights In Western Europe and North America labour unions brought about laws granting workers the right to strike establishing minimum work conditions and forbidding or regulating child labour The women s rights movement succeeded in gaining for many women the right to vote National liberation movements in many countries succeeded in driving out colonial powers One of the most influential was Mahatma Gandhi s leadership of the Indian independence movement Movements by long oppressed racial and religious minorities succeeded in many parts of the world among them the civil rights movement and more recent diverse identity politics movements on behalf of women and minorities in the United States br The foundation of the International Committee of the Red Cross the Lieber Code and the first of the Geneva Conventions in laid the foundations of International humanitarian law to be further developed following the two World Wars br br br Between World War I and World War II br The League of Nations was established in at the negotiations over the Treaty of Versailles following the end of World War I The League s goals included disarmament preventing war through collective security settling disputes between countries through negotiation diplomacy and improving global welfare Enshrined in its Charter was a mandate to promote many of the rights which were later included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights The League of Nations had mandates to support many of the former colonies of the Western European colonial powers during their transition from colony to independent state Established as an agency of the League of Nations and now part of United Nations the International Labour Organization also had a mandate to promote and safeguard certain of the rights later included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights UDHR br br the primary goal of the ILO today is to promote opportunities for women and men to obtain decent and productive work in conditions of freedom equity security and human dignity br br br After World War II br br br Universal Declaration of Human Rights br br The Universal Declaration of Human Rights UDHR is a non binding declaration adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in partly in response to the events of World War II The UDHR urges member states to promote a number of human civil economic and social rights asserting these rights are part of the foundation of freedom justice and peace in the world The declaration was the first international legal effort to limit the behavior of states and make sure they did their duties to their citizens following the model of the rights duty duality br br recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom justice and peace in the world br The UDHR was framed by members of the Human Rights Commission with Eleanor Roosevelt as chair who began to discuss an International Bill of Rights in The members of the Commission did not immediately agree on the form of such a bill of rights and whether or how it should be enforced The Commission proceeded to frame the UDHR and accompanying treaties but the UDHR quickly became the priority Canadian law professor John Humprey and French lawyer Ren Cassin were responsible for much of the cross national research and the structure of the document respectively where the articles of the declaration were interpretative of the general principle of the preamble The document was structured by Cassin to include the basic principles of dignity liberty equality and brotherhood in the first two articles followed successively by rights pertaining to individuals rights of individuals in relation to each other and to groups spiritual public and political rights and economic social and cultural rights The final three articles place according to Cassin rights in the context of limits duties and the social and political order in which they are to be realized Humphrey and Cassin intended the rights in the UDHR to be legally enforceable through some means as is reflected in the third clause of the preamble br br Whereas it is essential if man is not to be compelled to have recourse as a last resort to rebellion against tyranny and oppression that human rights should be protected by the rule of law br Some of the UDHR was researched and written by a committee of international experts on human rights including representatives from all continents and all major religions and drawing on consultation with leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi The inclusion of both civil and political rights and economic social and cultural rights was predicated on the assumption that basic human rights are indivisible and that the different types of rights listed are inextricably linked Although this principle was not opposed by any member states at the time of adoption the declaration was adopted unanimously with the abstention of the Soviet bloc apartheid South Africa and Saudi Arabia this principle was later subject to significant challenges On the issue of the term universal the declarations did not apply to domestic discrimination or racism Henry J Richardson III argued br br All major governments at the time of drafting the U N charter and the Universal declaration did their best to ensure by all means known to domestic and international law that these principles had only international application and carried no legal obligation on those governments to be implemented domestically All tacitly realized that for their own discriminated against minorities to acquire leverage on the basis of legally being able to claim enforcement of these wide reaching rights would create pressures that would be political dynamite br The onset of the Cold War soon after the UDHR was conceived brought to the fore divisions over the inclusion of both economic and social rights and civil and political rights in the declaration Capitalist states tended to place strong emphasis on civil and political rights such as freedom of association and expression and were reluctant to include economic and social rights such as the right to work and the right to join a union Socialist states placed much greater importance on economic and social rights and argued strongly for their inclusion Because of the divisions over which rights to include and because some states declined to ratify any treaties including certain specific interpretations of human rights and despite the Soviet bloc and a number of developing countries arguing strongly for the inclusion of all rights in a Unity Resolution the rights enshrined in the UDHR were split into two separate covenants allowing states to adopt some rights and derogate others Although this allowed the covenants to be created it denied the proposed principle that all rights are linked which was central to some interpretations of the UDHR Although the UDHR is a non binding resolution it is now considered to be a central component of international customary law which may be invoked under appropriate circumstances by state judiciaries and other judiciaries br br br Human Rights Treaties br In the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ICCPR and the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights ICESCR were adopted by the United Nations between them making the rights contained in the UDHR binding on all states They came into force only in when they were ratified by a sufficient number of countries despite achieving the ICCPR a covenant including no economic or social rights the US only ratified the ICCPR in The ICESCR commits state parties to work toward the granting of economic social and cultural rights ESCR to individuals br br Numerous other treaties pieces of legislation have been offered at the international level They are generally known as human rights instruments Some of the most significant are br br Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide adopted entry into force unhchr ch br Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination CERD adopted entry into force unhchr ch br Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women CEDAW entry into force Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women br United Nations Convention Against Torture CAT adopted entry into force br Convention on the Rights of the Child CRC adopted entry into force Convention on the Rights of the Child UNICEF Archived April at the Wayback Machine br International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families ICRMW adopted br Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court ICC entry into force br br br Including environmental rights br In the United Nations Human Rights Council officially recognized having a clean healthy and sustainable environment as a human right In April the European Court of Human Rights ruled for the first time in history that the Swiss government had violated human rights by not acting strongly enough to stop climate change br br br Promotion strategies br br br Military force br br Responsibility to protect refers to a doctrine for United Nations member states to intervene to protect populations from atrocities It has been cited as justification in the use of recent military interventions An example of an intervention that is often criticized is the military intervention in the First Libyan Civil War by NATO and Qatar where the goal of preventing atrocities is alleged to have taken upon itself the broader mandate of removing the target government br br br Economic actions br br Economic sanctions are often levied upon individuals or states who commit human rights violations Sanctions are often criticized for its feature of collective punishment in hurting a country s population economically in order dampen that population s view of its government It is also argued that counterproductively sanctions on offending authoritarian governments strengthen that government s position domestically as governments would still have more mechanisms to find funding than their critics and opposition who become further weakened br The risk of human rights violations increases with the increase in financially vulnerable populations Girls from poor families in non industrialized economies are often viewed as a financial burden on the family and marriage of young girls is often driven in the hope that daughters will be fed and protected by wealthier families Female genital mutilation and force feeding of daughters is argued to be similarly driven in large part to increase their marriage prospects and thus their financial security by achieving certain idealized standards of beauty In certain areas girls requiring the experience of sexual initiation rites with men and passing sex training tests on girls are designed to make them more appealing as marriage prospects Measures to help the economic status of vulnerable groups in order to reduce human rights violations include girls education and guaranteed minimum incomes and conditional cash transfers such as Bolsa familia which subsidize parents who keep children in school rather than contributing to family income has successfully reduced child labor br br br Informational strategies br br Human rights abuses are monitored by United Nations committees national institutions and governments and by many independent non governmental organizations such as Amnesty International Human Rights Watch World Organisation Against Torture Freedom House International Freedom of Expression Exchange and Anti Slavery International These organisations collect evidence and documentation of human rights abuses and apply pressure to promote human rights Educating people on the concept of human rights has been argued as a strategy to prevent human rights abuses br br br Legal instruments br Many examples of legal instruments at the international regional and national level described below are designed to enforce laws securing human rights br br br Protection at the international level br br br United Nations br br The United Nations UN is the only multilateral governmental agency with universally accepted international jurisdiction for universal human rights legislation All UN organs have advisory roles to the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations Human Rights Council and there are numerous committees within the UN with responsibilities for safeguarding different human rights treaties The most senior body of the UN with regard to human rights is the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights The United Nations has an international mandate to br br achieve international co operation in solving international problems of an economic social cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race sex language or religion br br br Human Rights Council br br The UN Human Rights Council created in has a mandate to investigate alleged human rights violations of the UN member states sit on the council elected by simple majority in a secret ballot of the United Nations General Assembly Members serve a maximum of six years and may have their membership suspended for gross human rights abuses The council is based in Geneva and meets three times a year with additional meetings to respond to urgent situations Independent experts rapporteurs are retained by the council to investigate alleged human rights abuses and to report to the council The Human Rights Council may request that the Security Council refer cases to the International Criminal Court ICC even if the issue being referred is outside the normal jurisdiction of the ICC br br br United Nations treaty bodies br br In addition to the political bodies whose mandate flows from the UN charter the UN has set up a number of treaty based bodies comprising committees of independent experts who monitor compliance with human rights standards and norms flowing from the core international human rights treaties They are supported by and are created by the treaty that they monitor With the exception of the CESCR which was established under a resolution of the Economic and Social Council to carry out the monitoring functions originally assigned to that body under the Covenant they are technically autonomous bodies established by the treaties that they monitor and accountable to the state parties of those treaties rather than subsidiary to the United Nations though in practice they are closely intertwined with the United Nations system and are supported by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights UNHCHR and the UN Centre for Human Rights br br The Human Rights Committee promotes participation with the standards of the ICCPR The members of the committee express opinions on member countries and make judgments on individual complaints against countries which have ratified an Optional Protocol to the treaty The judgments termed views are not legally binding The member of the committee meets around three times a year to hold sessions br The Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights monitors the ICESCR and makes general comments on ratifying countries performance It will have the power to receive complaints against the countries that opted into the Optional Protocol once it has come into force Unlike the other treaty bodies the economic committee is not an autonomous body responsible to the treaty parties but directly responsible to the Economic and Social Council and ultimately to the General Assembly This means that the Economic Committee faces particular difficulties at its disposal only relatively weak means of implementation in comparison to other treaty bodies Particular difficulties noted by commentators include perceived vagueness of the principles of the treaty relative lack of legal texts and decisions ambivalence of many states in addressing economic social and cultural rights comparatively few non governmental organisations focused on the area and problems with obtaining relevant and precise information br The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination monitors the CERD and conducts regular reviews of countries performance It can make judgments on complaints against member states allowing it but these are not legally binding It issues warnings to attempt to prevent serious contraventions of the convention br The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women monitors the CEDAW It receives states reports on their performance and comments on them and can make judgments on complaints against countries which have opted into the Optional Protocol br The Committee Against Torture monitors the CAT and receives states reports on their performance every four years and comments on them Its subcommittee may visit and inspect countries which have opted into the Optional Protocol br The Committee on the Rights of the Child monitors the CRC and makes comments on reports submitted by states every five years It does not have the power to receive complaints br The Committee on Migrant Workers was established in and monitors the ICRMW and makes comments on reports submitted by states every five years It will have the power to receive complaints of specific violations only once ten member states allow it br The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was established in to monitor the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities It has the power to receive complaints against the countries which have opted into the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities br The Committee on Enforced Disappearances monitors the ICPPED All States parties are obliged to submit reports to the committee on how the rights are being implemented The Committee examines each report and addresses its concerns and recommendations to the State party in the form of concluding observations br Each treaty body receives secretariat support from the Human Rights Council and Treaties Division of Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights OHCHR in Geneva except CEDAW which is supported by the Division for the Advancement of Women DAW CEDAW formerly held all its sessions at United Nations headquarters in New York but now frequently meets at the United Nations Office in Geneva the other treaty bodies meet in Geneva The Human Rights Committee usually holds its March session in New York City The human rights enshrined in the UDHR the Geneva Conventions and the various enforced treaties of the United Nations are enforceable in law In practice many rights are very difficult to legally enforce due to the absence of consensus on the application of certain rights the lack of relevant national legislation or of bodies empowered to take legal action to enforce them br br br International courts br br There exist a number of internationally recognized organisations with worldwide mandate or jurisdiction over certain aspects of human rights br br The International Court of Justice ICJ is the United Nations primary judiciary body It has worldwide jurisdiction It is directed by the Security Council The ICJ settles disputes between nations The ICJ does not have jurisdiction over individuals br The International Criminal Court ICC is the body responsible for investigating and punishing war crimes and crimes against humanity when such occur within its jurisdiction with a mandate to bring to justice perpetrators of such crimes that occurred after its creation in A number of UN members have not joined the court and the ICC does not have jurisdiction over their citizens and others have signed but not yet ratified the Rome Statute which established the court br The ICC and other international courts see Regional human rights below exist to take action where the national legal system of a state is unable to try the case itself If national law is able to safeguard human rights and punish those who breach human rights legislation it has primary jurisdiction by complementarity Only when all local remedies have been exhausted does international law take effect br br br Regional human rights regimes br br In over countries national human rights institutions NHRIs have been set up to protect promote or monitor human rights with jurisdiction in a given country Although not all NHRIs are compliant with the Paris Principles the number and effect of these institutions is increasing The Paris Principles were defined at the first International Workshop on National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in Paris on October and adopted by United Nations Human Rights Commission Resolution of and the General Assembly Resolution of The Paris Principles list a number of responsibilities for national institutions br br br Africa br br The African Union AU is a continental union consisting of fifty five African states Established in the AU s purpose is to help secure Africa s democracy human rights and a sustainable economy especially by bringing an end to intra African conflict and creating an effective common market The African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights ACHPR is a quasi judicial organ of the African Union tasked with promoting and protecting human rights and collective peoples rights throughout the African continent as well as interpreting the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights and considering individual complaints of violations of the Charter The commission has three broad areas of responsibility br br Promoting human and peoples rights br Protecting human and peoples rights br Interpreting the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights br In pursuit of these goals the commission is mandated to collect documents undertake studies and researches on African problems in the field of human and peoples rights organise seminars symposia and conferences disseminate information encourage national and local institutions concerned with human and peoples rights and should the case arise give its views or make recommendations to governments Charter Art br With the creation of the African Court on Human and Peoples Rights under a protocol to the Charter which was adopted in and entered into force in January the commission will have the additional task of preparing cases for submission to the Court s jurisdiction In a July decision the AU Assembly resolved that the future Court on Human and Peoples Rights would be integrated with the African Court of Justice The Court of Justice of the African Union is intended to be the principal judicial organ of the Union Protocol of the Court of Justice of the African Union Article Although it has not yet been established it is intended to take over the duties of the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights as well as act as the supreme court of the African Union interpreting all necessary laws and treaties The Protocol establishing the African Court on Human and Peoples Rights entered into force in January but its merging with the Court of Justice has delayed its establishment The Protocol establishing the Court of Justice will come into force when ratified by countries br There are many countries in Africa accused of human rights violations by the international community and NGOs br br br Americas br The Organization of American States OAS is an international organization headquartered in Washington D C United States Its members are the thirty five independent states of the Americas Over the course of the s with the end of the Cold War the return to democracy in Latin America and the thrust toward globalization the OAS made major efforts to reinvent itself to fit the new context Its stated priorities now include the following br br Strengthening democracy br Working for peace br Protecting human rights br Combating corruption br The rights of Indigenous Peoples br Promoting sustainable development br The Inter American Commission on Human Rights the IACHR is an autonomous organ of the Organization of American States also based in Washington D C Along with the Inter American Court of Human Rights based in San Jos Costa Rica it is one of the bodies that comprise the inter American system for the promotion and protection of human rights The IACHR is a permanent body which meets in regular and special sessions several times a year to examine allegations of human rights violations in the hemisphere Its human rights duties stem from three documents br br the American Convention on Human Rights br the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man br the Charter of the Organization of American States br The Inter American Court of Human Rights was established in with the purpose of enforcing and interpreting the provisions of the American Convention on Human Rights Its two main functions are thus adjudicatory and advisory Under the former it hears and rules on the specific cases of human rights violations referred to it Under the latter it issues opinions on matters of legal interpretation brought to its attention by other OAS bodies or member states br br br Asia br br There are no Asia wide organisations or conventions to promote or protect human rights Countries vary widely in their approach to human rights and their record of human rights protection The Association of Southeast Asian Nations ASEAN is a geo political and economic organization of countries located in Southeast Asia which was formed in by Indonesia Malaysia the Philippines Singapore and Thailand The organisation now also includes Brunei Darussalam Vietnam Laos Myanmar and Cambodia In October the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights was inaugurated and subsequently the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration was adopted unanimously by ASEAN members on November br The Arab Charter on Human Rights ACHR was adopted by the Council of the League of Arab States on May br br br Europe br br The Council of Europe founded in is the oldest organisation working for European integration It is an international organisation with legal personality recognised under public international law and has observer status with the United Nations The seat of the Council of Europe is in Strasbourg in France The Council of Europe is responsible for both the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights These institutions bind the council s members to a code of human rights which though strict are more lenient than those of the United Nations charter on human rights The council also promotes the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages and the European Social Charter Membership is open to all European states which seek European integration accept the principle of the rule of law and are able and willing to guarantee democracy fundamental human rights and freedoms br The Council of Europe is an organisation that is not part of the European Union but the latter is expected to accede to the European Convention and potentially the Council itself The EU has its own human rights document the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union The European Convention on Human Rights defines and guarantees since human rights and fundamental freedoms in Europe All member states of the Council of Europe have signed this convention and are therefore under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg In order to prevent torture and inhuman or degrading treatment Article of the convention the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture was established br br br Philosophies of human rights br br Several theoretical approaches have been advanced to explain how and why human rights become part of social expectations One of the oldest Western philosophies on human rights is that they are a product of a natural law stemming from different philosophical or religious grounds Other theories hold that human rights codify moral behavior which is a human social product developed by a process of biological and social evolution associated with David Hume Human rights are also described as a sociological pattern of rule setting as in the sociological theory of law and the work of Max Weber These approaches include the notion that individuals in a society accept rules from legitimate authority in exchange for security and economic advantage as in John Rawls a social contract br br br Natural rights br br Natural law theories base human rights on a natural moral religious or even biological order which is independent of transitory human laws or traditions Socrates and his philosophic heirs Plato and Aristotle posited the existence of natural justice or natural right dikaion physikon Latin ius naturale Of these Aristotle is often said to be the father of natural law although evidence for this is due largely to the interpretations of his work by Thomas Aquinas The development of this tradition of natural justice into one of natural law is usually attributed to the Stoics br Some of the early Church fathers sought to incorporate the until then pagan concept of natural law into Christianity Natural law theories have featured greatly in the philosophies of Thomas Aquinas Francisco Su rez Richard Hooker Thomas Hobbes Hugo Grotius Samuel von Pufendorf and John Locke In the th century Thomas Hobbes founded a contractualist theory of legal positivism on what all men could agree upon what they sought happiness was subject to contention but a broad consensus could form around what they feared violent death at the hands of another The natural law was how a rational human being seeking to survive and prosper would act It was discovered by considering humankind s natural rights whereas previously it could be said that natural rights were discovered by considering the natural law In Hobbes opinion the only way natural law could prevail was for men to submit to the commands of the sovereign In this lay the foundations of the theory of a social contract between the governed and the governor br Hugo Grotius based his philosophy of international law on natural law He wrote that even the will of an omnipotent being cannot change or abrogate natural law which would maintain its objective validity even if we should assume the impossible that there is no God or that he does not care for human affairs De iure belli ac pacis Prolegomeni XI This is the famous argument etiamsi daremus non esse Deum that made natural law no longer dependent on theology John Locke incorporated natural law into many of his theories and philosophy especially in Two Treatises of Government Locke turned Hobbes prescription around saying that if the ruler went against natural law and failed to protect life liberty and property people could justifiably overthrow the existing state and create a new one br The Belgian philosopher of law Frank van Dun is one among those who are elaborating a secular conception of natural law in the liberal tradition There are also emerging and secular forms of natural law theory that define human rights as derivative of the notion of universal human dignity The term human rights has replaced the term natural rights in popularity because the rights are less and less frequently seen as requiring natural law for their existence br br br Other theories of human rights br The philosopher John Finnis argues that human rights are justifiable on the grounds of their instrumental value in creating the necessary conditions for human well being Interest theories highlight the duty to respect the rights of other individuals on grounds of self interest br br Human rights law applied to a State s own citizens serves the interest of states by for example minimizing the risk of violent resistance and protest and by keeping the level of dissatisfaction with the government manageable br The biological theory considers the comparative reproductive advantage of human social behavior based on empathy and altruism in the context of natural selection The philosopher Zhao Tingyang argues that the traditional human rights framework fails to be universal because it arose from contingent aspects of Western culture and that the concept of inalienable and unconditional human rights is in tension with the principle of justice He proposes an alternative framework called credit human rights in which rights are tied to responsibilities br br br Concepts in human rights br br br Indivisibility and categorization of rights br The most common categorization of human rights is to split them into civil and political rights and economic social and cultural rights Civil and political rights are enshrined in articles to of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the ICCPR Economic social and cultural rights are enshrined in articles to of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the ICESCR The UDHR included both economic social and cultural rights and civil and political rights because it was based on the principle that the different rights could only successfully exist in combination br br The ideal of free human beings enjoying civil and political freedom and freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his civil and political rights as well as his social economic and cultural rights br This is held to be true because without civil and political rights the public cannot assert their economic social and cultural rights Similarly without livelihoods and a working society the public cannot assert or make use of civil or political rights known as the full belly thesis br Although accepted by the signatories to the UDHR most of them do not in practice give equal weight to the different types of rights Western cultures have often given priority to civil and political rights sometimes at the expense of economic and social rights such as the right to work to education health and housing For example in the United States there is no universal access to healthcare free at the point of use That is not to say that Western cultures have overlooked these rights entirely the welfare states that exist in Western Europe are evidence of this Similarly the ex Soviet bloc countries and Asian countries have tended to give priority to economic social and cultural rights but have often failed to provide civil and political rights br Another categorization offered by Karel Vasak is that there are three generations of human rights first generation civil and political rights right to life and political participation second generation economic social and cultural rights right to subsistence and third generation solidarity rights right to peace right to clean environment Out of these generations the third generation is the most debated and lacks both legal and political recognition This categorisation is at odds with the indivisibility of rights as it implicitly states that some rights can exist without others Prioritisation of rights for pragmatic reasons is however a widely accepted necessity Human rights expert Philip Alston argues br br If every possible human rights element is deemed to be essential or necessary then nothing will be treated as though it is truly important br He and others urge caution with prioritisation of rights br br the call for prioritizing is not to suggest that any obvious violations of rights can be ignored br Priorities where necessary should adhere to core concepts such as reasonable attempts at progressive realization and principles such as non discrimination equality and participation br Some human rights are said to be inalienable rights The term inalienable rights or unalienable rights refers to a set of human rights that are fundamental are not awarded by human power and cannot be surrendered br The adherence to the principle of indivisibility by the international community was reaffirmed in br br All human rights are universal indivisible and interdependent and related The international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner on the same footing and with the same emphasis br This statement was again endorsed at the World Summit in New York paragraph br br br Universalism vs cultural relativism br br The Universal Declaration of Human Rights enshrines by definition rights that apply to all humans equally whichever geographical location state race or culture they belong to Proponents of cultural relativism suggest that human rights are not all universal and indeed conflict with some cultures and threaten their survival Rights which are most often contested with relativistic arguments are the rights of women For example female genital mutilation occurs in different cultures in Africa Asia and South America It is not mandated by any religion but has become a tradition in many cultures It is considered a violation of women s and girl s rights by much of the international community and is outlawed in some countries br Universalism has been described by some as cultural economic or political imperialism In particular the concept of human rights is often claimed to be fundamentally rooted in a politically liberal outlook which although generally accepted in Europe Japan or North America is not necessarily taken as standard elsewhere For example in the Iranian representative to the United Nations Said Rajaie Khorassani articulated the position of his country regarding the UDHR by saying that the UDHR was a secular understanding of the Judeo Christian tradition which could not be implemented by Muslims without trespassing the Islamic law The former Prime Ministers of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew and of Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad both claimed in the s that Asian values were significantly different from western values and included a sense of loyalty and foregoing personal freedoms for the sake of social stability and prosperity and therefore authoritarian government is more appropriate in Asia than democracy This view is countered by Mahathir s former deputy br br To say that freedom is Western or unAsian is to offend our traditions as well as our forefathers who gave their lives in the struggle against tyranny and injustices br Singapore s opposition leader Chee Soon Juan also states that it is racist to assert that Asians do not want human rights An appeal is often made to the fact that influential human rights thinkers such as John Locke and John Stuart Mill have all been Western and indeed that some were involved in the running of Empires themselves Relativistic arguments tend to neglect the fact that modern human rights are new to all cultures dating back no further than the UDHR in They also do not account for the fact that the UDHR was drafted by people from many different cultures and traditions including a US Roman Catholic a Chinese Confucian philosopher a French Zionist and a representative from the Arab League amongst others and drew upon advice from thinkers such as Mahatma Gandhi br Michael Ignatieff has argued that cultural relativism is almost exclusively an argument used by those who wield power in cultures which commit human rights abuses and that those whose human rights are compromised are the powerless This reflects the fact that the difficulty in judging universalism versus relativism lies in who is claiming to represent a particular culture Although the argument between universalism and relativism is far from complete it is an academic discussion in that all international human rights instruments adhere to the principle that human rights are universally applicable The World Summit reaffirmed the international community s adherence to this principle br br The universal nature of human rights and freedoms is beyond question br br br Universal jurisdiction vs state sovereignty br br Universal jurisdiction is a controversial principle in international law whereby states claim criminal jurisdiction over persons whose alleged crimes were committed outside the boundaries of the prosecuting state regardless of nationality country of residence or any other relation with the prosecuting country The state backs its claim on the grounds that the crime committed is considered a crime against all which any state is authorized to punish The concept of universal jurisdiction is therefore closely linked to the idea that certain international norms are erga omnes or owed to the entire world community as well as the concept of jus cogens In Belgium passed a law of universal jurisdiction to give its court s jurisdiction over crimes against humanity in other countries and in Augusto Pinochet was arrested in London following an indictment by Spanish judge Baltasar Garz n under the universal jurisdiction principle The principle is supported by Amnesty International and other human rights organisations as they believe certain crimes pose a threat to the international community as a whole and the community has a moral duty to act but others including Henry Kissinger argue that state sovereignty is paramount because breaches of rights committed in other countries are outside states sovereign interest and because states could use the principle for political reasons br br br State and non state actors br Companies NGOs political parties informal groups and individuals are known as non State actors Non State actors can also commit human rights abuses but are not subject to human rights law other than International Humanitarian Law which applies to individuals Multinational companies play an increasingly large role in the world and are responsible for a large number of human rights abuses Although the legal and moral environment surrounding the actions of governments is reasonably well developed that surrounding multinational companies is both controversial and ill defined Multinational companies often view their primary responsibility as being to their shareholders not to those affected by their actions Such companies are often larger than the economies of the states in which they operate and can wield significant economic and political power No international treaties exist to specifically cover the behavior of companies with regard to human rights and national legislation is very variable Jean Ziegler Special Rapporteur of the UN Commission on Human Rights on the right to food stated in a report in br br the growing power of transnational corporations and their extension of power through privatization deregulation and the rolling back of the State also mean that it is now time to develop binding legal norms that hold corporations to human rights standards and circumscribe potential abuses of their position of power br In August the Human Rights Commission s Sub Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights produced draft Norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises with regard to human rights These were considered by the Human Rights Commission in but have no binding status on corporations and are not monitored Additionally the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal aims to substantially reduce inequality by through the promotion of appropriate legislation br br br Human rights in emergency situations br br With the exception of non derogable human rights international conventions class the right to life the right to be free from slavery the right to be free from torture and the right to be free from retroactive application of penal laws as non derogable the UN recognises that human rights can be limited or even pushed aside during times of national emergency although it clarifies br br the emergency must be actual affect the whole population and the threat must be to the very existence of the nation The declaration of emergency must also be a last resort and a temporary measure br Rights that cannot be derogated for reasons of national security in any circumstances are known as peremptory norms or jus cogens Such International law obligations are binding on all states and cannot be modified by treaty br br br Criticism br br Critics of the view that human rights are universal argue that human rights are a Western concept that emanate from a European Judeo Christian and or Enlightenment heritage typically labeled Western and cannot be enjoyed by other cultures that don t emulate the conditions and values of Western societies Right wing critics of human rights argue that they are unrealistic and unenforceable norms and inappropriate intrusions on state sovereignty while left wing critics of human rights argue that they fail to achieve or prevents better approaches to achieving progressive goals br br br See also br br br Explanatory notes br br br
