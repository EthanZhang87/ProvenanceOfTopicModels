Juniper Networks Inc is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Sunnyvale California The company develops and markets networking products including routers switches network management software network security products and software defined networking technology br The company was founded in by Pradeep Sindhu with Scott Kriens as the first CEO who remained until September Kriens has been credited with much of Juniper s early market success It received several rounds of funding from venture capitalists and telecommunications companies before going public in Juniper grew to million in annual revenues by By it had a share of the core routers market challenging Cisco s once dominant market share It grew to US billion in revenues by and billion in Juniper appointed Kevin Johnson as CEO in Shaygan Kheradpir in and Rami Rahim in br Juniper Networks originally focused on core routers which are used by internet service providers ISPs to perform IP address lookups and direct internet traffic Through the acquisition of Unisphere in the company entered the market for edge routers which are used by ISPs to route internet traffic to individual consumers In Juniper entered the IT security market with its own JProtect security toolkit before acquiring security company NetScreen Technologies the following year In the early s Juniper entered the enterprise segment which accounted for one third of its revenues by Since Juniper has been focused on developing new software defined networking products In early Juniper agreed to be bought out by Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE for approximately billion br br br History br br br Origins and funding br br Pradeep Sindhu a scientist with Xerox s Palo Alto Research Center PARC conceived the idea for Juniper Networks while on vacation in br and founded the company in February Sindhu wanted to create data packet based routers that were optimized for Internet traffic packet switching whereby the routing and transferring of data occurs by means of addressed packets so that a channel is occupied during the transmission of the packet only and upon completion of the transmission the channel is made available for the transfer of other traffic He was joined by engineers Bjorn Liencres from Sun Microsystems and Dennis Ferguson from MCI Communications br Sindhu started Juniper Networks with million in seed funding which was followed by million in funding in the company s first year of operations About seven months after the company s founding Scott Kriens was appointed CEO to manage the business while founder Sindhu became the Chief Technology Officer By February Juniper had raised million in venture funding Later that year Juniper Networks raised an additional million in investments from a round that included four out of five of the largest telecommunications equipment manufacturers Siemens Ericsson Nortel and Com Juniper also received million from Qwest and other investments from AT T br br br Growth and IPO br Juniper Networks had million in annual revenue in By the following year its only product the M router was being used by telecommunications companies Juniper Networks signed agreements with Alcatel and Ericsson to distribute the M internationally A European headquarters was established in the United Kingdom and an Asia Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong A subsidiary was created in Japan and offices were established in Korea in Juniper Networks s market share for core routers grew from in to one year later and by April br Juniper Networks filed for an initial public offering in April and its first day on the NASDAQ was that June The stock set a record in first day trading in the technology sector by increasing to a market capitalization of billion According to Telephony Juniper Networks became the latest darling of Wall Street reaching a billion valuation by late July Within a year the company s stock grew five fold br Juniper Networks s revenues grew in to million That same year Juniper Networks moved its headquarters from Mountain View to Sunnyvale California br br br Competition br By Juniper controlled one third of the market for high end core routers mostly at the expense of Cisco Systems sales According to Businessweek analysts unanimously agree d that Juniper s boxes were technically superior to Cisco s because the hardware does most of the data processing Cisco routers still relied on software which often results in slower speeds However Cisco provided a broader range of services and support and had an entrenched market position The press often depicted Juniper and Cisco as a David versus Goliath story Cisco had grown through acquisitions to be a large generalist vendor for routing equipment in homes businesses and for ISPs whereas Juniper was thought of as the anti Cisco for being a small company with a narrow focus br In January Cisco introduced a suite of router products that Businessweek said was intended to challenge Juniper s increasing market share According to Businessweek Juniper s top end router was four times as fast at only twice the cost of comparable Cisco products Cisco s routers were not expected to erode Juniper s growing share of the market but other companies such as Lucent Alcatel and startups Avici Systems and Pluris had announced plans to release products that would out pace Juniper s routers br Juniper introduced a suite of routers for the network edge that allowed it to compete with Cisco Juniper s edge routers had a market share two months after release Both companies made exaggerated marketing claims Juniper promoted its products as stable enough to make IT staff bored and Cisco announced lab tests from Light Reading proved its products were superior to Juniper whereas the publication itself reached the opposite conclusion By both companies were repeatedly announcing products with faster specifications than the other in what Network World called a speeds and feeds public relations contest br By Juniper controlled of the core router market By it had a and share of the market for enterprise edge and core routers respectively Alcatel Lucent was unsuccessful in challenging Juniper in the core router market but continued competing with Juniper in edge routers along with Cisco br br br Further development br In late Juniper formed a joint venture with Ericsson to develop and market network switches for internet traffic on mobile devices and with Nortel for fiber optic technology In Juniper introduced a technical certification program and was involved in the first optical internet network in China Juniper s growth slowed in as the telecommunications sector experienced a slowdown and revenues fell by two thirds during the dot com bust to of its workforce was laid off br Juniper had rebounded by surpassing billion in revenues for the first time that year and reaching billion in revenue in Beginning in with the acquisition of NetScreen Juniper Networks began developing and marketing products for the enterprise segment Juniper had a reputation for serving ISPs not enterprises which it was trying to change By enterprise customers accounted for one third of the company s revenues but it had spent billion in acquisitions and R D for the enterprise market br In more than US companies restated their financial results due to a series of investigations into stock backdating practices Juniper stockholders alleged the company engaged in deceptive backdating practices that benefited its top executives unfairly In December Juniper restated its financials charging million in expenses to correct backdated stock options from to This was followed by a million settlement with stockholders in February br br br present br In July Juniper s first CEO Scott Kriens became chairman and former Microsoft executive Kevin Johnson was appointed CEO Johnson focused the company more on software creating a software solutions division headed by a former Microsoft colleague Bob Muglia Juniper also hired other former Microsoft executives to focus on the company s software strategy and encourage developers to create software products that run on the Junos operating system Juniper established partnerships with IBM Microsoft and Oracle for software compatibility efforts The SSL VPN Pulse product family was launched in then later spun off to a private equity firm in for million br In Juniper laid off of its staff and four of its high ranking executives departed The following year CEO Kevin Johnson announced he was retiring once a replacement was found In November Juniper Networks announced that Shaygan Kheradpir would be appointed as the new CEO He started the position in January br In January hedge fund activist investor and Juniper shareholder Elliott Associates advocated that Juniper reduce its cash reserves and cut costs before Kheradpir was officially appointed That February Juniper reached an agreement with Elliott and other stakeholders for an Integrated Operating Plan IOP that involved repurchasing billion in shares reducing operating expenses by million and appointing two new directors to its board That April of the company s staff were laid off to cut expenses In November Kheradpir unexpectedly resigned following a review by Juniper s board of directors regarding his conduct in a negotiation with an unnamed Juniper customer An internal Juniper executive Rami Rahim took his place as CEO br In May Palo Alto Networks agreed to pay a million settlement for allegedly infringing on Juniper s patents for application firewalls br In Wired magazine reported that the company announced it had found unauthorized code that enabled backdoors into its ScreenOS products The code was patched with updates from the company br In January the company agreed to be purchased by Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE for billion in an all cash deal to boost HPE s networking and artificial intelligence resources br br br Acquisitions and investments br br By Juniper had made only a few acquisitions of smaller companies due to the leadership s preference for organic growth The pace of acquisition picked up in and with the purchases of Pacific Broadband and Unisphere Networks In Juniper made a billion acquisition of network security company NetScreen Technologies Juniper revised NetScreen s channel program that year and used its reseller network to bring other products to market br Juniper made five acquisitions in mostly of startups with deal values ranging from to million It acquired application acceleration vendor Redline Networks VOIP company Kagoor Networks as well as wide area network WAN company Peribit Networks Peribit and Redline were incorporated into a new application products group and their technology was integrated into Juniper s infranet framework Afterwards Juniper did not make any additional acquisitions until br From to September Juniper made six acquisitions and invested in eight companies Often Juniper acquired early stage startups developing their technology then selling it to pre existing Juniper clients Juniper acquired two digital video companies Ankeena Networks and Blackwave Inc as well as wireless LAN software company Trapeze Networks In Juniper acquired Mykonos Software which develops security software intended to deceive hackers already within the network perimeter and a developer of software defined network controllers Contrail Systems In Juniper acquired the software defined networking SDN company WANDL br In April Juniper closed its acquisition of BTI a provider of cloud and metro network technology in an effort to beef up its data center interconnect and metro packet optical transport technology and services Juniper acquired cloud operations management and optimization startup AppFormix in December In Juniper bought Cyphort a Silicon Valley startup that makes security analytics software Juniper acquired cloud storage company HTBASE in November In April Juniper acquired wireless LAN WLAN startup Mist Systems to bolster its software defined enterprise portfolio and multicloud offerings In February it was announced Juniper had acquired WiteSand a specialist cloud native zero trust Network Access Control NAC solutions company br br br Products br Juniper Networks designs and markets IT networking products such as routers switches and IT security products It started out selling core routers for ISPs and expanded into edge routers data centers wireless networking networking for branch offices and other access and aggregation devices br Juniper is the third largest market share holder overall for routers and switches used by ISPs According to analyst firm Dell Oro Group it is the fourth largest for edge routers and second for core routers with of the core market It is also the second largest market share holder for firewall products with a share of the firewall market In data center security appliances Juniper is the second place market share holder behind Cisco In WLAN where Juniper used to hold a more marginal market share it is now expanding through its acquisition of Mist Systems now a Leader in Wired and Wireless LAN according to Gartner Juniper provides technical support and services through the J Care program br As of February Juniper s product families include the following br br br Routers and switches br Juniper Networks first product was the Junos router operating system which was released on July The first Juniper router was made available that September and was a core router for internet service providers called the M It incorporated specialized application specific integrated circuits ASIC for routing internet traffic that were developed in partnership with IBM It had ten times the throughput of comparable contemporary Cisco products The M was followed by the smaller M router in December and the M in March br By Juniper had developed five hardware systems and made seven new releases of its Junos operating system That April Juniper released the second generation of the internet processors embedded in its core routers In April Juniper released the first of the T series family originally known under the code name Gibson which could perform four times as many route lookups per second as the M The first products of the TX Matrix family which could be used to combine up to four T series routers was released in December br By Juniper had diversified into three major router applications core routers edge routers and routers for mobile traffic Juniper s first major diversification from core routers was when it entered the market for edge routers by acquiring the e series product family originally known as ERX through the purchase of Unisphere in By both Cisco and Juniper had increased their focus on edge routers because many ISPs had built up abundant bandwidth at the core Several improvements to Juniper s software and its broadband aggregation features were released in late At this time Juniper had the largest market share of the broadband aggregation market In Juniper entered the market for cable modem termination systems with the G series product family after the acquisition of Pacific Broadband The product family was discontinued later that year br Juniper s first enterprise switch product was the EX which was released in In a comparative technical test Network World said the EX was the top performer out of network switches they tested in latency and throughput but its multicast features were newer and less robust than other aspects of the product Juniper Networks announced the T Terabits per second core router in and the newer T Terabit router in In it released the ACX family of universal access routers In the company made several new releases in the MX family of edge routers it introduced a smaller version of its core routers called PTX and several new enterprise routers were released Seven months later Juniper acquired WANDL and its technology was integrated into the NorthStar WAN controller Juniper announced in February br In February Juniper introduced QFabric a proprietary protocol methodology for transferring data over a network using a single network layer Several individual products for the QFabric methodology were released throughout the year In October Juniper introduced another network architecture called MetaFabric and a new set of switches the QFX family as one of the foundations of the new architecture br In February several software and hardware improvements were introduced for Juniper routers including a series of software applications ISPs could use to provide internet based services to consumers In December Juniper introduced a network switch OCX that could run on either the Junos operating system or the Open Compute Project open source software br br br Security br br Juniper Networks introduced the JProtect security toolkit in May It included firewalls flow monitoring filtering and Network Address Translation NAT Through the acquisition of NetScreen Technologies Juniper acquired the Juniper Secure Meeting product line as well as remote desktop access software The NetScreen GT ADSL security appliance was the first new NetScreen product Juniper introduced after the acquisition and its first wireless product The first Juniper product intended for small businesses was a remote access appliance that was released in August An open interface for the development of third party tools for the appliance was made available that September br In September Juniper entered the market for enterprise access routers with three routers that were the first of the J series product family It used the channel partners acquired with NetScreen to take the routers to market Juniper released its first dedicated Network Access Control NAC product in late which was followed by the acquisition of Funk Software for its NAC capabilities for switches According to a review in Network World Juniper s SSG firewall and routing product was the first serious threat to competing products from Cisco Juniper released the SRX family of gateway products in The gateways sold well but customers and resellers reported a wide range of technical issues starting in which Juniper did not acknowledge until when it began providing updates to the product software br In August Juniper and AT T announced they would jointly develop the AT T Mobile Security application based on Juniper s Pulse security software In May Juniper released a series of new features for the web security software it acquired from Mykonos Software that February Mykonos software is focused on deceiving hackers by presenting fake vulnerabilities and tracking their activity In January Juniper announced the Firefly Suite of security and switching products for virtual machines The following month Juniper Networks released several products for intrusion deception which create fake files store incorrect passwords and change network maps in order to confuse hackers that have already penetrated the network perimeter br br An analysis of Juniper s ScreenOS firmware code in December discovered a backdoor key using Dual EC DRBG allowing to passively decrypt the traffic encrypted by ScreenOS This backdoor was inserted in the year into the versions of ScreenOS from r to r and from r to r and gives any user administrative access when using a special master password Some analysts claim that this backdoor still exists in ScreenOS Stephen Checkoway was quoted in Wired that If this backdoor was not intentional then in my opinion it s an amazing coincidence br In December Juniper Systems announced that they had discovered unauthorized code in the ScreenOS software that underlies their NetScreen devices present from onwards There were two vulnerabilities One was a simple root password backdoor and the other one was changing a point in Dual EC DRBG so that the attackers presumably had the key to use the preexisting intentional or unintentional kleptographic backdoor in ScreenOS to passively decrypt traffic br br br Software defined networking br According to a SWOT analysis by MarketLine in recent history Juniper has been focusing on software defined networking SDN It acquired SDN company Contrail Systems in December The following month Juniper announced its SDN strategy which included a new licensing model based on usage and new features for the Junos operating system In February Juniper released several SDN products including the application provisioning software Services Activation Director and the Mobile Control Gateway appliance br In May Juniper announced an SDN controller called JunosV Contrail using technology it acquired through Contrail Systems A series of SDN products were released in February such as a network management software product Junos Fusion and an SDN controller called NorthStar Northstar helps find the optimal path for data to travel through a network br Every year since Juniper holds SDN Throwdown competition to encourage students from universities across the world to access NorthStar Controller and build a solution around it to optimize network throughput In the competition team led by Sumit Maheshwari Rutgers University took first place Jialu Sun Santa Clara University led his team to a second place finish br br br Recent updates br In March Juniper announced a series of updates to the PTX family of core routers the QFX family of switches as well as updates to its security portfolio According to a report published by technology consulting firm LexInnova as of June Juniper Networks was the third largest recipient of network security related patents with portfolio of security related patents br In October Juniper announced a new offering called EngNet which is a set of developer tools and information meant to help companies move toward automation and replace the typical command line interface br br br Operations br Juniper Networks has operations in more than countries Around of its revenue is from the United States is from EMEA and is from Asia Juniper sells directly to businesses as well as through resale and distribution partners such as Ericsson IBM Nokia IngramMicro and NEC About of Juniper s revenues are derived from routers from switches comes from IT security and from services br According to a report by Glassdoor Juniper Networks has the highest paid software engineers in the technology sector by a margin of about per year It operates the Juniper Networks Academic Alliance JNAA program which scouts fresh college graduates br According to a SWOT analysis by MarketLine Juniper has a strong focus on research and development R D expenses have been between and of revenue from to Most of the company s manufacturing is outsourced to three manufacturing companies Celestica Flextronics and Accton Technology Juniper operates the Junos Innovation Fund which was started with million in and invests in early stage technology companies developing applications for the Junos operating system As of Juniper Networks invested in companies This is estimated to be to of the companies it has evaluated for a potential investment br br br ScreenOS Backdoor br In December Juniper issued an emergency security patch for a backdoor in its security equipment Together with another vulnerability it allowed to bypass authentication and decrypt VPN traffic on ScreenOS Analysis showed that the mechanism of the backdoor was created by the NSA but might later have been taken over by an unnamed national government br br br See also br br List of networking hardware vendors br br br br br br External links br
