and web sites of related news and information monitors and challenges potential legislation that it believes would infringe on personal liberties and fair use and solicits a list of what it considers are abusive patents with intentions to defeat those that it considers are without merit br br br History br br br Foundation br br The Electronic Frontier Foundation was formed in July by John Gilmore John Perry Barlow and Mitch Kapor in response to a series of actions by law enforcement agencies that led them to conclude that the authorities were gravely uninformed about emerging forms of online communication and that there was a need for increased protection for Internet civil liberties br In April Barlow had been visited by a U S Federal Bureau of Investigation agent in relation to the theft and distribution of the source code for a series of Macintosh ROMs Barlow described the visit as complicated by the agent s fairly complete unfamiliarity with computer technology I realized right away that before I could demonstrate my innocence I would first have to explain to him what guilt might be Barlow felt that his experience was symptomatic of a great paroxysm of governmental confusion during which everyone s liberties would become at risk br Barlow posted an account of this experience to The WELL online community and was contacted by Mitch Kapor who had had a similar experience The pair agreed that there was a need to defend civil liberties on the Internet Kapor agreed to fund any legal fees associated with such a defense and the pair contacted New York lawyers Rabinowitz Boudin Standard Krinsky and Lieberman about defending several computer hackers from a Harper s magazine forum on computers and freedom who had been the target of Secret Service raids This generated a large amount of publicity which led to offers of financial support from John Gilmore and Steve Wozniak Barlow and Kapor continued to research conflicts between the government and technology and in June Barlow posted online the influential article entitled Crime Puzzlement in which Barlow announced his and Kapor s plans to create an organization to raise and disburse funds for education lobbying and litigation in the areas relating to digital speech and the extension of the Constitution into Cyberspace br This generated further reaction and support for the ideas of Barlow and Kapor In late June Barlow held a series of dinners in San Francisco with major figures in the computer industry to develop a coherent response to these perceived threats Barlow considered that The actions of the FBI and Secret Service were symptoms of a growing social crisis Future Shock America was entering the Information Age with neither laws nor metaphors for the appropriate protection and conveyance of information itself Barlow felt that to confront this a formal organization would be needed he hired Cathy Cook as press coordinator and began to set up what would become the Electronic Frontier Foundation br The Electronic Frontier Foundation was formally founded on July by Kapor and Barlow who very soon after elected Gilmore Wozniak and Stewart Brand to join them on the board of directors Initial funding was provided by Kapor Wozniak and an anonymous benefactor br In Mike Godwin joined the organization as its first staff counsel Then in Esther Dyson and Jerry Berman joined the EFF board of directors By Cliff Figallo became the director of the original office and in December Jerry Berman became the acting executive director of the organization as a whole based in a new second office br br br Early cases br br The creation of the organization was motivated by the massive search and seizure on Steve Jackson Games executed by the United States Secret Service early in Similar but officially unconnected law enforcement raids were being conducted across the United States at about that time as part of a state federal task force called Operation Sundevil GURPS Cyberpunk one of the game company s projects was mistakenly labeled as a handbook for computer crime and the Secret Service raided the offices of Steve Jackson Games The search warrant for the raid was deemed hastily issued and the games company soon after claimed unauthorized access as well as tampering of their emails While phone calls were protected by legislation digital emails were an early concept and had not been considered to fall under the right to personal privacy The Steve Jackson Games case was the EFF s first high profile case was the major rallying point around which the EFF began promoting computer and Internet related civil liberties br The EFF s second big case was Bernstein v United States led by Cindy Cohn in which programmer and professor Daniel J Bernstein sued the government for permission to publish his encryption software Snuffle and a paper describing it More recently the organization has been involved in defending Edward Felten Jon Lech Johansen and Dmitry Sklyarov br br br Expansion and development br br The organization was originally located at Mitch Kapor s Kapor Enterprises offices in Boston By the fall of the main EFF offices were consolidated into a single office in Washington DC headed by Executive Director Jerry Berman During this time some of the EFF s attention focused on influencing national policy to the dislike of some of the members of the organization In Berman parted ways with the EFF and formed the Center for Democracy and Technology while Drew Taubman briefly took the reins as executive director br In under the auspices of Executive Director Lori Fena after some downsizing and in an effort to regroup and refocus on their base of support br the organization moved offices to San Francisco California There it took up temporary residence at John Gilmore s Toad Hall and soon afterward moved into the Hamm s Building at Bryant St After Fena moved onto the EFF board of directors for a while the organization was led briefly by Tara Lemmey followed by Barry Steinhardt who had come from the closely allied Technology and Liberty Program at the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU and eventually returned to the ACLU Not long before EFF s move into new offices at Shotwell St in SF s Mission District Mike Godwin departed long time Legal Director Shari Steele was appointed executive director and staff attorney Cindy Cohn became the legal director br In the spring of the EFF announced the opening of an office again in Washington D C with two new staff attorneys In the EFF began a fundraising campaign for the renovation of a building located at Eddy Street in San Francisco to serve as its new headquarters The move was completed in April On April Shari Steele stepped down as executive director Cindy Cohn became the new executive director Corynne McSherry became the legal director and Kurt Opsahl became the general counsel br br br DES cracker br br By the mid s the EFF was becoming seriously concerned about the refusal of the US government to license any secure encryption product for export unless it utilized key recovery and claims that governments could not decrypt information when protected by Data Encryption Standard DES continuing even after the public breaking of the code in the first of the DES Challenges They coordinated and supported the construction of the EFF DES cracker nicknamed Deep Crack using special purpose hardware and software and costing This brought the record for breaking a message down to hours on July and to under hours on January in conjunction with distributed net br The EFF published the plans and source code for the cracker Within four years the Advanced Encryption Standard was standardized as a replacement for DES br br br Activities br br br Legislative activity br The EFF is a leading supporter of the Email Privacy Act br br br Litigation br br The EFF regularly brings and defends lawsuits at all levels of the US legal system in pursuit of its goals and objectives The EFF has long taken a stance against strategic lawsuits against public participation SLAPP as attempts to stymie free speech and advocated for effective anti SLAPP legislation Many of the most significant technology law cases have involved the EFF including MGM Studios Inc v Grokster Ltd Apple v Does and others br br br Patent Busting Project br The Patent Busting Project is an Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF initiative challenging patents that the organization describes as illegitimate and suppress innovation or limit online expression The initiative launched on April and involves two phases documenting the damage caused by these patents and submitting challenges to the United States Patent and Trademark Office br br br Enfranchisement activism br The EFF has long been an advocate of paper audit trails for voting machines and testified in support of them after the United States presidential election Later it funded the research of Hariprasad Vemuru who exposed vulnerabilities in a particular model Since the EFF has operated the Our Vote Live website and database Staffed by hotline volunteers it is designed to quickly document irregularities and instances of voter suppression as they occur on an election day br The EFF was active in the United States presidential election because of online phishing related to the controversy over fabrication of election results J Alex Halderman a computer security professor at the University of Michigan wrote an article that was published in Medium in stating he thought it was advisable to have a recount on some of the election results from states like Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania exclusively states Hillary Clinton lost In retaliation against Halderman a hacker sent anti Semitic and racist emails to students at University of Michigan signed from Halderman The EFF publicizes these controversies and promotes the reduction of online phishing br br br Content moderation reform br In the spring of the EFF joined the Open Technology Institute OTI the Center for Democracy Technology the ACLU Foundation of Northern California and four academics in writing The Santa Clara Principles On Transparency and Accountability in Content Moderation The document sets out the following guidelines for social networks br br Statistics on removed posts should be publicly available br Banned users or users who have had posts deleted should be notified with clear reasons br Such users should have the opportunity to appeal and have that appeal read by a human br Six months later the same organizations sought the support of roughly others including Article in calling for Facebook to adopt the Santa Clara Principles This was later updated with a request for Facebook to warn users who have interacted with sock puppet law enforcement accounts br In the EFF and OTI delivered testimony about the Online Harms White Paper in the United Kingdom They commented that several proposals to increase the amount of regulation on social media were open to abuse Also in the EFF launched the website TOSsed out to document cases of moderation rules being applied inconsistently Cindy Cohn underscored their commitment to upholding free speech online writing that once you ve turned it on whether through pressure or threats of lawsuits the power to silence people doesn t just go in one direction br br br Protect the Stack br br In December the EFF and other digital advocacy organizations called for internet infrastructure providers to stop policing the content of the websites they service The organizations argued that many providers can only moderate content by revoking access to an entire website leaving end users with little transparency or recourse They expressed concern that governments may pressure infrastructure providers to deny service to opponents and marginalized groups and that monopolistic infrastructure providers may take banned users offline altogether The coalition believes that platforms and user facing websites are better positioned as moderators because they can remove specific content sanction accounts granularly and offer reasoning and appeals for moderation decisions br The initiative was launched in the wake of Drop Kiwi Farms a campaign that convinced several internet service providers and DDoS protection firms to revoke service to Kiwi Farms a controversial forum After the forum returned behind an open source bot detection tool the EFF stopped classifying DDoS protection services as infrastructure because they cannot determine whether a website stays online or not br br br Awards br The EFF organizes two sets of awards to promote work in accordance with its goals and objectives br br br EFF Awards br br The EFF Awards until called the EFF Pioneer Awards are
