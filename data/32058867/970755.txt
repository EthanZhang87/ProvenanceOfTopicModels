supports daily the formation of interest groups In there were such groups whose membership varies from to Groups support a limited form of discussion area moderated by the group owners and managers Groups may be private accessible to members only or may be open to Internet users in general to read though they must join in order to post messages Since groups offer the functionality to reach a wide audience without so easily falling foul of anti spam solutions there is a constant stream of spam postings and there now exists a range of firms who offer a spamming service for this very purpose LinkedIn has devised a few mechanisms to reduce the volume of spam but recently decided to remove the ability of group owners to inspect the email address of new members in order to determine if they were spammers Groups also keep their members informed through emails with updates to the group including most talked about discussions within your professional circles br In December LinkedIn

LinkedIn discontinued LinkedIn stories a feature that was rolled out worldwide in October br br br Usage br br br Personal branding br br LinkedIn is particularly well suited for personal branding which according to Sandra Long entails actively managing one s image and unique value to position oneself for career opportunities LinkedIn has evolved from being a mere platform for job searchers into a social network which allows users a chance to create a personal brand Career coach Pamela Green describes a personal brand as the emotional experience you want people to have as a result of interacting with you and a LinkedIn profile is an aspect of that A contrasting report suggests that a personal brand is a public facing persona exhibited on LinkedIn Twitter and other networks that showcases expertise and fosters new connections br LinkedIn allows professionals to build exposure for their brand within the site itself and on the World Wide Web as a whole With a tool that LinkedIn dubs a Profile Strength Meter the site encourages users to offer enough information in their profile to optimize visibility by search engines It can strengthen a user s LinkedIn presence if they belong to professional groups on the site The site enables users to add a video to their profiles Some users hire a professional photographer for their profile photo Video presentations can be added to one s profile LinkedIn s capabilities have been expanding so rapidly that a cottage industry of outside consultants has grown up to help users navigate the system A particular emphasis is helping

headquarters and offices and a list of present and former employees In July LinkedIn launched a new feature allowing companies to include an Apply with LinkedIn button on job listing pages The new plugin allowed potential employees to apply for positions using their LinkedIn profiles as resumes br LinkedIn can help small businesses connect with customers In the site s parlance two users have a first degree connection when one accepts an invitation from another People connected to each of them are second degree connections and persons connected to the second degree connections are third degree connections This forms a user s internal LinkedIn network making the user s profile more likely to appear in searches br LinkedIn s Profinder is a marketplace where freelancers can for a monthly subscription fee bid for project proposals submitted by individuals and small businesses In it had around freelancers in more than service areas such as headshot photography bookkeeping or tax filing br The premise for connecting with someone has shifted significantly in recent years Before the new interface was launched LinkedIn encouraged connections between people who d already worked studied done business or the like Since that step has been removed from the connection request process and users are allowed to connect with up to people This change means LinkedIn is a more proactive networking site for job applicants trying to secure a career move or for salespeople wanting to generate new client leads br br br Top Companies br LinkedIn Top Companies is a series of lists

sites such as LinkedIn to generate revenue br LinkedIn launched its carousel ads feature in making it the newest addition to the platform s advertising options With carousel ads businesses can showcase their products or services through a series of swipeable cards each with its unique image headline and description They can be used for various marketing objectives such as promoting a new

Shiftgig released in as a platform for hourly workers br br br Criticism and controversies br br br Controversial design choices br br br Endorsement feature br The feature that allows LinkedIn members to endorse each other s skills and experience has been criticized as meaningless since the endorsements are not necessarily accurate or given by people who have familiarity with the member s skills In October LinkedIn acknowledged that it really does matter who endorsed you and began highlighting endorsements from coworkers and other mutual connections to address the criticism br br br Use of e mail accounts of members for spam sending br LinkedIn sends invite emails to Outlook contacts from its members email accounts without obtaining their consent The invitations give the

br The sign up process includes users entering their email password there is an opt out feature LinkedIn will then offer to send out contact invitations to all members in that address book or that the user has had email conversations with When the member s email address book is opened it is opened with all email addresses selected and the member is advised invitations will be sent to selected email addresses or to all LinkedIn was sued for sending out another two follow up invitations to each contact from members to link to friends who had ignored the initial authorized invitation br In November LinkedIn lost a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in a ruling that the invitations were advertisements not broadly protected by free speech rights that would otherwise permit use of people s names and images without authorization The lawsuit was eventually settled in in favor of LinkedIn members br br br Moving emails to LinkedIn servers br At the end of it was announced that the LinkedIn app intercepted users emails and quietly moved them to LinkedIn servers for full access LinkedIn used man in the middle attacks br br br Security incidents br br br hack br br In June cryptographic hashes of approximately million LinkedIn user passwords were stolen by Yevgeniy Nikulin and other hackers who then published the stolen hashes online This action is known as the LinkedIn hack In response to the incident LinkedIn asked its users to change their passwords Security experts criticized LinkedIn for not salting their password file and for using a single iteration of SHA On May LinkedIn added two factor authentication an important security enhancement for preventing hackers from gaining access to accounts In May million LinkedIn usernames and passwords were offered for sale online for the equivalent of in These account details are believed to be sourced from the original LinkedIn hack in which the number of user IDs stolen had been underestimated To handle the large volume of emails

politicians and government officials br In the company ranked first in a list of brands most likely to be imitated in phishing attempts br In August several Linkedin users were targeted by hackers in hijacking and phishing bid Users were locked out of their accounts and threatened with permanent account deletion if they did not pay a ransom br br br False and misleading information br LinkedIn has come under scrutiny for its handling of misinformation and disinformation The platform has struggled to deal with fake profiles and falsehoods about COVID and the US presidential election br br br

granting the company far reaching rights It has also been claimed that LinkedIn does not respond to consumer protection center requests br br br Research on labor market effects br In Social Science Computer Review published research by economists Ralf Caers and Vanessa Castelyns who sent an online questionnaire to and LinkedIn and Facebook users respectively in Belgium and found that both sites had become tools for recruiting job applicants for professional occupations as well as additional information about applicants and that it was being used by recruiters to decide which applicants would receive interviews In May Research Policy published an analysis of PhD holders use of LinkedIn and found that PhD holders who move into industry were more likely to have LinkedIn accounts and to have larger networks of LinkedIn connections were more likely to use LinkedIn if they had co authors abroad and to have wider networks if they moved abroad after obtaining their PhD br Also in sociologist Ofer Sharone conducted interviews with unemployed workers to research the effects of LinkedIn and Facebook as labor market intermediaries and found that social networking services SNS have had a filtration effect that has little to do with evaluations of merit and that the SNS filtration effect has exerted new pressures on workers to manage their careers to conform to the logic of the SNS filtration effect In October Foster School of Business professors Melissa Rhee Elina Hwang and Yong Tan performed an empirical analysis of whether the common professional networking tactic by job seekers of creating LinkedIn connections with professionals who work at a target company or in a target field is actually instrumental in obtaining referrals and found instead that job seekers were less likely to be referred by employees who were employed by the target company or in the target field due to job similarity and self protection from competition Rhee Hwang and Tan further found that referring employees in higher hierarchical positions than the job candidates were more likely to provide referrals and that gender homophily did not reduce the competition self protection effect br In July sociologists Steve McDonald Amanda K Damarin Jenelle Lawhorne and Annika Wilcox performed qualitative interviews with human resources recruiters in two metropolitan areas in the Southern United States and found that recruiters filling low and general skilled positions typically posted advertisements on online job boards while recruiters filling high skilled or supervisor positions targeted passive candidates on LinkedIn i e employed workers not actively seeking work but possibly willing to change positions and concluded that this is resulting in a bifurcated winner takes all job market with recruiters focusing their efforts on poaching already employed high skilled workers while active job seekers are relegated to hyper competitive online job boards In December the ACM SIGGROUP Bulletin published a study on the use of mobile phones by blue collar workers that noted that research about tools for blue collar workers to find work in the digital age was strangely absent and expressed concern that the absence of such research could lead to technology design choices that would concentrate greater power in the hands of managers rather than workers br In a September working paper economists Laurel Wheeler Robert Garlick and RTI International scholars Eric Johnson Patrick Shaw and Marissa Gargano ran a randomized evaluation of training job seekers in South Africa to use LinkedIn as part of job readiness programs The evaluation found that the training increased the job seekers employment by approximately percent by reducing information frictions between job seekers and prospective employers that the training had this effect for approximately months and that while the training may also have facilitated referrals it did not reduce job search costs and the jobs for the treatment and control groups in the evaluation had equal probabilities of retention promotion and obtaining a permanent contract In Applied Economics published research by economists Steffen Brenner Sezen Aksin Sivrikaya and Joachim Schwalbach using LinkedIn demonstrating that high status individuals self select into professional networking services rather than workers unsatisfied with their career status adversely selecting into the services to receive networking benefits br br br International restrictions br In February it was reported that LinkedIn was being blocked in China

LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner acknowledged in a blog post that they would have to censor some of the content that users post on its website in order to comply with Chinese rules but he also said the

LinkedIn must be blocked in Russia for violating a data retention law which requires the user data of Russian citizens to be stored on servers within the country The relevant law had been in force there since This ban was upheld on November and all Russian ISPs began blocking LinkedIn thereafter LinkedIn s mobile app was also banned from Google Play Store and iOS App Store in Russia in January
