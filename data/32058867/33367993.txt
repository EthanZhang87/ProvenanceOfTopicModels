Google Drive is a file hosting service and synchronization service developed by Google Launched on April Google Drive allows users to store files in the cloud on Google s servers synchronize files across devices and share files In addition to a web interface Google Drive offers apps with offline capabilities for Windows and macOS computers and Android and iOS smartphones and tablets Google Drive encompasses Google Docs Google Sheets and Google Slides which are a part of the Google Docs Editors office suite that permits collaborative editing of documents spreadsheets presentations drawings forms and more Files created and edited through the Google Docs suite are saved in Google Drive br Google Drive offers users GB of free storage sharing it with Gmail and Google Photos Through Google One Google Drive also offers paid plans at tiers of GB and TB along with a premium TB plan that comes with Google s artificial intelligence Files uploaded can be up to GB in size Users can change privacy settings for individual files and folders including enabling sharing with other users or making content public On the website users can search for an image by describing its visuals and use natural language to find specific files such as find my budget spreadsheet from last December br The website and Android app offer a Backups section to see what Android devices have data backed up to the service and a completely overhauled computer app released in July allows for backing up specific folders on the user s computer A Quick Access feature can intelligently predict the files users need br Google Drive is a key component of Google Workspace Google s monthly subscription offering for businesses and organizations that operated as G Suite until October As part of select Google Workspace plans Drive offers unlimited storage advanced file audit reporting enhanced administration controls and greater collaboration tools for teams br Following the launch of the service Google Drive s privacy policy was heavily criticized by some members of the media Google has one set of Terms of Service and Privacy Policy agreements that cover all of its services meaning that the language in the agreements grants the company broad rights to reproduce use and create derivative works from content stored on Google Drive While the policies also confirm that users retain intellectual property rights privacy advocates raised concerns that the licenses grant Google the right to use the information and data to customize the advertising and other services Google provides In contrast other members of the media noted that the agreements were no worse than those of competing cloud storage services but that the competition uses more artful language in the agreements and also stated that Google needs the rights in order to move files around on its servers cache your data or make image thumbnails br As of July Google Drive had over one billion active users and as of September it had over one million organizational paying users As of May there were over two trillion files stored on the service br br br Platforms br br Google Drive was introduced on April with apps available for Windows macOS and Android as well as a website interface The iOS app was released later in June br br br Computer apps br Google Drive is available for PCs running Windows or later and Macs running OS X Catalina or later Google indicated in April that work on Linux software was underway but there was no news on this as of November In April Google s then Senior Vice President Sundar Pichai said that Google Drive would be tightly integrated with ChromeOS version In October Google announced that going forward it would drop support for versions of the computer software older than

Originally intended for release on June its release was delayed until July In September Google announced that it would discontinue the Google Drive desktop app in March and end support in December br In July Google released a new app for Windows and Mac which is meant to replace Backup and Sync and Drive File Stream br br br Backup and Sync br In July Google announced their new downloadable software Backup and Sync It was made mainly to replace the Google Drive desktop app which was discontinued Its main function is for the user to be able to set certain folders to constantly sync onto their Google Account s Drive The synced folders and files count against the shared quota allocated between Gmail Google Photos and Google Drive In early Google announced that it would be combining its Drive File Stream and Backup and Sync products into one product Google Drive for Desktop which will support features previously exclusive to each respective Client br br br Mobile apps br Google Drive is available for Android smartphones and tablets running Android Marshmallow or later and iPhones and iPads running iOS or later br In August Google Drive ended support for Android devices running Android Ice Cream Sandwich or older versions citing Google s mobile app update policy which states For Android devices we provide updates for the current and previous Android versions According to the policy the app will continue to work for devices running older Android versions but any app updates are provided on a best efforts basis The policy also states a notice will be given for any planned end of service br On May Google rolled out a new feature update in its Google Drive app version for iOS and iPadOS known as Privacy Screen which requires Face ID or Touch ID authentication whenever the app is open br br br Website interface br Google Drive has a website that allows users to see their files from any Internet connected computer without the need to download an app br The website received a visual overhaul in that gave it a completely new look and improved performance It also simplified some of the most common tasks such as clicking only once on a file to see recent activity or share the file and added drag and drop functionality where users can simply drag selected files to folders for improved organization br A new update in August changed several visual elements of the website the logo was updated the search box design was refreshed and the primary color was changed from red to blue It also improved the functionality to download files locally from the website users can now compress and download large Drive items into multiple GB zip files with an improved naming structure better Google Forms handling and empty folders are now included in the zip thereby preserving the user s folder hierarchy br br br Storage br Google Drive offers various tiers of storage starting with a free tier of GB for individual users with options to purchase additional storage

user GB GB billion bytes of free storage This cloud storage is also shared with Gmail and Google Photos Users can purchase additional space through either a monthly or yearly payment The option of yearly payments was introduced in December and is limited to the GB and standard TB storage plans Furthermore the yearly payments offer a discount In May Google announced that storage plans including the free gigabyte plan would be moved over to Google One br As of these are the storage plans offered by Google br br br Chromebook promotions br Chromebook users can obtain GB of Google Drive storage free for months as long as the promotion is activated within days of the Chromebook device s initial purchase This is available in all countries where Google Drive is available Offer can only be

Drive was introduced with free storage of GB Storage plans were revised with GB costing month GB costing month and TB costing month br Originally Gmail Google Docs and Picasa had separate allowances for free storage and a shared allowance for purchased storage Between April and May Google Drive and Google Photos had a shared allowance for both free and purchased storage whereas Gmail had a separate GB storage limit which increased to GB on the purchase of any storage plan br In September Google announced that a paid plan would now cover total storage rather than the paid allocation being added to the free e g a GB plan allowed a total of GB rather than GB as previously br In May Google announced the overall merge of storage across Gmail Google Drive and Google Photos giving users GB of unified free storage between the services br In March the storage plans were revised again and prices were reduced by to month for GB month for TB and month for TB This was much cheaper than competitors Dropbox and OneDrive offered at the time br In the paid plans were re branded as Google One to emphasize their application beyond Google Drive along with the addition of a month plan for GB and increasing the plan to TB at no additional charge br On November Google announced that it would discontinue unlimited storage for files stored using Google Docs file formats including the Docs format but excluding Sites in Drive along with photos and vidoes uploaded to Google Photos using its saver originally High quality setting The update was announced to come into effect on June Before June all documents and compressed photos uploaded on Google s online storage were not be counted under the GB cap br In September Google added a TB storage plan priced at month br br br Features br br br Sharing br Google Drive incorporates a system of file sharing in which the creator of a file or folder is by default its owner The owner can regulate the public visibility of the file or folder Ownership is transferable Files or folders can be shared privately with particular users having a Google account using the email address usually but not necessarily ending in gmail com associated with that account Sharing files with users not having a Google account requires making them accessible to anybody with the link This generates a secret URL for the file which may be shared via email or private messages Files and folders can also be made public on the web which means that they can be indexed by search engines and thus can be found and accessed by anyone The owner may also set an access level for regulating permissions The three access levels offered are can edit can comment and can view Users with editing access can invite others to edit br On September the URL to a portion of existing files was changed ostensibly for security reasons br Shared files have upload limit of items br br br Third party apps br A number of external web applications that work with Google Drive are available from the Chrome Web Store To add an app users are required to sign in to the Chrome Web Store but the apps are compatible with all supported web browsers Drive apps operate on online files and can be used to view edit and create files in various formats edit images and videos fax and sign documents manage projects create flowcharts etc Drive apps can also be made the default for handling file formats supported by them Some of these apps also work offline on Google Chrome and ChromeOS br All of the third party apps are free to install However some have fees associated with continued usage or access to additional features Saving data from a third party app to Google Drive requires user authorization the first time In most cases the apps continue to hold access levels until users proactively revoke their access to Google Drive br The Google Drive software development kit SDK works together with the Google Drive user interface and the Chrome Web Store to create an ecosystem of apps that can be installed into Google Drive In February the Create menu in Google Drive was revamped to include third party apps thus effectively granting them the same status as Google s own apps br In March Google released an API for Google Drive that enables third party developers to build collaborative apps that support real time editing br br br File viewing br

Quick Access br Introduced in the Android app in September Quick Access uses machine learning to intelligently predict the files you need before you ve even typed anything The feature was announced to be expanded to iOS and the web in March though the website interface received the feature in May br br br Search br Search results can be narrowed by file type ownership visibility and the open with app Users can search for images by describing or naming what is in them For example a search for mountain returns all the photos of mountains as well as any text documents about mountains Text in images and PDFs can be extracted using optical character recognition In September Google added natural language processing for searching on the Google Drive website enabling specific user search queries like find my budget spreadsheet from last December In February Google integrated Drive and the Google Search app on Android letting users search for keywords switch to an In Apps tab and see any relevant Drive files br br br Backups br In December Google updated the Android app and website with a Backups section listing the Android device and app backups saved to Drive The section lets

MHTML or Google Docs file Users need to be signed into Chrome to use the extension br br br Mobile apps br The main Google Drive mobile app supported editing of documents and spreadsheets until April when the capability was moved to separate standalone apps for Google Docs Google Sheets and Google Slides The Google Drive app on Android allows users to take a photo of a document sign or other text and use optical character recognition to convert to text that can be edited In October the Android app was updated with a Material Design user interface improved search the ability to add a custom message while sharing a file and a new PDF viewer br br br Encryption br Before Google did not encrypt data stored on its servers Following information that the United States National Security Agency had direct access to servers owned by multiple technology companies including Google the company began testing encrypting data in July and enabled encryption for data in transit between its data centers in November Since Google Drive has been providing a client side encryption feature br br br Professional editions br br br Google Drive Enterprise br Google Drive Enterprise formerly Google Drive for Work is a business version as part of Google Workspace formerly Google Apps for Work or G Suite announced at the Google I O conference on June and made available immediately The service features unlimited storage advanced file audit reporting and eDiscovery services along with enhanced administration control and new APIs specifically useful to businesses Users can upload files as

Google Drive for Education was announced on September It was made available for free to all Google Apps for Education users It includes unlimited storage and support for individual files up to TB in size in addition to full encryption br br br Shared Drives br In September Google announced Team Drives later renamed Shared Drives as a new way for Google Workspace teams to collaborate on documents and store files In Shared Drives file folder sharing and ownership are assigned to a team rather than to an individual user Since Shared Drives had an ability to assign different access levels to files and folders to different users and teams and an ability to share a folder publicly Unlike individual Google Drive Shared Drives offer unlimited storage br br br Drive File Stream soon Google Drive for desktop br In March Google introduced Drive File Stream a desktop application for G Suite now Google Workspace customers using Windows and macOS computers that maps Google Drive to a drive letter on the operating system and thus allows easy access to Google Drive files and folders without using a web browser It also features on demand file access when the file is downloaded from Google Drive only when it is accessed Additionally Drive File Stream supports the Shared Drives functionality of Google Workspace br In early Google announced that it will be combining its Drive File Stream and Backup and Sync products into one product Google Drive for desktop which will support features previously exclusive to each respective Client Signing into the Client using a Google Workspace enable account is expected to enable the same enterprise features that Google is migrating to the new product br br br Docs Sheets and Slides br br Google Docs Google Sheets and Google Slides constitute a free web based office suite offered by Google and integrated with Google Drive It allows users to create and edit documents spreadsheets and presentations online while collaborating in real time with other users The three apps are available as web applications as Chrome apps that work offline and as mobile apps for Android and iOS The apps are also compatible with Microsoft Office file formats The suite also consists of Google Drawings Google Forms Google Sites and Google Keep While Forms and Sites are only available as web applications Drawings is also available as a Chrome app while a mobile app for Keep is also available The suite is tightly integrated with Google Drive and all files created with the apps are by default saved to Google Drive br br br Updates br Updates to Docs Sheets and Slides have introduced features using machine learning including Explore offering search results based on the contents of a document answers based on natural language questions in a spreadsheet and dynamic design suggestions based on contents of a slideshow and Action items allowing users to assign tasks to other users While Google Docs has been criticized for lacking the functionality of Microsoft Office it has received praise for its simplicity ease of collaboration and frequent product updates br In order to view and edit Docs Sheets or Slides documents offline users need to be using the Google Chrome web browser A Chrome extension Google Docs Offline allows users to enable offline support for Docs Sheets and Slides files on the Google Drive website br Google also offers an extension for the Google Chrome web browser called Office editing for Docs Sheets and Slides that enables users to view and edit Microsoft Office documents on Google Chrome via Docs Sheets and Slides apps The extension can be used for opening Office files stored on the computer using Chrome as well as for opening Office files encountered on the web in the form of email attachments web search results etc without having to download them The extension is installed on ChromeOS by default br br br Reception br br br Features br In a review of Google Drive after its launch in April Dan Grabham of TechRadar wrote that the integration of Google Docs into Google Drive was a bit confusing mainly due to the differences in the user interfaces between the two where Drive offers a My Drive section with a specific Shared with me view for shared documents He stated that We think the user interface needs a lot more work It s like a retread of Google Docs at the moment and Google surely needs to do work here He considered uploading files fairly easy but noted that folder upload was only supported through the Google Chrome web browser The lack of native editing of Microsoft Office documents was annoying Regarding Google Drive s computer apps he stated that the option in Settings to synchronize only specific folders was powerful He wrote that Drive was a great addition to Google armory of apps and everything does work seamlessly while again criticizing the interface for being confusing and that the file view was not quite intuitive enough without file icons Grabham also reviewed the mobile Android app writing that it s a pretty simple app that enables you to access your files on the move and save some for offline access should you wish and praised Google Docs creation and photo uploading for being easy He also praised that everything is easily searchable br A review by Michael Muchmore of PC Magazine in February praised the service as truly impressive in creating and editing files describing its features as leading in office suite collaboration He added that Compatibility is rarely an issue with importing and exporting options and that the free storage of gigabytes was generous However he also criticized the user interface for being confusing to navigate and wrote that Offline editing isn t simple br The Android version of Google Drive has been criticized for requiring users to individually toggle each file for use offline instead of allowing entire folders to be stored offline br br br Ownership and licensing br Immediately after its announcement in April Google faced criticism over Google Drive privacy In particular privacy advocates have noted that Google has one unified set of Terms of Service and Privacy Policy agreements for all its products and services In a CNET report Zack Whittaker noted that the terms and service have come under heavy fire by the wider community for how it handles users copyright and intellectual property rights In a comparison of Terms of Service agreements between Google Drive and competing cloud storage services Dropbox and OneDrive he cited a paragraph stating that Google has broad rights to reproduce use and create derivative works from content stored on Google Drive via a license from its users Although the user retains intellectual property rights the user licenses Google to extract and parse uploaded content to customize the advertising and other services that Google provides to the user and to promote the service Summarized he wrote that According to its terms Google does not own user uploaded files to Google Drive but the company can do whatever it likes with them In a highly critical editorial of the service Ed Bott of ZDNet wrote that language in the agreements contained exact same words as Dropbox used in a July Privacy Policy update that sparked criticism and forced Dropbox to update its policy once again with clarifying language adding that It s a perfect example of Google s inability to pay even the slightest bit of attention to anything that happens outside the Googleplex Matt Peckham of Time criticized the lack of unique service agreements for Drive writing that If any Google service warrants privacy firewalling it s Google Drive This isn t YouTube or Calendar or even Gmail the potential for someone s most sensitive data to be snooped whether to glean info for marketing or otherwise is too high Google ought to create a privacy exception that narrows the scope of its service terms for Google Drive one that minimally states the company will never circulate the information generated from searching within sic your G Drive data in any way br In contrast a report by Nilay Patel of The Verge stated that all web services should be subject to the harsh scrutiny of their privacy policies but a close and careful reading reveals that Google s terms are pretty much the same as anyone else s and slightly better in some cases pointing to the fact that Google couldn t move files around on its servers cache your data or make image thumbnails without proper rights In comparing the policies with competing services Patel wrote that it s clear that they need the exact same permissions they just use slightly more artful language to communicate them br br br Growth br On November Google announced that Google Drive had million active users a figure that the company was releasing for the first time br On June at the Google I O developer conference Sundar Pichai announced that Google Drive now had million monthly active users and that it was being used by of the Fortune companies as well as by of the top universities br On October at its Atmosphere Live event it was announced that Google Drive had million monthly active users The Next Web noted that this meant an increase of million users in just one quarter br On September it was announced that Google Drive had over one million organizational paying users br In March Google announced that Google Drive had million active users br In May a Google executive stated at a company event that there were over two trillion files stored on Google Drive br br br Downtime issues br Although Google has a uptime guarantee for Google Drive for Google Workspace customers Google Drive has suffered downtimes for both consumers and business users During significant downtimes Google s App Status Dashboard gets updated with the current status of each service Google offers along with details on restoration progress Notable downtimes occurred in March October January September January and December br When the January outage was resolved a Google spokesperson told The Next Web br br At Google we recognize that failures are statistically inevitable and we strive to insulate our users from the effects of failures As that did not happen in this instance we apologize to everyone who was inconvenienced by this event Our engineers are conducting a post mortem investigation to determine how to make our services more resilient to unplanned network failures and we will do our utmost to continue to make Google service outages notable for their rarity br In an outage that affected all of Google s services for five minutes in August CNET reported that global Internet traffic dropped br br br Spam issues br Google Drive allowed users to share drive contents with other Google users without requiring any authorization from the recipient of a sharing invitation This had resulted in users receiving spam from unsolicited shared drives Google acknowledged this issue in and rolled out the ability to block users in In Google rolled out a spam folder for Drive similar to the one in its Gmail service br br br
