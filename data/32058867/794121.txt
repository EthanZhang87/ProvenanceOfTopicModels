Online under the title Just Dangerous Me the addition of which has been criticised by DDLC creator Dan Salvato due to no permission having been sought and the skin being sold as downloadable content without compensation to Team Salvato br br br Forums br There is a large variety of forums in which users can post it and communicate with one another These forums are used for general discussion news Admin announcements role play general entertainment and artist discussions br br br Economy br br br Currency br The currency used in Gaia is known as Gaia Platinum formerly Gaia Gold Platinum is regularly distributed to users as they browse around the website post in the forums play games and participate in other various events and contests the site also rewards users every day with random platinum or items from the Daily Chance The former virtual currency was known as Gaia Gold however after a rapid increase in inflation after gold generating items were released Gaia created Gaia Platinum and gave users the chance to switch to that currency br In July Gaia released another virtual currency called Gaia Cash which can be purchased with real money Gaia Cash can be bought through cell phone payments or directly from Gaia itself br br br AutoCash br On September Gaia announced the introduction of AutoCash AutoCash is an optional feature where GaiaOnline members can sign up to buy Gaia Cash on a reoccurring monthly schedule The current cost per month for the feature is users are given extra content for the monthly fee Staying past three months offers users the bonus of receiving special items br br br Market br Sales within the Gaian market can be divided into four areas Gold Shops Cash Shops Trade and Marketplace br br Gold Shops Items from these stores can be bought with Gold or Gaia Cash most users purchase with Gold and can range from regular store items to upmarket items These are various NPC run stores that sell a variety of items such as avatar clothing and accessories furniture for Gaia Houses and parts for Gaia Cars Items found in the shops can also be sold back to the shop for of the shop price br Cash Shops Items from these stores can be purchased with Gaia Cash only The majority of Gaia Cash sales are from La Victoire an NPC run store that only accepts Gaia Cash It specializes in high end items such as Evolving Items Random Item Generators and Monthly Collectibles Most items from La Victoire are continuously rotated in and out of the store Other Cash Only stores include Phin Phang Gaia Aquarium items and Back Alley Bargains power up items for Gaia s MMORPG zOMG br Trade Users can trade items and gold with other users A majority of these trades are settled in the Gaia Exchange forum and its sub forums br Marketplace The Marketplace is a separate area of the site for users to buy and sell items Rather than self auctioning an item through a thread in the Exchange forum users can either put their item up for immediate sale with a Buy Now price or leave their item for auction with a starting Bid price Users can have up to items for sale at once until getting the Tycoon achievement After that users can sell items at once and each item can be listed for a maximum of days The cost of this convenience is a tax on all gold earned from sales br The site s virtual economy experienced hyperinflation after the introduction of more gold into circulation partly due to the introduction of purchasable gold generators which generated daily gold automatically These were introduced by the site s then owners in an attempt to boost the site s short term revenue To maintain that revenue new and bigger gold generators were frequently introduced and an arms race ensued between site users This would eventually lead to the collapse of the economy coupled with large declines in the userbase and the ultimate sale of the site Later owners substituted a replacement currency Platinum currently pegged at Platinum to million of the old Gold currency and have not returned to currency generators as a way to raise revenue br However former COO Jason Loia has stated he didn t consider inflation as a significant issue br br br Notable items br br br Monthly Collectibles br Monthly Collectibles previously known as Donation Items also referred on site as MCs are special items that can be bought with real money meant to support Gaia s maintenance and costs Established in June after users of Gaia Online petitioned for a donation system in an attempt to increase site revenue for every US a user gives to the site he or she receives an item known as a Sealed Envelope in his or her inventory br Sealed Envelopes go on sale on the first day of every month and are released on the th of each month on During August and September the envelopes were unsealed on the eighth but on October it was decided that the release date should be returned to the fifteenth The Sealed Envelope disappears from the user s inventory and is replaced by a Thank You Letter for the current paid month for example a Thank You Letter for August represents a payment made in that month of that year Users are then able to open these virtual letters to choose one of two or three limited edition items to be granted into their inventory from each letter These items were known as Donation Items until potential legal problems prompted the name change Monthly Collectible items and the Thank You letter items they are found in are specific to the month that they were released in for example the items found in the Thank You letter for April can only be found in that letter and one could only purchase that letter in April br Letters can be purchased over the phone with a text message from a mobile phone via PayPal credit card
