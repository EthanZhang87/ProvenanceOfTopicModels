SRI International SRI is an American nonprofit scientific research institute and organization headquartered in Menlo Park California The trustees of Stanford University established SRI in as a center of innovation to support economic development in the region br The organization was founded as the Stanford Research Institute SRI formally separated from Stanford University in and became known as SRI International in SRI performs client sponsored research and development for government agencies commercial businesses and private foundations It also licenses its technologies forms strategic partnerships sells products and creates spin off companies SRI s headquarters are located near the Stanford University campus br SRI s annual revenue in was approximately million which tripled from under the leadership of Curtis Carlson In the organization was on the verge of bankruptcy when Carlson took over as CEO Over the next sixteen years with Carlson as CEO the organizational culture of SRI was transformed SRI tripled in size became very profitable and created many world changing innovations using the NABC framework One of its best known successes Siri the personal assistant on the iPhone came from a company SRI created and then sold to Apple William A Jeffrey served as SRI s president and CEO from September to December David Parekh is the chief executive officer as of December br SRI employs about people Sarnoff Corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of SRI since was fully integrated into SRI in January br SRI s focus areas include biomedical sciences chemistry and materials computing Earth and space systems economic development education and learning energy and environmental technology security and national defense as well as sensing and devices SRI has received more than patents and patent applications worldwide br br br History br br br Foundation br In the s Stanford University professor Robert E Swain proposed creating a research institute in the Western United States Herbert Hoover then a trustee of Stanford University was also an early proponent of an institute but became less involved with the project after being elected president of the United States The development of the institute was delayed by the Great Depression in the s and World War II in the s with three separate attempts leading to its formation in br In August Maurice Nelles Morlan A Visel and Ernest L Black of Lockheed made the first attempt to create the institute with the formation of the Pacific Research Foundation in Los Angeles A second attempt was made by Henry T Heald then president of the Illinois Institute of Technology In Heald wrote a report recommending a research institute on the West Coast and a close association with Stanford University with an initial grant of equivalent to in A third attempt was made by Fred Terman Stanford University s dean of engineering Terman s proposal followed Heald s but focused on faculty and student research more than contract research br The trustees of Stanford University voted to create the organization in It was structured so that its goals were aligned with the charter of the university to advance scientific knowledge and to benefit the public at large not just the students of Stanford University The trustees were named as the corporation s general members and elected SRI s directors later known as presidents if the organization were dissolved its assets would return to Stanford University br Research chemist William F Talbot became the institute s first director Stanford University president Donald Tresidder instructed Talbot to avoid work that would conflict with the interests of the university particularly federal contracts that might attract political pressure The drive to find work and the lack of support from Stanford faculty caused the new research institute to violate this directive six months later through the pursuit of a contract with the Office of Naval Research This and other issues including frustration with Tresidder s micromanagement of the new organization caused Talbot to repeatedly offer his resignation which Tresidder eventually accepted Talbot was replaced by Jesse Hobson who had previously led the Armour Research Foundation but the pursuit of contract work remained br br br Early history br br SRI s first research project investigated whether the guayule plant could be used as a source of natural rubber During World War II rubber was imported into the U S and was subject to shortages and strict rationing From to the United States Department of Agriculture USDA supported a project to create a domestic source of natural rubber Once the war ended the United States Congress cut funding for the program in response the Office of Naval Research created a grant for the project to continue at SRI and the USDA staff worked through SRI until Congress reauthorized funding in br SRI s first economic study was for the United States Air Force In the Air Force wanted to determine the expansion potential of the U S aircraft industry SRI found that it would take too long to escalate production in an emergency In SRI began research and consultation with Chevron Corporation to develop an artificial substitute for tallow and coconut oil in soap production SRI s investigation confirmed the potential of dodecylbenzene as a suitable replacement Later Procter Gamble used the substance as the basis for Tide laundry detergent br The institute performed much of the early research on air pollution and the formation of ozone in the lower atmosphere SRI sponsored the First National Air Pollution Symposium in Pasadena California in November Experts gave presentations on pollution research exchanged ideas and techniques and stimulated interest in the field The event was attended by scientists business executives and civic leaders from the U S SRI co sponsored subsequent events on the subject br br In April Walt and Roy Disney hired SRI and in particular Harrison Price to consult on their proposal for establishing an amusement park in Burbank California SRI provided information on location attendance patterns and economic feasibility SRI selected a larger site in Anaheim prepared reports about the operation provided on site administrative support for Disneyland and acted in an advisory role as the park expanded In SRI was commissioned to select a site and provide design suggestions for the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts br In the Technicolor Corporation contracted with SRI to develop a near instantaneous electro optical alternative to the manual timing process during film copying In the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented the Scientific and Engineering Award jointly to SRI and Technicolor for their work on the design and development of the Technicolor electronic printing timer which greatly benefited the motion picture industry In Southern Pacific asked SRI to investigate ways of reducing damage during rail freight shipments by mitigating shock to railroad box cars This investigation led to William K MacCurdy s development of the Hydra Cushion technology which remains standard today br In the s SRI worked under the direction of the Bank of America to develop ERMA Electronic Recording Machine Accounting and magnetic ink character recognition MICR The ERMA project was led by computer scientist Jerre Noe SRI s assistant director of engineering at the time As of MICR remains the industry standard in automated check processing br br br Rapid expansion br br Douglas Engelbart the founder of SRI s Augmentation Research Center ARC was the primary force behind the design and development of the multi user oN Line System or NLS featuring original versions of modern computer human interface elements including bit mapped displays collaboration software hypertext and precursors to the graphical user interface such as the computer mouse As a pioneer of human computer interaction Engelbart is arguably SRI s most notable alumnus He was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in br Bill English then chief engineer at ARC built the first prototype of a computer mouse from Engelbart s design in SRI also developed inkjet printing and optical disc recording Liquid crystal display LCD technology was developed at RCA Laboratories in the s which later became Sarnoff Corporation in a wholly owned subsidiary of SRI Sarnoff was fully integrated into SRI in br In the early s Hewitt Crane and his colleagues developed the world s first all magnetic digital computer based upon extensions to magnetic core memories The technology was licensed to AMP Inc who then used it to build specialized computers for controlling tracks in the New York City Subway and on railroad switching yards br In SRI s Artificial Intelligence Center began working on Shakey the robot the first mobile robot to reason about its actions Equipped with a television camera a triangulating rangefinder and bump sensors Shakey used software for perception world modeling and acting The project ended in SRI s Artificial Intelligence Center marked its th anniversary in br br On October the first connection on a wide area network to use packet switching ARPANET was established between nodes at Leonard Kleinrock s laboratory at University of California Los Angeles UCLA and Douglas Engelbart s laboratory at SRI using Interface Message Processors at both sites The following year Engelbart s laboratory installed the first TENEX system outside of BBN where it was developed In addition to SRI and UCLA University of California Santa Barbara and the University of Utah were part of the original four network nodes By December the entire four node network was connected In the s SRI developed packet switched radio a precursor to wireless networking over the horizon radar Deafnet vacuum microelectronics and software implemented fault tolerance br The first true Internet transmission occurred on November when SRI originated the first connection between three disparate networks Data flowed seamlessly through the mobile Packet Radio Van between SRI in Menlo Park California and the University of Southern California in Los Angeles via University College London England across three types of networks packet radio satellite and the ARPANET In the Computer History Museum presented a th anniversary celebration of this demonstration which included several participants from the event SRI would go on to run the Network Information Center under the leadership of Jake Feinler br br br Split and diversification br The Vietnam War was an important issue on college campuses across the United States in the s and s As a belated response to Vietnam War protesters who believed that funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA made the university part of the military industrial complex the Stanford Research Institute split from Stanford University in The organization subsequently changed its name from the Stanford Research Institute to SRI International in br br In physicists Harold E Puthoff and Russell Targ undertook a series of investigations of psychic phenomena sponsored by the CIA for which they coined the term remote viewing Among other activities the project encompassed the work of consulting consciousness researchers including artist writer Ingo Swann military intelligence officer Joseph McMoneagle and psychic illusionist Uri Geller This ESP work continued with funding from the US intelligence community until Puthoff and Targ left SRI in the mid s For more information see Parapsychology research at SRI br Social scientist and consumer futurist Arnold Mitchell created the Values
