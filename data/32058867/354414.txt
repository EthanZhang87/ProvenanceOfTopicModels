announced they would be acquiring the Enterprise Security software division of Symantec for billion After the acquisition Symantec became known as NortonLifeLock After completing its merger with Avast in September the company adopted the name Gen Digital Inc br br br History br br br to br br br Founded in by Gary Hendrix with a National Science Foundation grant Symantec was originally focused on artificial intelligence related projects including a database program Hendrix hired several Stanford University natural language processing researchers as the company s first employees br In it became clear that the advanced natural language and database system that Symantec had developed could not be ported from DEC minicomputers to the PC This left Symantec without a product but with expertise in natural language database query systems and technology As a result later in Symantec was acquired by another smaller software startup company C E Software founded by Denis Coleman and Gordon Eubanks and headed by Eubanks C E Software developed a combined file management and word processing program called Q A br The merged company retained the name Symantec Eubanks became its chairman Vern Raburn the former president of the original Symantec remained as president of the combined company The new Symantec combined the file management and word processing functionality that C E had planned and added an advanced Natural Language query system designed by Gary Hendrix and engineered by Dan Gordon that set new standards for ease of database query and report generation The natural language system was named The Intelligent Assistant Turner chose the name of Q A for Symantec s flagship product in large part because the name lent itself to use in a short easily merchandised logo Brett Walter designed the user interface of Q A Brett Walter director of product management Q A was released in November br In Vern Raburn and Gordon Eubanks swapped roles and Eubanks became CEO and president of Symantec while Raburn became its chairman After this change Raburn had little involvement with Symantec and in a few years Eubanks added chairmanship to his other roles After a slow start for sales of Q A in the fall of and spring of Rod Turner a Symantec Sr Executive signed up a new advertising agency called Elliott Dickens embarked on an aggressive new advertising campaign and came up with the Six Pack Program in which all Symantec employees regardless of role went on the road training and selling nationwide in the United States Turner named it Six Pack because employees were to work six days a week see six dealerships per day train six sales representatives per store and stay with friends free or at Motel Simultaneously a promotion was run jointly with SofSell which was Symantec s exclusive wholesale distributor in the United States for the first year that Q A was on the market This promotion was very successful in encouraging dealers to try Q A br During this time Symantec was advised by its board members Jim Lally and John Doerr that if it would cut its expenses and grow revenues enough to achieve cash flow break even then Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers would back the company in raising more venture capital To accomplish this the management team worked out a salary reduction schedule where the chairman and the CEO would take zero pay all vice presidents would take a pay cut and all other employees pay was cut by Two employees were laid off Eubanks also negotiated a sizable rent reduction on the office space the company had leased in the days of the original Symantec These expense reductions combined with strong international sales of Q A enabled the company to attain break even br The significantly increased traction for Q A from this re launch grew Symantec s revenues substantially along with early success for Q A in international markets uniquely a German version was shipped three weeks after the United States version and it was the first software in the world that supported German Natural Language following Turner s having emphasized establishing international sales distribution and multiple language versions of Q A from the initial shipment br In Rod Turner negotiated the publishing agreement with David Whitney for Symantec s second product which Turner named NoteIt an annotation utility for Lotus It was evident to Turner that NoteIt would confuse the dealer channel if it was launched under the Symantec name because Symantec had built up interest by that stage in Q A but not yet shipped it and because the low price for the utility would not be initially attracted to the dealer channel until demand had been built up Turner felt that the product should be marketed under a unique brand name br Turner and Gordon E Eubanks Jr then chairman of Symantec Corporation agreed to form a new division of Symantec and Eubanks delegated the choice of name to Turner Turner chose the name Turner Hall Publishing to be a new division of Symantec devoted to publishing third party software and hardware The objective of the division was to diversify revenues and accelerate the growth of Symantec Turner chose the name Turner Hall Publishing using his last name and that of Dottie Hall Director of Marketing Communications to convey the sense of a stable long established company Turner Hall Publishing s first offering was Note It a notation utility add in for Lotus which was developed by David Whitney and licensed to Symantec Its second product was the Turner Hall Card which was a k RAM half slot memory card initially made to inexpensively increase the available memory for Symantec s flagship product Q A The Turner Hall division also marketed the card as a standalone product Turner Hall s third product also a add in was SQZ a Lotus spreadsheet compression utility developed by Chris Graham Synex Systems In the summer of Eubanks and Turner recruited Tom Byers from Digital Research to expand the Turner Hall Publishing product family and lead the Turner Hall effort br By the winter of the Turner Hall Publishing division had achieved success with NoteIt the Turner Hall Card and SQZ The popularity of these products while contributing a relatively small portion of revenues to Symantec conveyed the impression that Symantec was already a diversified company and indeed many industry participants were under the impression that Symantec had acquired Turner Hall Publishing In Byers recruited Ted Schlein into the Turner Hall Product Group to assist in building the product family and in marketing br Revenues from Q A and Symantec s early launch into the international marketplace combined with Turner Hall Publishing generated the market presence and scale that enabled Symantec to make its first merger acquisition in February that of Breakthrough Software maker of the TimeLine project management software for DOS Because this was the first time that Symantec had acquired a business that had revenues inventory and customers Eubanks chose to change nothing at BreakThrough Software for six months and the actual merger logistics started in the summer of with Turner being appointed by Eubanks as general manager of the TimeLine business unit Turner was made responsible for the successful integration of the company into Symantec and ongoing growth of the business with P L There was a heavy emphasis placed on making the minimum disruption by Eubanks and Turner br Soon after the acquisition of TimeLine Breakthrough Software Eubanks reorganized Symantec structuring the company around product centric groups each having its development quality assurance technical support and product marketing functions and a general manager with profit and loss responsibility Sales finance and operations were centralized functions that were shared This structure lent itself well to Symantec s further growth through mergers and acquisitions Eubanks made Turner general manager of the new TimeLine Product Group and simultaneously of the Q A Product Group and made Tom Byers general manager of the Turner Hall Product Group Turner continued to build and lead the company s international business and marketing for the whole company br At the TimeLine Product Group Turner drove strong marketing promotion and sales programs to accelerate momentum By this merger was very successful product group morale was high TimeLine development continued apace and the increased sales and marketing efforts applied built the TimeLine into the clear market lead in PC project management software on DOS Both the Q A and TimeLine product groups were healthily profitable The profit stream and merger success set the stage for subsequent merger and acquisition activity by the company and indeed funded the losses of some of the product groups that were subsequently acquired In Eubanks hired John Laing as VP worldwide sales and Turner transferred the international division to Laing Eubanks also recruited Bob Dykes to be executive vice president for operations and finance in anticipation of the upcoming IPO On June Symantec had its IPO br br br to br In May Symantec announced its intent to merge with and acquire Peter Norton Computing a developer of various utilities for DOS Turner was appointed as product group manager for the Norton business and made responsible for the merger with P L responsibility Ted Schlein was made product group manager for the Q A business br The Peter Norton group merger logistical effort began immediately while the companies sought approval for the merger and in August Symantec concluded the purchase by this time the combination of the companies was already complete Symantec s consumer antivirus and data management utilities are still marketed under the Norton name At the time of the merger Symantec had built upon its Turner Hall Publishing presence in the utility market by introducing Symantec Antivirus for the Macintosh SAM and Symantec Utilities for the Macintosh SUM These two products were already market leaders on the Mac and this success made the Norton merger more strategic Symantec had already begun the development of a DOS based antivirus program one year before the merger with Norton The management team had decided to enter the antivirus market in part because it was felt that the antivirus market entailed a great deal of ongoing work to stay ahead of new viruses The team felt that Microsoft would be unlikely to find this effort attractive which would lengthen the viability of the market for Symantec Turner decided to use the Norton name for obvious reasons on what became the Norton Antivirus which Turner and the Norton team launched in At the time of the merger Norton revenues were approximately to of the combined entity By while being led by Turner Norton product group revenues had grown to approximately of Symantec s total br At one time Symantec was also known for its development tools particularly the THINK Pascal THINK C Symantec C Enterprise Developer and Visual Cafe packages that were popular on the Macintosh and IBM PC compatible platforms These product lines resulted from acquisitions made by the company in the late s and early s These businesses and the Living Videotext acquisition were consistently unprofitable for Symantec and these losses diverted expenditures away from both the Q A for Windows and the TimeLine for Windows development efforts during the critical period from through Symantec exited this business in the late s as competitors such as Metrowerks Microsoft and Borland gained significant market share br In Symantec Corporation was alleged of misleading financial statements in violation of GAAP br br br to present br br From to April Symantec was led by CEO John W Thompson a former VP at IBM At the time Thompson was the only African American leading a major US technology company He was succeeded in April by the company s long time Symantec executive Enrique Salem Under Salem Symantec completed the acquisition of Verisign s Certificate Authority business dramatically increasing their share of that market br br In Symantec released a list of the then dirtiest websites which contain the most malware as detected by Norton Safe Web br br Salem was abruptly fired in for disappointing earnings performance and replaced by Steve Bennett a former CEO of Intuit and GE executive In January Bennett announced a major corporate reorganization with the goal of reducing costs and improving Symantec s product line He said that sales and marketing had been high costs but did not provide quality outcomes He concluded that Our system is just broken br Robert Enderle of CIO com reviewed the reorganization and noted that Bennett was following the General Electric model of being product focused instead of customer focused He concluded Eliminating middle management removes a large number of highly paid employees This will tactically improve Symantec s bottom line but reduce the skills needed to ensure high quality products in the long term br In March Symantec fired Steve Bennett from his CEO position and named Michael Brown as interim president
