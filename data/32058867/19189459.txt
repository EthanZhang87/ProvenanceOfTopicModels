data centers br br br Storage br Wuala offered free accounts that had GB of storage for no charge As of June they shifted to a paid only service As of the end of they will no longer support any form of free only storage shifting entirely to a payment based usage model br Users of joint products may start with greater amounts of storage for a limited period br with a LaCie external hard disk drive

storage prices range from EUR year for GB to EUR year for TB br Pricing changed in June The storage plan starts with per month per year for GB and ends at per Month per year for TB of storage br br br Trading br One of the distinguishing features of Wuala the ability to trade local disk storage space against cloud storage is no longer available br br br User interfaces br br br Desktop application br The user interface offers most of the features that are normally associated with a file manager Additional features come through integration br A registered user can install the Java based client application SWT GUI br br on any number of Linux Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows computers br with FUSE MacFUSE and Dokan respectively for file system integration br br br Wuala Webstart and web browsers br Through a web browser on a computer that has Java installed br br the user can start trust a Java applet which downloads and runs a class loader allowing fast start of the latest version of the Wuala application br If the computer is without Java or if running of the class loader is prevented br br any folder that is public or shared with a weblink can be browsed br br br Non graphical interfaces br Support for the following may be limited br br command line interface br daemon br headless system br br br Security br According to Wuala s FAQ the software uses AES for encryption and RSA for key exchange and signatures Keys are organized in a key management scheme called Cryptree br According to the FAQ Wuala employs full client side encryption All files and their metadata most OS X metadata is not supported get encrypted before they are uploaded The encryption key is stored such that no one not even LaCie that operates the service can decrypt the stored files The disadvantage of this is that Wuala has no password recovery and all data processing needs to be done in the client for example creating a search index The advantage is significantly improved privacy br Since the source code to Wuala has not been released it is difficult to ensure that the software does what it states it does including proper client side encryption Also updates are pushed automatically to the client machine These facts mean that users of Wuala are not safe from possible backdoors in code br br br Reviews br Unlimited online storage for free almost Wuala Webware CNET
