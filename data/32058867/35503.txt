 Com Corporation was an American digital electronics manufacturer best known for its computer network products The company was co founded in by Robert Metcalfe Howard Charney and others Bill Krause joined as President in Metcalfe explained the name Com was a contraction of Computer Communication Compatibility with its focus on Ethernet technology that he had co invented which enabled the networking of computers br Com provided network interface controller and switches routers wireless access points and controllers IP voice systems and intrusion prevention systems The company was based in Santa Clara California From its acquisition of percent ownership of H C Technologies Co Limited H C initially a joint venture with China based Huawei Technologies Com achieved a market presence in China and a significant networking market share in Europe Asia and the Americas Com products were sold under the brands Com H C and TippingPoint br On April Hewlett Packard completed the acquisition of Com and it no longer exists as a separate entity Com s products support and technologies were eventually merged into HPE s Aruba Networks business unit following HP s acquisition of Aruba in and subsequent split into HPE later that same year br br br History br br br Xerox PARC br After reading an article on ALOHAnet Robert Metcalfe became interested in computer networking ALOHAnet was an over the air wide area network system in Hawaii using ultra high frequency radios and made several assumptions that Metcalfe thought would not be correct in practice He developed his own theories of how to manage traffic and began to consider an ALOHAnet in a wire networking system In he joined Xerox PARC to develop these ideas and after pairing up with David Boggs the two had early Mbit s versions of Ethernet working in They then went on to build up a networking protocol known as PARC Universal Packet PuP with the entire system ready for build out by late br At this point Xerox management did nothing with it even after being approached by prospective customers Increasingly upset by management s lack of interest Metcalfe left Xerox in but he was lured back again the next year Further development followed resulting in the seminal Xerox Network Systems XNS protocol which was completed by Once again Metcalfe found that management was unwilling to actually do anything with the product and he threatened to leave and in he left the company br br br Founding and early days br Metcalfe subsequently co founded Com in The other co founders were Metcalfe s college friend Howard Charney and two others Bill Krause joined as President in and became CEO in and led Com until when he retired Com began making Ethernet adapter cards for many early s computer systems including the DEC LSI DEC VAX Sun and the IBM PC In the mid s Com branded their Ethernet technology as EtherSeries while introducing a range of software and PC based equipment to provide shared services over a local area network LAN using XNS protocols These protocols were branded EtherShare for file sharing EtherPrint for printing EtherMail for email and Ether for IBM host emulation Com became a public company via an initial public offering IPO in br The company s network software products included br br Share file and printer sharing br Mail e mail br Route for routing XNS over a Server serial port towards a remote Route LAN br Remote PC for routing XNS towards a Remote PC Workstation serial port br NetConnect to support flexible XNS routing between a number of connected Ethernets AND OR Token Ring Networks br SNA Gateway to enable standard MS DOS workstations to emulate standard IBM Terminals via the LAN and the connected SNA Gateway towards a remote IBM compatible mainframe system br MultiConnect was a chassis based multi port BASE Ethernet repeater br Server a server grade PC for running services br Station a diskless workstation br Open file and printer sharing based on Microsoft s LAN Manager br Etherterm terminal emulation br Etherprobe LAN analysis software br DynamicAccess software products for Ethernet load balancing response time and RMON II distributed monitoring br br Com s expansion beyond its original base of PC and thin Ethernet products began in when it merged with Bridge Communications This provided a range of equipment based on Motorola processors and using XNS protocols compatibly with Com s Etherterm PC software br br CS CS communication servers terminal servers br Ethernet bridges and XNS routers br GS X X gateway br CS SNA SNA gateway br NCS network control software running on a Sun Microsystems computer br By Com s status was such that they were able to enter into an agreement with the city of San Francisco to pay per year for the naming rights to Candlestick Park That agreement ended in br br br br br In Com merged with USRobotics USR a maker of dial up modems and owner of Palm Inc USRobotics was known for its Sportster line of consumer oriented modems as well as its Courier business class modem line This merger spelled the beginning of the end of Com In addition to consumer network electronics USRobotics was a well known manufacturer of a dialup access server the Total Control Hub rebadged by Com as the Total Control based largely on its Courier modem technology This key business product competed against Cisco s AS access server line in the mid s as the explosion of the Internet led to service provider investment in dialup access server equipment Com continued the development of the Total Control line until it was eventually spun off as a part of Commworks which was then acquired by UTStarcom br In August Bruce Claflin was named chief operating officer The modem business was rapidly shrinking Com attempted to enter the DSL business but was not successful br In the lucrative server network interface card NIC business Com dominated market share with Intel only able to break past Com after dramatic price slashing It started developing Gigabit Ethernet cards in house but later scrapped the plans Later it formed a joint venture with Broadcom where Broadcom would develop the main integrated circuit component and the NIC would be Com branded br In Com acquired NBX a Boston company with an Ethernet based phone system for small and medium sized businesses This product proved popular with Com s existing distribution channel and saw rapid growth and adoption As one of the first companies to deliver a complete networked phone system and increased its distribution channel with larger telephony partners such as Southwestern Bell and Metropark Communications Com helped make VoIP into a safe and practical technology with wide adoption br Com then tried to move into the smart consumer appliances business and in June Com acquired internet radio startup Kerbango for million It developed its Audrey appliance which made an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show It scrapped the Audrey and Kerbango products less than a year later br In March in a highly public and criticized move Com exited the high end core routers and switch market to focus on other areas of the business The CoreBuilder Ethernet and ATM LAN switches PathBuilder and NetBuilder WAN Routers were all discontinued June CoreBuilder products and the customer base was migrated over to Extreme Networks The PathBuilder and NetBuilder were transitioned to Motorola Com focused its efforts from to on building up the HomeConnect OfficeConnect SuperStack NBX and Total Control product lines Due to this perceived exit from the Enterprise market Com would never gain momentum with large customers or carriers again br In July Com spun off Palm as an independent company Following Palm s IPO Com continued to own percent of Palm but Com s market capitalization was smaller than Palm s U S Robotics was also spun out again as a separate company at this time br br br and beyond br In January Claflin became chief executive officer replacing ric Benhamou CEO from to He was criticized for the costly diversification in the mobile handheld computer market br At this point the company s main line of business selling addon network interface cards NICs was also shrinking rapidly mainly because many new computers had NICs built in The company started slashing or selling divisions and going through numerous rounds of layoffs The company went from employing more than employees to fewer than br In May the company moved its Silicon Valley Santa Clara headquarters to Marlborough Massachusetts It also formed a venture called H C with Huawei whereby Com would sell and rebrand products under the joint venture br In Com sold its CommWorks Corporation subsidiary to UTStarcom Inc CommWorks was based in Rolling Meadows Illinois and developed wireline telecommunications and wireless infrastructure technologies br In January Claflin announced he would be leaving the company In January R Scott Murray became CEO of Com and chairman of H C Technology in China the joint venture with Huawei Technologies Murray voluntarily resigned from the company in August over his concerns about the questionable business ethics of Huawei and potential cyber security risks posed by Huawei Edgar Masri returned to Com to head as president and CEO following Murray s departure br In September Bain Capital agreed to buy the company for billion with minority equity financing from Huawei Technologies However the deal met with U S government regulatory opposition and it fell through early in following concerns over Huawei s risk of conducting cyber security threats against the United States Government and its allies Huawei s former dealings in Iran and Huawei being operated by a former engineer in China s People s Liberation Army Edgar Masri left the company in April partially as a result of the failed Bain transaction br In April Robert Mao was named chief executive and Ron Sege president and chief operating officer br In fiscal year ended May Com had annual revenue of billion and more than employees in over countries In September Com reported financial results for its fiscal first quarter which ended August Revenue in the quarter was million compared to revenue of million in the corresponding period in fiscal a percent increase Net income in the quarter was million compared with a net loss of million in the first quarter of fiscal year br The company reported that it had more than engineers with more than United States patents and nearly Chinese issued patents as well as more than pending Chinese applications It also reported pending applications for separate inventions outside of China covering a wide range of networking technologies br br br Acquisition by HP br On November Com and Hewlett Packard announced that Hewlett Packard would acquire Com for billion in cash On April Hewlett Packard completed its acquisition When Hewlett Packard split into Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Hewlett Packard Inc the Com unit continued with HPE and was ultimately integrated into Aruba Networks along with the rest of HP s networking portfolio br br br Products

for US million from a joint venture br br br Former subsidiaries br CommWorks Corporation was a subsidiary of Com Corporation based in Rolling Meadows Illinois It was sold to UTStarcom of Alameda California in br CommWorks was formerly the Carrier Network Business unit of Com comprising several acquired companies U S Robotics Rolling Meadows Illinois Call Technologies Reston Virginia and LANsource Toronto Ontario Canada CommWorks was able to use technology from each company to create IP softswitch and IP communications software U S Robotics provided media gateways the Total Control product line formerly used for dial modem termination and softswitch technology Call Technologies provided Unified Messaging software LANsource provided fax over IP software that was integrated with the Unified Messaging platform br The Carrier Network Business unit of Com developed an Inter working function technology that became the first and dominant G CDMA wireless data gateway product In partnership with Unwired Planet now Openwave and Qualcomm Quicknet connect allowed for second connect times versus modems connecting the call in approximately seconds This product was deployed in the United States Japan and Korea covering the G CDMA market sample carriers included Sprint It led to follow on products that became core to CommWorks now UTStarcom offerings including the and G packet data gateway products known as PDSN and Home Agents br CommWorks Com co developed an H based softswitch with AT T in for use in a transparent trunking application for AT T s residential long distance customers Long distance telephone calls were redirected from the LEC s ingress CLASS switch to the Total Control media gateway where it was converted from TDM to IP and transported across AT T s WorldNet IP backbone When it reached the destination it was passed to the egress LEC s CLASS switch as an untariffed data call br CommWorks modified the gateway and softswitch software to support SIP for MCI WorldCom s hosted business offering in br Although Com sold CommWorks to UTStarcom they retained intellectual property rights to the softswitch technology After modifying the software to enable enterprise PBX features Com released this technology as VCX the industry s first pure SIP PBX in br br br See also br Station br Busy Override br Ungermann Bass br Sytek br List of acquisitions
