An email client email reader or more formally message user agent MUA or mail user agent is a computer program used to access and manage a user s email br A web application which provides message management composition and reception functions may act as a web email client and a piece of computer hardware or software whose primary or most visible role is to work as an email client may also use the term br br br Retrieving messages from a mailbox br Like most client programs an email client is only active when a user runs it The common arrangement is for an email user the client to make an arrangement with a remote Mail Transfer Agent br MTA server for the receipt and storage of the client s emails The MTA using a suitable mail delivery agent MDA adds email messages to a client s storage as they arrive The remote mail storage is referred to as the user s mailbox The default setting on many Unix systems is for the mail server to store formatted messages in mbox within the user s home directory Of course users of the system can log in and run a mail client on the same computer that hosts their mailboxes in which case the server is not actually remote other than in a generic sense br Emails are stored in the user s mailbox on the remote server until the user s email client requests them to be downloaded to the user s computer or can otherwise access the user s mailbox on the possibly remote server The email client can be set up to connect to multiple mailboxes at the same time and to request the download of emails either automatically such as at pre set intervals or the request can be manually initiated by the user br A user s mailbox can be accessed in two dedicated ways The Post Office Protocol POP allows the user to download messages one at a time and only deletes them from the server after they have been successfully saved on local storage It is possible to leave messages on the server to permit another client to access them However there is no provision for flagging a specific message as seen answered or forwarded thus POP is not convenient for users who access the same mail from different machines br Alternatively the Internet Message Access Protocol IMAP allows users to keep messages on the server flagging them as appropriate IMAP provides folders and sub folders which can be shared among different users with possibly different access rights Typically the Sent Drafts and Trash folders are created by default IMAP features an idle extension for real time updates providing faster notification than polling where long lasting connections are feasible See also the remote messages section below br The JSON Meta Application Protocol JMAP is implemented using JSON APIs over HTTP and has been developed as an alternative to IMAP SMTP br In addition the mailbox storage can be accessed directly by programs running on the server or via shared disks Direct access can be more efficient but is less portable as it depends on the mailbox format it is used by some email clients including some webmail applications br br br Message composition br Email clients usually contain user interfaces to display and edit text Some applications permit the use of a program external editor br The email clients will perform formatting according to RFC for headers and body and MIME for non textual content and attachments Headers include the destination fields To Cc short for Carbon copy and Bcc Blind carbon copy and the originator fields From which is the message s author s Sender in case there are more authors and Reply To in case responses should be addressed to a different mailbox To better assist the user with destination fields many clients maintain one or more address books and or are able to connect to an LDAP directory server For originator fields clients may support different identities br Client settings require the user s real name and email address for each user s identity and possibly a list of LDAP servers br br br Submitting messages to a server br When a user wishes to create and send an email the email client will handle the task The email client is usually set up automatically to connect to the user s mail server which is typically either an MSA or an MTA two variations of the SMTP protocol The email client which uses the SMTP protocol creates an authentication extension which the mail server uses to authenticate the sender This method eases modularity and nomadic computing The older method was for the mail server to recognize the client s IP address e g because the client is on the same machine and uses internal address or because the client s IP address is controlled by the same Internet service provider that provides both Internet access and mail services br Client settings require the name or IP address of the preferred outgoing mail server the port number for MTA for MSA and the user name and password for the authentication if any There is a non standard port for SSL encrypted SMTP sessions that many clients and servers support for backward compatibility br br br Encryption br With no encryption much like for postcards email activity is plainly visible by any occasional eavesdropper Email encryption enables privacy to be safeguarded by encrypting the mail sessions the body of the message or both Without it anyone with network access and the right tools can monitor email and obtain login passwords Examples of concern include the government censorship and surveillance and fellow wireless network users such as at an Internet cafe br All relevant email protocols have an option to encrypt the whole session to prevent a user s name and password from being sniffed They are strongly suggested for nomadic users and whenever the Internet access provider is not trusted When sending mail users can only control encryption at the first hop from a client to its configured outgoing mail server At any further hop messages may be transmitted with or without encryption depending solely on the general configuration of the transmitting server and the capabilities of the receiving one br Encrypted mail sessions deliver messages in their original format i e plain text or encrypted body on a user s local mailbox and on the destination server s The latter server is operated by an email hosting service provider possibly a different entity than the Internet access provider currently at hand br Encrypting an email retrieval session with e g SSL can protect both parts authentication and message transfer of the session br Alternatively if the user has SSH access to their mail server they can use SSH port forwarding to create an encrypted tunnel over which to retrieve their emails br br br Encryption of the message body br There are two main models for managing cryptographic keys S MIME employs a model based on a trusted certificate authority CA that signs users public keys OpenPGP employs a somewhat more flexible web of trust mechanism that allows users to sign one another s public keys OpenPGP is also more flexible in the format of the messages in that it still supports plain message encryption and signing as they used to work before MIME standardization br In both cases only the message body is encrypted Header fields including originator recipients and often subject remain in plain text br br br Webmail br br In addition to email clients running on a desktop computer there are those hosted remotely either as part of a remote UNIX installation accessible by telnet i e a shell account or hosted on the Web Both of these approaches have several advantages they share an ability to send and receive email away from the user s normal base using a web browser or telnet client thus eliminating the need to install a dedicated email client on the user s device br Some websites are dedicated to providing email services and many Internet service providers provide webmail services as part of their Internet service package The main limitations of webmail are that user interactions are subject to the website s operating system and the general inability to download email messages and compose or work on the messages offline although there are software packages that can integrate parts of the webmail functionality into the OS e g creating messages directly from third party applications via MAPI br Like IMAP and MAPI webmail provides for email messages to remain on the mail server See next section br br br Remote messages br POP has an option to leave messages on the server By contrast both IMAP and webmail keep messages on the server as their method of operating albeit users can make local copies as they like Keeping messages on the server has advantages and disadvantages br br br Advantages br Messages can be accessed from various computers or mobile devices at different locations using different clients br Some kind of backup is usually provided by the server br br br Disadvantages br With limited bandwidth access to long messages can be lengthy unless the email client caches a local copy br There may be privacy concerns since messages that stay on the server at all times have more chances to be casually accessed by IT personnel unless end to end encryption is used br br br Protocols br Popular protocols for retrieving mail include POP and IMAP Sending mail is usually done using the SMTP protocol br Another important standard supported by most email clients is MIME which is used to send binary file email attachments Attachments are files that are not part of the email proper but are sent with the email br Most email clients use a User Agent header field to identify the software used to send the message This header field is defined for Netnews but not for e mail and as such is non standard in e mail headers br RFC Message Submission for Mail details the role of the Mail submission agent br RFC Email Submission Operations Access and Accountability Requirements provides a survey of the concepts of MTA MSA MDA and MUA It mentions that Access Providers MUST NOT block users from accessing the external Internet using the SUBMISSION port and that MUAs SHOULD use the SUBMISSION port for message submission br RFC An Extensible Format for Email Feedback Reports provides an extensible format and MIME type that may be used by mail operators to report feedback about received email to other parties br br br Port numbers br Email servers and clients by convention use the TCP port numbers in the following table For MSA IMAP and POP the table reports also the labels that a client can use to query the SRV records and discover both the host name and the port number of the corresponding service br br While webmail obeys the earlier HTTP disposition of having separate ports for encrypt and plain text sessions mail protocols use the STARTTLS technique thereby allowing encryption to start on an already established TCP connection While RFC used to discourage the use of the previously established ports and RFC promotes the use of implicit TLS when available br br br Proprietary client protocols br Microsoft mail systems use the proprietary Messaging Application Programming Interface MAPI in client applications such as Microsoft Outlook to access Microsoft Exchange electronic mail servers br br br See also br br Comparison of email clients br
