Amdahl Corporation was an information technology company which specialized in IBM mainframe compatible computer products some of which were regarded as supercomputers competing with those from Cray Research Founded in by Gene Amdahl a former IBM computer engineer best known as chief architect of System it has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Fujitsu since The company was located in Sunnyvale California br From its first machine in Amdahl s business was to provide mainframe computers that were plug compatible with contemporary IBM mainframes but offering higher reliability running somewhat faster and costing somewhat less They often had additional practical advantages as well in terms of size power requirements of being air cooled instead of requiring a chilled water supply This offered a price performance ratio superior to the IBM lineup and made Amdahl one of the few real competitors to Big Blue in the very high margin computer market segment The company won about of the mainframe business worldwide but was a market leader in some regions most notably in the Carolinas Proverbially savvy IBM customers liked to have Amdahl coffee mugs visible in their offices when IBM salespeople came to visit br As the mainframe market began to change in the later s Amdahl was increasingly diversified becoming a major supplier of UNIX and open systems software and servers data storage subsystems data communications products application development software and a variety of educational and consulting services br br br Company history br br br ASC br From Gene Amdahl had been working at IBM on the IBM Advanced Computer Systems project ASC which intended to introduce what would be the world s fastest computer During a shake up of the project in early Amdahl suggested the company to abandon the ASC concept and instead use the techniques and circuit designs to build a System compatible design In a shoot out between the two concepts that spring Amdahl s concept won Many of the managers of the ASC left and Amdahl was placed in charge of developing the new concept br That July IBM sent out a memo stating that their older software was going to be released into the public domain and that new software would be sold as separate line items not part of the purchase of a system This seemingly small change alerted Amdahl to the possibility of IBM compatible machines if the software was sold separately then IBM could not refuse to sell it to other computers or they would violate anti trust rules br In May Amdahl outlined a series of three machines developed from the ASC concept This followed IBM s pricing model of offering a series of designs that were separated by about three times in performance and two times in cost offering customers a reason to upgrade to a larger system To make the top end system affordable it would have to be priced in a way that would push the prices of the smaller systems below what their current machines sold for Management decided against the plans and as this essentially ended the ASC effort Amdahl suggested they shut down the lab They did so and Amdahl left the company shortly thereafter in early telling them of his plans to introduce compatible machines br br br Forming Amdahl br br br Meeting with several other former ASC engineers a new concept emerged Instead of attempting to make the fastest computer using the most tightly packed circuit boards possible with current technology they would instead design a much looser arrangement of five by five components on a standardized card Although a machine using these cards would not be able to run as fast as ASC they would be much easier to design and cheaper to build A key concept in the system was the automated layout of the circuit board interconnections using software running on IBM computers Looking for partners to produce the circuits they found Motorola was interested in doing so as long as Amdahl would provide the routing software to them first Amdahl concluded they would take the software and not deliver the chips After talking to National Semiconductor and Texas Instruments with no result they finally signed with Advanced Memory Systems br The company found it extremely difficult to arrange funding for development Much of this was due to the venture capital industry s feeling that attempting to compete with IBM was doomed RCA had spent billions developing and marketing their Spectra series and had yet to come close to a profit while Xerox had attempted a different attack by buying Scientific Data Systems and was suffering as a result The effort was saved by Amdahl s relationship with Fujitsu which allowed him to arrange a meeting with their high ranking engineers After three days of intensive meetings their lead engineer had enough and said they were going to invest million This news prompted a surprise investment of the same amount from Nixdorf Worried this would dilute their influence Fujitsu then invested another million The company was officially launched in br br br series br br During this period IBM announced their new System series These were initially at least System s with new electronics that allowed them to run faster and be less expensive in comparison to the s they replaced Amdahl s new target was to offer a lower cost version of the high end member of the family Amdahl felt that this would trap IBM in their own pricing structure if they lowered the cost of their high end machine they would be forced to lower the cost of their lower end offerings where they made much of their profit The new machines were given the name br Amdahl engineers working with Fujitsu circuit designers developed unique air cooled chips which were based on high speed emitter coupled logic ECL circuit macros These chips were packaged in a chip package with a heat dissipating cooling attachment consisting of a cylindrical arrangement of fins similar to the heat dissipating fins on a motorcycle engine mounted directly on the top of the chip This patented technology allowed the Amdahl mainframes of this era to be completely air cooled unlike IBM systems that required chilled water and its supporting infrastructure br Originally designed for a by arrangement of components on a card during development this evolved into a by array on multi layer cards up to layers which were then mounted in vertical columns in the computer chassis The cards had eight connectors attached to micro coaxial cables that interconnected the system components A conventional backplane was not used in the central processing units The card columns held at least three cards per side two per column in rare exceptions such as the processor s C Unit Each column had two large Tarzan fans a pusher and a puller to move the considerable amount of air needed to cool the chips Each system included a Data General Nova programmed to support the CRT console and to accept the same channel command operations as the IBM on the and br At the time the lacked virtual memory which was criticized in the computer press In IBM announced a new series of systems that would include this feature which they referred to as dynamic address translation Amdahl modified their design to match becoming the V for virtual The machine began to take form in after several manufacturing issues were resolved The machine was about twice as fast as the contemporary at about the same price It also occupied one third as much floor space and as it lacked the water cooling system it was much easier to install and maintain br The first V machine serial number was delivered to NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in June It was installed and commissioned in five days compared to the two or three weeks required for similar IBM machines The second was delivered to the University of Michigan Texas A M received theirs in October and Computer Usage Corporation in November By August systems had been installed and the production line had to be expanded from four to six machines a month br For the next quarter century Amdahl and IBM competed aggressively against one another in the high end mainframe market At its peak Amdahl had a market share Amdahl owed some of its success to antitrust settlements between IBM and the U S Department of Justice which ensured that Amdahl s customers could license IBM s mainframe software under reasonable terms The machines could also use any or peripheral and while IBM initially refused to maintain these machines when connected to Amdahl systems they were eventually forced to when Amdahl began making a profit maintaining IBM hardware br br br Later s br In February Amdahl announced the V II which offered to percent greater performance but at a slightly higher cost The next month they announced the V a smaller system based on the same circuitry that offered about to percent of the performance of the II Customers could upgrade from the to the II at any time for Deliveries began in September At the same March announcement they also introduced the V as competition to the recently announced IBM system a re implementation of the series using newer circuitry and incorporating some ideas from the ASC project The first s shipped in August br The V first shipped in incorporated high speed KB cache memories to improve performance and the first real hardware based virtualization known as the Multiple Domain Facility br Amdahl also pioneered a variable speed feature the accelerator on the and systems that allowed the customer to run the CPUs at the higher level of performance of the and systems respectively when desired The customer was charged by the number of hours used Some at Amdahl thought this feature would anger customers but it became quite popular as customer management could now control expenses while still having greater performance available when necessary br br br series br br In the late s Amdahl began an effort to develop a next generation systems architecture under the project Both the Amdahl engineering teams and Fujitsu strongly suggested developing a multi processor architecture Gene Amdahl was against this and wanted to develop a faster single processor Things came to a head in and Amdahl left the company in August to start Trilogy Systems With Gene Amdahl s departure and increasing influence from Fujitsu Amdahl entered the large scale multiprocessor market in the mid s with the attached processor and full multiprocessor models br In the systems the chips were mounted in an by array on multi layer boards called Multi Chip Carriers MCCs that were positioned in high airflow for cooling The MCCs were mounted horizontally in a large rectangular frame The MCCs slid into a complex physical connection system The processor side panels interconnected the system providing clock propagation delays that maintained race free synchronous operation at relatively high clock frequencies ns base clock cycles This processor box was cooled by high speed fans generating horizontal airflow across the MCCs br Along the way Amdahl came to believe that its best bet at competing with IBM head to head was to bulk up in particular executing a merger with a well known vendor in the enterprise storage space Most Amdahl mainframe customers would purchase storage devices hard disk and tape drives from IBM or its plug compatible competitors Amdahl first attempted a merger with one of the largest of these vendors Memorex in After this deal fell through Amdahl went much further on a deal to merge with Colorado based Storage Technology Corporation STC The deal was approved by the boards of both companies and detailed plans were in place to implement the merger when Fujitsu an important partner and major shareholder of Amdahl at the time objected to the deal which forced it to collapse STC later tried to develop its own mainframe computer the failure of which contributed to it filing for Chapter bankruptcy in Around that same time Amdahl agreed to allow Fujitsu to acquire just under half of Amdahl leading to its ultimate acquisition of all of Amdahl s shares some years later br In the s Amdahl entered the IBM compatible peripherals business in front end processors and storage products shipping its first communications controller in August and its first DASD in August These products were very successful for a number of years with the support of Jack Lewis the former CEO of Amdahl The reliance upon a limited product line restricted to containment within the complex business of mainframes and their highly valuable peripherals constrained the company s hardware business when market forces shifted to x based processors This had been foreseen leading to an increasing emphasis on software and consulting services br br br Market exit br By the early s Amdahl was suffering losses of several hundred million dollars per quarter as a result of declining mainframe sales Management decided to lay off employees in in early and another out of the remaining later in that year as well as canceling hardware development projects in favor of reselling computers from Sun Microsystems br Amdahl perhaps enjoyed its best success during IBM s transition from bipolar to CMOS technology in the early to mid s The first generations of IBM s CMOS mainframe processors the IBM G and G could not perform as well as those from the Enterprise System family which were based on bipolar technology giving Amdahl a temporary advantage However IBM s CMOS strategy paid off in the long run allowing IBM s Poughkeepsie factory to produce even faster mainframes at a lower cost as the technology matured By the time IBM introduced its bit zSeries in Amdahl s hardware business could no longer compete with IBM with its Millennium and OmniFlex servers that only had bit addressing In late Fujitsu Amdahl announced that the company had no plans to invest the estimated US billion or more to create an IBM compatible bit system br Amdahl also failed in its effort to introduce its ObjectStar software initially known as Huron during this period and the product later became the object of a successful management buyout ObjectStar was subsequently acquired by the integration software vendor TIBCO in br br br Amdahl customer options br z OS is the last release of IBM s flagship operating system still able to run on bit mainframes including Amdahl and older IBM systems IBM effectively ended support for z OS on March In May IBM announced that the next version of z VSE Version would require a bit system signaling the end to bit support for that operating system z TPF which became available in December also requires a bit system The bit Linux distributions will survive as long as the open source community and distributors have an interest So while there is still some potential life for Amdahl s hardware the transition to bit systems is essentially complete Some companies and governments still had Amdahl systems performing useful work into mid and Fujitsu Amdahl promised support to those customers with replacement parts and other services through March br Arguably IBM did not have a suitable replacement model for many Amdahl customers until the May introduction of the zSeries The previous zSeries also became an attractive replacement for Amdahl machines by late as that model s typical used price fell below and continued to fall The System z BC model introduced in May increased IBM s attractiveness yet again and the BC drove z and z prices down even more The late introduction of the IBM System z BC yet again made IBM s equipment more enticing In fact Fujitsu Amdahl now sells used IBM mainframes and offers services to migrate customers to the IBM machines This migration is straightforward and comparable to upgrading from one IBM model to a newer IBM model The IBM z is the last z Systems server to support running an operating system in ESA architecture mode z and future machines will support only bit operating systems Other generally less attractive options include running without support rewriting applications or possibly running applications under FLEX ES FLEX ES is a mainframe instruction set emulator that supports ESA and in some cases z Architecture operating systems and software br The vestiges of Amdahl s ESA emulation project were resurrected under a new name Platform Solutions Inc Using capital from Intel Hewlett Packard Microsoft and other major investors they designed a line of Itanium based computers and software to emulate z Architecture machines so that they could run zSeries operating systems with zSeries channels for attaching real IBM equipment as well as virtual simulators for most hardware to minimize the need for IBM s peripheral equipment Its LPARs hosted not only IBM operating systems but bit Intel Itanium Linux HP UX Solaris and potentially other operating systems br Platform Solutions started shipping its machines in the first quarter of This action precipitated a lawsuit from IBM citing patent infringement and PSI s failure to negotiate a z Architecture license and IBM refused to license its operating systems and software on PSI s machines Platform Solutions countered that by tying the sale of its software to the sale of its hardware IBM was in violation of its prior anti trust agreement with the U S Justice Dept In July IBM acquired PSI and both companies dropped their lawsuits against each other PSI s machines are no longer available br br br Fujitsu GS br Fujitsu continues to sell its GlobalServer GS mainframe models in the Japanese domestic market The GS machines are essentially ESA bit instruction set processors largely based on Amdahl designed technologies but are only compatible with Fujitsu s domestic market operating systems OSIV MSP EX and OSIV XSP MSP is most similar to classic IBM MVS ESA and XSP is most similar to classic IBM VSE ESA Fujitsu GS mainframe hardware would most closely correspond to the late s IBM G or G mainframes in terms of their instruction set support Fujitsu has stated the company has no intention to license or implement z Architecture bit br Fujitsu will discontinue their GS mainframe with end of sale in and end of support in to promote customer modernization br br br See also br Amdahl UTS br IBM ESA br Magnuson
