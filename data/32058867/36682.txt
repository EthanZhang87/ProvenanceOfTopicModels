Linear predictive coding LPC is a method used mostly in audio signal processing and speech processing for representing the spectral envelope of a digital signal of speech in compressed form using the information of a linear predictive model br LPC is the most widely used method in speech coding and speech synthesis It is a powerful speech analysis technique and a useful method for encoding good quality speech at a low bit rate br br br Overview br LPC starts with the assumption that a speech signal is produced by a buzzer at the end of a tube for voiced sounds with occasional added hissing and popping sounds for voiceless sounds such as sibilants and plosives Although apparently crude this Source filter model is actually a close approximation of the reality of speech production The glottis the space between the vocal folds produces the buzz which is characterized by its intensity loudness and frequency pitch The vocal tract the throat and mouth forms the tube which is characterized by its resonances these resonances give rise to formants or enhanced frequency bands in the sound produced Hisses and pops are generated by the action of the tongue lips and throat during sibilants and plosives br LPC analyzes the speech signal by estimating the formants removing their effects from the speech signal and estimating the intensity and frequency of the remaining buzz The process of removing the formants is called inverse filtering and the remaining signal after the subtraction of the filtered modeled signal is called the residue br The numbers which describe the intensity and frequency of the buzz the formants and the residue signal can be stored or transmitted somewhere else LPC synthesizes the speech signal by reversing the process use the buzz parameters and the residue to create a source signal use the formants to create a filter which represents the tube and run the source through the filter resulting in speech br Because speech signals vary with time this process is done on short chunks of the speech signal which are called frames generally to frames per second give an intelligible speech with good compression br br br Early history br Linear prediction signal estimation goes back to at least the s when Norbert Wiener developed a mathematical theory for calculating the best filters and predictors for detecting signals hidden in noise Soon after Claude Shannon established a general theory of coding work on predictive coding was done by C Chapin Cutler Bernard M Oliver and Henry C Harrison Peter Elias in published two papers on predictive coding of signals br Linear predictors were applied to speech analysis independently by Fumitada Itakura of Nagoya University and Shuzo Saito of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone in and in by Bishnu S Atal Manfred R Schroeder and John Burg Itakura and Saito described a statistical approach based on maximum likelihood estimation Atal and Schroeder described an adaptive linear predictor approach Burg outlined an approach based on principle of maximum entropy br In Itakura and Saito introduced method based on partial correlation PARCOR Glen Culler proposed real time speech encoding and Bishnu S Atal presented an LPC speech coder at the Annual Meeting of the Acoustical Society of America In realtime LPC using bit LPC hardware was demonstrated by Philco Ford four units were sold LPC technology was advanced by Bishnu Atal and Manfred Schroeder during the s s In Atal and Vishwanath et al of BBN developed the first variable rate LPC algorithm The same year Atal and Manfred R Schroeder at Bell Labs proposed an LPC speech codec called adaptive predictive coding which used a psychoacoustic coding algorithm exploiting the masking properties of the human ear This later became the basis for the perceptual coding technique used by the MP audio compression format introduced in Code excited linear prediction CELP was developed by Schroeder and Atal in br LPC is the basis for voice over IP VoIP technology In Bob Kahn of ARPA with Jim Forgie of Lincoln Laboratory LL and Dave Walden of BBN Technologies started the first developments in packetized speech which would eventually lead to voice over IP technology In according to Lincoln Laboratory informal history the first real time bit s LPC was implemented by Ed Hofstetter In the first real time two way LPC packet speech communication was accomplished over the ARPANET at bit s between Culler Harrison and Lincoln Laboratory In the first LPC conference took place over the ARPANET using the Network Voice Protocol between Culler Harrison ISI SRI and LL at bit s br br br LPC coefficient representations br LPC is frequently used for transmitting spectral envelope information and as such it has to be tolerant of transmission errors Transmission of the filter coefficients directly see linear prediction for a definition of coefficients is undesirable since they are very sensitive to errors In other words a very small error can distort the whole spectrum or worse a small error might make the prediction filter unstable br There are more advanced representations such as log area ratios LAR line spectral pairs LSP decomposition and reflection coefficients Of these especially LSP decomposition has gained popularity since it ensures the stability of the predictor and spectral errors are local for small coefficient deviations br br br Applications br LPC is the most widely used method in speech coding and speech synthesis It is generally used for speech analysis and resynthesis It is used as a form of voice compression by phone companies such as in the GSM standard for example It is also used for secure wireless where voice must be digitized encrypted and sent over a narrow voice channel an early example of this is the US government s Navajo I br LPC synthesis can be used to construct vocoders where musical instruments are used as an excitation signal to the time varying filter estimated from a singer s speech This is somewhat popular in electronic music br Paul Lansky made the well known computer music piece notjustmoreidlechatter using linear predictive coding br A th order LPC was used in the popular s Speak Spell educational toy br LPC predictors are used in Shorten MPEG ALS FLAC SILK audio codec and other lossless audio codecs br LPC has received some attention as a tool for
