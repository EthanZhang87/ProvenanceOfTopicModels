disclosed in June allowing the ability to traverse to any external storage plugged in through the USB ports on the back of the router via the open internet Before making the vulnerability public the researcher was told by Asus that the behavior was not an issue but the vulnerability was reportedly patched shortly before the breach The IP addresses of routers and AiCloud accounts were also leaked

memory br Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in ASUS initially refused to join a widespread withdrawal of businesses from the Russian market In mid March the company did announce it was halting its operations in Russia following a social media boycott and government pressure br In April a post on the PCMasterRace subreddit began gaining popularity regarding the user s AMD Ryzen X D CPU which had visible burning along with the socket of the Asus motherboard This sparked the attention of both people interested in PCs who initially thought it was an issue with the D V Cache Technology as there had been previous user reports similar to this incident as well as enthusiast YouTube channels such as Gamers Nexus who ran tests to successfully recreate the burning of their CPU They realised that the cause of the burning was due to a voltage error in the BIOS In May Asus responded to the incidents by releasing a Beta BIOS which was supposed to fix the error However not only did the new BIOS not fix the issue by installing it the user voided their warranty as it was a Beta BIOS which Asus clearly stated in the BIOS s description Later that month Asus responded to the public backlash

disassembled state if it did not pay the repair fee Several days later Asus honoured the warranty and performed the repair of the original issue under pressure from Gamers Nexus as well as subsequently apologised for the poor service br br br See also br br ASRock br Biostar br DFI br Elitegroup Computer Systems br EVGA Corporation br Fastra II br Gigabyte Technology br Micro Star
