A telephone call or telephone conversation or telcon also known as a phone call or voice call or simply a call is a connection over a telephone network between the called party and the calling party Telephone calls started in the late th century As technology has improved a majority of telephone calls are made over a cellular network through mobile phones or over the internet with Voice over IP Telephone calls are typically used for real time conversation between two or more parties especially when the parties cannot meet in person br A telephone call historically was between two live people It has progressed to also include a live person and a recorded message or a live person with an AI generated message The term call is now broadly used for other connections over a network including audio calls and video calls when you are using your voice to communicate as opposed to typing text br br br First telephone call br The first telephone call was made on March by Alexander Graham Bell Bell demonstrated his ability to talk with electricity by transmitting a call to his assistant Thomas Watson The first words transmitted were Mr Watson come here I want to see you br This event has been called Bell s greatest success as it demonstrated the first successful use of the telephone Although it was his greatest success he refused to have a telephone in his own home because it was something he invented by mistake and saw it as a distraction from his main studies br br br Information transmission br A telephone call may carry ordinary voice transmission using a telephone data transmission when the calling party and called party are using modems or facsimile transmission when they are using fax machines The call may use land line mobile phone satellite phone or any combination thereof When a telephone call has more than one called party it is referred to as a conference call When two or more users of the network are sharing the same physical line it is called a party line or Rural phone line br br If the caller s wired phone is connected directly to the calling party when the caller takes their telephone off hook the calling party s phone will ring This is called a hot line or ringdown Otherwise the calling party is usually given a tone to indicate they should begin dialing the desired number In some now very rare cases if the calling party cannot dial calls directly they will be connected to an operator who places the call for them br Calls may be placed through a public network such as the Public Switched Telephone Network provided by a commercial telephone company or a private network called a Private branch exchange PBX In most cases a private network is connected to the public network in order to allow PBX users to dial the outside world Incoming calls to a private network arrive at the PBX in two ways either directly to a users phone using a DDI number or indirectly via a receptionist who will answer the call first and then manually put the caller through to the desired user on the PBX br Most telephone calls through the PSTN are set up using ISUP signalling messages or one of its variants between telephone exchanges to establish the end to end connection Calls through PBX networks are set up using QSIG DPNSS or variants br br br Costs br Some types of calls are not charged such as local calls and internal calls dialed directly by a telephone subscriber in Canada the United States Hong Kong United Kingdom Ireland or New Zealand Residential subscribers only In most other areas all telephone calls are charged a fee for the connection Fees depend on the provider of the service the type of service being used a call placed from a landline or wired telephone will have one rate and a call placed from a mobile telephone will have a different rate and the distance between the calling and the called parties In most circumstances the calling party pays this fee However in some circumstances such as a reverse charge or collect call the called party pays the cost of the call In some circumstances the caller pays a flat rate charge for the telephone connection and does not pay any additional charge for all calls made Telecommunication liberalization has been established in several countries to allows customers to keep their local phone provider and use an alternate provider for a certain call in order to save money br br br Placing a call br br A typical phone call using a traditional phone is placed by picking the phone handset up off the base and holding the handset so that the hearing end is next to the user s ear and the speaking end is within range of the mouth The caller then rotary dials or presses buttons for the phone number needed to complete the call and the call is routed to the phone which has that number The second phone makes a ringing noise to alert its owner while the user of the first phone hears a ringing noise in its earpiece If the second phone is picked up then the operators of the two units are able to talk to one another through them If the phone is not picked up the operator of the first phone continues to hear a ringing noise until they hang up their own phone br In addition to the traditional method of placing a telephone call new technologies allow different methods for initiating a telephone call such as voice dialing Voice over IP technology allows calls to be made through a PC using a service like Skype Other services such as toll free dial around enable callers to initiate a telephone call through a third party without exchanging phone numbers Originally no phone calls could be made without first talking to the Switchboard operator Using st century mobile phones does not require the use of an operator to complete a phone call br The use of headsets is becoming more common for placing or receiving a call Headsets can either come with a cord or be wireless br A special number can be dialed for operator assistance which may be different for local vs long distance or international calls br br br Details of operation br br The landline telephone contains a switchhook A and an alerting device usually a ringer A that remains connected to the phone line whenever the phone is on hook i e the switch A is open and other components which are connected when the phone is off hook The off hook components include a transmitter microphone A a receiver speaker A and other circuits for dialing filtering A and amplification br To place a telephone call the calling party picks up the telephone s handset thereby operating a lever that closes the hook switch A This powers the telephone by connecting the transmission hybrid transformer as well as the transmitter microphone and receiver speaker to the line In this off hook state the telephone circuitry has a low resistance of typically less than ohms which causes the flow of direct current DC in the line C from the telephone exchange The exchange detects this current attaches a digit receiver circuit to the line and sends dial tone to indicate its readiness On a modern push button telephone the caller then presses the number keys to send the telephone number of the destination the called party The keys control a tone generator circuit not shown that sends DTMF tones to the exchange A rotary dial telephone uses pulse dialing A sending electrical pulses that the exchange counts to decode each digit of the telephone number If the called party s line is available the terminating exchange applies an intermittent alternating current AC ringing signal of to volts to alert the called party of the incoming call If the called party s line is in use however the exchange returns a busy signal to the calling party If the called party s line is in use but subscribes to call waiting service the exchange sends an intermittent audible tone to the called party to indicate another call br The electromechanical ringer of a telephone A is connected to the line through a capacitor A which blocks direct current and passes the alternating current of the ringing power The telephone draws no current when it is on hook while a DC voltage is continually applied to the line Exchange circuitry D can send an alternating current down the line to activate the ringer and announce an incoming call In manual service exchange areas before dial service was installed telephones had hand cranked magneto generators to generate a ringing voltage back to the exchange or any other telephone on the same line When a landline telephone is inactive on hook the circuitry at the telephone exchange detects the absence of direct current to indicate that the line is not in use When a party initiates a call to this line the exchange sends the ringing signal When the called party picks up the handset they actuate a double circuit switchhook not shown which may simultaneously disconnect the alerting device and connect the audio circuitry to the line This in turn draws direct current through the line confirming that the called phone is now active The exchange circuitry turns off the ring signal and both telephones are now active and connected through the exchange The parties may now converse as long as both phones remain off hook When a party hangs up placing the handset back on the cradle or hook direct current ceases in that line signaling the exchange to disconnect the call br Calls to parties beyond the local exchange are carried over trunk lines which establish connections between exchanges In modern telephone networks fiber optic cable and digital technology are often employed in such connections Satellite technology may be used for communication over very long distances br In most landline telephones the transmitter and receiver microphone and speaker are located in the handset although in a speakerphone these components may be located in the base or in a separate enclosure Powered by the line the microphone A produces a modulated electric current which varies its frequency and amplitude in response to the sound waves arriving at its diaphragm The resulting current is transmitted along the telephone line to the local exchange then on to the other phone via the local exchange or via a larger network where it passes through the coil of the receiver A The varying current in the coil produces a corresponding movement of the receiver s diaphragm reproducing the original sound waves present at the transmitter br Along with the microphone and speaker additional circuitry is incorporated to prevent the incoming speaker signal and the outgoing microphone signal from interfering with each other This is accomplished through a hybrid coil A The incoming audio signal passes through a resistor A and the primary winding of the coil A which passes it to the speaker A Since the current path A A has a far lower impedance than the microphone A virtually all of the incoming signal passes through it and bypasses the microphone br At the same time the DC voltage across the line causes a DC current which is split between the resistor coil A A branch and the microphone coil A A branch The DC current through the resistor coil branch has no effect on the incoming audio signal But the DC current passing through the microphone is turned into AC in response to voice sounds which then passes through only the upper branch of the coil s A primary winding which has far fewer turns than the lower primary winding This causes a small portion of the microphone output to be fed back to the speaker while the rest of the AC goes out through the phone line br A lineman s handset is a telephone designed for testing the telephone network and may be attached directly to aerial lines and other infrastructure components br br br Tones br Preceding during and after a traditional telephone call is placed certain tones signify the progress and status of the telephone call br br a dial tone signifying that the system is ready to accept a telephone number and connect the call br either br a ringing tone signifying that the called party has yet to answer the telephone br a busy signal or engaged tone signifying that the called party s telephone is being used in a telephone call to another person or is off the hook though no number has been dialled i e the customer does not want to be disturbed br a fast busy signal also called reorder tone or overflow busy tone signifying that there is congestion in the telephone network or possibly that the calling subscriber has delayed too long in dialling all the necessary digits The fast busy signal is generally twice as fast as the normal busy signal br status tones such as STD notification tones to inform the caller that the telephone call is being trunk dialled at a greater cost to the calling party minute minder beeps to inform the caller of the relative duration of the telephone call on calls that are charged on a time basis and others br a tone sometimes the busy signal often the dial tone to signify that the called party has hung up br tones used by earlier inband telephone switching systems were simulated by a Red box or a blue box used by phone phreaks to illegally make or receive free trunk toll calls br off hook tone if the phone has been picked up but no number dialed for an extended period of time br Cell phones generally do not use dial tones because the technology used to transmit the dialed number is different from a landline br br br Unwanted calls br br Unsolicited telephone calls are a modern nuisance Common kinds of unwanted calls include prank calls telemarketing calls and obscene phone calls br Caller ID provides some protection against unwanted calls but can still be turned off by the calling party Even where end user Caller ID is not available calls are still logged both in billing records at the originating telco and via automatic number identification so the perpetrator s phone number can still be discovered in many cases However this does not provide complete protection harassers can use payphones in some cases automatic number identification itself can be spoofed or blocked and mobile telephone abusers can at some cost use throwaway phones or SIMs br br br Patents br Rabinow J U S patent Telephone call indicator November br br br See also br br Call completion br Call processing br Emergency telephone
