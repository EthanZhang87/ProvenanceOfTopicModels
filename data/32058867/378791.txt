Mastercard Inc stylized as MasterCard from to mastercard from to is an American multinational payment card services corporation headquartered in Purchase New York It offers a range of payment transaction processing and other related payment services such as travel related payments and bookings Throughout the world its principal business is to process payments between the banks of merchants and the card issuing banks or credit unions of the purchasers who use the Mastercard brand debit credit and prepaid cards to make purchases Mastercard has been publicly traded since br Mastercard originally Interbank then Master Charge was created by an alliance of several banks and regional bankcard associations in response to the BankAmericard issued by Bank of America which later became Visa and is still its biggest competitor Prior to its initial public offering Mastercard Worldwide was a cooperative owned by the more than financial institutions that issue its branded cards br br br History br Although BankAmericard s debut in September was a disaster it began to turn a profit by May Bank of America deliberately kept this information secret and allowed then widespread negative impressions to linger in order to ward off competition This strategy was successful until when BankAmericard s profitability had become far too big to hide From to there were only new credit cards introduced in the United States but from to approximately credit cards were introduced by banks large and small throughout the country These newcomers promptly banded together into regional bankcard associations br One reason why most banks chose to join forces was that at the time states limited the ability of banks to operate through branch locations while states entirely prohibited branch banking and required unit banking A unit bank can legally operate only at a single site and is thereby forced to remain very small By joining a regional bankcard association a unit bank could quickly add a credit card to its lineup of financial products and achieve economies of scale by outsourcing tedious back office tasks like card servicing to the association Such associations also enabled unit banks to aggregate their customer bases and merchant networks in order to make a credit card useful for both customers and merchants early credit cards had failed because they could only be used within a small radius around their respective issuing banks br In Karl H Hinke an executive vice president at Marine Midland Bank asked representatives of several other banks to meet him in Buffalo New York Marine Midland had just launched its own regional bankcard in the Upstate New York market after Bank of America declined its request for a BankAmericard regional license on the basis that Marine Midland was too big The result of the Buffalo meeting was that several banks and regional bankcard associations soon agreed to join forces as Interbankard Inc which then became the Interbank Card Association ICA By the end of ICA had members and Hinke became ICA s chairman Bank of America eventually joined MasterCard as well In the st century Bank of America would revive the BankAmericard brand name as a Mastercard credit card which it remains today br The Interbank branding in initially consisted only of a small unobtrusive lowercase i inside a circle in the lower right hand corner of the front of each Interbank card the rest of the card design was the prerogative of each issuing bank This tiny logo proved to be entirely unsatisfactory for creating nationwide brand awareness in order to compete against the established leader BankAmericard In Interbank developed a new national brand Master Charge The Interbank Card by combining the two overlapping yellow and orange circles of the Western States Bankcard Association with the Master Charge name coined by the First National Bank of Louisville Kentucky br That same year First National City Bank joined Interbank and merged its proprietary Everything Card with Master Charge br In the ICA and Eurocard started a strategic alliance which effectively allowed the ICA access to the European market and for Eurocard to be accepted on the ICA network The Access card system from the United Kingdom joined the ICA Eurocard alliance in br br In Master Charge The Interbank Card was renamed MasterCard br In MasterCard International Inc became the first bank to use holograms as part of their card security They acquired the Cirrus network of automated tellers in br In MasterCard took over the Access card the Access brand was then

due to the transfer of internal transactions to the Russian National Card Payment System br br br Finances br br As of Mastercard ranked on the Fortune list of the largest United States corporations by revenue br br br Market power br Operating a payment processing network entails risk of engaging in anticompetitive practices due to the many parties involved that is the customer and their bank and the merchant and their bank br Few companies have faced more antitrust lawsuits both in the US and abroad br br br United States br Mastercard along with Visa engaged in systematic parallel exclusion against American Express during the s and s Mastercard used exclusivity clauses in its contracts and blacklists to prevent banks from doing business with American Express Such exclusionary clauses and other written evidence were used by the United States Department of Justice in regulatory actions against Mastercard and Visa Discover has sued Mastercard for similar issues br Both Mastercard and Visa have paid approximately billion in damages resulting from a class action lawsuit filed in January for debit card swipe fee price fixing The litigation cites several retail giants as plaintiffs including Wal Mart Sears Roebuck Co and Safeway br In four million merchants sued Mastercard in federal court for making them accept debit cards if they wanted to accept credit cards and

federal judge entered an order granting preliminary approval to a proposed settlement to a class action lawsuit filed in by merchants and trade associations against Mastercard and Visa The suit was filed due to alleged price fixing practices employed by Mastercard and Visa About one fourth of the named class plaintiffs have decided to opt out of the settlement Opponents object to provisions that would bar future lawsuits and prevent merchants from opting out of significant portions of the proposed settlement br Plaintiffs allege that Visa Inc and Mastercard fixed interchange fees also known as swipe fees that are charged to merchants for the privilege of accepting payment cards In their complaint the plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unfairly interfere with merchants from encouraging customers to use less expensive forms of payment such as lower cost cards cash and checks br A settlement of billion got preliminary approval in November A settlement of B was approved in Certain merchants appealed the settlement and were heard The case is ongoing as of October br br br Antitrust settlement with U S Justice Department br In October Mastercard and Visa reached a settlement with the U S Justice Department in another antitrust case The companies agreed to allow merchants displaying their logos to decline certain types of cards because interchange fees differ or to offer consumers discounts for using cheaper cards br br br ATM operators br Mastercard along with Visa has been sued in a class action by ATM operators that claim the credit card networks rules effectively fix ATM access fees The suit claims that this is a restraint of trade in violation of federal law The lawsuit was filed by the National ATM Council and independent operators of automated teller machines More specifically it is alleged that Mastercard s and Visa s network rules prohibit ATM operators from offering lower prices for transactions over PIN debit networks that are not affiliated with Visa or Mastercard The suit says that this price fixing artificially raises the price that consumers pay using ATMs limits the revenue that ATM operators earn and violates the Sherman Act s prohibition against unreasonable restraints of trade Johnathan Rubin an attorney for the plaintiffs said Visa and Mastercard are the ringleaders organizers and enforcers of a conspiracy among U S banks to fix the price of ATM access fees in order to keep the competition at bay br br br Oceania br In the Reserve Bank of Australia required that interchange fees be dramatically reduced from about of the transaction to approximately One notable result has been the reduced use of reward cards and increased use of debit cards Australia also prohibited the no surcharge rule a policy established by credit card networks like Visa and Mastercard to prevent merchants from charging a credit card usage fee to the cardholder A surcharge would mitigate or even exceed the merchant discount paid by a merchant but would also make the cardholder more reluctant to use the card as the method of payment Australia has also made changes to the interchange rates on debit cards and has considered abolishing interchange fees altogether br As of November New Zealand was considering similar actions following a Commerce Commission lawsuit alleging price fixing by Visa and Mastercard In New Zealand merchants pay a fee on every credit card transaction br br br Europe br The European Union has repeatedly criticized Mastercard for monopolistic trade practices In April Mastercard reached

citizens to a European corporation could apparently be blocked by the United States and called for a further reduction in the dominance of Visa and Mastercard in the European payment system br In Mastercard was under investigation by the European Union for the high fees it charged merchants to accept cards issued outside the EU compared to cards issued in the EU as well as other anti competitive practices that could hinder electronic commerce and international trade and high fees associated with premium credit cards The EU s competition regulator said that these fees were of special concern because of the growing role of non cash payments Mastercard was banned from charging fees on cross border transactions conducted wholly within the EU via a ruling by the European Commission in The European Commission said that their investigation also included large differences in fees across national borders For instance a payment might cost in the Netherlands but eight times that amount in Poland The Commission argues that Mastercard rules that prohibit merchants from enjoying better terms offered in other EU countries may be against antitrust law br The European Consumer Organisation BEUC praised the action against Mastercard BEUC said interbank fees push up prices and hurt consumers BEUC Director General Monique Goyens said So in the end all consumers are hit by a scheme which ultimately rewards the card company and issuing bank br In January the European Commission imposed an antitrust fine of on Mastercard for obstructing merchants access to cross border card payment services due to Mastercard s rules obliging acquiring banks to apply the interchange fees of the country where a retailer was located The Commission concluded that Mastercard s rules prevented retailers from benefitting from lower fees and restricted competition between banks cross border in breach of EU antitrust rules The infringement of antitrust rules ended when Mastercard amended its rules due to the entering into force of the Interchange Fee Regulation in which introduced caps on interchange fees The Commission did grant Mastercard a reduction of the fine however in return for

Circuit sided with Mastercard The Fifth Circuit also clarified the application of the Wire Act to illegal online gambling The Court determined that the wire act only applied to gambling activities related to a sporting event or contest Therefore the court could not conclude that Mastercard had violated the Wire Act br When PASPA was overturned May Mastercard had to provide new guidance to its member banks It clarified that state location restrictions apply to the individual placing the wager not the member bank processing the transaction According to various state gaming laws sports
