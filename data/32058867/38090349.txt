EdgeRank is the name commonly given to the algorithm that Facebook uses to determine what articles should be displayed in a user s News Feed As of Facebook has stopped using the EdgeRank system and uses a machine learning algorithm that as of takes more than factors into account br EdgeRank was developed and implemented by Serkan Piantino br br br Formula and factors br In a simplified version of the EdgeRank algorithm was presented as br br br br br br br br br e br d br g br e br s br br br e br br br br u br br e br br br br w br br e br br br br d br br e br br br br br displaystyle sum mathrm edges e u e w e d e br br br where br br br br br br u br br e br br br br br displaystyle u e br br is user affinity br br br br br br w br br e br br br br br displaystyle w e br br is how the content is weighted br br br br br br d br br e br br br br br displaystyle d e br br is a time based decay parameter br User Affinity The User Affinity part of the algorithm in Facebook s EdgeRank looks at the relationship and proximity of the user and the content post status update br Content Weight What action was taken by the user on the content br Time Based Decay Parameter New or old Newer posts tend to hold a higher place than older posts br Some of the methods that Facebook uses to adjust the parameters are proprietary and not available to the public br A study has shown that it is possible to hypothesize a disadvantage of the like reaction and advantages of other interactions e g the haha reaction or comments in content algorithmic ranking on Facebook The like button can decrease the organic reach as a brake effect of viral reach The haha reaction comments and the love reaction could achieve the highest increase in total organic reach br br br Impact br EdgeRank and its successors have a broad impact on what users actually see out of what they ostensibly follow for instance the selection can produce a filter bubble if users are exposed to updates which confirm their opinions etc or alter people s mood if users are shown a disproportionate amount of positive or negative updates br As a result for Facebook pages the typical engagement rate is less than or less than for the bigger ones and organic reach or less for most non profits br As a consequence for pages it may be nearly impossible to reach any significant audience without paying to promote their content br br br See also br PageRank the ranking algorithm used by Google s search engine br br br br br br External links br edgerank net br Facebook How News Feed Works
