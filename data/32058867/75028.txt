title: Voice over IP
id: 75028
Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP also called IP telephony is a method and group of technologies for voice calls for the delivery of voice communication sessions over Internet Protocol IP networks such as the Internet br The broader terms Internet telephony broadband telephony and broadband phone service specifically refer to the provisioning of voice and other communications services fax SMS voice messaging over the Internet rather than via the public switched telephone network PSTN also known as plain old telephone service POTS br br br Overview br The steps and principles involved in originating VoIP telephone calls are similar to traditional digital telephony and involve signaling channel setup digitization of the analog voice signals and encoding Instead of being transmitted over a circuit switched network the digital information is packetized and transmission occurs as IP packets over a packet switched network They transport media streams using special media delivery protocols that encode audio and video with audio codecs and video codecs Various codecs exist that optimize the media stream based on application requirements and network bandwidth some implementations rely on narrowband and compressed speech while others support high fidelity stereo codecs br The most widely used speech coding standards in VoIP are based on the linear predictive coding LPC and modified discrete cosine transform MDCT compression methods Popular codecs include the MDCT based AAC LD used in FaceTime the LPC MDCT based Opus used in WhatsApp the LPC based SILK used in Skype law and A law versions of G G and an open source voice codec known as iLBC a codec that uses only kbit s each way called G br Early providers of voice over IP services used business models and offered technical solutions that mirrored the architecture of the legacy telephone network Second generation providers such as Skype built closed networks for private user bases offering the benefit of free calls and convenience while potentially charging for access to other communication networks such as the PSTN This limited the freedom of users to mix and match third party hardware and software Third generation providers such as Google Talk adopted the concept of federated VoIP These solutions typically allow dynamic interconnection between users in any two domains of the Internet when a user wishes to place a call br In addition to VoIP phones VoIP is also available on many personal computers and other Internet access devices Calls and SMS text messages may be sent via Wi Fi or the carrier s mobile data network VoIP provides a framework for consolidation of all modern communications technologies using a single unified communications system br br br Protocols br Voice over IP has been implemented with proprietary protocols and protocols based on open standards in applications such as VoIP phones mobile applications and web based communications br A variety of functions are needed to implement VoIP communication Some protocols perform multiple functions while others perform only a few and must be used in concert These functions include br br Network and transport Creating reliable transmission over unreliable protocols which may involve acknowledging receipt of data and retransmitting data that wasn t received br Session management Creating and managing a session sometimes glossed as simply a call which is a connection between two or more peers that provides a context for further communication br Signaling Performing registration advertising one s presence and contact information and discovery locating someone and obtaining their contact information dialing including reporting call progress negotiating capabilities and call control such as hold mute transfer forwarding dialing DTMF keys during a call e g to interact with an automated attendant or IVR etc br Media description Determining what type of media to send audio video etc how to encode decode it and how to send receive it IP addresses ports etc br Media Transferring the actual media in the call such as audio video text messages files etc br Quality of service Providing out of band content or feedback about the media such as synchronization statistics etc br Security Implementing access control verifying the identity of other participants computers or people and encrypting data to protect the privacy and integrity of the media contents and or the control messages br VoIP protocols include br br Matrix open standard for online chat voice over IP and videotelephony br Session Initiation Protocol SIP connection management protocol developed by the IETF br H one of the first VoIP call signaling and control protocols that found widespread implementation Since the development of newer less complex protocols such as MGCP and SIP H deployments are increasingly limited to carrying existing long haul network traffic br Media Gateway Control Protocol MGCP connection management for media gateways br H control protocol for media gateways across a converged internetwork consisting of the traditional PSTN and modern packet networks br Real time Transport Protocol RTP transport protocol for real time audio and video data br Real time Transport Control Protocol RTCP sister protocol for RTP providing stream statistics and status information br Secure Real time Transport Protocol SRTP encrypted version of RTP br Session Description Protocol SDP a syntax for session initiation and announcement for multi media communications and WebSocket transports br Inter Asterisk eXchange IAX protocol used between Asterisk PBX instances br Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol XMPP instant messaging presence information and contact list maintenance br Jingle for peer to peer session control in XMPP br Skype protocol proprietary Internet telephony protocol suite based on peer to peer architecture br br br Adoption br br br Consumer market br br Mass market VoIP services use existing broadband Internet access by which subscribers place and receive telephone calls in much the same manner as they would via the PSTN Full service VoIP phone companies provide inbound and outbound service with direct inbound dialing Many offer unlimited domestic calling and sometimes international calls for a flat monthly subscription fee Phone calls between subscribers of the same provider are usually free when flat fee service is not available br A VoIP phone is necessary to connect to a VoIP service provider This can be implemented in several ways br br Dedicated VoIP phones connect directly to the IP network using technologies such as wired Ethernet or Wi Fi These are typically designed in the style of traditional digital business telephones br An analog telephone adapter connects to the network and implements the electronics and firmware to operate a conventional analog telephone attached through a modular phone jack Some residential Internet gateways and cable modems have this function built in br Softphone application software installed on a networked computer that is equipped with a microphone and speaker or headset The application typically presents a dial pad and display field to the user to operate the application by mouse clicks or keyboard input br br br PSTN and mobile network providers br It is increasingly common for telecommunications providers to use VoIP telephony over dedicated and public IP networks as a backhaul to connect switching centers and to interconnect with other telephony network providers this is often referred to as IP backhaul br Smartphones may have SIP clients built into the firmware or available as an application download br br br Corporate use br Because of the bandwidth efficiency and low costs that VoIP technology can provide businesses are migrating from traditional copper wire telephone systems to VoIP systems to reduce their monthly phone costs In of all new Private branch exchange PBX lines installed internationally were VoIP For example in the United States the Social Security Administration is converting its field offices of workers from traditional phone installations to a VoIP infrastructure carried over its existing data network br VoIP allows both voice and data communications to be run over a single network which can significantly reduce infrastructure costs The prices of extensions on VoIP are lower than for PBX and key systems VoIP switches may run on commodity hardware such as personal computers Rather than closed architectures these devices rely on standard interfaces VoIP devices have simple intuitive user interfaces so users can often make simple system configuration changes Dual mode phones enable users to continue their conversations as they move between an outside cellular service and an internal Wi Fi network so that it is no longer necessary to carry both a desktop phone and a cell phone Maintenance becomes simpler as there are fewer devices to oversee br VoIP solutions aimed at businesses have evolved into unified communications services that treat all communications phone calls faxes voice mail e mail web conferences and more as discrete units that can all be delivered via any means and to any handset including cellphones Two kinds of service providers are operating in this space one set is focused on VoIP for medium to large enterprises while another is targeting the small to medium business SMB market br Skype which originally marketed itself as a service among friends has begun to cater to businesses providing free of charge connections between any users on the Skype network and connecting to and from ordinary PSTN telephones for a charge br br br Delivery mechanisms br In general the provision of VoIP telephony systems to organizational or individual users can be divided into two primary delivery methods private or on premises solutions or externally hosted solutions delivered by third party providers On premises delivery methods are more akin to the classic PBX deployment model for connecting an office to local PSTN networks br While many use cases still remain for private or on premises VoIP systems the wider market has been gradually shifting toward Cloud or Hosted VoIP solutions Hosted systems are also generally better suited to smaller or personal use VoIP deployments where a private system may not be viable for these scenarios br br br Hosted VoIP systems br Hosted or Cloud VoIP solutions involve a service provider or telecommunications carrier hosting the telephone system as a software solution within their own infrastructure br Typically this will be one or more data centers with geographic relevance to the end user s of the system This infrastructure is external to the user of the system and is deployed and maintained by the service provider br Endpoints such as VoIP telephones or softphone applications apps running on a computer or mobile device will connect to the VoIP service remotely These connections typically take place over public internet links such as local fixed WAN breakout or mobile carrier service br br br Private VoIP systems br br In the case of a private VoIP system the primary telephony system itself is located within the private infrastructure of the end user organization Usually the system will be deployed on premises at a site within the direct control of the organization This can provide numerous benefits in terms of QoS control see below cost scalability and ensuring privacy and security of communications traffic However the responsibility for ensuring that the VoIP system remains performant and resilient is predominantly vested in the end user organization This is not the case with a Hosted VoIP solution br Private VoIP systems can be physical hardware PBX appliances converged with other infrastructure or they can be deployed as software applications Generally the latter two options will be in the form of a separate virtualized appliance However in some scenarios these systems are deployed on bare metal infrastructure or IoT devices With some solutions such as CX companies can attempt to blend the benefits of hosted and private on premises systems by implementing their own private solution but within an external environment Examples can include data center collocation services public cloud or private cloud locations br For on premises systems local endpoints within the same location typically connect directly over the LAN For remote and external endpoints available connectivity options mirror those of Hosted or Cloud VoIP solutions br However VoIP traffic to and from the on premises systems can often also be sent over secure private links Examples include personal VPN site to site VPN private networks such as MPLS and SD WAN or via private SBCs Session Border Controllers While exceptions and private peering options do exist it is generally uncommon for those private connectivity methods to be provided by Hosted or Cloud VoIP providers br br br Quality of service br Communication on the IP network is perceived as less reliable in contrast to the circuit switched public telephone network because it does not provide a network based mechanism to ensure that data packets are not lost and are delivered in sequential order It is a best effort network without fundamental quality of service QoS guarantees Voice and all other data travels in packets over IP networks with fixed maximum capacity This system may be more prone to data loss in the presence of congestion than traditional circuit switched systems a circuit switched system of insufficient capacity will refuse new connections while carrying the remainder without impairment while the quality of real time data such as telephone conversations on packet switched networks degrades dramatically Therefore VoIP implementations may face problems with latency packet loss and jitter br By default network routers handle traffic on a first come first served basis Fixed delays cannot be controlled as they are caused by the physical distance the packets travel They are especially problematic when satellite circuits are involved because of the long distance to a geostationary satellite and back delays of ms are typical Latency can be minimized by marking voice packets as being delay sensitive with QoS methods such as DiffServ br Network routers on high volume traffic links may introduce latency that exceeds permissible thresholds for VoIP Excessive load on a link can cause congestion and associated queueing delays and packet loss This signals a transport protocol like TCP to reduce its transmission rate to alleviate the congestion But VoIP usually uses UDP not TCP because recovering from congestion through retransmission usually entails too much latency So QoS mechanisms can avoid the undesirable loss of VoIP packets by immediately transmitting them ahead of any queued bulk traffic on the same link even when the link is congested by bulk traffic br VoIP endpoints usually have to wait for the completion of transmission of previous packets before new data may be sent Although it is possible to preempt abort a less important packet in mid transmission this is not commonly done especially on high speed links where transmission times are short even for maximum sized packets An alternative to preemption on slower links such as dialup and digital subscriber line DSL is to reduce the maximum transmission time by reducing the maximum transmission unit But since every packet must contain protocol headers this increases relative header overhead on every link traversed br The receiver must resequence IP packets that arrive out of order and recover gracefully when packets arrive too late or not at all Packet delay variation results from changes in queuing delay along a given network path due to competition from other users for the same transmission links VoIP receivers accommodate this variation by storing incoming packets briefly in a playout buffer deliberately increasing latency to improve the chance that each packet will be on hand when it is time for the voice engine to play it The added delay is thus a compromise between excessive latency and excessive dropout i e momentary audio interruptions br Although jitter is a random variable it is the sum of several other random variables that are at least somewhat independent the individual queuing delays of the routers along the Internet path in question Motivated by the central limit theorem jitter can be modeled as a Gaussian random variable This suggests continually estimating the mean delay and its standard deviation and setting the playout delay so that only packets delayed more than several standard deviations above the mean will arrive too late to be useful In practice the variance in latency of many Internet paths is dominated by a small number often one of relatively slow and congested bottleneck links Most Internet backbone links are now so fast e g Gbit s that their delays are dominated by the transmission medium e g optical fiber and the routers driving them do not have enough buffering for queuing delays to be significant br A number of protocols have been defined to support the reporting of quality of service QoS and quality of experience QoE for VoIP calls These include RTP Control Protocol RTCP extended reports SIP RTCP summary reports H Annex B for H H and MGCP extensions br The RTCP extended report VoIP metrics block specified by RFC is generated by an VoIP phone or gateway during a live call and contains information on packet loss rate packet discard rate because of jitter packet loss discard burst metrics burst length density gap length density network delay end system delay signal noise echo level mean opinion scores MOS and R factors and configuration information related to the jitter buffer VoIP metrics reports are exchanged between IP endpoints on an occasional basis during a call and an end of call message sent via SIP RTCP summary report or one of the other signaling protocol extensions VoIP metrics reports are intended to support real time feedback related to QoS problems the exchange of information between the endpoints for improved call quality calculation and a variety of other applications br br br DSL and ATM br DSL modems typically provide Ethernet connections to local equipment but inside they may actually be Asynchronous Transfer Mode ATM modems They use ATM Adaptation Layer AAL to segment each Ethernet packet into a series of byte ATM cells for transmission reassembling them back into Ethernet frames at the receiving end br Using a separate virtual circuit identifier VCI for voice over IP has the potential to reduce latency on shared connections ATM s potential for latency reduction is greatest on slow links because worst case latency decreases with increasing link speed A full size byte Ethernet frame takes ms to transmit at kbit s but only ms at Mbit s If this is the bottleneck link this latency is probably small enough to ensure good VoIP performance without MTU reductions or multiple ATM VCs The latest generations of DSL VDSL and VDSL carry Ethernet without intermediate ATM AAL layers and they generally support IEEE p priority tagging so that VoIP can be queued ahead of less time critical traffic br ATM has substantial header overhead roughly twice the total header overhead of a byte Ethernet frame This ATM tax is incurred by every DSL user whether or not they take advantage of multiple virtual circuits and few can br br br Layer br Several protocols are used in the data link layer and physical layer for quality of service mechanisms that help VoIP applications work well even in the presence of network congestion Some examples include br br IEEE e is an approved amendment to the IEEE standard that defines a set of quality of service enhancements for wireless LAN applications through modifications to the media access control MAC layer The standard is considered of critical importance for delay sensitive applications such as voice over wireless IP br IEEE p defines different classes of service including one dedicated to voice for traffic on layer wired Ethernet br The ITU T G hn standard which provides a way to create a high speed up to gigabit per second Local area network LAN using existing home wiring power lines phone lines and coaxial cables G hn provides QoS by means of Contention Free Transmission Opportunities CFTXOPs which are allocated to flows such as a VoIP call that require QoS and which have negotiated a contract with the network controllers br br br Performance metrics br The quality of voice transmission is characterized by several metrics that may be monitored by network elements and by the user agent hardware or software Such metrics include network packet loss packet jitter packet latency delay post dial delay and echo The metrics are determined by VoIP performance testing and monitoring br br br PSTN integration br br A VoIP media gateway controller aka Class Softswitch works in cooperation with a media gateway aka IP Business Gateway and connects the digital media stream so as to complete the path for voice and data Gateways include interfaces for connecting to standard PSTN networks Ethernet interfaces are also included in the modern systems which are specially designed to link calls that are passed via VoIP br E is a global numbering standard for both the PSTN and public land mobile network PLMN Most VoIP implementations support E to allow calls to be routed to and from VoIP subscribers and the PSTN PLMN VoIP implementations can also allow other identification techniques to be used For example Skype allows subscribers to choose Skype names usernames whereas SIP implementations can use Uniform Resource Identifier URIs similar to email addresses Often VoIP implementations employ methods of translating non E identifiers to E numbers and vice versa such as the Skype In service provided by Skype and the E number to URI mapping ENUM service in IMS and SIP br Echo can also be an issue for PSTN integration Common causes of echo include impedance mismatches in analog circuitry and an acoustic path from the receive to transmit signal at the receiving end br br br Number portability br Local number portability LNP and mobile number portability MNP also impact VoIP business Number portability is a service that allows a subscriber to select a new telephone carrier without requiring a new number to be issued Typically it is the responsibility of the former carrier to map the old number to the undisclosed number assigned by the new carrier This is achieved by maintaining a database of numbers A dialed number is initially received by the original carrier and quickly rerouted to the new carrier Multiple porting references must be maintained even if the subscriber returns to the original carrier The Federal Communications Commission FCC mandates carrier compliance with these consumer protection stipulations In November the FCC in the United States released an order extending number portability obligations to interconnected VoIP providers and carriers that support VoIP providers br A voice call originating in the VoIP environment also faces least cost routing LCR challenges to reach its destination if the number is routed to a mobile phone number on a traditional mobile carrier LCR is based on checking the destination of each telephone call as it is made and then sending the call via the network that will cost the customer the least This rating is subject to some debate given the complexity of call routing created by number portability With MNP in place LCR providers can no longer rely on using the network root prefix to determine how to route a call Instead they must now determine the actual network of every number before routing the call br Therefore VoIP solutions also need to handle MNP when routing a voice call In countries without a central database like the UK it may be necessary to query the mobile network about which home network a mobile phone number belongs to As the popularity of VoIP increases in the enterprise markets because of LCR options VoIP needs to provide a certain level of reliability when handling calls br br br Emergency calls br A telephone connected to a land line has a direct relationship between a telephone number and a physical location which is maintained by the telephone company and available to emergency responders via the national emergency response service centers in form of emergency subscriber lists When an emergency call is received by a center the location is automatically determined from its databases and displayed on the operator console br In IP telephony no such direct link between location and communications end point exists Even a provider having wired infrastructure such as a DSL provider may know only the approximate location of the device based on the IP address allocated to the network router and the known service address Some ISPs do not track the automatic assignment of IP addresses to customer equipment br IP communication provides for device mobility For example a residential broadband connection may be used as a link to a virtual private network of a corporate entity in which case the IP address being used for customer communications may belong to the enterprise not the residential ISP Such off premises extensions may appear as part of an upstream IP PBX On mobile devices e g a G handset or USB wireless broadband adapter the IP address has no relationship with any physical location known to the telephony service provider since a mobile user could be anywhere in a region with network coverage even roaming via another cellular company br At the VoIP level a phone or gateway may identify itself by its account credentials with a Session Initiation Protocol SIP registrar In such cases the Internet telephony service provider ITSP knows only that a particular user s equipment is active Service providers often provide emergency response services by agreement with the user who registers a physical location and agrees that if an emergency number is called from the IP device emergency services are provided to that address only br Such emergency services are provided by VoIP vendors in the United States by a system called Enhanced E based on the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act The VoIP E emergency calling system associates a physical address with the calling party s telephone number All VoIP providers that provide access to the public switched telephone network are required to implement E a service for which the subscriber may be charged VoIP providers may not allow customers to opt out of service The VoIP E system is based on a static table lookup Unlike in cellular phones where the location of an E call can be traced using assisted GPS or other methods the VoIP E information is accurate only if subscribers keep their emergency address information current br br br Fax support br Sending faxes over VoIP networks is sometimes referred to as Fax over IP FoIP Transmission of fax documents was problematic in early VoIP implementations as most voice digitization and compression codecs are optimized for the representation of the human voice and the proper timing of the modem signals cannot be guaranteed in a packet based connectionless network br A standards based solution for reliably delivering fax over IP is the T protocol The T protocol is designed to compensate for the differences between traditional packet less communications over analog lines and packet based transmissions which are the basis for IP communications The fax machine may be a standard device connected to an analog telephone adapter ATA or it may be a software application or dedicated network device operating via an Ethernet interface Originally T was designed to use UDP or TCP transmission methods across an IP network br Some newer high end fax machines have built in T capabilities which are connected directly to a network switch or router In T each packet contains a portion of the data stream sent in the previous packet Two successive packets have to be lost to actually lose data integrity br br br Power requirements br Telephones for traditional residential analog service are usually connected directly to telephone company phone lines which provide direct current to power most basic analog handsets independently of locally available electrical power The susceptibility of phone service to power failures is a common problem even with traditional analog service where customers purchase telephone units that operate with wireless handsets to a base station or that have other modern phone features such as built in voicemail or phone book features br VoIP phones and VoIP telephone adapters connect to routers or cable modems which typically depend on the availability of mains electricity or locally generated power Some VoIP service providers use customer premises equipment e g cable modems with battery backed power supplies to assure uninterrupted service for up to several hours in case of local power failures Such battery backed devices typically are designed for use with analog handsets Some VoIP service providers implement services to route calls to other telephone services of the subscriber such a cellular phone in the event that the customer s network device is inaccessible to terminate the call br br br Security br Secure calls are possible using standardized protocols such as Secure Real time Transport Protocol Most of the facilities of creating a secure telephone connection over traditional phone lines such as digitizing and digital transmission are already in place with VoIP It is necessary only to encrypt and authenticate the existing data stream Automated software such as a virtual PBX may eliminate the need for personnel to greet and switch incoming calls br The security concerns for VoIP telephone systems are similar to those of other Internet connected devices This means that hackers with knowledge of VoIP vulnerabilities can perform denial of service attacks harvest customer data record conversations and compromise voicemail messages Compromised VoIP user account or session credentials may enable an attacker to incur substantial charges from third party services such as long distance or international calling br The technical details of many VoIP protocols create challenges in routing VoIP traffic through firewalls and network address translators used to interconnect to transit networks or the Internet Private session border controllers are often employed to enable VoIP calls to and from protected networks Other methods to traverse NAT devices involve assistive protocols such as STUN and Interactive Connectivity Establishment ICE br Standards for securing VoIP are available in the Secure Real time Transport Protocol SRTP and the ZRTP protocol for analog telephony adapters as well as for some softphones IPsec is available to secure point to point VoIP at the transport level by using opportunistic encryption Though many consumer VoIP solutions do not support encryption of the signaling path or the media securing a VoIP phone is conceptually easier to implement using VoIP than on traditional telephone circuits A result of the lack of widespread support for encryption is that it is relatively easy to eavesdrop on VoIP calls when access to the data network is possible Free open source solutions such as Wireshark facilitate capturing VoIP conversations br Government and military organizations use various security measures to protect VoIP traffic such as voice over secure IP VoSIP secure voice over IP SVoIP and secure voice over secure IP SVoSIP The distinction lies in whether encryption is applied in the telephone endpoint or in the network Secure voice over secure IP may be implemented by encrypting the media with protocols such as SRTP and ZRTP Secure voice over IP uses Type encryption on a classified network such as SIPRNet Public Secure VoIP is also available with free GNU software and in many popular commercial VoIP programs via libraries such as ZRTP br In June the National Security Agency NSA released comprehensive documents describing the four attack planes of a communications system the network perimeter session controllers and endpoints and explaining security risks and mitigation techniques for each of them br br br Caller ID br Voice over IP protocols and equipment provide caller ID support that is compatible with the PSTN Many VoIP service providers also allow callers to configure custom caller ID information br br br Hearing aid compatibility br Wireline telephones which are manufactured in imported to or intended to be used in the US with Voice over IP service on or after February are required to meet the hearing aid compatibility requirements set forth by the Federal Communications Commission br br br Operational cost br VoIP has drastically reduced the cost of communication by sharing network infrastructure between data and voice A single broadband connection has the ability to transmit multiple telephone calls br br br Regulatory and legal issues br br As the popularity of VoIP grows governments are becoming more interested in regulating VoIP in a manner similar to PSTN services br Throughout the developing world particularly in countries where regulation is weak or captured by the dominant operator restrictions on the use of VoIP are often imposed including in Panama where VoIP is taxed Guyana where VoIP is prohibited In Ethiopia where the government is nationalizing telecommunication service it is a criminal offense to offer services using VoIP The country has installed firewalls to prevent international calls from being made using VoIP These measures were taken after the popularity of VoIP reduced the income generated by the state owned telecommunication company br br br Canada br In Canada the Canadian Radio television and Telecommunications Commission regulates telephone service including VoIP telephony service VoIP services operating in Canada are required to provide emergency service br br br European Union br In the European Union the treatment of VoIP service providers is a decision for each national telecommunications regulator which must use competition law to define relevant national markets and then determine whether any service provider on those national markets has significant market power and so should be subject to certain obligations A general distinction is usually made between VoIP services that function over managed networks via broadband connections and VoIP services that function over unmanaged networks essentially the Internet br The relevant EU Directive is not clearly drafted concerning obligations that can exist independently of market power e g the obligation to offer access to emergency calls and it is impossible to say definitively whether VoIP service providers of either type are bound by them br br br Arab states of the GCC br br br Oman br In Oman it is illegal to provide or use unauthorized VoIP services to the extent that web sites of unlicensed VoIP providers have been blocked Violations may be punished with fines of Omani Rial about US dollars a two year prison sentence or both In police raided Internet cafes throughout the country and arrested people for using or providing VoIP services br br br Saudi Arabia br In September Saudi Arabia lifted the ban on VoIPs in an attempt to reduce operational costs and spur digital entrepreneurship br br br United Arab Emirates br In the United Arab Emirates UAE it is illegal to provide or use unauthorized VoIP services Web sites of unlicensed VoIP providers have been blocked Some VoIP services such as Skype were allowed In January internet service providers in UAE blocked all VoIP apps including Skype but permitting only government approved VoIP apps C ME and BOTIM In opposition a petition on Change org garnered over signatures in response to which the website was blocked in UAE br On March the United Arab Emirates loosened restriction on VoIP services earlier prohibited in the country to ease communication during the COVID pandemic However popular instant messaging applications like WhatsApp Skype and FaceTime remained blocked from being used for voice and video calls constricting residents to use paid services from the country s state owned telecom providers br br br India br In India it is legal to use VoIP but it is illegal to have VoIP gateways inside India This effectively means that people who have PCs can use them to make a VoIP call to other computers but not to a normal phone number Foreign based VoIP server services are illegal to use in India br Internet telephony is permitted to the ISP with restrictions The following services are permitted br br PC to PC within or outside India br PC a device Adapter conforming to the standard of any international agencies like ITU or IETF etc in India to PSTN PLMN abroad br Any device Adapter conforming to standards of International agencies like ITU IETF etc connected to ISP node with static IP address to similar device Adapter within or outside India br Except whatever is described in condition ii above no other form of Internet Telephony is permitted br In India no Separate Numbering Scheme is provided to the Internet Telephony Presently the digit Numbering allocation based on E is permitted to the Fixed Telephony GSM CDMA wireless service For Internet Telephony the numbering scheme shall only conform to IP addressing Scheme of Internet Assigned Numbers Authority IANA Translation of E number private number to IP address allotted to any device and vice versa by ISP to show compliance with IANA numbering scheme is not permitted br The Internet Service Licensee is not permitted to have PSTN PLMN connectivity Voice communication to and from a telephone connected to PSTN PLMN and following E numbering is prohibited in India br br br South Korea br In South Korea only providers registered with the government are authorized to offer VoIP services Unlike many VoIP providers most of whom offer flat rates Korean VoIP services are generally metered and charged at rates similar to terrestrial calling Foreign VoIP providers encounter high barriers to government registration This issue came to a head in when Internet service providers providing personal Internet services by contract to United States Forces Korea USFK members residing on USFK bases threatened to block off access to VoIP services used by USFK members as an economical way to keep in contact with their families in the United States on the grounds that the service members VoIP providers were not registered A compromise was reached between USFK and Korean telecommunications officials in January wherein USFK service members arriving in Korea before June and subscribing to the ISP services provided on base could continue to use their US based VoIP subscription but later arrivals are required to use a Korean based VoIP provider which by contract will offer pricing similar to the flat rates offered by US VoIP providers br br br United States br In the United States the FCC requires all interconnected VoIP service providers to comply with requirements comparable to those for traditional telecommunications service providers VoIP operators in the US are required to support local number portability make service accessible to people with disabilities pay regulatory fees universal service contributions and other mandated payments and enable law enforcement authorities to conduct surveillance pursuant to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act CALEA br Operators of Interconnected VoIP fully connected to the PSTN are mandated to provide Enhanced service without special request provide for customer location updates clearly disclose any limitations on their E functionality to their consumers obtain affirmative acknowledgements of these disclosures from all consumers and may not allow their customers to opt out of service VoIP operators also receive the benefit of certain US telecommunications regulations including an entitlement to interconnection and exchange of traffic with incumbent local exchange carriers via wholesale carriers Providers of nomadic VoIP service those who are unable to determine the location of their users are exempt from state telecommunications regulation br Another legal issue that the US Congress is debating concerns changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act The issue in question is calls between Americans and foreigners The NSA is not authorized to tap Americans conversations without a warrant but the Internet and specifically VoIP does not draw as clear a line to the location of a caller or a call s recipient as the traditional phone system does As VoIP s low cost and flexibility convinces more and more organizations to adopt the technology surveillance for law enforcement agencies becomes more difficult VoIP technology has also increased federal security concerns because VoIP and similar technologies have made it more difficult for the government to determine where a target is physically located when communications are being intercepted and that creates a whole set of new legal challenges br br br History br The early developments of packet network designs by Paul Baran and other researchers were motivated by a desire for a higher degree of circuit redundancy and network availability in the face of infrastructure failures than was possible in the circuit switched networks in telecommunications of the mid twentieth century Danny Cohen first demonstrated a form of packet voice in which was developed into Network Voice Protocol which operated across the early ARPANET br On the early ARPANET real time voice communication was not possible with uncompressed pulse code modulation PCM digital speech packets which had a bit rate of kbps much greater than the kbps bandwidth of early modems The solution to this problem was linear predictive coding LPC a speech coding data compression algorithm that was first proposed by Fumitada Itakura of Nagoya University and Shuzo Saito of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone NTT in LPC was capable of speech compression down to kbps leading to the first successful real time conversation over ARPANET in between Culler Harrison Incorporated in Goleta California and MIT Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington Massachusetts LPC has since been the most widely used speech coding method Code excited linear prediction CELP a type of LPC algorithm was developed by Manfred R Schroeder and Bishnu S Atal in LPC algorithms remain an audio coding standard in modern VoIP technology br In the two decades following the demo various forms of packet telephony were developed and industry interest groups formed to support the new technologies Following the termination of the ARPANET project and expansion of the Internet for commercial traffic IP telephony was tested and deemed infeasible for commercial use until the introduction of VocalChat in the early s and then in Feb the official release of Internet Phone or iPhone for short commercial software by VocalTec based on a patent by Lior Haramaty and Alon Cohen and followed by other VoIP infrastructure components such as telephony gateways and switching servers Soon after it became an established area of interest in commercial labs of the major IT concerns notably at AT T where Marian Croak and her team filed many patents related to the technology By the late s the first softswitches became available and new protocols such as H MGCP and Session Initiation Protocol SIP gained widespread attention In the early s the proliferation of high bandwidth always on Internet connections to residential dwellings and businesses spawned an industry of Internet telephony service providers ITSPs The development of open source telephony software such as Asterisk PBX fueled widespread interest and entrepreneurship in voice over IP services applying new Internet technology paradigms such as cloud services to telephony br br br Milestones br Linear predictive coding
