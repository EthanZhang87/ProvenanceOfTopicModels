title: International Mobile Equipment Identity
id: 418118
The International Mobile Equipment Identity IMEI is a numeric identifier usually unique for GPP and iDEN mobile phones as well as some satellite phones It is usually found printed inside the battery compartment of the phone but can also be displayed on screen on most phones by entering the MMI Supplementary Service code on the dialpad or alongside other system information in the settings menu on smartphone operating systems br GSM networks use the IMEI number to identify valid devices and can stop a stolen phone from accessing the network For example if a mobile phone is stolen the owner can have their network provider use the IMEI number to blocklist the phone This renders the phone useless on that network and sometimes other networks even if the thief changes the phone s SIM card br Devices without a SIM card slot or eSIM capability usually do not have an IMEI code However the IMEI only identifies the device and has no particular relationship to the subscriber The phone identifies the subscriber by transmitting the International mobile subscriber identity IMSI number which is stored on a SIM card that can in theory be transferred to any handset However the network s ability to know a subscriber s current individual device enables many network and security features br Dual SIM enabled phones will have two IMEI numbers br br br IMEI and the law br Many countries have acknowledged the use of the IMEI in reducing the effect of mobile phone thefts For example in the United Kingdom under the Mobile Telephones Re programming Act changing the IMEI of a phone or possessing equipment that can change it is considered an offence under some circumstances br A bill was introduced in the United States by Senator Chuck Schumer in that would have made the changing of an IMEI illegal but the bill was not enacted br IMEI blocking is not the only way to fight phone theft Instead mobile operators are encouraged to take measures such as immediate suspension of service and replacement of SIM cards in case of loss or theft br The existence of a formally allocated IMEI number range for a GSM terminal does not mean that the terminal is approved or complies with regulatory requirements The linkage between regulatory approval and IMEI allocation was removed in April with the introduction of the European R TTE Directive Since that date IMEIs have been allocated by BABT or one of several other regional administrators acting on behalf of the GSM Association to legitimate GSM terminal manufacturers without the need to provide evidence of approval br br br Blocklists of stolen devices br When someone has their mobile equipment stolen or lost they can ask their service provider to block the phone from their network and the operator may do so especially if required by law If the local operator maintains an Equipment Identity Register EIR it adds the device IMEI to it Optionally it also adds the IMEI to shared registries such as the Central Equipment Identity Register CEIR which blocklists the device with other operators that use the CEIR This blocklisting makes the device unusable on any operator that uses the CEIR which makes mobile equipment theft pointless except for parts br To make blocklisting effective the IMEI number is supposed to be difficult to change However a phone s IMEI may be easy to change with special tools In addition IMEI is an un authenticated mobile identifier as opposed to IMSI which is routinely authenticated by home and serving mobile networks Using a spoofed IMEI can thwart some efforts to track handsets or target handsets for lawful intercept br Australia was the first nation to implement IMEI blocking across all GSM networks in In Australia the Electronic Information Exchange EIE Administration Node provides a blocked IMEI lookup service for Australian customers br In the UK a voluntary charter operated by the mobile networks ensures that any operator s blocklisting of a handset is communicated to the CEIR and subsequently to all other networks This ensures that the handset is quickly unusable for calls at most within hours br Some UK Police forces including the Metropolitan Police Service actively check IMEI numbers of phones found involved in crime br In New Zealand the NZ Telecommunications Forum Inc provides a blocked IMEI lookup service for New Zealand consumers The service allows up to three lookups per day and checks against a database that is updated daily by the three major mobile network operators A blocked IMEI cannot be connected to any of these three operators br In Latvia the SIA Datorikas instit ts DIVI provides a blocked IMEI lookup service for checks against a database that is updated by all major mobile network operators in Latvia br In some countries such blocklisting is not customary In major network companies in the United States under government pressure committed to introducing a blocklisting service but it s not clear whether it will interoperate with the CEIR GSM carriers AT T and T Mobile began blocking newly reported IMEIs in November Thefts reported prior to November were not added to the database The CTIA refers users to websites at www stolenphonechecker org and the GSMA where consumers can check whether a smartphone has been reported as lost or stolen to its member carriers The relationship between the former and any national or international IMEI blocklists is unclear br It is unclear whether local barring of IMEI has any positive effect as it may result in international smuggling of stolen phones br br br Limitations br IMEIs can sometimes be removed from a blocklist depending on local arrangements This would typically include quoting a password chosen at the time of blocklisting br br br Law enforcement and intelligence use br Law enforcement and intelligence services can use an IMEI number as input for tracking devices that are able to locate a cell phone with an accuracy of a few meters Saudi Arabian government agencies have reportedly used IMEI numbers retrieved from cell phone packaging to locate and detain women who fled Saudi Arabia s patriarchal society in other countries br An IMEI number retrieved from the remnants of a Nokia was used to trace and identify the perpetrators behind the Bali bombings br br br Allowlists br Some countries use allowlists instead of blocklists for IMEI numbers so that any mobile phone needs to be legally registered in the country in order to be able to access mobile networks of the country with possible exceptions for international roaming and a grace period for registering These include Chile Turkey Azerbaijan Colombia and Nepal Other countries that have adopted some form of mandatory IMEI registration include India Pakistan Indonesia Cambodia Thailand Iran Nigeria Ecuador Ukraine and Lebanon br Prior to their merger with T Mobile Sprint in the United States used an allowlist of devices where a user had to register their IMEI and SIM card before a device can be used despite no US law mandating it If a user changed their device they had to register their new IMEI and SIM card This isn t the case with other CDMA carriers like Verizon which only used allowlists for G and T Mobile does not use an allowlist but instead a blocklist including for former Sprint customers br AT T and Telus also use an allowlist for VoLTE access but do not require IMEI registration by customers Instead phone manufacturers are required to register their devices into AT T s or Telus databases and customers are able to freely swap SIM cards into any allowlisted device br br br Structure of the IMEI and IMEISV IMEI software version br The IMEI decimal digits digits plus a check digit or IMEISV decimal digits digits plus two software version digits includes information on the origin model and serial number of the device The structure of the IMEI SV is specified in GPP TS The model and origin comprise the initial digit portion of the IMEI SV known as the Type Allocation Code TAC The remainder of the IMEI is manufacturer defined with a Luhn check digit at the end For the IMEI format prior to the GSMA guideline was to have this Check Digit always transmitted to the network as zero This guideline seems to have disappeared for the format valid from onwards br As of the format of the IMEI is AA BBBBBB CCCCCC D although it may not always be displayed this way The IMEISV does not have the Luhn check digit but instead has two digits for the Software Version Number SVN making the format AA BBBBBB CCCCCC EE br br Prior to the TAC was six digits and followed by a two digit Final Assembly Code FAC which was a manufacturer specific code indicating the location of the device s construction br From January until April the FAC for all phones was br After April the Final Assembly Code ceased to exist and the Type Allocation Code increased to eight digits in length br In any of the above cases the first two digits of the TAC are the Reporting Body Identifier which identifies the GSMA approved group that allocated the TAC The RBI numbers are allocated by the Global Decimal Administrator IMEI numbers being decimal helps distinguish them from an MEID which is hexadecimal and always has xA or larger as the first two hexadecimal digits br For example the old style IMEI code or IMEISV code tells us the following br br TAC issued by the BABT code with the allocation number br FAC indicating the phone was made during the transition period when FACs were being removed br SNR uniquely identifying a unit of this model br CD so it is a GSM Phase or higher br SVN The software version number identifying the revision of the software installed on the phone is reserved br br By contrast the new style IMEI code has an digit TAC of br The new CDMA Mobile Equipment Identifier MEID uses the same basic format as the IMEI br br br Check digit computation br br The last number of the IMEI is a check digit calculated using the Luhn algorithm as defined in the IMEI Allocation and Approval Guidelines br br The Check Digit shall be calculated according to Luhn formula ISO IEC See GSM GPP The Check Digit is a function of all other digits in the IMEI The Software Version Number SVN of a mobile is not included in the calculation br The purpose of the Check Digit is to help guard against the possibility of incorrect entries to the CEIR and EIR equipment br The presentation of the Check Digit both electronically and in printed form on the label and packaging is very important Logistics using bar code reader and EIR CEIR administration cannot use the Check Digit unless it is printed outside of the packaging and on the ME IMEI Type Accreditation label br The check digit is not transmitted over the radio interface nor is it stored in the EIR database at any point Therefore all references to the last three or six digits of an IMEI refer to the actual IMEI number to which the check digit does not belong br br The check digit is validated in three steps br br Starting from the right double every other digit e g br Sum the digits e g br Check if the sum is divisible by br Conversely one can calculate the IMEI by choosing the check digit that would give a sum divisible by For the example IMEI br br To make the sum divisible by we set x so the complete IMEI becomes br br br Usage on satellite phone networks br The Broadband Global Area Network BGAN Iridium and Thuraya satellite phone networks all use IMEI numbers on their transceiver units as well as SIM cards in much the same way as GSM phones do The Iridium modem relies solely on its IMEI number for identification and uses no SIM card however Iridium is a proprietary network and the device is incompatible with terrestrial GSM networks br
