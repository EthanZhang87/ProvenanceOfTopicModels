Intel Corporation is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara California and incorporated in Delaware Intel designs manufactures and sells computer components and related products for business and consumer markets It is considered one of the world s largest semiconductor chip manufacturers by revenue and ranked in the Fortune list of the largest United States corporations by revenue for nearly a decade from to fiscal years until it was removed from the ranking in In it was reinstated and ranked th being the th largest technology company in the ranking br Intel supplies microprocessors for most manufacturers of computer systems and is one of the developers of the x series of instruction sets found in most personal computers PCs It also manufactures chipsets network interface controllers flash memory graphics processing units GPUs field programmable gate arrays FPGAs and other devices related to communications and computing Intel has a strong presence in the high performance general purpose and gaming PC market with its Intel Core line of CPUs whose high end models are among the fastest consumer CPUs as well as its Intel Arc series of GPUs The Open Source Technology Center at Intel hosts PowerTOP and LatencyTOP and supports other open source projects such as Wayland Mesa Threading Building Blocks TBB and Xen br Intel Integrated electronics was founded on July by semiconductor pioneers Gordon Moore of Moore s law and Robert Noyce along with investor Arthur Rock and is associated with the executive leadership and vision of Andrew Grove The company was a key component of the rise of Silicon Valley as a high tech center as well as being an early developer of SRAM and DRAM memory chips which represented the majority of its business until Although Intel created the world s first commercial microprocessor chip in it was not until the success of the PC in the early s that this became its primary business br During the s the partnership between Microsoft Windows and Intel known as Wintel became instrumental in shaping the PC landscape and solidified Intel s position on the market As a result Intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs in the mid to late s fostering the rapid growth of the computer industry During this period it became the dominant supplier of PC microprocessors and was known for aggressive and anti competitive tactics in defense of its market position particularly against AMD as well as a struggle with Microsoft for control over the direction of the PC industry br br Since the s and especially the late s Intel has faced increasing competition from AMD resulting in a significant decline of its dominance and market share in the PC market Nevertheless with a market share as of Intel still leads the x market by a wide margin br br br Industries br br br Operating segments br Client Computing Group of revenues produces PC processors and related components br Data Center Group of revenues produces hardware components used in server network and storage platforms br Internet of Things Group of revenues offers platforms designed for retail transportation industrial buildings and home use br Programmable Solutions Group of revenues manufactures programmable semiconductors primarily FPGAs br br br Customers br In Dell accounted for about of Intel s total revenues Lenovo accounted for of total revenues and HP Inc accounted for of total revenues As of May the U S Department of Defense is another large customer for Intel br br br Market share br According to IDC while Intel enjoyed the biggest market share in both the overall worldwide PC microprocessor market and the mobile PC microprocessor in the second quarter of the numbers decreased by and compared to the first quarter of br Intel s market share decreased significantly in the enthusiast market as of and they have faced delays for their nm products According to former Intel CEO Bob Swan the delay was caused by the company s overly aggressive strategy for moving to its next node br br br Historical market share br In the s Intel was among the world s top ten sellers of semiconductors th in Along with Microsoft Windows it was part of the Wintel personal computer domination in the s and early s In Intel became the biggest chip maker by revenue and held the position until when Samsung Electronics surpassed it but Intel returned to its former position the year after Other major semiconductor companies include TSMC GlobalFoundries Texas Instruments ASML STMicroelectronics United Microelectronics Corporation UMC Micron SK Hynix Kioxia and SMIC br br br Major competitors br Intel s competitors in PC chipsets included AMD VIA Technologies Silicon Integrated Systems and Nvidia Intel s competitors in networking include NXP Semiconductors Infineon Broadcom Limited Marvell Technology Group and Applied Micro Circuits Corporation and competitors in flash memory included Spansion Samsung Electronics Qimonda Kioxia STMicroelectronics Micron and SK Hynix br The only major competitor in the x processor market is AMD with which Intel has had full cross licensing agreements since each partner can use the other s patented technological innovations without charge after a certain time However the cross licensing agreement is canceled in the event of an AMD bankruptcy or takeover br Some smaller competitors such as VIA Technologies produce low power x processors for small factor computers and portable equipment However the advent of such mobile computing devices in particular smartphones has led to a decline in PC sales Since over of the world s smartphones currently use processors cores designed by Arm using the Arm instruction set Arm has become a major competitor for Intel s processor market Arm is also planning to make attempts at setting foot into the PC and server market with Ampere and IBM each individually designing CPUs for servers and supercomputers The only other major competitor in processor instruction sets is RISC V which is an open source CPU instruction set The major Chinese phone and telecommunications manufacturer Huawei has released chips based on the RISC V instruction set due to US sanctions br Intel has been involved in several disputes regarding the violation of antitrust laws which are noted below br br br Carbon footprint br Intel reported total CO e emissions direct indirect for the twelve months ending December at Kt y o y Intel plans to reduce carbon emissions by from a base year br br br Manufacturing locations br Intel has self reported that they have wafer fabs in the United States Ireland and Israel They have also self reported that they have assembly and testing sites mostly in China Costa Rica Malaysia and Vietnam with only one site in the United States br br br History br br br Origins br Intel was incorporated in Mountain View California on July by Gordon E Moore known for Moore s law a chemist Robert Noyce a physicist and co inventor of the integrated circuit and Arthur Rock an investor and venture capitalist Moore and Noyce had left Fairchild Semiconductor where they were part of the traitorous eight who founded it There were originally shares outstanding of which Dr Noyce bought shares Dr Moore shares and Mr Rock shares all at per share Rock offered of convertible debentures to a limited group of private investors equivalent to million in convertible at per share Just years later Intel became a public company via an initial public offering IPO raising million per share Intel s third employee was Andy Grove a chemical engineer who later ran the company through much of the s and the high growth s br In deciding on a name Moore and Noyce quickly rejected Moore Noyce near homophone for more noise an ill suited name for an electronics company since noise in electronics is usually undesirable and typically associated with bad interference Instead they founded the company as NM Electronics or MN Electronics on July but by the end of the month had changed the name to Intel which stood for Integrated Electronics Since Intel was already trademarked by the hotel chain Intelco they had to buy the rights for the name br br br Early history br At its founding Intel was distinguished by its ability to make logic circuits using semiconductor devices The founders goal was the semiconductor memory market widely predicted to replace magnetic core memory Its first product a quick entry into the small high speed memory market in was the Schottky TTL bipolar bit static random access memory SRAM which was nearly twice as fast as earlier Schottky diode implementations by Fairchild and the Electrotechnical Laboratory in Tsukuba Japan In the same year Intel also produced the Schottky bipolar bit read only memory ROM and the first commercial metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor MOSFET silicon gate SRAM chip the bit br While the was a significant advance its complex static cell structure made it too slow and costly for mainframe memories The three transistor cell implemented in the first commercially available dynamic random access memory DRAM the released in solved these issues The was the bestselling semiconductor memory chip in the world by as it replaced core memory in many applications Intel s business grew during the s as it expanded and improved its manufacturing processes and produced a wider range of products still dominated by various memory devices br br Intel created the first commercially available microprocessor the Intel in The microprocessor represented a notable advance in the technology of integrated circuitry as it miniaturized the central processing unit of a computer which then made it possible for small machines to perform calculations that in the past only very large machines could do Considerable technological innovation was needed before the microprocessor could actually become the basis of what was first known as a mini computer and then known as a personal computer Intel also created one of the first microcomputers in br Intel opened its first international manufacturing facility in in Malaysia which would host multiple Intel operations before opening assembly facilities and semiconductor plants in Singapore and Jerusalem in the early s and manufacturing and development centers in China India and Costa Rica in the s By the early s its business was dominated by DRAM chips However increased competition from Japanese semiconductor manufacturers had by dramatically reduced the profitability of this market The growing success of the IBM personal computer based on an Intel microprocessor was among factors that convinced Gordon Moore CEO since to shift the company s focus to microprocessors and to change fundamental aspects of that business model Moore s decision to sole source Intel s chip played into the company s continuing success br By the end of the s buoyed by its fortuitous position as microprocessor supplier to IBM and IBM s competitors within the rapidly growing personal computer market Intel embarked on a year period of unprecedented growth as the primary and most profitable hardware supplier to the PC industry part of the winning Wintel combination Moore handed over his position as CEO to Andy Grove in By launching its Intel Inside marketing campaign in Intel was able to associate brand loyalty with consumer selection so that by the end of the s its line of Pentium processors had become a household name br br br Challenges to dominance s br After growth in demand for high end microprocessors slowed Competitors most notably AMD Intel s largest competitor in its primary x architecture market garnered significant market share initially in low end and mid range processors but ultimately across the product range and Intel s dominant position in its core market was greatly reduced mostly due to controversial NetBurst microarchitecture In the early s then CEO Craig Barrett attempted to diversify the company s business beyond semiconductors but few of these activities were ultimately successful br br br Litigation br Intel had also for a number of years been embroiled in litigation U S law did not initially recognize intellectual property rights related to microprocessor topology circuit layouts until the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of a law sought by Intel and the Semiconductor Industry Association SIA During the late s and s after this law was passed Intel also sued companies that tried to develop competitor chips to the CPU The lawsuits were noted to significantly burden the competition with legal bills even if Intel lost the suits Antitrust allegations had been simmering since the early s and had been the cause of one lawsuit against Intel in In and AMD brought further claims against Intel related to unfair competition br br br Reorganization and success with Intel Core br In CEO Paul Otellini reorganized the company to refocus its core processor and chipset business on platforms enterprise digital home digital health and mobility br On June Steve Jobs then CEO of Apple announced that Apple would be using Intel s x processors for its Macintosh computers switching from the PowerPC architecture developed by the AIM alliance This was seen as win for Intel an analyst called the move risky and foolish as Intel s current offerings at the time were considered to be behind those of AMD and IBM br In Intel unveiled its Core microarchitecture to widespread critical acclaim the product range was perceived as an exceptional leap in processor performance that at a stroke regained much of its leadership of the field In Intel had another tick when it introduced the Penryn microarchitecture fabricated using the nm process node Later that year Intel released a processor with the Nehalem architecture to positive reception br On June the sale of Intel s XScale assets was announced Intel agreed to sell the XScale processor business to Marvell Technology Group for an estimated million and the assumption of unspecified liabilities The move was intended to permit Intel to focus its resources on its core x and server businesses and the acquisition completed on November br In Intel spun off key assets of a solar startup business effort to form an independent company SpectraWatt Inc In SpectraWatt filed for bankruptcy br In February Intel began to build a new microprocessor manufacturing facility in Chandler Arizona completed in at a cost of billion The building is now the nm certified Fab and is connected to the other Fabs on Ocotillo Campus via an enclosed bridge known as the Link The company produces three quarters of its products in the United States although three quarters of its revenue come from overseas br The Alliance for Affordable Internet A AI was launched in October and Intel is part of the coalition of public and private organizations that also includes Facebook Google and Microsoft Led by Sir Tim Berners Lee the A AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world where only of people are online Google will help to decrease Internet access prices so that they fall below the UN Broadband Commission s worldwide target of of monthly income br br br Attempts at entering the smartphone market br In April Intel began a pilot project with ZTE Corporation to produce smartphones using the Intel Atom processor for China s domestic market In December Intel announced that it reorganized several of its business units into a new mobile and communications group that would be responsible for the company s smartphone tablet and wireless efforts Intel planned to introduce Medfield a processor for tablets and smartphones to the market in as an effort to compete with Arm As a nanometer processor Medfield is designed to be energy efficient which is one of the core features in Arm s chips br At the Intel Developers Forum IDF in San Francisco Intel s partnership with Google was announced In January Google announced Android supporting Intel s Atom microprocessor In Intel s Kirk Skaugen said that Intel s exclusive focus on Microsoft platforms was a thing of the past and that they would now support all tier one operating systems such as Linux Android iOS and Chrome br In Intel cut thousands of employees in response to evolving market trends and offered to subsidize manufacturers for the extra costs involved in using Intel chips in their tablets In April Intel cancelled the SoFIA platform and the Broxton Atom SoC for smartphones effectively leaving the smartphone market br br br Intel custom foundry br Finding itself with excess fab capacity after the failure of the Ultrabook to gain market traction and with PC sales declining in Intel reached a foundry agreement to produce chips for Altera using a nm process General Manager of Intel s custom foundry division Sunit Rikhi indicated that Intel would pursue further such deals in the future This was after poor sales of Windows hardware caused a major retrenchment for most of the major semiconductor manufacturers except for Qualcomm which continued to see healthy purchases from its largest customer Apple br As of July five companies were using Intel s fabs via the Intel Custom Foundry division Achronix Tabula Netronome Microsemi and Panasonic most are field programmable gate array FPGA makers but Netronome designs network processors Only Achronix began shipping chips made by Intel using the nm Tri Gate process Several other customers also exist but were not announced at the time br The foundry business was closed in due to Intel s issues with its manufacturing br br br Security and manufacturing challenges br Intel continued its tick tock model of a microarchitecture change followed by a die shrink until the th generation Core family based on the Skylake microarchitecture This model was deprecated in with the release of the th generation Core family codenamed Kaby Lake ushering in the process architecture optimization model As Intel struggled to shrink their process node from nm to nm processor development slowed down and the company continued to use the Skylake microarchitecture until albeit with optimizations br br br nm process node issues br While Intel originally planned to introduce nm products in it later became apparent that there were manufacturing issues with the node The first microprocessor under that node Cannon Lake marketed as th generation Core was released in small quantities in The company first delayed the mass production of their nm products to They later delayed mass production to and then to Despite rumors of the process being cancelled Intel finally introduced mass produced nm th generation Intel Core mobile processors codenamed Ice Lake in September br Intel later acknowledged that their strategy to shrink to nm was too aggressive While other foundries used up to four steps in nm or nm processes the company s nm process required up to five or six multi pattern steps In addition Intel s nm process is denser than its counterpart processes from other foundries Since Intel s microarchitecture and process node development were coupled processor development stagnated br br br Security flaws br br br Renewed competition and other developments present br Due to Intel s issues with its nm process node and the company s slow processor development the company now found itself in a market with intense competition The company s main competitor AMD introduced the Zen microarchitecture and a new chiplet based design to critical acclaim Since its introduction AMD once unable to compete with Intel in the high end CPU market has undergone a resurgence and Intel s dominance and market share have considerably decreased In addition Apple began to transition away from the x architecture and Intel processors to their own Apple silicon for their Macintosh computers in The transition is expected to affect Intel minimally however it might prompt other PC manufacturers to reevaluate their reliance on Intel and the x architecture br br br IDM strategy br On March CEO Pat Gelsinger laid out new plans for the company These include a new strategy called IDM that includes investments in manufacturing facilities use of both internal and external foundries and a new foundry business called Intel Foundry Services IFS a standalone business unit Unlike Intel Custom Foundry IFS will offer a combination of packaging and process technology and Intel s IP portfolio including x cores Other plans for the company include a partnership with IBM and a new event for developers and engineers called Intel ON Gelsinger also confirmed that Intel s nm process is on track and that the first products using their nm process also known as Intel are Ponte Vecchio and Meteor Lake br In January Intel reportedly selected New Albany Ohio near Columbus Ohio as the site for a major new manufacturing facility The facility will cost at least billion The company expects the facility to begin producing chips by The same year Intel also choose Magdeburg Germany as a site for two new chip mega factories for billion topping Tesla s investment in Brandenburg The start of the construction was initially planned for but this has been postponed to late while production start is planned for Including subcontractors this would create new jobs br In August Intel signed a billion partnership with Brookfield Asset Management to fund its recent factory expansions As part of the deal Intel would have a controlling stake by funding of the cost of building new chip making facilities in Chandler with Brookfield owning the remaining stake allowing the companies to split the revenue from those facilities br On January as part of billion in cost reductions Intel announced pay cuts affecting employees above midlevel ranging from upwards It also suspended bonuses and merit pay increases while reducing retirement plan matching These cost reductions followed layoffs announced in the fall of br In October Intel confirmed it would be the first commercial user of high NA EUV lithography tool as part of its plan to regain process leadership from TSMC br br br Artificial intelligence br In December Intel unveiled Gaudi an artificial intelligence AI chip for generative AI software which will launch in and compete with rival chips from Nvidia and AMD On June Intel announced AI chips for data centers the Xeon processor aiming for better performance and power efficiency compared to its predecessor Intel s Gaudi and Gaudi AI accelerators were revealed to be more cost effective than competitors offerings Additionally Intel disclosed architecture details for its upcoming Lunar Lake processors for AI PCs set to ship in the third quarter br br br Product and market history br br br SRAMs DRAMs and the microprocessor br Intel s first products were shift register memory and random access memory integrated circuits and Intel grew to be a leader in the fiercely competitive DRAM SRAM and ROM markets throughout the s Concurrently Intel engineers Marcian Hoff Federico Faggin Stanley Mazor and Masatoshi Shima invented Intel s first microprocessor Originally developed for the Japanese company Busicom to replace a number of ASICs in a calculator already produced by Busicom the Intel was introduced to the mass market on November though the microprocessor did not become the core of Intel s business until the mid s Note Intel is usually given credit with Texas Instruments for the almost simultaneous invention of the microprocessor br In at the dawn of the personal computer era Intel s profits came under increased pressure from Japanese memory chip manufacturers and then president Andy Grove focused the company on microprocessors Grove described this transition in the book Only the Paranoid Survive A key element of his plan was the notion then considered radical of becoming the single source for successors to the popular microprocessor br Until then the manufacture of complex integrated circuits was not reliable enough for customers to depend on a single supplier but Grove began producing processors in three geographically distinct factories and ceased licensing the chip designs to competitors such as AMD When the PC industry boomed in the late s and s Intel was one of the primary beneficiaries br br br Early x processors and the IBM PC br br Despite the ultimate importance of the microprocessor the and its successors the and the were never major revenue contributors at Intel As the next processor the and its variant the was completed in Intel embarked on a major marketing and sales campaign for that chip nicknamed Operation Crush and intended to win as many customers for the processor as possible One design win was the newly created IBM PC division though the importance of this was not fully realized at the time br IBM introduced its personal computer in and it was rapidly successful In Intel created the microprocessor which two years later was used in the IBM PC AT Compaq the first IBM PC clone manufacturer produced a desktop system based on the faster processor in and in quickly followed with the first based system beating IBM and establishing a competitive market for PC compatible systems and setting up Intel as a key component supplier br In the company had started a project to develop a highly advanced bit microprocessor finally released in as the Intel iAPX The project was too ambitious and the processor was never able to meet its performance objectives and it failed in the marketplace Intel extended the x architecture to bits instead br br br microprocessor br During this period Andrew Grove dramatically redirected the company closing much of its DRAM business and directing resources to the microprocessor business Of perhaps greater importance was his decision to single source the microprocessor Prior to this microprocessor manufacturing was in its infancy and manufacturing problems frequently reduced or stopped production interrupting supplies to customers To mitigate this risk these customers typically insisted that multiple manufacturers produce chips they could use to ensure a consistent supply The and series microprocessors were produced by several companies notably AMD with which Intel had a technology sharing contract br Grove made the decision not to license the design to other manufacturers instead producing it in three geographically distinct factories Santa Clara California Hillsboro Oregon and Chandler a suburb of Phoenix Arizona He convinced customers that this would ensure consistent delivery In doing this Intel breached its contract with AMD which sued and was paid millions of dollars in damages but could not manufacture new Intel CPU designs any longer Instead AMD started to develop and manufacture its own competing x designs br As the success of Compaq s Deskpro established the as the dominant CPU choice Intel achieved a position of near exclusive dominance as its supplier Profits from this funded rapid development of both higher performance chip designs and higher performance manufacturing capabilities propelling Intel to a position of unquestioned leadership by the early s br br br Pentium and Itanium br Intel introduced the microprocessor in and in established a second design team designing the processors code named P and P in parallel and committing to a major new processor every two years versus the four or more years such designs had previously taken Engineers Vinod Dham and Rajeev Chandrasekhar Member of Parliament India were key figures on the core team that developed the chip and later Intel s signature Pentium chip The P project was earlier known as Operation Bicycle referring to the cycles of the processor through two parallel execution pipelines The P was introduced in as the Intel Pentium substituting a registered trademark name for the former part number Numbers such as cannot be legally registered as trademarks in the United States The P followed in as the Pentium Pro and improved into the Pentium II in New architectures were developed alternately in Santa Clara California and Hillsboro Oregon br The Santa Clara design team embarked in on a successor to the x architecture codenamed P The first attempt was dropped a year later but quickly revived in a cooperative program with Hewlett Packard engineers though Intel soon took over primary design responsibility The resulting implementation of the IA bit architecture was the Itanium finally introduced in June The Itanium s performance running legacy x code did not meet expectations and it failed to compete effectively with x which was AMD s bit extension of the bit x architecture Intel uses the name Intel previously EM T In Intel announced that the Itanium series Kittson would be the last Itanium chips produced br The Hillsboro team designed the Willamette processors initially code named P which were marketed as the Pentium br During this period Intel undertook two major supporting advertising campaigns The first campaign the Intel Inside marketing and branding campaign is widely known and has become synonymous with Intel itself The idea of ingredient branding was new at the time with only NutraSweet and a few others making attempts to do so One of the key architects of the marketing team was the head of the microprocessor division David House He coined the slogan Intel Inside This campaign established Intel which had been a component supplier little known outside the PC industry as a household name br The second campaign Intel s Systems Group which began in the early s showcased manufacturing of PC motherboards the main board component of a personal computer and the one into which the processor CPU and memory RAM chips are plugged The Systems Group campaign was lesser known than the Intel Inside campaign br Shortly after Intel began manufacturing fully configured white box systems for the dozens of PC clone companies that rapidly sprang up At its peak in the mid s Intel manufactured over of all PCs making it the third largest supplier at the time br During the s Intel Architecture Labs IAL was responsible for many of the hardware innovations for the PC including the PCI Bus the PCI Express PCIe bus and Universal Serial Bus USB IAL s software efforts met with a more mixed fate its video and graphics software was important in the development of software digital video but later its efforts were largely overshadowed by competition from Microsoft The competition between Intel and Microsoft was revealed in testimony by then IAL Vice president Steven McGeady at the Microsoft antitrust trial United States v Microsoft Corp br br br Pentium flaw br br In June Intel engineers discovered a flaw in the floating point math subsection of the P Pentium microprocessor Under certain data dependent conditions the low order bits of the result of a floating point division would be incorrect The error could compound in subsequent calculations Intel corrected the error in a future chip revision and under public pressure it issued a total recall and replaced the defective Pentium CPUs which were limited to some and MHz models on customer request br The bug was discovered independently in October by Thomas Nicely Professor of Mathematics at Lynchburg College He contacted Intel but received no response On October he posted a message about his finding on the Internet Word of the bug spread quickly and reached the industry press The bug was easy to replicate a user could enter specific numbers into the calculator on the operating system Consequently many users did not accept Intel s statements that the error was minor and not even an erratum During Thanksgiving in The New York Times ran a piece by journalist John Markoff spotlighting the error Intel changed its position and offered to replace every chip quickly putting in place a large end user support organization This resulted in a million charge against Intel s revenue Dr Nicely later learned that Intel had discovered the FDIV bug in its own testing a few months before him but had decided not to inform customers br The Pentium flaw incident Intel s response to it and the surrounding media coverage propelled Intel from being a technology supplier generally unknown to most computer users to a household name Dovetailing with an uptick in the Intel Inside campaign the episode is considered to have been a positive event for Intel changing some of its business practices to be more end user focused and generating substantial public awareness while avoiding a lasting negative impression br br br Intel Core br br The Intel Core line originated from the original Core brand with the release of the bit Yonah CPU Intel s first dual core mobile low power processor Derived from the Pentium M the processor family used an enhanced version of the P microarchitecture Its successor the Core family was released on July This was based on the Intel Core microarchitecture and was a bit design Instead of focusing on higher clock rates the Core microarchitecture emphasized power efficiency and a return to lower clock speeds It also provided more efficient decoding stages execution units caches and buses reducing the power consumption of Core branded CPUs while increasing their processing capacity br In November Intel released the st generation Core processors based on the Nehalem microarchitecture Intel also introduced a new naming scheme with the three variants now named Core i i and i as well as i from th generation onwards Unlike the previous naming scheme these names no longer correspond to specific technical features It was succeeded by the Westmere microarchitecture in with a die shrink to nm and included Intel HD Graphics br In Intel released the Sandy Bridge based nd generation Core processor family This generation featured an performance increase over Nehalem It was succeeded by Ivy Bridge based rd generation Core introduced at the Intel Developer Forum Ivy Bridge featured a die shrink to nm and supported both DDR memory and DDR L chips br Intel continued its tick tock model of a microarchitecture change followed by a die shrink until the th generation Core family based on the Skylake microarchitecture This model was deprecated in with the release of the th generation Core family based on Kaby Lake ushering in the process architecture optimization model From until Intel later released more optimizations on the Skylake microarchitecture with Kaby Lake R Amber Lake Whiskey Lake Coffee Lake Coffee Lake R and Comet Lake Intel struggled to shrink their process node from nm to nm with the first microarchitecture under that node Cannon Lake marketed as th generation Core only being released in small quantities in br In Intel released the th generation of Core processors codenamed Amber Lake Comet Lake and Ice Lake Ice Lake based on the Sunny Cove microarchitecture was produced on the nm process and was limited to low power mobile processors Both Amber Lake and Comet Lake were based on a refined nm node with the latter being used for desktop and high performance mobile products and the former used for low power mobile products br In September th generation Core mobile processors codenamed Tiger Lake were launched Tiger Lake is based on the Willow Cove microarchitecture and a refined nm node Intel later released th generation Core desktop processors codenamed Rocket Lake fabricated using Intel s nm process and based on the Cypress Cove microarchitecture on March It replaced Comet Lake desktop processors All th generation Core processors feature new integrated graphics based on the Intel Xe microarchitecture br Both desktop and mobile products were unified under a single process node with the release of th generation Intel Core processors codenamed Alder Lake in late This generation will be fabricated using Intel s nm process called Intel for both desktop and mobile processors and is based on a hybrid architecture utilizing high performance Golden Cove cores and high efficiency Gracemont Atom cores br br br Transient execution CPU vulnerability br br br Use of Intel products by Apple Inc br br On June Steve Jobs then CEO of Apple announced that Apple would be transitioning the Macintosh from its long favored PowerPC architecture to the Intel x architecture because the future PowerPC road map was unable to satisfy Apple s needs This was seen as a win for Intel although an analyst called the move risky and foolish as Intel s current offerings at the time were considered to be behind those of AMD and IBM The first Mac computers containing Intel CPUs were announced on January and Apple had its entire line of consumer Macs running on Intel processors by early August The Apple Xserve server was updated to Intel Xeon processors from November and was offered in a configuration similar to Apple s Mac Pro br Despite Apple s use of Intel products relations between the two companies were strained at times Rumors of Apple switching from Intel processors to their own designs began circulating as early as On June during Apple s annual WWDC Tim Cook Apple s CEO announced that it would be transitioning the company s entire Mac line from Intel CPUs to custom Apple designed processors based on the Arm architecture over the course of the next two years In the short term this transition was estimated to have minimal effects on Intel as Apple only accounted for to of its revenue However at the time it was believed that Apple s shift to its own chips might prompt other PC manufacturers to reassess their reliance on Intel and the x architecture By November Apple unveiled the M its processor custom designed for the Mac br br br Solid state drives SSD br br In Intel began shipping mainstream solid state drives SSDs with up to GB storage capacities As with their CPUs Intel develops SSD chips using ever smaller nanometer processes These SSDs make use of industry standards such as NAND flash mSATA PCIe and NVMe In Intel introduced SSDs based on D XPoint technology under the Optane brand name br In SK Hynix acquired most of Intel s NAND memory business for billion with a remaining transaction worth billion expected in Intel also discontinued its consumer Optane products in In July Intel disclosed in its Q earnings report that it would cease future product development within its Optane business which in turn effectively discontinued the development of D XPoint as a whole br br br Supercomputers br The Intel Scientific Computers division was founded in by Justin Rattner to design and produce parallel computers based on Intel microprocessors connected in hypercube internetwork topology In the name was changed to the Intel Supercomputing Systems Division and development of the iWarp architecture was also subsumed The division designed several supercomputer systems including the Intel iPSC iPSC iPSC Paragon and ASCI Red In November Intel stated that it was planning to use optical fibers to improve networking within supercomputers br br br Fog computing br On November Intel alongside Arm Dell Cisco Systems Microsoft and Princeton University founded the OpenFog Consortium to promote interests and development in fog computing Intel s Chief Strategist for the IoT Strategy and Technology Office Jeff Fedders became the consortium s first president br br br Self driving cars br Intel is one of the biggest stakeholders in the self driving car industry having joined the race in mid after joining forces with Mobileye The company is also one of the first in the sector to research consumer acceptance after an AAA report quoted a nonacceptance rate of the technology in the U S br Safety levels of autonomous driving technology the thought of abandoning control to a machine and psychological comfort of passengers in such situations were the major discussion topics initially The commuters also stated that they did not want to see everything the car was doing This was primarily a referral to the auto steering wheel with no one sitting in the driving seat Intel also learned that voice control regulator is vital and the interface between the humans and machine eases the discomfort condition and brings some sense of control back It is important to mention that Intel included only people in this study which makes the study less credible In a video posted on YouTube Intel accepted this fact and called for further testing br br br Programmable devices br Intel formed a new business unit called the Programmable Solutions Group PSG on completion of its Altera acquisition Intel has since sold Stratix Arria and Cyclone FPGAs In Intel released Agilex FPGAs chips aimed at data centers G applications and other uses br In October Intel announced it would be spinning off PSG into a separate company at the start of while maintaining majority ownership br br br Competition antitrust and espionage br br By the end of the s microprocessor performance had outstripped software demand for that CPU power Aside from high end server systems and software whose demand dropped with the end of the dot com bubble consumer systems ran effectively on increasingly low cost systems after br Intel s strategy was to develop processors with better performance in a short time from the appearance of one to the other as seen with the appearance of the Pentium II in May the Pentium III in February and the Pentium in the fall of making the strategy ineffective since the consumer did not see the innovation as essential and leaving an opportunity for rapid gains by competitors notably AMD This in turn lowered the profitability of the processor line and ended an era of unprecedented dominance of the PC hardware by Intel br Intel s dominance in the x microprocessor market led to numerous charges of antitrust violations over the years including FTC investigations in both the late s and in and civil actions such as the suit by Digital Equipment Corporation DEC and a patent suit by Intergraph Intel s market dominance at one time it controlled over of the market for bit x microprocessors combined with Intel s own hardball legal tactics such as its infamous patent suit versus PC manufacturers made it an attractive target for litigation culminating in Intel agreeing to pay AMD billion and grant them a perpetual patent cross license in as well as several anti trust judgements in Europe Korea and Japan br A case of industrial espionage arose in that involved both Intel and AMD Bill Gaede an Argentine formerly employed both at AMD and at Intel s Arizona plant was arrested for attempting in to sell the i and P Pentium designs to AMD and to certain foreign powers Gaede videotaped data from his computer screen at Intel and mailed it to AMD which immediately alerted Intel and authorities resulting in Gaede s arrest Gaede was convicted and sentenced to months in prison in June br br br Corporate affairs br br br Business trends br The key trends for Intel are as of the financial year ending in late December br br br Leadership and corporate structure br br Robert Noyce was Intel s CEO at its founding in followed by co founder Gordon Moore in Andy Grove became the company s president in and added the CEO title in when Moore became chairman In Grove succeeded Moore as chairman and Craig Barrett already company president took over On May Barrett handed the reins of the company over to Paul Otellini who had been the company president and COO and who was responsible for Intel s design win in the original IBM PC The board of directors elected Otellini as president and CEO and Barrett replaced Grove as Chairman of the Board Grove stepped down as chairman but is retained as a special adviser In May Barrett stepped down as chairman of the board and was succeeded by Jane Shaw In May Intel vice chairman Andy Bryant who had held the posts of CFO and Chief Administrative Officer at Intel succeeded Shaw as executive chairman br In November president and CEO Paul Otellini announced that he would step down in May at the age of three years before the company s mandatory retirement age During a six month transition period Intel s board of directors commenced a search process for the next CEO in which it considered both internal managers and external candidates such as Sanjay Jha and Patrick Gelsinger Financial results

price is below however according to two presidents from Acer and Compaq this goal will not be achieved if Intel does not lower the price of its chips br br br Open source support br Intel has a significant participation in the open source communities since For example in Intel released MIT licensed X org drivers for their integrated graphic cards of the i family of chipsets Intel released FreeBSD drivers for some networking cards available under a BSD compatible license which were also ported to OpenBSD Binary firmware files for non wireless Ethernet devices were also released under a BSD licence allowing free redistribution Intel ran the Moblin project until April when they handed the project over to the Linux Foundation Intel also runs the LessWatts org campaigns br However after the release of the wireless products called Intel Pro Wireless BG BG ABG and ABG in Intel was criticized for not granting free redistribution rights for the firmware that must be included in the operating system for the wireless devices to operate As a result of this Intel became a target of campaigns to allow free operating systems to include binary firmware on terms acceptable to the open source community Linspire Linux creator Michael Robertson outlined the difficult position that Intel was in releasing to open source as Intel did not want to upset their large customer Microsoft Theo de Raadt of OpenBSD also claimed that Intel is being an Open Source fraud after an Intel employee presented a distorted view of the situation at an open source conference In spite of the significant negative attention Intel received as a result of the wireless dealings the binary firmware still has not gained a license compatible with free software principles br Intel has also supported other open source projects such as Blender and Open D Engine br br br Corporate identity br br br Logo br br In its history Intel has had three logos The first Intel logo introduced on April featured the company s name stylized in all lowercase with the letter e dropped below the other letters The second logo introduced on January was inspired by the Intel Inside campaign featuring a swirl around the Intel brand name br The third logo introduced on September was inspired by the previous logos It removes the swirl as well as the classic blue color in almost all parts of the logo except for the dot in the i br br br Intel Inside br br Intel has become one of the world s most recognizable computer brands following its long running Intel Inside campaign The idea for Intel Inside came out of a meeting between Intel and one of the major computer resellers MicroAge br In the late s Intel s market share was being seriously eroded by upstart competitors such as AMD Zilog and others who had started to sell their less expensive microprocessors to computer manufacturers This was because by using cheaper processors manufacturers could make cheaper computers and gain more market share in an increasingly price sensitive market In Intel s Dennis Carter visited MicroAge s headquarters in Tempe Arizona to meet with MicroAge s VP of Marketing Ron Mion MicroAge had become one of the largest distributors of Compaq IBM HP and others and thus was a primary although indirect driver of demand for microprocessors Intel wanted MicroAge to petition its computer suppliers to favor Intel chips However Mion felt that the marketplace should decide which processors they wanted Intel s counterargument was that it would be too difficult to educate PC buyers on why Intel microprocessors were worth paying more for br Mion felt that the public did not really need to fully understand why Intel chips were better they just needed to feel they were better So Mion proposed a market test Intel would pay for a MicroAge billboard somewhere saying If you re buying a personal computer make sure it has Intel inside In turn MicroAge would put Intel Inside stickers on the Intel based computers in their stores in that area To make the test easier to monitor Mion decided to do the test in Boulder Colorado where it had a single store Virtually overnight the sales of personal computers in that store dramatically shifted to Intel based PCs Intel very quickly adopted Intel Inside as its primary branding and rolled it out worldwide As is often the case with computer lore other tidbits have been combined to explain how things evolved Intel Inside has not escaped that tendency and there are other explanations that had been floating around br Intel s branding campaign started with The Computer Inside tagline in in the U S and Europe The Japan chapter of Intel proposed an Intel in it tagline and kicked off the Japanese campaign by hosting EKI KON meaning Station Concert in Japanese at the Tokyo railway station dome on Christmas Day December Several months later The Computer Inside incorporated the Japan idea to become Intel Inside which eventually elevated to the worldwide branding campaign in by Intel marketing manager Dennis Carter A case study Inside Intel Inside was put together by Harvard Business School The five note jingle was introduced in and by its tenth anniversary was being heard in countries around the world The initial branding agency for the Intel Inside campaign was DahlinSmithWhite Advertising of Salt Lake City The Intel swirl logo was the work of DahlinSmithWhite art director Steve Grigg under the direction of Intel president and CEO Andy Grove br The Intel Inside advertising campaign sought public brand loyalty and awareness of Intel processors in consumer computers Intel paid some of the advertiser s costs for an ad that used the Intel Inside logo and xylo marimba jingle br In Intel planned to shift the emphasis of its Intel Inside campaign from traditional media such as television and print to newer media such as the Internet Intel required that a minimum of of the money it provided to the companies in its co op program be used for online marketing The Intel annual financial report indicated that billion of the gross margin and nearly of the total net income was allocated to all advertising with Intel Inside being part of that br br br Intel jingle br br The D D G D A xylophone marimba jingle known as the Intel bong used in Intel advertising was produced by Musikvergnuegen and written by Walter Werzowa once a member of the Austrian s sampling band Edelweiss The Intel jingle was made in to coincide with the launch of the Pentium It was modified in to coincide with the launch of the Pentium III although it overlapped with the version which was phased out in Advertisements for products featuring Intel processors with prominent MMX branding featured a version of the jingle with an embellishment shining sound after the final note br The jingle was remade a second time in to coincide with the new logo change Again it overlapped with the version and was not mainstreamed until the launch of the Core processors in with the melody unchanged br Another remake of the jingle debuted with Intel s new visual identity The company has made use of numerous variants since its rebranding in while retaining the mainstream version br br br Processor naming strategy br br In Intel expanded its promotion of open specification platforms beyond Centrino to include the Viiv media center PC and the business desktop Intel vPro br In mid January Intel announced that they were dropping the long running Pentium name from their processors The Pentium name was first used to refer to the P core Intel processors and was done to comply with court rulings that prevent the trademarking of a string of numbers so competitors could not just call their processor the same name as had been done with the prior and processors both of which had copies manufactured by IBM and AMD They phased out the Pentium names from mobile processors first when the new Yonah chips branded Core Solo and Core Duo were released The desktop processors changed when the Core line of processors were released By Intel was using a good better best strategy with Celeron being good Pentium better and the Intel Core family representing the best the company has to offer br According to spokesman Bill Calder Intel has maintained only the Celeron brand the Atom brand for netbooks and the vPro lineup for businesses Since late Intel s mainstream processors have been called Celeron Pentium Core i Core i Core i and Core i in order of performance from lowest to highest The st generation Core products carry a digit name such as i and the nd generation products carry a digit name such as the i and from th generation onwards Intel processors will have a digit name such as i K for desktop In all cases a K at the end of it shows that it is an unlocked processor enabling additional overclocking abilities for instance K vPro products will carry the Intel Core i vPro processor or the Intel Core i vPro processor name In October Intel started to sell its Core i K Sandy Bridge chip to customers worldwide br Since Centrino is only being applied to Intel s WiMAX and Wi Fi technologies br In Intel announced that they are dropping the Pentium and Celeron naming schemes for their desktop and laptop entry level processors The Intel Processor branding will be replacing the old Pentium and Celeron naming schemes starting in br In Intel announced that they will be dropping the i in their future processor markings For example products such as Core i will now be called Core Ultra will be added to the endings of processors that are in the higher end such as Core Ultra br br br Typography br Neo Sans Intel is a customized version of Neo Sans based on the Neo Sans and Neo Tech designed by Sebastian Lester in It was introduced alongside Intel s rebranding in Previously Intel used Helvetica as its standard typeface in corporate marketing br Intel Clear is a global font announced in designed for to be used across all communications The font family was designed by Red Peek Branding and Dalton Maag Initially available in Latin Greek and Cyrillic scripts it replaced Neo Sans Intel as the company s corporate typeface Intel Clear Hebrew Intel Clear Arabic were added by Dalton Maag Ltd Neo Sans Intel remained in logo and to mark processor type and socket on the packaging of Intel s processors br In as part of a new visual identity a new typeface Intel One was designed It replaced Intel Clear as the font used by the company in most of its branding however it is used alongside Intel Clear typeface In logo it replaced Neo Sans Intel typeface However it is still used to mark processor type and socket on the packaging of Intel s processors br br br Intel Brand Book br It is a book produced by Red Peak Branding as part of new brand identity campaign celebrating Intel s achievements while setting the new standard for what Intel looks feels and sounds like br br br Charity br br In November Intel designed a Paddington Bear statue themed Little Bear Blue one of fifty statues created by various celebrities and companies which were located around London Created prior to the release of the film

disputes br br br Patent infringement litigation br In October a Transmeta lawsuit was filed against Intel for patent infringement on computer architecture and power efficiency technologies The lawsuit was settled in October with Intel agreeing to pay US million initially and US million per year for the next five years Both companies agreed to drop lawsuits against each other while Intel was granted a perpetual non exclusive license to use current and future patented Transmeta technologies in its chips for years br br br Antitrust allegations and litigation br br In September Intel filed a response to an AMD lawsuit disputing AMD s claims and claiming that Intel s business practices are fair and lawful In a rebuttal Intel deconstructed AMD s offensive strategy and argued that AMD struggled largely as a result of its own bad business decisions including underinvestment in essential manufacturing capacity and excessive reliance on contracting out chip foundries Legal analysts predicted the lawsuit would drag on for a number of years since Intel s initial response indicated its unwillingness to settle with AMD In a court date was finally set br On November New York s attorney general filed an antitrust lawsuit against Intel Corp claiming the company used illegal threats and collusion to dominate the market for computer microprocessors br On November AMD agreed to drop the antitrust lawsuit against Intel in exchange for billion A joint press release published by the two chip makers stated While the relationship between the two companies has been difficult in the past this agreement ends the legal disputes and enables the companies to focus all of our efforts on product innovation and development br An antitrust lawsuit and a class action suit relating to cold calling employees of other companies has been settled br br br Allegations by Japan Fair Trade Commission br In the local Fair Trade Commission found that Intel violated the Japanese Antimonopoly

to of its annual sales if found guilty In June the Fair Trade Commission ordered Intel to pay a fine of US million for taking advantage of its dominant position to offer incentives to major Korean PC manufacturers on the condition of not buying products from AMD br br br Allegations by regulators in the United States br New York started an investigation of Intel in January on whether the company violated antitrust laws in pricing and sales of its microprocessors In June the Federal Trade Commission also began an antitrust investigation of the case In December the FTC announced it would initiate an administrative proceeding against Intel in September br In November following a two year investigation New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo sued Intel accusing them of bribery and coercion claiming that Intel bribed computer makers to buy more of their chips than those of their rivals and threatened to withdraw these payments if the computer makers were perceived as working too closely with its competitors Intel has denied these claims br On July Dell agreed to a settlement with the U S Securities and Exchange Commission SEC to pay million in penalties resulting from charges that Dell did not accurately disclose accounting information to investors In particular the SEC charged that from to Dell had an agreement with Intel to receive rebates in exchange for not using chips manufactured by AMD These substantial rebates were not disclosed to investors but were used to help meet investor expectations regarding the company s financial performance These exclusivity payments grew from of Dell s operating income in FY to in FY and peaked at in the first quarter of FY Dell eventually did adopt AMD as a secondary supplier in and Intel subsequently stopped their rebates causing Dell s financial performance to fall br br br Allegations by the European Union br In July the European Commission accused Intel of anti competitive practices mostly against AMD The allegations going back to include giving preferential prices to computer makers buying most or all of their chips from Intel paying computer makers to delay or cancel the launch of products using AMD chips and providing chips at below standard cost to governments and educational institutions Intel responded that the allegations were unfounded and instead qualified its market behavior as consumer friendly General counsel Bruce Sewell responded that the commission had misunderstood some factual assumptions regarding pricing and manufacturing costs br In February Intel announced that its office in Munich had been raided by European Union regulators Intel reported that it was cooperating with investigators Intel faced a fine of up to of its annual revenue if found guilty of stifling competition AMD subsequently launched a website promoting these allegations In June the EU filed new charges against Intel In May the EU found that Intel had engaged in anti competitive practices and subsequently fined Intel billion US billion a record amount Intel was found to have paid companies including Acer Dell HP Lenovo and NEC to exclusively use Intel chips in their products and therefore harmed other less successful companies including AMD The European Commission said that Intel had deliberately acted to keep competitors out of the computer chip market and in doing so had made a serious and sustained violation of the EU s antitrust rules In addition to the fine Intel was ordered by the commission to immediately cease all illegal practices Intel has said that they will appeal against the commission s verdict In June the General Court which sits below the European Court of Justice rejected the appeal br In the billion fine was dropped but was successively re imposed in September as a million fine br br br Corporate responsibility record br Intel has been accused by some residents of Rio Rancho New Mexico of allowing volatile organic compounds VOCs to be released in excess of their pollution permit One resident claimed that a release of tons of carbon tetrachloride was measured from one acid scrubber during the fourth quarter of but an emission factor allowed Intel to report no carbon tetrachloride emissions for all of br Another resident alleges that Intel was responsible for the release of other VOCs from their Rio Rancho site and that a necropsy of lung tissue from two deceased dogs in the area indicated trace amounts of toluene hexane ethylbenzene and xylene isomers all of which are solvents used in industrial settings but also commonly found in gasoline retail paint thinners and retail solvents During a sub committee meeting of the New Mexico Environment Improvement Board a resident claimed that Intel s own reports documented more than
