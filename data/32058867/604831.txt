Store and forward is a telecommunications technique in which information is sent to an intermediate station where it is kept and sent at a later time to the final destination or to another intermediate station The intermediate station or node in a networking context verifies the integrity of the message before forwarding it In general this technique is used in networks with intermittent connectivity especially in the wilderness or environments requiring high mobility It may also be preferable in situations when there are long delays in transmission and error rates are variable and high or if a direct end to end connection is not available br br br Modern store and forward networking br Store and forward originates with delay tolerant networks No real time services are available for these kinds of networks br Logistical Networking is a scalable form of store and forward networking that exposes network embedded buffers on intermediate nodes and allows flexible creation of services by higher level managers including caching point to multipoint communication or multicast content delivery and many other stateful distributed services Real time services can be created using logistical networking when data transfer connectivity permits br A store and forward switching center is a message switching center in which a message is accepted from the originating user i e sender when it is offered held in a physical storage and forwarded to the destination user i e receiver in accordance with the priority placed upon the message by the originating user and the availability of an outgoing channel br Store and forward switching centers are usually implemented in mobile service stations where the messages that are sent from the sender is first sent to these centers If the destination address isn t available then the center stores this message and tries sending it later This improves the probability of the message to be delivered In the other case if the destination is available at that time then the message is immediately sent br br br Manually operated relay br Store and forward networks predate the use of computers Point to point teleprinter equipment was used to send messages which were stored at the receiving end on punched paper tape at a relay center A human operator at the center removed the message tape from the receiving machine read the addressing information and then sent it toward its destination on appropriate outbound point to point teleprinter link If the outbound link was in use the operator placed the message in tape in a physical queue usually consisting of a set of clips or hooks A major relay center in the mid s might have dozens of inbound and outbound teleprinters scores of operators and thousands of messages in the queues during peak periods Operators referred to these centers as torn tape relay centers a reference to removing the received message from the inbound teleprinter by tearing the paper tape to separate one message from the next The U S military term for such a center was Non Automated Relay Center NARC br br br Automatic relay br In Western Union introduced Plan A the first automatic electromechanical store and forward message switching system All message storage was performed by paper tape punches paired with paper tape readers with a bin in between br br br Email br It is very common for an email system using SMTP to accept a message store it and then forward it on elsewhere Although fully open mail relays are no longer common not only does simple server based forwarding work this way but also many email filtering and automated electronic mailing lists services br br br UUCP br br Prior to the deployment of the Internet computers were connected via a variety of point to point techniques with many smaller computers using dial up connections The UUCP store and forward protocols allowed a message typically e mail to move across the collection of computers and eventually reach its destination Late in the th century store and forward techniques evolved into packet switching which replaced it for most purposes br br br FidoNet br br FidoNet was an email store and forward system for bulletin board systems that peaked at systems with millions of users across the world The system was highly efficient using the latest file compression and file transfer systems to aggressively drive down the cost of transmission on what was largely a hobby network The system was later modified to support public messages forums called EchoMail which grew to about MB a day compressed br br br See also br Best effort delivery br Cut through switching br Delay tolerant networking br Email forwarding br Fragment free br Hop by hop transport br Internet fax br Logistical Networking br Network switch br Packet radio br Stofor br Store and forward delay br Wormhole routing br br br br br Switches What Are Forwarding Modes and How Do They Work Archived from the original on
