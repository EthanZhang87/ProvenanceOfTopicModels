Symyx Technologies Inc was a company that specialized in informatics and automation products Symyx provided software solutions for scientific research including Enterprise Laboratory Notebooks and products for combinatorial chemistry The software part of the business became part of Accelrys Inc in and then in this company merged with Dassault Syst mes Symyx also offered laboratory robotics systems for performing automated chemical research which in was spun out as Freeslate Inc br br br Products br Symyx offered high speed combinatorial technologies for the discovery of new materials Using proprietary technologies including instruments software and methods Symyx was able to generate hundreds to thousands of unique materials at a time and screen those materials rapidly and automatically for desired properties This approach was said to deliver results hundreds to thousands of times faster than traditional research methods at a fraction of the cost Symyx applied this technology to revolutionize materials discovery in the life sciences chemical and electronics industries br br br History br Founded in by Dr Alejandro Zaffaroni and Dr Peter G Schultz Symyx conceptual basis drew from Affymax Inc and Affymetrix Inc which commercialized the use of high speed combinatorial methods for pharmaceutical and genetic research respectively Dr Eric McFarland professor at UCSB was the founding director Symyx screens about a million materials a year and has produced a product pipeline with several materials that have the potential to be commercialized in the next few years Examples of their discovery efforts include X ray storage phosphors for radiography polymers to speed DNA research and catalysts for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals chemicals and plastics br In Symyx Technologies acquired Intellichem a software manufacturer for electronic laboratory notebooks and in Symyx Technologies acquired MDL Information Systems originally Molecular Design Limited Inc a provider of R D informatics in the chemistry and life sciences industries which had been launched as a computer aided drug design firm in January With this purchase came the purveyorship of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention NIOSH Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances RTECS www cdc gov niosh rtecs a database of basic toxicity information on household chemical substances food additives drugs solvents biocides and chemical waste components which as of first quarter of contained entries In Symyx sold non RTECS portions of the occupational health and safety OHS component of the MDL business to ChemAdvisor Inc of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania Subsequent innovations derived from these business components included an enterprise electronic laboratory notebook ELN capable of supporting multiple scientific disciplines br In Symyx spun off their laboratory robotics business as Freeslate Inc Freeslate developed high throughput systems for automating chemical research In the remaining Symyx software business merged with Accelrys with the combined company being known simply as Accelrys In Accelrys in turn merged with Dassault Syst mes who announced the creation of the BIOVIA brand to supply software for scientific applications br br br Business model considerations br The concept of combinatory chemistry outside of bio tech area was the focus of Symyx The initial Symyx business model was to provide contract research for large chemical companies at a contract size from Million to Million The company had initial success in gaining enough contracts to reach profitability with small deals with few initial customers which led to large deals such as with Exxon Symyx then started to sell equipment br One other key point was the company had to develop new tools and hire new people when a new project came up because the contract was in a brand new research area and required different expertise Therefore the research contract business was not scalable This is seen as the reason for company failure even though the company had over patents Other companies followed Symyx s path Intermolecular licensed Symyx patents on electronic materials and is developing tools for the electronic materials companies br br br br br br External links br Official website as BIOVIA Dassault Syst mes
