a frontrunner for Rehnquist s seat which ultimately went to John Roberts Professor Stephen B Presser of Northwestern University School of Law argued that McConnell was high on the White House s short list because br br McConnell does believe that the Supreme Court has gone too far in reading the total separation of church and state into the Constitution and because he understands that Roe v Wade has no firm constitutional foundation He might be acceptable to the left not only because so many liberal professors support him but also because he has been public in his criticism of Bush v Gore and the impeachment of President Clinton br McConnell was also mentioned as a possible Supreme Court nominee in a John McCain or Mitt Romney presidency br br br Testimony on constitutional term limits for Supreme Court justices br On June McConnell provided testimony to the Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court of the United States on the dangers of increasing the Court s size He proposed a constitutional amendment to address such dangers including an year term limit on justices and appointment of a justice in each odd year unless the Senate voted against the appointment br Highlights of his testimony include br br Any attempt to increase the size of the Court would be widely and correctly be regarded as a partisan interference with the independence of the Court It is no exaggeration to say that this would destroy one of the central features of our constitutional system the independent judiciary br This McConnell s proposal if adopted would have several salutary effects It would make the power of the president to name Supreme Court justices regular fair and consistent and thus likely would lower the political stakes of each nomination The political balance of the Court would reflect the opinions of the people over time as expressed in their choice of presidents and senators rather than the happenstance of health or accident or the strategic timing of the justices br br br
