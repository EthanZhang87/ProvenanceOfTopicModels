downloaded by only a handful of Fishman s Russian speaking friends Apple launched push notifications allowing users to be pinged even when not using the app br Koum updated WhatsApp so that everyone in the user s network would be notified when a user s status changed This new facility to Koum s surprise was used by users to ping each other with jokey custom statuses like I woke up late or I m on my way br Fishman said At some point it sort of became instant messaging br WhatsApp released for iPhone in August featured a purpose designed messaging component the number of active users suddenly increased to br Although Acton was working on another startup idea he decided to join the company In October Acton persuaded five former friends at Yahoo to invest in seed funding and Acton became a
