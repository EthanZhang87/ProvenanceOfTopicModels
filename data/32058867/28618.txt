Speech coding is an application of data compression to digital audio signals containing speech Speech coding uses speech specific parameter estimation using audio signal processing techniques to model the speech signal combined with generic data compression algorithms to represent the resulting modeled parameters in a compact bitstream br Common applications of speech coding are mobile telephony and voice over IP VoIP The most widely used speech coding technique in mobile telephony is linear predictive coding LPC while the most widely used in VoIP applications are the LPC and modified discrete cosine transform MDCT techniques br The techniques employed in speech coding are similar to those used in audio data compression and audio coding where appreciation of psychoacoustics is used to transmit only data that is relevant to the human auditory system For example in voiceband speech coding only information in the frequency band to Hz is transmitted but the reconstructed signal retains adequate intelligibility br Speech coding differs from other forms of audio coding in that speech is a simpler signal than other audio signals and statistical information is available about the properties of speech As a result some auditory information that is relevant in general audio coding can be unnecessary in the speech coding context Speech coding stresses the preservation of intelligibility and pleasantness of speech while using a constrained amount of transmitted data In addition most speech applications require low coding delay as latency interferes with speech

earlier precursor of speech encoding requiring only bits per sample but giving effectively bits of resolution Logarithmic companding are consistent with human hearing perception in that a low amplitude noise is heard along a low amplitude speech signal but is masked by a high amplitude one Although this would generate unacceptable distortion in a music signal the peaky nature of speech waveforms combined with the simple frequency structure of speech as a periodic waveform having a single fundamental frequency with occasional added noise bursts make these very simple instantaneous compression algorithms acceptable for speech br A wide variety of other algorithms were tried at the time mostly delta modulation variants but after careful consideration the A law law algorithms were chosen by the designers of the early digital telephony systems At the time of their design their bandwidth reduction for a very low complexity made an excellent engineering compromise Their audio performance remains acceptable and there was no need to replace them in the stationary phone network br In G codec which has a scalable structure was standardized by ITU T The input sampling rate is kHz br br br Modern speech compression br Much of the later work in speech compression was motivated by military research into digital communications for secure military radios where very low data rates were used to achieve effective operation in a hostile radio environment At the same time far more processing power was available in the form of VLSI circuits than was available for earlier compression techniques As a result modern speech compression algorithms could use far more complex techniques than were available in the s to achieve far higher compression ratios br The most widely used speech coding algorithms are based on linear predictive coding LPC In particular the most common speech coding scheme is the LPC based code excited linear prediction CELP coding which is used for example in the GSM standard In CELP the modeling is divided in two stages a linear predictive stage that models the spectral envelope and a code book based model of the residual of the linear predictive model In CELP linear prediction coefficients LPC are computed and quantized usually as line spectral pairs LSPs In addition to the actual speech coding of the signal it is often necessary to use channel coding for transmission to avoid losses due to transmission errors In order to get the best overall coding results speech coding and channel coding methods are chosen in pairs with the more important bits in the speech data stream protected by more robust channel coding br The modified discrete cosine transform MDCT is used in the LD MDCT technique used by the AAC LD format introduced in MDCT has since been widely adopted in voice over IP VoIP applications such as the G wideband audio codec introduced in Apple s FaceTime using AAC LD introduced in and the CELT codec introduced in br Opus is a free software audio coder It combines the speech oriented LPC based SILK algorithm and the lower latency MDCT based CELT algorithm switching between or combining them as needed for maximal efficiency It is widely used for VoIP calls in WhatsApp The PlayStation video game console also uses Opus for its PlayStation Network system party chat br A number of codecs with even lower bit rates have been demonstrated Codec which operates at bit rates as low as bit s sees use in amateur radio NATO currently uses MELPe offering intelligible speech at bit s and below Neural vocoder approaches have also emerged Lyra by Google gives an almost eerie quality at kbit s Microsoft s Satin also uses machine learning but uses a higher tunable bitrate and is wideband br br br Sub
