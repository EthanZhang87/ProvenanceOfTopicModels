executive officer and chief financial officer respectively Eberhard said that he wanted to build a car manufacturer that is also a technology company with its core technologies as the battery the computer software and the proprietary motor br Ian Wright was Tesla s third employee joining a few months later In February the company raised US million equivalent to million in in series A funding including million equivalent to million in from Elon Musk who had received million from the sale of his interest in PayPal two years earlier Musk became the chairman of the board of directors and the largest shareholder of Tesla J B Straubel joined Tesla in May as chief technical officer br A lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla in September allows all five Eberhard Tarpenning Wright Musk and Straubel to call themselves co founders br br br Roadster br br Elon Musk took an active role within the company but was not deeply involved in day to day business operations The company s strategy was to start with a premium sports car aimed at early adopters and then move into more mainstream vehicles including sedans and affordable compacts br In February Musk led Tesla s Series B venture capital funding round of million which added Valor Equity Partners to the funding team Musk co led the third million round in May which saw investment from prominent entrepreneurs including Google co founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page and former eBay President Jeff Skoll A fourth round worth million in May brought the total private financing investment to over million br In August Eberhard was asked by the board led by Elon Musk to step down as CEO Eberhard then took the title of President of Technology before ultimately leaving the company in January Co founder Marc Tarpenning who served as the Vice President of Electrical Engineering of the company also left the company in January In August Michael Marks was brought in as interim CEO and in December Ze ev Drori became CEO and President Musk succeeded Drori as CEO in October In June Eberhard filed a lawsuit against Musk for allegedly forcing him out The case was dismissed in August br Tesla began production of the Roadster in inside the service bays of a former Chevrolet dealership in Menlo Park By January Tesla had raised million and delivered cars Musk had contributed million of his own money to the company br In June Tesla was approved to receive million in interest bearing loans from the United States Department of Energy The funding part of the billion Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program supported the engineering and production of the Model S sedan as well as the development of commercial powertrain technology Tesla repaid the loan in May with million in interest br br br IPO Model S and Model X br br In May Tesla purchased the NUMMI plant in Fremont California from Toyota for million On June the company went public via an initial public offering IPO on the NASDAQ the first American car company to do so since the Ford Motor Company had its IPO in The company issued million shares of common stock at a price of per share raising million br In October Tesla opened the Tesla Factory to start production of the Model S In January Tesla ceased production of the Roadster and in June the company launched its second car the Model S luxury sedan The Model S won several automotive awards during and including the Motor Trend Car of the Year and became the first electric car to top the monthly sales ranking of a country when it topped the Norwegian new car sales list in September The Model S was also the best selling plug in electric car worldwide for the years and br On July Tesla became a NASDAQ company br Tesla announced the Tesla Autopilot a driver assistance system in In September that year all Tesla cars started shipping with sensors and software to support the feature with what would later be called hardware version br Tesla entered the energy storage market unveiling its Tesla Powerwall home and Tesla Powerpack business battery packs in April The company received orders valued at million within a week of the unveiling br Tesla began shipping its third vehicle the luxury SUV Tesla Model X in September which had pre orders at the time br br br SolarCity and Model br Tesla entered the solar installation business in November with the purchase of SolarCity in an all stock billion deal The business was merged with Tesla s existing battery energy storage products division to form the Tesla Energy subsidiary The deal was controversial because at the time of the acquisition SolarCity was facing liquidity issues of which Tesla s shareholders were not informed In February Tesla Motors changed its name to Tesla Inc to better reflect the scope of its expanded business br Tesla unveiled its first mass market vehicle in April the Model sedan The Model was less expensive than Tesla s previous three vehicles and within a week the company received over paid reservations In an effort to speed up production and control costs Tesla invested heavily in robotics and automation to assemble the Model but the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles This led to significant delays and production problems a period which the company described as production hell By the end of the production problems had been overcome and the Model became the world s best selling electric car from to br This period of production hell put significant financial pressure on Tesla and during this time it became one of the most shorted companies in the stock market On August amid the financial issues Musk posted on social media that he was considering taking Tesla private The plan did not materialize and gave rise to much controversy and many lawsuits including a securities fraud charge from the SEC which would force Musk to pay a million fine and step down as the company s chairman although he was allowed to remain the CEO br br br Global expansion and Model Y present br From July to June Tesla reported four consecutive profitable quarters for the first time which made it eligible for inclusion in the S P During its share price increased and by December its market capitalization was more than the next nine largest automakers combined and it became the sixth most valuable company in the US Tesla was added to the S P index on December it was the most valuable company ever added and was the sixth largest member of the index immediately after it was added br Tesla introduced its second mass market vehicle in March the Model Y mid size crossover SUV based on the Model Deliveries started in March br During this period Tesla invested heavily in expanding its production capacity opening three new Gigafactories in quick succession Construction of Gigafactory Shanghai started in January as the first automobile factory in China fully owned by a foreign company not a joint venture Its first production vehicle a Model rolled out of the factory in December less than one year after groundbreaking Gigafactory Berlin Brandenburg broke ground in February and its production of the Model Y began in March Gigafactory Texas broke ground in June its production of the Model Y began in April and it produced the first Cybertruck in November In March Tesla announced plans for a Gigafactory Mexico to open in br At the beginning of the COVID pandemic Tesla closed the Fremont Factory in March due to California state and Alameda county COVID restrictions When California lifted restrictions but the county did not Tesla sued the county and restarted production on May The county lifted restrictions on May and Tesla dropped its lawsuit After the dispute with county officials on December Tesla moved its legal headquarters to Gigafactory Texas However Tesla continued to use its former headquarters building in Palo Alto and over the next two years significantly expanded its footprint in California The company opened its Megafactory to build Megapack batteries in Lathrop California in and announced in February that it would establish a large global engineering headquarters in Palo Alto moving into a corporate campus once owned by Hewlett Packard br In early Tesla became a major investor in bitcoin acquiring billion of the cryptocurrency and on March the company started accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for US vehicle purchases However after days the company ended bitcoin payments over concerns that the production of bitcoin was contributing to the consumption of fossil fuels against the company s mission of encouraging the transition to sustainable energy After the announcement the price of bitcoin dropped around Tesla CEO Elon Musk later noted that Tesla would resume Bitcoin payments if there was confirmation of at least clean energy usage by Bitcoin miners Despite later reaching this milestone Tesla did not return to accepting Bitcoin By July Tesla had sold about of its bitcoin holdings at a loss citing that the cryptocurrency was hurting the company s profitability br Between May and February almost all major North America EV manufacturers announced plans to switch to Tesla s North American Charging Standard adapters on their EVs by which is expected to be a stable source of recurring revenue for Tesla br In April the company announced it was laying off of its employees br br br Automotive products and services br br As of November Tesla offers six vehicle models Model S Model X Model Model Y Tesla Semi and Cybertruck Tesla s first vehicle the first

navigation using a cellular connection For a fee Tesla offers a subscription to Premium Connectivity which adds live traffic and satellite maps to navigation internet browsing and media streaming br br br Vehicle servicing br Tesla s strategy is to service its vehicles first through remote diagnosis and repair If it is not possible to resolve a problem remotely a mobile technician is dispatched or customers are referred to a local Tesla owned service center Tesla has said that it does not want to make a profit on vehicle servicing which has traditionally been a large profit center for most auto dealerships br In Tesla recommended having any Tesla car inspected every miles or once a year whichever comes first In early the manual was changed to say your Tesla does not require annual maintenance and regular fluid changes and instead it recommends periodic servicing of the brake fluid air conditioning tires and air filters br br br Charging services br br br Supercharger network br br Supercharger is the branding used by Tesla for its high voltage direct current fast chargers br br br Destination charging location network br br Tesla also has a network of Destination Chargers slower than Superchargers and intended for locations where customers are expected to park and stay for several hours such as hotels restaurants or shopping centers Unlike the Supercharger network Tesla does not own the destination chargers instead property owners set up the devices and set pricing When the network first launched in Tesla provided free charging equipment and covered installation costs One of the largest providers is hotel chain Hilton Worldwide which in announced an agreement with Tesla to install chargers across of its properties in North America by br br br Insurance services br Tesla has offered its own vehicle insurance in the United States since and has been acting as an independent insurance producer since as Tesla Insurance Services Inc It was introduced after the American Automobile Association AAA a major insurance carrier raised rates for Tesla owners in June after a report concluded that the automakers vehicles crashed more often and were more expensive to repair than comparable vehicles A study in based on data from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety confirmed the findings br The company says that it uniquely understands its vehicles technology and repair costs and can eliminate traditional insurance carriers additional charges In states where allowed the company uses individual vehicle data to offer personalized pricing that can increase or decrease in cost based on the prior month s driving safety score br As of January Tesla offers insurance in the U S states of Arizona California Colorado Illinois Maryland Minnesota Nevada Ohio Oregon Texas Utah and Virginia The company also offers insurance for non Tesla vehicles owned by Tesla owners br br br Energy products br br Tesla subsidiary Tesla Energy develops builds sells and installs solar energy generation systems and battery energy storage products as well as related products and services to residential commercial and industrial customers The subsidiary was created by the merger of Tesla s existing battery energy storage products division with SolarCity a solar energy company that Tesla acquired in In the company deployed gigawatt hours of battery energy storage products an increase of over but only deployed solar energy systems capable of generating megawatts a decrease of over br Tesla Energy products include solar panels built by other companies for Tesla the Tesla Solar Roof a solar shingle system and the Tesla Solar Inverter Storage products include the Powerwall a home energy storage device and the Megapack a large scale energy storage system br For large scale customers Tesla Energy operates an online platform which allows for automated real time power trading demand forecasting and product control In March the company said its online products were managing over GWh of storage For home customers the company operates a virtual power company in Texas called Tesla Electric which utilizes the company s online platforms to manage customers Powerwall devices discharging them into the grid to sell power when prices are high earning money for customers br br br Business strategy br br At the time of Tesla s founding in electric vehicles were very expensive In Elon Musk stated that Tesla s strategy was to first produce high price low volume vehicles such as sports cars for which customers are less sensitive to price This would allow them to progressively bring down the cost of batteries which in turn would allow them to offer cheaper and higher volume cars Tesla s first vehicle the Roadster was low volume fewer than were produced and priced at over The next models the Model S and Model X are more affordable but still luxury vehicles The most recent models the Model and the Model Y are priced still lower and aimed at a higher volume market selling over vehicles each quarter Tesla continuously updates the hardware of its cars rather than waiting for a new model year as opposed to nearly every other car manufacturer br Unlike other automakers Tesla does not rely on franchised dealerships to sell vehicles Instead the company directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company owned stores The company is the first automaker in the United States to sell cars directly to consumers Some jurisdictions particularly in the United States prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers In these areas Tesla has locations that it calls galleries that the company says educate and inform customers about our products but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles In total Tesla operates nearly stores and galleries in more than countries These locations are typically located in retail shopping districts inside shopping malls or other high traffic areas instead of near other auto dealerships br Analysts describe Tesla as vertically integrated given how it develops many components in house such as batteries motors and software The practice of vertical integration is rare in the automotive industry where companies typically outsource of components to suppliers and focus on engine manufacturing and final assembly br Tesla generally allows its competitors to license its technology stating that it wants to help its competitors accelerate the world s use of sustainable energy Licensing agreements include provisions whereby the recipient agrees not to file patent suits against Tesla or to copy its designs directly Tesla retains control of its other intellectual property such as trademarks and trade secrets to prevent direct copying of its technology br On April Tesla secured a deal with Tata Electronics to supply semiconductor chips marking a significant step in Tesla s expansion into India s automotive market br On May Tesla announced that it has abandoned its plan for next generation gigacasting a cutting edge manufacturing technique Initially aiming to revolutionize production and reduce costs Tesla has now opted for its more proven method of casting vehicle underbodies in three pieces This strategic shift reflects the company s focus on self driving vehicles and adjusting to market challenges br br br Technology br Tesla is highly vertically integrated and develops many components in house such as batteries motors and software br br br Batteries br br As of Tesla uses four different battery cell form factors and prismatic br Tesla purchases these batteries from three suppliers CATL LG Energy Solution and Panasonic the latter of which has co located some of its battery production inside Tesla s Gigafactory Nevada Tesla is also currently building out the capacity to produce its own batteries br Tesla batteries sit under the vehicle floor to save interior space Tesla uses a multi part aluminum and titanium protection system to protect the battery from road debris and or vehicle crashes br Business analysis company BloombergNEF estimated Tesla s battery pack cost in at per kilowatt hour kWh versus an industry average of per kWh br br br br Tesla was the first automaker to use cylindrical lithium ion battery cells When it built the first generation Roadster it used off the shelf type mm diameter mm height cylindrical batteries that were already used for other consumer electronics The cells provided an engineering challenge because each has a relatively low capacity so thousands needed to be bundled together in a battery pack Electrical and thermal management also proved to be a challenge requiring liquid cooling and an intumescent fire prevention chemical However the decision proved to be pragmatic because there was already a mature manufacturing process that could produce a high volume of the cells at a consistent quality Although the type cells are the oldest technology they are used in the Model S and X vehicles Tesla sources these batteries with a nickel cobalt aluminum NCA cathode chemistry from Panasonic s factories in Japan br br br br The next battery type to be used was type mm diameter mm height cylindrical cell The larger size was optimized for electric cars allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack The was introduced for the Model and Y vehicles br For vehicles built at the Tesla Fremont Factory the company sources type batteries with a nickel cobalt aluminum cathode chemistry from Panasonic s production line at Gigafactory Nevada In January Panasonic had the capacity to produce GWh per year of battery cells there Tesla Energy also uses cells in its Powerwall home energy storage product br For vehicles made at Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory Berlin Brandenburg batteries with a nickel cobalt manganese NMC cathode chemistry are sourced from LG Energy Solution s factories in China br br br br Tesla s latest cylindrical cell design is the type mm diameter mm height introduced in The battery was developed in house by Tesla and is physically times bigger than the type again allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack Currently Tesla builds the cells itself and has not disclosed the cathode chemistry The company has already opened production lines in Fremont California and plans to open lines inside Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Texas The cells are used in the Model Y and Cybertruck built at Gigafactory Texas br br br Prismatic br Tesla also uses prismatic rectangular cells in many entry level Model and Model Y vehicles The prismatic cells are a lithium iron phosphate battery LFP or LiFePO which is a less energy dense type but do not contain any nickel or cobalt which makes it less expensive to produce Tesla sources these batteries from CATL s factories in China As of April nearly half of Tesla s vehicle production used prismatic cells Tesla Energy also uses prismatic cells in its Megapack grid scale energy storage product br br br Research br Tesla invests in lithium ion battery research In the company established a year battery research and development partnership at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia Canada with lead researcher Jeff Dahn Tesla acquired Maxwell Technologies for over million and sold in It also acquired Hibar Systems Tesla purchased several battery manufacturing patent applications from Springpower International a small Canadian battery company br br br Software br Tesla uses over the air updates to deliver updates to vehicles adding features or fixing problems This is enabled by tight integration between a few powerful onboard computers compared to the way automakers had previously handled technology by purchasing off the shelf electronic components for each subsystem that typically could not interface at the software level br The system also has allowed Tesla to control which features customers have access to For example for ease of assembly all Model vehicles were built with heated rear seats but only customers who purchased a premium interior could turn them on However Tesla has allowed customers who didn t pay for a premium interior to purchase access to the heated rear seats Tesla uses a similar software lock feature for Enhanced Autopilot and Full Self Driving features even though all vehicles are equipped with the computers and cameras necessary to enable those features br br br Motors br Tesla makes two kinds of electric motors an induction motor and an IPM SynRM motor br The older design is a three phase four pole alternating current induction motor also called an asynchronous motor with a copper rotor which inspired the Tesla logo These motors use electromagnetic induction by varying magnetic field to produce torque Induction motors are used as the rear motor in the Model S and Model X as the front motor in the Model and Model Y and were used in the first generation Roadster br Since the introduction of the Model in Tesla has also been building motors that use internal permanent magnets IPM with synchronous reluctance motor SynRM characteristics These motors uses an iron rotor with slots cut into the metal where magnets are inserted in the internal core As an IPM motor it produces excellent starting torque however performance declines at high speeds due to counter electromotive forces For high speed operation Tesla engineers used iron s reluctance property which allows it to spin in synchronization with the magnetic field of the stator if channels are cut into the core These channels were also an ideal internal location for the permanent magnets to be mounted The IPM SynRM motor is currently used as the rear motor in the Model and Model Y the front motor of onward versions of the Model S and X and are expected to be used in the Tesla Semi br br br North American Charging Standard br br The North American Charging Standard NACS is an electric vehicle charging connector system developed by Tesla It has been used on all North American market Tesla vehicles since and was opened for use to other manufacturers in Since then nearly every other vehicle manufacturer has announced that starting from their electric vehicles sold in North America will be equipped with the NACS charge port Several electric vehicle charging network operators and equipment manufacturers have also announced plans to add NACS connectors br br br Autopilot and Full Self Driving br br br Robotics br In preparation for Model production Tesla heavily invested in robotics and automation for vehicle assembly To that end between and the company purchased several companies involved in automation and robotics including Compass Automation Grohmann Automation Perbix Machine Company and Riviera Tool and Die Elon Musk later admitted that the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles br Subsequently the shifted towards utilizing massive casting machines known as Giga Presses These machines streamline production by creating large single piece underbodies leading to reductions in production time labor costs factory footprint and the number of welding robots previously required Critics note that reducing the number of components makes the vehicles harder or more expensive to repair after an accident br The company has been developing a humanoid robot called Optimus since Musk has stated that Optimus leverages the same core software powering Tesla s Full Self Driving technology and has suggested that it could be used within Tesla s factories to mitigate labor shortages through the automation of repetitive tasks br br br Glass br In November the company announced the Tesla Glass technology group The group produced the roof glass for the Tesla Model It also produces the glass used in the Tesla Solar Roof s solar shingles br br br Facilities br br The company operates seven large factories and about a dozen smaller factories around the world As of the company also operates more than retail stores galleries service delivery and body shop locations globally br br br North America br br Tesla was founded in San Carlos California in In the company opened its first production facility at a former Chevrolet dealership in Menlo Park California The original roadster was assembled inside the service bays until and used the company showroom as a retail store Another retail store was opened in Los Angeles the same year In Tesla moved its corporate headquarters and opened a powertrain development facility in Palo Alto br Tesla s first major assembly plant occupies the former NUMMI plant in Fremont California known as the Tesla Fremont Factory The factory was originally opened by General Motors in and then operated by NUMMI a joint venture of GM and Toyota from The joint venture ended when GM entered bankruptcy in In Toyota agreed to sell the plant to Tesla at a significant discount br br Tesla s first purpose built facility was opened in Nevada in Gigafactory Nevada produces the Powerwall battery cells in partnership with Panasonic Model drivetrains and the Tesla Semi The factory received substantial subsidies abatements and credits from the local and state government that in exchange for opening in their jurisdiction allowed Tesla to operate essentially tax free for years later extended to years in exchange for expanding the factory to add a production line for the Tesla Semi and add additional battery manufacturing capacity br As part of the acquisition of SolarCity in Tesla gained control of Gigafactory New York in Buffalo on the site of a former Republic Steel plant The state of New York spent cash to build and equip the factory through the Buffalo Billion program In the factory started production of the Tesla Solar Roof but faced multiple production challenges Since Tesla has also assembled Superchargers in New York The plant has been criticized for offering little economic benefit for the state funding br In Tesla assembled tension fabric buildings at the Fremont plant to meet production goals of cars produced a month The structure was assembled in two weeks and measured feet high feet wide and feet long br br On July Tesla picked Austin Texas as the site of its fifth Gigafactory since then known as Gigafactory Texas Giga Texas is the only factory that produces the Tesla Cybertruck and produces Model Y cars for the Eastern United States On December Tesla announced

while working at Tesla s Fremont factory They accused the company of facilitating a culture of rampant sexual harassment The women said they were consistently subjected to catcalling unwanted advances unwanted touching and discrimination while at work I was so tired of the unwanted attention and the males gawking at me I proceeded to create barriers around me just so I could get some relief Brooks told The Washington Post That was something I felt necessary just so I can do my job Stories range from intimate groping to being called out to the parking lot for sex br Women feared calling Human Resources for help as their supervisors were often participants Musk himself is not indicted but most of the women pressing charges believe their abuse is connected to the behavior of CEO Elon Musk They cite his crude remarks about women s bodies wisecracks about starting a university that abbreviated to T IT S and his generally dismissive attitude towards reporting sexual harassment What we re addressing for each of the lawsuits is just a shocking pattern of rampant harassment that exists at Tesla said attorney David A Lowe In another woman had accused Tesla of very similar behavior and was subsequently fired In a statement to the Guardian Tesla confirmed the company had fired her saying it had thoroughly investigated the employee s allegations with the help of a neutral third party expert and concluded her complaints were unmerited br In May a California judge ruled that the sexual harassment lawsuit could move to court rejecting Tesla s request for closed door arbitration br br

customers about our products but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles This is because some jurisdictions particularly in the United States prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers Dealership associations have filed lawsuits to prevent direct sales These associations argued that the franchise system protects consumers by encouraging dealers
