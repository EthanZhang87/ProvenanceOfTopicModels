The Drug Enforcement Administration DEA is a United States federal law enforcement agency under the U S Department of Justice tasked with combating illicit drug trafficking and distribution within the U S It is the lead agency for domestic enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act sharing concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation the U S Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U S Customs and Border Protection However the DEA has sole responsibility for coordinating and pursuing U S drug investigations both domestically and internationally br It was established in as part of the U S government s war on drugs The DEA has an intelligence unit that is also a member of the U S Intelligence Community While the unit is part of the DEA chain of command it also reports to the Director of National Intelligence The DEA has been criticized for scheduling drugs that have medical uses and for focusing on operations that allow it to seize money rather than those involving drugs that cause more harm br br br History and mandate br The Drug Enforcement Administration was established on July by Reorganization Plan No of signed by President Richard Nixon on July It proposed the creation of a single federal agency to enforce the federal drug laws as well as consolidate and coordinate the government s drug control activities Congress accepted the proposal as they were concerned with the growing availability of drugs As a result the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs BNDD the Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement ODALE approximately Special Agents of the Bureau of Customs Customs Agency Service and other federal offices merged to create the DEA br The DEA is the primary federal agency charged with implementing and enforcing the Controlled Substances Act CSA It is responsible for drugs listed in the CSA s five drug Schedules categories that rank drugs by their potential for harm and whether they have a medical use The CSA seeks to ensure legitimate access to controlled pharmaceuticals while preventing illicit use of controlled drugs To these ends the DEA implements two intersecting legal schemes created by the CSA registration provisions for entities involved in legal activities violations of which are not usually criminal offenses and trafficking provisions for illegal activities violations of which are criminal offenses br From the early s DEA headquarters was located at I Eye Street NW in downtown Washington D C With the overall growth of the agency in the s owing to the increased emphasis on federal drug law enforcement efforts and concurrent growth in the headquarters staff DEA began to search for a new headquarters location locations in Arkansas Mississippi and various abandoned military bases around the United States were considered However then Attorney General Edwin Meese determined that the headquarters had to be located close to the Attorney General s office Thus in the headquarters relocated to Army Navy Drive in the Pentagon City area of Arlington County Virginia near the eponymous Metro station br br On April Timothy McVeigh carried out a terrorist attack on the Alfred P Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City He was targetting regional offices for the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives ATF and DEA all of which had carried out raids that he viewed as unjustified intrusions on the rights of the people This attack caused the deaths of two DEA employees one task force member and two contractors in the Oklahoma City bombing Subsequently the DEA headquarters complex was classified as a Level IV installation under United States federal building security standards meaning it was to be considered a high risk law enforcement target for terrorists Security measures include hydraulic steel roadplates to enforce standoff distance from the building metal detectors and guard stations br In February the DEA established a Digital Evidence Laboratory within its Office of Forensic Sciences br br br Organization br br The DEA is headed by an Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the U S Senate The Administrator reports to the Attorney General through the Deputy Attorney General The administrator is assisted by a deputy administrator the chief of operations the chief inspector and three assistant administrators for the Operations Support Intelligence and Human Resources divisions Other senior staff includes the chief financial officer and the chief counsel The administrator and deputy administrator are the only presidentially appointed personnel in the DEA all other DEA officials are career government employees DEA s headquarters is located in Arlington County Virginia across from The Pentagon It maintains its own DEA Academy located on the Marine Corps Base Quantico at Quantico Virginia alongside the FBI Academy As of it maintains domestic offices in divisions and foreign offices in countries With a budget exceeding billion DEA employs people including Special Agents and Intelligence Analysts Becoming a Special Agent or Intelligence Analyst with the DEA is a competitive process br c its headquarters and the DEA Museum were in square feet m in Lincoln Place a rented office building in Pentagon City in Arlington County Virginia In September this lease was scheduled to end The General Services Administration GSA circa was checking to see where in Northern Virginia the DEA could be headquartered In the government of the United States extended the lease at Lincoln Place now to expire circa The DEA administration favored retaining the original location br br br Structure br Administrator br Deputy

br br As of there were special agents employed by the Drug Enforcement Administration DEA agents starting salary is After four years the salary rises to above br After receiving a conditional offer of employment recruits must then complete an week rigorous training which includes lessons in firearms proficiency including basic marksmanship weapons safety tactical shooting and deadly force decision training To graduate students must maintain an academic average of percent on academic examinations pass the firearms qualification test successfully demonstrate leadership and sound decision making in practical scenarios and pass rigorous physical task tests Upon graduation recruits earn the title of DEA Special Agent br The DEA excludes from consideration job applicants who have a history of any use of narcotics or illicit drugs Investigation usually includes a polygraph test for special agent diversion investigator and intelligence research specialist positions br br Applicants who are found through investigation or personal admission to have experimented with or used narcotics or dangerous drugs except those medically prescribed will not be considered for employment with the Drug Enforcement Administration DEA Exceptions to this policy may be made for applicants who admit to limited youthful and experimental use of marijuana Such applicants may be considered for employment if there is no evidence of regular confirmed usage and the full field background investigation and results of the other steps in the process are otherwise favorable br The DEA s relatively firm stance on this issue contrasts with that of the Federal Bureau of Investigation which in considered relaxing its hiring policy relevant to individual drug use history br br br Aviation Division br br The DEA Aviation Division or Office of Aviation Operations OA formerly Aviation Section is an airborne division based in Perot Field Fort Worth Alliance Airport Texas The current OA fleet consists of aircraft and DEA pilots br The DEA shares a communications system with the Department of Defense for communication with state and regional enforcement independent of the Department of Justice and police information systems and is coordinated by an information command center called the El Paso Intelligence Center EPIC near El Paso Texas br br br Special Response Teams br br Rapid Response Teams RRT previously known as Foreign Deployed Advisory and Support Teams FAST were decommissioned by DEA Acting Administrator Chuck Rosenburg in March via memorandum A need for domestic high risk service teams led to the hybrid creation of specialized tactical units residing within various geographical regions throughout the United States br DEA officially created and standardized its Special Response Team SRT program in The SRT was designed as a stop gap between tactical operations conducted by field agents and those necessitating specialized tactics as a result of elevated risks SRT operators are highly trained in various weapons systems and entry tactics maneuvers Because of the clandestine nature of the DEA mission SRT training protocols and activation requirements are highly sensitive and not available to the public Some of the SRT missions consist of high risk arrests vehicle assaults air assault infiltration specialized surveillance custody of high profile individuals dignitary and witness protection tactical surveillance and interdiction advanced breaching tactical training to other police units and urban and rural fugitive searches Covertly located throughout the nation DEA SRT teams are available to respond to practically any CONUS geographical area with little to no preparation or notification The DEA SRT has been involved in several high profile operations in recent years however DEA involvement is often not publicized due to operational and intelligence considerations Considered one of the most covert outfits in federal law enforcement very little is known about DEA SRT capabilities and its operator selection process br In the past DEA had other tactical teams like the High risk Entry Apprehension Teams HEAT in some Field Divisions and Operation Snowcap Teams predecessor of FAST The teams administered by the Mobile Enforcement Section the Mobile Enforcement Teams MET and Regional Enforcement Teams RET were mobile investigative units intended to deploy resources to state and local agencies MET or DEA Field Divisions RET in need of assistance with a particular investigation or trafficking group These programs ended in the early s br br br Special Operations Division br The DEA Special Operations Division SOD is a division within the DEA which forwards information from wiretaps intercepts and databases from various sources to federal agents and local law enforcement officials The SOD came under scrutiny following the s global surveillance disclosures br br br Domestic Cannabis Eradication Suppression Program br The Domestic Cannabis Eradication Suppression Program DCE SP began funding eradication programs in Hawaii and California in The program rapidly expanded to include programs in states by By all states were participating in the DCE SP In the DCE SP was responsible for the eradication of cultivated outdoor cannabis plants and indoor plants for a total of marijuana plants In addition the DCE SP accounted for arrests and the seizure in excess of million of cultivator assets br In the DEA spent to eradicate marijuana plants in Utah though they did not find a single marijuana plant Federal documents obtained by journalist Drew Atkins detail the DEA s continuing efforts to spend upwards of million per year to completely eradicate marijuana within the United States despite the government funding allocation reports showing that the Marijuana Eradication Program often leads to the discovery of no marijuana plants This prompted twelve members of Congress to push for the elimination of the program and use the money instead to fund domestic violence prevention and deficit reduction programs br br br Budget br In the DEA budget was billion million was spent on international enforcement and billion was spent on domestic enforcement br br Breaking foreign and domestic sources of supply billion via domestic cannabis eradication suppression domestic enforcement research engineering and technical operations the Foreign Cooperative Investigations Program intelligence operations financial intelligence operational intelligence strategic intelligence and the El Paso Intelligence Center and drug and chemical diversion control br Reduction of drug related crime and violence million funding state and local teams and mobile enforcement teams br Demand reduction million via anti legalization education training for law enforcement personnel youth programs support for community based coalitions and sports drug awareness programs br br br Firearms br DEA agents primary service weapons are the Glock and Glock Remington gauge shotgun and Rock River Arms LAR semi automatic carbine in mm NATO Agents may also qualify to carry a firearm listed on an authorized carry list maintained and updated by the Firearms Training Unit FTU Quantico Virginia br Special Agents may qualify with their own personally owned handguns rifle and shotgun and certain handguns are allowed to be used with permission from the FTU Agents are required to attend tactical and firearms proficiency training quarterly and to qualify with their handguns twice per year The DEA has one of the most challenging handgun qualification courses in all of the federal law enforcement Failure to achieve a passing qualification score is the reason for most Academy dismissals and special agents in the field may have their authority to carry a firearm revoked for failure to qualify br Basic Agent Trainees BATs who fail the initial pistol qualification course of fire are placed in a remedial program to receive additional training In remedial training BATs receive five extra two hour range sessions for a total of more hours of live fire training on their issued sidearm to further aid them in helping pass the pistol qualification After passing their pistol qualification Basic Agent Trainees move on to receive formal training on the DEA s standard issue long guns and will continue to frequently shoot the agency issued sidearms that they have already qualified on In all BATs receive a total of firearms training sessions when combining classroom instruction gear issue and pistol rifle and shotgun live fire training at the DEA Academy They will shoot the qualification courses for all three weapons systems during their initial training but must pass their final qualification attempts only on their Glock pistols to become a Special Agent br br Agents are trained to use shoulder fired weapons such as the Rock River LAR adopted in and the LWRC M A the standard carbine of DEA The Colt mm SMG was previously issued but no longer in service Agents are required to complete a two day hour proficiency course to carry a shoulder weapon on enforcement operations They may carry a Rock River LAR or LWRC carbine as authorized personally owned weapons provided they meet the same training and proficiency standards br br br Impact on the drug trade br br In the DEA seized a reported billion in drug trade related assets and million worth of drugs According to the White House s Office of Drug Control Policy the total value of all of the drugs sold in the U S is as much as billion a year giving the DEA an efficiency rate of less than at intercepting the flow of drugs into and within the United States Critics of the DEA including recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences Milton Friedman prior to his death a member of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition point out that demand for illegal drugs is inelastic the people who are buying drugs will continue to buy them with little regard to price often turning to crime to support expensive drug habits when the drug prices rise One recent study by the DEA showed that the price of cocaine and methamphetamine is the highest it has ever been while the quality of both is at its lowest point ever This is contrary to a collection of data done by the Office of National Drug Control Policy which states that purity of street drugs has increased while price has decreased In contrast to the statistics presented by the DEA the United States Department of Justice released data in showing that purity of methamphetamine was on the rise br br br Registration and licensing br br The DEA has a registration system in place which authorizes anyone to manufacture import export and distribute by filing DEA form Archived November at the Wayback Machine along with medical professionals researchers and manufacturers access to Schedule I drugs as well as Schedules and Authorized registrants apply for and if granted receive a DEA number An entity that has been issued a DEA number is authorized to manufacture drug companies distribute research prescribe doctors pharmacists nurse practitioners and physician assistants etc or dispense pharmacy a controlled substance br br br Diversion control system br Many problems associated with substance use disorders are the result of legitimately manufactured controlled substances being diverted from their lawful purpose into the illicit drug traffic Many of the analgesics depressants and stimulants manufactured for legitimate medical use can often carry the potential for addiction Therefore those scheduled substances have been brought under legal control for prevention and population safety The goal of controls is to ensure that these controlled substances are readily available for medical use while preventing their distribution for illicit distribution and non medical use This can be a difficult task sometimes providing difficulty for legitimate patients and healthcare providers while circumventing illegal trade and consumption of scheduled drugs br Under federal law all businesses which manufacture or distribute controlled drugs all health professionals entitled to dispense administer or prescribe them and all pharmacies entitled to fill prescriptions must register with the DEA Registrants must comply with a series of regulatory requirements relating to drug security records accountability and adherence to standards br All of these investigations are conducted by Diversion Investigators DIs DIs conduct investigations to uncover and investigate suspected sources of diversion and take appropriate civil and administrative actions Prescription Database Management Programs PDMP aid and facilitate investigation and surveillance br br br Fentanyl overdose crisis br In and record overdoses from illicit fentanyl tablets or as a deadly adulterant in heroin have ravaged North America An estimated individuals died of a drug overdose in the United States in the first months of compared with in the same month period in this trend was fueled by synthetic opioids especially illicitly manufactured fentanyl and analogs Furthermore between May and April the estimated number of drug overdose deaths in the United States exceeded over this time period with of deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone the same illicitly manufactured fentanyls and analogs In contrast Europe has seen a decrease from heroin overdoses and a practical absence of illicit synthetic opioids br Fentanyl originally developed in the s by Janssen Pharmaceutica is a potent anesthetic primarily used in hospital or hospice settings In Europe heroin is mainly supplied from Western Asia from Afghanistan and neighboring countries and less likely to be contaminated with fentanyl In North America there are now fewer deaths involving heroin than either meth or cocaine a striking change that has taken place over the last two years as heroin has all but disappeared from some regions Due to the absence of heroin from Asian sources fentanyl laced heroin powder or tablets have filled that void br In October the US reported another record in fentanyl deaths as federal agencies were unable to stem the tide of illicit synthetic drugs entering the US Originally introduced to replace much of the white powder heroin in the Eastern United States the drug continues to move further west Between July December illicitly manufactured fentanyl involved deaths increased sharply in midwestern southern and western jurisdictions br br br MDMA DEA scheduling overturn br In MDMA and its analogues were under review by the American government as a drug with a potential for addiction During this time several public hearings on the new drug were held by the DEA Based on all of the evidence and facts presented at the time the DEA s administrative law judge did not see MDMA and its analogues as being of large concern and recommended that they be placed in Schedule III The DEA administrator expressing concern for addictive potential overruled the recommendation and ruled that MDMA be put in Schedule I the Controlled Substances Act s most restrictive category br br br Rank structure br The following is a listing of the rank structure found within the DEA in ascending order br br Agents br Agent Trainee br Special Agent br Senior Special Agent br Supervising Special Agent br Assistant Special Agent in Charge ASAC br Special Agent in Charge SAC br Management br Assistant Administrator br Associate Deputy Administrator br Deputy Administrator br Principal Deputy Administrator br Chief of Staff br Administrator br br br Criticism and controversies br br The DEA has been criticized for placing highly restrictive schedules on a few drugs that researchers in the fields of pharmacology and medicine regard as having medical uses Critics assert that some such decisions are motivated primarily by political factors stemming from the U S government s War on Drugs and that many benefits of such substances remain unrecognized due to the difficulty of conducting scientific research A counterpoint to that criticism is that under the Controlled Substances Act it is the Department of Health and Human Services through the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institute on Drug Abuse not the DEA which has the legal responsibility to make scientific and medical determinations with respect to drug scheduling no drug can be scheduled if the Secretary of Health and Human Services recommends against it on a scientific or medical basis and no drug can be placed in the most restrictive schedule Schedule I if DHHS finds that the drug has an accepted medical use Jon Gettman s essay Science and the End of Marijuana Prohibition describes the DEA as a fall guy to deflect responsibility from the key decision makers and opines HHS calls the shots when it comes to marijuana prohibition and the cops at DEA and the general over at ONDCP take the heat br The DEA is also criticized for focusing on the operations from which it can seize the most money namely the organized cross border trafficking of marijuana Some individuals contemplating the nature of the DEA s charter advise that based on danger the DEA should be most focused on cocaine Others suggest that based on opiate popularity the DEA should focus much more on prescription opiates used recreationally which critics contend comes first before users switch to heroin br Practitioners who legally prescribe medicine however must possess a valid DEA license According to federal law the budget of the DEA Diversion Control Program is to be paid by these license fees In a three year license cost In the fee for a three year license was Some have likened this approach to license fees unreasonable like making pilot licenses support the entire Federal Aviation Administration FAA budget The renewal fee for as of October is for a three year license br In the DEA estimated that it had over informants without which they could not effectively enforce the controlled substances laws of the United States To gather information agents permitted their informants to buy and sell drugs engage in Medicaid fraud rings and other illicit acts Despite this the DEA claims that they are in compliance with the rules for using informants to gather information about illicit activities br br br Costs br The total budget of the DEA from to according to the agency website was billion The agency had employees in For the year the average cost per arrest made was br br br Civil liberties br Others such as former Republican congressman Ron Paul the Cato Institute The Libertarian Party and the Drug Policy Alliance criticize the very existence of the DEA and the War on Drugs as both hostile and contrary to the concept of civil liberties by arguing that anybody should be free to put any substance they choose into their own bodies for any reason particularly when legal drugs such as alcohol tobacco and prescription drugs are also open to addiction and that any harm caused by a drug user or addict to the general public is a case of conflicting civil rights Recurrently billions of dollars are spent yearly focusing largely on criminal law and demand reduction campaigns which has resulted in the imprisonment of thousands of U S citizens Demand for recreational drugs is somewhat static as the market for most illegal drugs has been saturated forcing the cartels to expand their market to Europe and other areas than the United States United States federal law registers cannabis as a Schedule I drug br br br Incarceration of Daniel Chong br br In April in San Diego California DEA agents detained a student Daniel Chong and left him locked in a holding room for five days The cell contained no food water or bathroom facilities When he was found he had to be hospitalized for several days for a variety of medical problems The incident touched off a national furor resulting in several investigations The incident has been described as a Kafkaesque nightmare a debacle and one of the worst cases of its kind Chong subsequently sued the DEA the government settled the suit for million br br br Department of Justice Smart on Crime Program br On August at the American Bar Association s House of Delegates meeting Attorney General Eric Holder announced the Smart on Crime program which is a sweeping initiative by the Justice Department that in effect renounces several decades of tough on crime anti drug legislation and policies Holder said the program will encourage U S attorneys to charge defendants only with crimes for which the accompanying sentences are better suited to their individual conduct rather than excessive prison terms more appropriate for violent criminals or drug kingpins Running through Holder s statements the increasing economic burden of over incarceration was stressed As of August the Smart on Crime program is not a legislative initiative but an effort limited to the DOJ s policy parameters br br br International events br David Coleman Headley born Daood Sayed Gilani June who was working as an informant for the U S Drug Enforcement Administration DEA simultaneously made periodic trips to Pakistan for LeT training and was one of the main conspirators in the Mumbai attacks br On January Headley then years old was sentenced by U S District Judge Harry Leinenweber of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in Chicago to years in prison for his part in the Mumbai attacks in which at least victims civilians and security personnel and nine attackers were killed Among the dead were foreign nationals from countries One attacker was captured The bodies of many of the dead hostages showed signs of torture or disfigurement A number of those killed were notable figures in business media and security services br The DEA was accused in by the Venezuelan government of collaborating with drug traffickers after which President Hugo Ch vez decided to end any collaboration with the agency In after the U S State Department criticized Venezuela in its annual report on drug trafficking the Venezuelan Minister of Justice reiterated the accusations A large quantity of drug shipments left the country through that organization We were in the presence of a new drug cartel br In his series of articles and subsequent book both titled Dark Alliance journalist Gary Webb asserts that the DEA helped harbor Nicaraguan drug traffickers Notably they allowed Oscar Danilo Bland n political asylum in the USA despite knowledge of his cocaine trafficking organization br The government of Bolivia has also taken similar steps to ban the DEA from operating in the country In September Bolivia drastically reduced diplomatic ties with the United States withdrawing its ambassador from the US and expelling the US ambassador from Bolivia This occurred soon after Bolivian president Evo Morales expelled all DEA agents from the country due to a revolt in the traditional coca growing Chapare Province The Bolivian government claimed that it could not protect the agents and Morales further accused the agency of helping incite the violence which claimed lives National agencies were to take over control of drug management Three years later Bolivia and the US began to restore full diplomatic ties However Morales maintained that the DEA would remain unwelcome in the country characterising it as an affront to Bolivia s dignity and sovereignty br In the Netherlands both the Dutch government and the DEA have been criticized for violations of Dutch sovereignty in drug investigations According to Peter R de Vries a Dutch journalist present at the trial of Henk Orlando Rommy the DEA has admitted to activities on Dutch soil Earlier then Minister of Justice Piet Hein Donner had denied to the Dutch parliament that he had given permission to the DEA for any such activities which would have been a requirement by Dutch law in order to allow foreign agents to act within the territory br The DEA conducted a covert operation over several years in which undercover operatives were sent to Venezuela to build drug trafficking cases against Venezuela s leadership including Nicholas Maduro The plan was part of Operation Money Badger which the DEA and prosecutors in Miami created in It potentially breached Venezuelan and international law and therefore required the approval of the Sensitive Activity Review Committee a secretive panel of senior State and Justice Department officials that oversees the most sensitive DEA cases involving tricky ethical legal or foreign policy considerations br Following the Colombian peace process which brought an end to the Colombian conflict between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia FARC EP the Special Jurisdiction for Peace found that the DEA had plotted with Colombian Attorney General N stor Humberto Mart nez to fabricate drug trafficking charges against Jes s Santrich in a bid to jeopardize the peace agreement by inciting the FARC to take up arms again br br br Special Operations Division fabricated evidence trails br In Reuters published a report about the DEA s Special Operations Division SOD stating that it conceals where an investigative trail about a suspect truly originates from and creates a parallel set of evidence given to prosecutors judges and defense lawyers This DEA program mainly affects common criminals such as drug dealers The concealment of evidence means the defendant is unaware of how his or her investigation began and will be unable to request a review of possible sources of exculpatory evidence Exculpatory evidence may include biased witnesses mistakes or entrapment Nancy Gertner a former federal judge who had served from to and a Harvard Law School professor stated that It is one thing to create special rules for national security Ordinary crime is entirely different It sounds like they are phonying up investigations Andrew O Hehir of Salon wrote that It s the first clear evidence that the special rules and disregard for constitutional law that have characterized the hunt for so called terrorists have crept into the domestic criminal justice system on a significant scale br br br Cannabis rescheduling br A report by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies and the Drug Policy Alliance accuses the DEA of unfairly blocking the removal of cannabis from Schedule I The report alleges that the methods employed by the DEA to achieve this include delaying rescheduling petitions for years overruling DEA administrative law judges and systematically impeding scientific research The DEA continues to refuse the removal of cannabis from Schedule I despite wide scale acceptance of the substance among the medical community including of doctors for the treatment of various diseases br br br Domestic anti drug advocacy br br The DEA in addition to enforcement also regularly engage in advocacy specifically against rescheduling marijuana by publishing policy based papers on certain drugs Some have criticized the DEA for using tax dollars in what they call an attempt to change public opinion which they call an overreach from the scope of the agency s job of enforcement and that by releasing such non peer reviewed reports is a transparent attempt to justify its own activities They have claimed that since the DEA is not by law an advocacy group but a legal enforcement group that those press releases are tantamount to what they consider domestic propaganda br br br Raids on medical marijuana dispensaries br br The DEA has taken a particularly strong stance on enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act on persons and organizations acting within state laws that allow medical cannabis cultivation and distribution DEA agency executive Chuck Rosenberg has made negative statements against patients who use medical marijuana Rosenberg has mentioned that he considers medical marijuana to be a joke As a reaction against the negative statements made by Rosenberg towards medical marijuana an international online petition has been formed More than signatures have been gathered globally with the intention that Rosenberg be fired or forced to resign as head of DEA br The people of California and the County of Santa Cruz have overwhelmingly supported the provision of medical marijuana for people who have serious illnesses county Supervisor Mardi Wormhoudt told the San Francisco Chronicle These people blocking the road are people with AIDS and cancer and other grave illnesses To attack these people who work collectively and have never taken money for their work is outrageous br As a result the Wo Men s Alliance for Medical Marijuana with the City and County of Santa Cruz had sued the DEA Attorney General Michael Mukasey and the ONDCP The most recent court decision rejected the government s motion to dismiss which allowed discovery to move forward The American Civil Liberties Union hailed the decision as a first of its kind ruling br More recently the DEA has escalated its enforcement efforts on the recently proliferated Los Angeles area medical cannabis collectives On July the DEA raided the California Patients Group Hollywood Compassionate Collective and Natural Hybrid NHI Caregivers in Hollywood California Earlier that day the operators of those collectives participated in a press conference with LA City Council members announcing the city s intention to regulate the collectives and asking the DEA to halt raids on collectives while the City drafted regulations The dispensary operator of Natural Hybrid NHI Caregivers was forced to close down the collective due to the tremendous loss caused by the DEA conducted joint task force raid against them br br br Project Cassandra br In the Special Operations part of the agency launched a multi agency effort named Project Cassandra to investigate Hezbollah for allegations of illicit drug trafficking and terrorist financing The investigation identified an Iranian cell in the U S which worked in concert with a Lebanese bank called the Lebanese Canadian Bank to launder money using the purchase of used automobiles exported to Africa Project Cassandra also identified hemispheric drug syndicates involved in cocaine trafficking in order to finance Hezbollah activities The Department of Justice issued several sealed indictments but declined to seize prosecute extradite or further investigate likely targets of these alleged foreign criminal activities operating in the United States due to White House diplomatic objectives involving the international nuclear agreement with Iran On December the Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered a review of prior cases in the project br br br DEA Museum br br In the DEA opened the Drug Enforcement Administration Museum in Arlington County Virginia The original permanent exhibit Illegal Drugs in America A Modern History remains the museum s centerpiece The exhibit features the more than year history of drugs and drug abuse and the DEA including a considerable collection of drug paraphernalia and an image of a smiling drug vendor under the heading Jimmy s Joint
