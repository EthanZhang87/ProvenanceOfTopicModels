OpenVPN is a virtual private network VPN system that implements techniques to create secure point to point or site to site connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote access facilities It implements both client and server applications br OpenVPN allows peers to authenticate each other using pre shared secret keys certificates or username password When used in a multiclient server configuration it allows the server to release an authentication certificate for every client using signatures and certificate authority br It uses the OpenSSL encryption library extensively as well as the TLS protocol and contains many security and control features It uses a custom security protocol that utilizes SSL TLS for key exchange It is capable of traversing network address translators NATs and firewalls br OpenVPN has been ported and embedded to several systems For example DD WRT has the OpenVPN server function SoftEther VPN a multi protocol VPN server also has an implementation of OpenVPN protocol br It was written by James Yonan and is free software released under the terms of the GNU General Public License version GPLv Additionally commercial licenses are available br br br Architecture br br br Encryption br OpenVPN uses the OpenSSL library to provide encryption of both the data and control channels It lets OpenSSL do all the encryption and authentication work allowing OpenVPN to use all the ciphers available in the OpenSSL package It can also use the HMAC packet authentication feature to add an additional layer of security to the connection referred to as an HMAC Firewall by the creator It can also use hardware acceleration to get better encryption performance Support for mbed TLS is available starting from version br br br Authentication br OpenVPN has several ways to authenticate peers with each other OpenVPN offers pre shared keys certificate based and username password based authentication Preshared secret key is the easiest and certificate based is the most robust and feature rich In version username password authentications can be enabled both with or without certificates However to make use of username password authentications OpenVPN depends on third party modules br br br Networking br br OpenVPN can run over User Datagram Protocol UDP or Transmission Control Protocol TCP transports multiplexing created SSL tunnels on a single TCP UDP port RFC for UDP br From x series on OpenVPN fully supports IPv as protocol of the virtual network inside a tunnel and the OpenVPN applications can also establish connections via IPv br It has the ability to work through most proxy servers including HTTP and is good at working through network address translation NAT and getting out through firewalls The server configuration has the ability to push certain network configuration options to the clients These include IP addresses routing commands and a few connection options OpenVPN offers two types of interfaces for networking via the Universal TUN TAP driver It can create either a layer based IP tunnel TUN or a layer based Ethernet TAP that can carry any type of Ethernet traffic OpenVPN can optionally use the LZO compression library to compress the data stream Port is the official IANA assigned port number for OpenVPN Newer versions of the program now default to that port A feature in the version allows for one process to manage several simultaneous tunnels as opposed to the original one tunnel per process restriction on the x series br OpenVPN s use of common network protocols TCP and UDP makes it a desirable alternative to IPsec in situations where an ISP may block specific VPN protocols in order to force users to subscribe to a higher priced business grade service tier For example Comcast previously declared that their Home product was and had always been designated as a residential service and did not allow the use of commercial applications Their argument was that conducting remote work via a VPN can adversely affect the network performance of their regular residential subscribers They offered an alternative Home Professional this would cost more than Home product So anyone wishing to use VPN would have to subscribe to higher priced business grade service tier br When OpenVPN uses Transmission Control Protocol TCP transports to establish a tunnel performance will be acceptable only as long as there is sufficient excess bandwidth on the un tunneled network link to guarantee that the tunneled TCP timers do not expire If this becomes untrue performance falls off dramatically This is known as the TCP meltdown problem br br br Security br OpenVPN offers various internal security features It has up to bit encryption through the OpenSSL library although some service providers may offer lower rates effectively providing some of the fastest VPN available to consumers It runs in userspace instead of requiring IP stack therefore kernel operation OpenVPN has the ability to drop root privileges use mlockall to prevent swapping sensitive data to disk enter a chroot jail after initialization and apply a SELinux context after initialization br OpenVPN runs a custom security protocol based on SSL and TLS rather than supporting IKE IPsec L TP or PPTP br OpenVPN offers support of smart cards via PKCS based cryptographic tokens br br br Extensibility br OpenVPN can be extended with third party plug ins or scripts which can be called at defined entry points The purpose of this is often to extend OpenVPN with more advanced logging enhanced authentication with username and passwords dynamic firewall updates RADIUS integration and so on The plug ins are dynamically loadable modules usually written in C while the scripts interface can execute any scripts or binaries available to OpenVPN In the OpenVPN source code there are some examples of such plug ins including a PAM authentication plug in Several third party plug ins also exist to authenticate against LDAP or SQL databases such as SQLite and MySQL br br br Header br br br Platforms br It is available on Solaris Linux OpenBSD FreeBSD NetBSD QNX macOS and Windows XP and later OpenVPN is available for mobile operating systems including Maemo Windows Mobile and below iOS GS devices jailbroken iOS devices Android devices and Android devices that have had the Cyanogenmod aftermarket firmware flashed or have the correct kernel module installed It is not compatible with some mobile phone OSes including Palm OS It is not a web based VPN shown as a web page such as Citrix or Terminal Services Web access the program is installed independently and configured by editing text files manually rather than through a GUI based wizard OpenVPN is not compatible with VPN clients that use the IPsec over L TP or PPTP protocols The entire package consists of one binary for both client and server connections an optional configuration file and one or more key files depending on the authentication method used br br br Firmware implementations br OpenVPN has been integrated into several router firmware packages allowing users to run OpenVPN in client or server mode from their network routers A router running OpenVPN in client mode for example allows any device on a network to access a VPN without needing the capability to install OpenVPN br Notable firmware packages with OpenVPN integration include br br OpenVPN has also been implemented in some manufacturer router firmware br br br Software implementations br OpenVPN has been integrated into SoftEther VPN an open source multi protocol VPN server to allow users to connect to the VPN server from existing OpenVPN clients br OpenVPN is also integrated into Vyos an open source routing operating system forked from the Vyatta software router br br br Licensing br OpenVPN is available in two versions br br OpenVPN Community Edition which is a free and open source version br OpenVPN Access Server OpenVPN AS is based on the Community Edition but provides additional paid and proprietary features like LDAP integration SMB server Web UI management and provides a set of installation and configuration tools that are reported to simplify the rapid deployment of a VPN remote access solution The Access Server edition relies heavily on iptables for load balancing and it has never been available on Windows for this reason This version is also able to dynamically create client OpenVPN Connect installers which include a client profile for connecting to a particular Access Server instance However the user does not need to have an Access Server client in order to connect to the Access Server instance the client from the OpenVPN Community Edition can be used br br br See also br br OpenConnect br OpenSSH br Secure Socket
