title: COVID-19 misinformation
id: 63055098
False information including intentional disinformation and conspiracy theories about the scale of the COVID pandemic and the origin prevention diagnosis and treatment of the disease has been spread through social media text messaging and mass media False information has been propagated by celebrities politicians and other prominent public figures Many countries have passed laws against fake news and thousands of people have been arrested for spreading COVID misinformation The spread of COVID misinformation by governments has also been significant br Commercial scams have claimed to offer at home tests supposed preventives and miracle cures Several religious groups have claimed their faith will protect them from the virus Without evidence some people have claimed the virus is a bioweapon accidentally or deliberately leaked from a laboratory a population control scheme the result of a spy operation or the side effect of G upgrades to cellular networks br The World Health Organization WHO declared an infodemic of incorrect information about the virus that poses risks to global health While belief in conspiracy theories is not a new phenomenon in the context of the COVID pandemic this can lead to adverse health effects Cognitive biases such as jumping to conclusions and confirmation bias may be linked to the occurrence of conspiracy beliefs Uncertainty among experts when combined with a lack of understanding of the scientific process by laypeople has likewise been a factor amplifying conspiracy theories about the COVID pandemic In addition to health effects harms resulting from the spread of misinformation and endorsement of conspiracy theories include increasing distrust of news organizations and medical authorities as well as divisiveness and political fragmentation br br br Overview br br In January the BBC reported on the developing issue of conspiracy theories and bad health advice regarding COVID Examples at the time included false health advice shared on social media and private chats as well as conspiracy theories such as the outbreak being planned with the participation of the Pirbright Institute In January The Guardian listed seven instances of misinformation adding the conspiracy theories about bioweapons and the link to G technology and including varied false health advice br In an attempt to speed up research sharing many researchers have turned to preprint servers such as arXiv bioRxiv medRxiv and SSRN Papers are uploaded to these servers without peer review or any other editorial process that ensures research quality Some of these papers have contributed to the spread of conspiracy theories Preprints about COVID have been extensively shared online and some data suggest that they have been used by the media almost times more than preprints on other topics br According to a study published by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism most misinformation related to COVID involves various forms of reconfiguration where existing and often true information is spun twisted recontextualised or reworked less misinformation was completely fabricated The study also found that top down misinformation from politicians celebrities and other prominent public figures while accounting for a minority of the samples captured a majority of the social media engagement According to their classification the largest category of misinformation was misleading or false claims about the actions or policies of public authorities including government and international bodies like the WHO or the UN br In addition to social media television and radio have been perceived as sources of misinformation In the early stages of the COVID pandemic in the United States Fox News adopted an editorial line that the emergency response to the pandemic was politically motivated or otherwise unwarranted and presenter Sean Hannity claimed on air that the pandemic was a hoax he later issued a denial When evaluated by media analysts the effect of broadcast misinformation has been found to influence health outcomes in the population In a natural experiment an experiment that takes place spontaneously without human design or intervention two similar television news programs that were shown on the Fox News network in February March were compared One program reported the effects of COVID more seriously while a second program downplayed the threat of COVID The study found that audiences who were exposed to the news downplaying the threat were statistically more susceptible to increased COVID infection rates and death In August television broadcaster Sky News Australia was criticised for posting videos on YouTube containing misleading medical claims about COVID Conservative talk radio in the US has also been perceived as a source of inaccurate or misleading commentary on COVID In August and September several radio hosts who had discouraged COVID vaccination or expressed skepticism toward the COVID vaccine subsequently died from COVID complications among them Dick Farrel Phil Valentine and Bob Enyart br Misinformation on the subject of COVID has been used by politicians interest groups and state actors in many countries for political purposes to avoid responsibility scapegoat other countries and avoid criticism of their earlier decisions Sometimes there is a financial motive as well Multiple countries have been accused of spreading disinformation with state backed operations in the social media in other countries to generate panic sow distrust and undermine democratic debate in other countries or to promote their models of government br A Cornell University study of million articles in English language media around the world found that US President Donald Trump was the single largest driver of the misinformation Analysis published by National Public Radio in December found that as American counties showed higher vote shares for Trump in COVID vaccination rates significantly decreased and death rates significantly increased NPR attributed the findings to misinformation br br br Virus origin br br The consensus among virologists is that the most likely origin of the SARS CoV virus to be natural crossover from animals having spilled over into the human population from bats possibly through an intermediate animal host although the exact transmission pathway has not been determined Genomic evidence suggests an ancestor virus of SARS CoV originated in horseshoe bats br An alternative hypothesis under investigation deemed unlikely by the majority of virologists given a lack of evidence is that the virus may have accidentally escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology in the course of standard research A poll in July found that of US adults believe COVID escaped from a lab br Unsubstantiated speculation and conspiracy theories related to this topic have gained popularity during the pandemic Common conspiracy theories state that the virus was intentionally engineered either as a bio weapon or to profit from the sale of vaccines According to the World Health Organization genetic manipulation has been ruled out by genomic analysis Many other origin stories have also been told ranging from claims of secret plots by political opponents to a conspiracy theory about mobile phones In March the Pew Research Center found that a third of Americans believed COVID had been created in a lab and a quarter thought it had been engineered intentionally The spread of these conspiracy theories is magnified through mutual distrust and animosity as well as nationalism and the use of propaganda campaigns for political purposes br The promotion of misinformation has been used by American far right groups such as QAnon by rightwing outlets such as Fox News by former US President Donald Trump and also other prominent Republicans to stoke anti China sentiments and has led to increased anti Asian activity on social media and in the real world This has also resulted in the bullying of scientists and public health officials both online and in person fueled by a highly political and oftentimes toxic debate on many issues Such spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories has the potential to negatively affect public health and diminish trust in governments and medical professionals br The resurgence of the lab leak and other theories was fueled in part by the publication in May of early emails between National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID director Anthony Fauci and scientists discussing the issue Per the emails in question Kristian Andersen author of one study debunking genomic manipulation theories had heavily considered the possibility and emailed Fauci proposing possible mechanisms before ruling out deliberate manipulation with deeper technical analysis These emails were later misconstrued and used by critics to claim a conspiracy was occurring The ensuing controversy became known as the Proximal Origin However despite claims to the contrary in some US newspapers no new evidence has surfaced to support any theory of a laboratory accident and the majority of peer reviewed research points to a natural origin This parallels previous outbreaks of novel diseases such as HIV SARS and H N which have also been the subject of allegations of laboratory origin br br br Wuhan lab origin br br br Bio weapon br One early source of the bio weapon origin theory was former Israeli secret service officer Dany Shoham who gave an interview to The Washington Times about the biosafety level BSL laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology A scientist from Hong Kong Li Meng Yan fled China and released a preprint stating the virus was modified in a lab rather than having a natural evolution In an ad hoc peer review as the paper was not submitted for traditional peer review as part of the standard scientific publishing process her claims were labelled as misleading unscientific and an unethical promotion of essentially conspiracy theories that are not founded in fact Yan s paper was funded by the Rule of Law Society and the Rule of Law Foundation two non profits linked to Steve Bannon a former Trump strategist and Guo Wengui an expatriate Chinese billionaire This misinformation was further seized on by the American far right who have been known to promote distrust of China In effect this formed a fast growing echo chamber for misinformation The idea of SARS CoV as a lab engineered weapon is an element of the Plandemic conspiracy theory which proposes that it was deliberately released by China br The Epoch Times an anti Chinese Communist Party CCP newspaper affiliated with Falun Gong has spread misinformation related to the COVID pandemic in print and via social media including Facebook and YouTube It has promoted anti CCP rhetoric and conspiracy theories around the coronavirus outbreak for example through an page special edition called How the Chinese Communist Party Endangered the World which was distributed unsolicited in April to mail customers in areas of the United States Canada and Australia In the newspaper the SARS CoV virus is known as the CCP virus and a commentary in the newspaper posed the question is the novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan an accident occasioned by weaponizing the virus at that Wuhan P virology lab The paper s editorial board suggested that COVID patients cure themselves by condemning the CCP and maybe a miracle will happen br In response to the propagation of theories in the US of a Wuhan lab origin the Chinese government promulgated the conspiracy theory that the virus was developed by the United States army at Fort Detrick The conspiracy theory was also promoted by British MP Andrew Bridgen in March br br br Gain of function research br One idea used to support a laboratory origin invokes previous gain of function research on coronaviruses Virologist Angela Rasmussen argued that this is unlikely due to the intense scrutiny and government oversight gain of function research is subject to and that it is improbable that research on hard to obtain coronaviruses could occur under the radar The exact meaning of gain of function is disputed among experts br In May Fox News host Tucker Carlson accused Anthony Fauci of having funded the creation of COVID through gain of function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology WIV br Citing an essay by science writer Nicholas Wade Carlson alleged that Fauci had directed research to make bat viruses more infectious to humans br In a hearing the next day US senator Rand Paul alleged that the US National Institutes of Health NIH had been funding gain of function research in Wuhan accusing researchers including epidemiologist Ralph Baric of creating super viruses br Both Fauci and NIH Director Francis Collins have denied that the US government supported such research br Baric likewise rejected Paul s allegations saying that his lab s research into the potential in bat coronaviruses for cross species transmission was not deemed gain of function by NIH or the University of North Carolina where he works br A study of chimeric bat coronaviruses at the WIV listed NIH as a sponsor however NIH funding was only related to sample collection Based on this and other evidence The Washington Post rated the claim of an NIH connection to gain of function research on coronaviruses as two pinocchios representing significant omissions and or exaggerations br br br Accidental release of collected sample br Another theory suggests the virus arose in humans from an accidental infection of laboratory workers by a natural sample Unfounded online speculation about this scenario has been widespread br In March an investigatory report released by the WHO described this scenario as extremely unlikely and not supported by any available evidence The report acknowledged however that the possibility cannot be ruled out without further evidence The investigation behind this report operated as a joint collaboration between Chinese and international scientists At the release briefing for the report WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus reiterated the report s calls for a deeper probe into all evaluated possibilities including the laboratory origin scenario The study and report were criticised by heads of state from the US the EU and other WHO member countries for a lack of transparency and incomplete access to data Further investigations have also been requested by some scientists including Anthony Fauci and signatories of a letter published in Science br Since May some media organizations softened previous language that described the laboratory leak theory as debunked or a conspiracy theory On the other hand scientific opinion that an accidental leak is possible but unlikely has remained steady A number of journalists and scientists have said that they dismissed or avoided discussing the lab leak theory during the first year of the pandemic as a result of perceived polarization resulting from Donald Trump s embrace of the theory br br br Stolen from Canadian lab br Some social media users have alleged that COVID was stolen from a Canadian virus research lab by Chinese scientists Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada said that this had no factual basis The stories seem to have been derived from a July CBC news article stating that some Chinese researchers had their security access to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg a Level virology lab revoked after a Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigation Canadian officials described this as an administrative matter and said there was no risk to the Canadian public br Responding to the conspiracy theories the CBC stated that its articles never claimed the two scientists were spies or that they brought any version of a coronavirus to the lab in Wuhan While pathogen samples were transferred from the lab in Winnipeg to Beijing in March neither of the samples contained a coronavirus The Public Health Agency of Canada has stated that the shipment conformed to all federal policies and that the researchers in question are still under investigation and thus it cannot be confirmed nor denied that these two were responsible for sending the shipment The location of the researchers under investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police has also not been released br In a January press conference NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg when asked about the case stated that he could not comment specifically on it but expressed concerns about increased efforts by the nations to spy on NATO allies in different ways br br br Accusations by China br br According to The Economist conspiracy theories exist on China s internet about COVID being created by the CIA in order to keep China down According to an investigation by ProPublica such conspiracy theories and disinformation have been propagated under the direction of China News Service the country s second largest government owned media outlet controlled by the United Front Work Department Global Times and Xinhua News Agency have similarly been implicated in propagating disinformation related to COVID s origins NBC News however has noted that there have also been debunking efforts of US related conspiracy theories posted online with a WeChat search of Coronavirus disease is from the U S reported to mostly yield articles explaining why such claims are unreasonable br In March two spokesmen for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Zhao Lijian and Geng Shuang alleged at a press conference that Western powers may have bio engineered COVID They were alluding that the US Army created and spread COVID allegedly during the Military World Games in Wuhan where numerous cases of influenza like illness were reported br A member of the U S military athletics delegation based at Fort Belvoir who competed in the mi Road Race at the Wuhan games became the subject of online targeting by netizens accusing her of being patient zero of the COVID outbreak in Wuhan and was later interviewed by CNN to clear her name from the false accusations in starting the pandemic br In January Hua Chunying renewed the conspiracy theory from Zhao Lijian and Geng Shuang that the SARS CoV virus originating in the United States at the U S biological weapons lab Fort Detrick This conspiracy theory quickly went trending on the Chinese social media platform Weibo and Hua Chunying continued to cite evidence on Twitter while asking the government of the United States to open up Fort Detrick for further investigation to determine if it is the source of the SARS CoV virus In August a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman repeatedly used an official podium to elevate the Fort Detrick s origin unproven idea br According to a report from Foreign Policy Chinese diplomats and government officials in concert with China s propaganda apparatus and covert networks of online agitators and influencers have responded focused on repeating Zhao Lijian s allegation relating to Fort Detrick in Maryland and the over U S biolabs around the world br br br Accusations by Russia br br In February US officials alleged that Russia is behind an ongoing disinformation campaign using thousands of social media accounts on Twitter Facebook and Instagram to deliberately promote unfounded conspiracy theories claiming the virus is a biological weapon manufactured by the CIA and the US is waging economic war on China using the virus br In March amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine the Russian Defense Ministry stated that US President Joe Biden s son Hunter Biden as well as billionaire George Soros were closely tied to Ukrainian biolabs American right wing media personalities such as Tucker Carlson highlighted the story while Chinese Communist Party owned tabloid Global Times further stated that the labs had been studying bat coronaviruses which spread widely on the Chinese internet for insinuating that the United States had created SARS CoV in Ukrainian laboratories br br br Accusations by other countries br According to Washington DC based nonprofit Middle East Media Research Institute numerous writers in the Arabic press have promoted the conspiracy theory that COVID as well as SARS and the swine flu virus were deliberately created and spread to sell vaccines against these diseases and it is part of an economic and psychological war waged by the U S against China with the aim of weakening it and presenting it as a backward country and a source of diseases br Accusations in Turkey of Americans creating the virus as a weapon have been reported and a YouGov poll from August found that of Turkish respondents believed the US government was responsible for creating and spreading the virus br br An Iranian cleric in Qom said Donald Trump targeted the city with coronavirus to damage its culture and honor Reza Malekzadeh Iran s deputy health minister and former Minister of Health rejected claims that the virus was a biological weapon pointing out that the US would be suffering heavily from it He said Iran was hard hit because its close ties to China and reluctance to cut air ties introduced the virus and because early cases had been mistaken for influenza br In Iraq pro Iranian social media users waged a Twitter campaign during Trump s Presidency to end U S presence in the country by blaming it for the virus The campaign centered around hashtags such as Bases of the American pandemic and Coronavirus is Trump s weapon A March survey by USCENTCOM found that of Iraqi respondents believed a foreign force was behind COVID with of them naming the USA as that force br Theories blaming the USA have also circulated in the Philippines Venezuela and Pakistan An October Globsec poll of Eastern European countries found that of respondents in Montenegro and Serbia of those in North Macedonia and in Bulgaria believed the USA deliberately created COVID br br br Jewish origin br br br In the Muslim world br Iran s Press TV asserted that Zionist elements developed a deadlier strain of coronavirus against Iran Similarly some Arab media outlets accused Israel and the United States of creating and spreading COVID avian flu and SARS Users on social media offered other theories including the allegation that Jews had manufactured COVID to precipitate a global stock market collapse and thereby profit via insider trading while a guest on Turkish television posited a more ambitious scenario in which Jews and Zionists had created COVID avian flu and Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever to design the world seize countries and neuter the world s population Turkish politician Fatih Erbakan reportedly said in a speech Though we do not have certain evidence this virus serves Zionism s goals of decreasing the number of people and preventing it from increasing and important research expresses this br Israeli attempts to develop a COVID vaccine prompted negative reactions in Iran Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi denied initial reports that he had ruled that a Zionist made vaccine would be halal and one Press TV journalist tweeted that I d rather take my chances with the virus than consume an Israeli vaccine A columnist for the Turkish Yeni Akit asserted that such a vaccine could be a ruse to carry out mass sterilization br br br In the United States br An alert by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding the possible threat of far right extremists intentionally spreading COVID mentioned blame being assigned to Jews and Jewish leaders for causing the pandemic and several statewide shutdowns br br br In Germany br Flyers have been found on German tram cars falsely blaming Jews for the pandemic br In April two members of the Reichsb rger movement later implicated in the German coup d tat plot were charged with conspiring to kidnap the German health minister Karl Lauterbach br br br In Britain br According to a study carried out by the University of Oxford in early nearly one fifth of respondents in England believed to some extent that Jews were responsible for creating or spreading the virus with the motive of financial gain br br br Muslims spreading virus br br In India Muslims have been blamed for spreading infection following the emergence of cases linked to a Tablighi Jamaat religious gathering There are reports of vilification of Muslims on social media and attacks on individuals in India Claims have been made that Muslims are selling food contaminated with SARS CoV and that a mosque in Patna was sheltering people from Italy and Iran These claims were shown to be false In the UK there are reports of far right groups blaming Muslims for the pandemic and falsely claiming that mosques remained open after the national ban on large gatherings br br br Population control scheme br br According to the BBC Jordan Sather a YouTuber supporting the QAnon conspiracy theory and the anti vax movement has falsely claimed that the outbreak was a population control scheme created by the Pirbright Institute in England and by former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates br Piers Corbyn was described as dangerous by physician and broadcaster Hilary Jones during their joint interview on Good Morning Britain in early September Corbyn described COVID as a psychological operation to close down the economy in the interests of mega corporations and stated vaccines cause death br br br G mobile networks br br The first conspiracy theories purporting a link between COVID and G mobile networks had already appeared by the end of January Such claims spread rapidly on social media networks leading to the spread of misinformation in what has been likened to a digital wildfire br In March Thomas Cowan a holistic medical practitioner who trained as a physician and operates on probation with the Medical Board of California alleged that COVID is caused by G He based this on the claims that African countries had not been affected significantly by the pandemic and Africa was not a G region Cowan also falsely alleged that the viruses were waste from cells that were poisoned by electromagnetic fields and that historical viral pandemics coincided with major developments in radio technology br The video of Cowan s claims went viral and was recirculated by celebrities including Woody Harrelson John Cusack and singer Keri Hilson The claims may also have been recirculated by an alleged coordinated disinformation campaign similar to campaigns used by the Internet Research Agency in Saint Petersburg Russia The claims were criticized on social media and debunked by Reuters USA Today Full Fact and American Public Health Association executive director Georges C Benjamin br Cowan s claims were repeated by Mark Steele a conspiracy theorist who claimed to have first hand knowledge that G was in fact a weapon system capable of causing symptoms identical to those produced by the virus Kate Shemirani a former nurse who had been struck off the UK nursing registry and had become a promoter of conspiracy theories repeatedly claimed that these symptoms were identical to those produced by exposure to electromagnetic fields br Steve Powis national medical director of NHS England described theories linking G mobile phone networks to COVID as the worst kind of fake news Viruses cannot be transmitted by radio waves and COVID has spread and continues to spread in many countries that do not have G networks br There were suspected arson attacks on phone masts in the UK over the Easter weekend These included an incident in Dagenham where three men were arrested on suspicion of arson a fire in Huddersfield that affected a mast used by emergency services and a fire in a mast that provides mobile connectivity to the NHS Nightingale Hospital Birmingham Some telecom engineers reported threats of violence including threats to stab and murder them by individuals who believe them to be working on G networks In April Garda and fire services were called to fires at G masts in County Donegal Ireland The Garda were treating the fires as arson After the arson attacks British Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said the theory that COVID virus may be spread by G wireless communication is just nonsense dangerous nonsense as well Telecommunications provider Vodafone announced that two Vodafone masts and two it shares with O another provider had been targeted br By April at least mobile phone masts in the UK had been vandalised Because of the slow rollout of G in the UK many of the damaged masts had only G and G equipment Mobile phone and home broadband operators estimated there were at least incidents where engineers maintaining equipment were confronted in the week up to April As of May there had been incidents of attempted arson at mobile phone masts in the Netherlands including one case where Fuck G was written There have also been incidents in Ireland and Cyprus Facebook has deleted messages encouraging attacks on G equipment br Engineers working for Openreach a division of British Telecom posted pleas on anti G Facebook groups asking to be spared abuse as they are not involved with maintaining mobile networks Industry lobby group Mobile UK said the incidents were affecting the maintenance of networks that support home working and provide critical connections to vulnerable customers emergency services and hospitals A widely circulated video showed a woman accusing employees of broadband company Community Fibre of installing G as part of a plan to kill the population br Of those who believed that G networks caused COVID symptoms stated that much of their knowledge about the virus came from YouTube In April YouTube announced that it would reduce the amount of content claiming links between G and COVID Videos that are conspiratorial about G that do not mention COVID would not be removed though they might be considered borderline content and therefore removed from search recommendations losing advertising revenue The discredited claims had been circulated by British conspiracy theorist David Icke in videos subsequently removed on YouTube and Vimeo and an interview by London Live TV network prompting calls for action by Ofcom It took YouTube on average days to remove Covid related videos containing false information in the first half of br Ofcom issued guidance to ITV following comments by Eamonn Holmes about G and COVID on This Morning Ofcom said the comments were ambiguous and ill judged and they risked undermining viewers trust in advice from public authorities and scientific evidence Ofcom also found local channel London Live in breach of standards for an interview it had with David Icke It said that he had expressed views which had the potential to cause significant harm to viewers in London during the pandemic br In April The Guardian revealed that Jonathan Jones an evangelical pastor from Luton had provided the male voice on a recording blaming G for deaths caused by COVID He claimed to have formerly headed the largest business unit at Vodafone but insiders at the company said that he was hired for a sales position in when G was not a priority for the company and that G would not have been part of his job He had left Vodafone after less than a year br A tweet started an internet meme that Bank of England banknotes contained a picture of a G mast and the SARS CoV virus Facebook and YouTube removed items pushing this story and fact checking organisations established that the picture is of Margate Lighthouse and the virus is the staircase at the Tate Britain br br br American scientist selling virus to China br In April rumors circulated on Facebook alleging that the US Government had just discovered and arrested Charles Lieber chair of the Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department at Harvard University for manufacturing and selling the novel coronavirus COVID to China According to a report from Reuters posts spreading the rumor were shared in multiple languages over times on Facebook Lieber was arrested in January and later charged with two federal counts of making an allegedly false statement about his links to a Chinese university unrelated to the virus The rumor of Lieber a chemist in an area entirely unrelated to the virus research developing COVID and selling it to China has been discredited br br br Meteor origin br In a group of researchers that included Edward J Steele and Chandra Wickramasinghe the foremost living proponent of panspermia speculated in ten research papers that COVID originated from a meteor spotted as a bright fireball over the city of Songyuan in Northeast China in October and that a fragment of the meteor landed in the Wuhan area which started the first COVID outbreaks However the group of researchers did not provide any direct evidence proving this conjecture br In an August article Astronomy com called the meteor origin conjecture so remarkable that it makes the others look boring by comparison br br br NCMI intelligence report br In April ABC News reported that in November U S intelligence officials were warning that a contagion was sweeping through China s Wuhan region changing the patterns of life and business and posing a threat to the population The article stated that the National Center for Medical Intelligence NCMI had produced an intelligence report in November which raised concerns about the situation The director of the NCMI Col R Shane Day said media reporting about the existence release of a National Center for Medical Intelligence Coronavirus related product assessment in November is not correct No such NCMI product exists br br br PCR testing br Social media posts have falsely claimed that Kary Mullis the inventor of polymerase chain reaction PCR said that PCR testing for SARS CoV does not work Mullis who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the invention of PCR died in August before the emergence of the SARS CoV virus and never made these statements Several posts claim Mullis said PCR tests cannot detect free infectious viruses at all that PCR testing was designed to detect any non human DNA or the DNA and RNA of the person being tested or that the process of DNA amplification used in PCR will lead to contamination of the samples A video of a interview with Mullis has also been widely circulated in which Mullis says PCR will find anything the video description asserts that this means PCR cannot be used to reliably detect SARS CoV br In reality the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RT PCR test for SARS CoV is highly sensitive to the virus and testing laboratories have controls in place to prevent and detect contamination However the tests only reveal the presence of the virus and not whether it remains infectious br A claim attributed to the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health that PCR testing is fraudulent became popular in the Philippines and remains a widespread belief According to a report from AFP research associate Joshua Miguel Danac of the University of the Philippines National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology debunked the claim calling PCR tests the gold standard for diagnosis Fake testing and perception of fake testing remains a problem in the Philippines br br br Symptoms and severity br In early there were a number of viral photos and videos that were mischaracterized as showing an extreme severity to COVID exposure In January and February a number of videos from China were circulated on social media that purported to show people infected with COVID either suddenly collapsing or having already collapsed on the street Some of these videos were republished or referenced by some tabloid newspapers including the Daily Mail and The Sun However the people in these videos are generally believed to have been suffering from something other than COVID such as one who was drunk br A video from February purported to be of dead COVID victims in China was actually a video from Shenzhen of people sleeping on the street Similarly a photo that circulated in March of dozens of people lying down in the street purported to be of COVID victims in either China or Italy was in fact a photo of living people from a art project in Germany br br br Incidence and mortality br Correctly reporting the number of people who were sick or who had died was difficult especially during the earliest days of the pandemic br br br In China br br br Chinese under reporting during early br Leaked documents show that China s public reporting of cases gave an incomplete picture during the early stages of the pandemic For example in February China publicly reported new confirmed cases However confidential internal documents that later leaked to CNN showed new cases in February These were broken down as confirmed cases clinically diagnosed cases and suspected cases br br br Nurse whistleblower br In January a video circulated online appearing to be of a nurse named Jin Hui in Hubei describing a far more dire situation in Wuhan than reported by Chinese officials However the BBC said that contrary to its English subtitles in one of the video s existing versions the woman does not claim to be either a nurse or a doctor in the video and that her suit and mask do not match the ones worn by medical staff in Hubei br The video claimed that more than people had been infected with the virus in China that the virus could spread from one person to people R and that the virus was starting a second mutation The video attracted millions of views on various social media platforms and was mentioned in numerous online reports The claimed R of in the video was noted by the BBC to be inconsistent with the expert estimation of to at that time The video s claim of infected cases was noted to be unsubstantiated br br br Alleged leak of death toll by Tencent br In February Taiwan News published an article claiming that Tencent may have accidentally leaked the real numbers of death and infection in China Taiwan News suggested that the Tencent Epidemic Situation Tracker had briefly showed infected cases and death tolls many times higher of the official figure citing a Facebook post by a year old Taiwanese beverage store owner and an anonymous Taiwanese netizen The article referenced by other news outlets such as the Daily Mail and widely circulated on Twitter Facebook and chan sparked a wide range of conspiracy theories that the screenshot indicates the real death toll instead of the ones published by health officials br The author of the original news article defended the authenticity and newsworthiness of the leak on a WION program br br br Mass cremation in Wuhan br In February a report emerged on Twitter claiming that data showed a massive increase in sulfur emissions over Wuhan China The Twitter thread then claimed the reason was due to the mass cremation those who died from COVID The story was shared on multiple media outlets including Daily Express Daily Mail and Taiwan News Snopes debunked the misinformation pointing out that the maps used by the claims were not real time observations of sulfur dioxide SO concentrations above Wuhan Instead the data was a computer generated model based on historical information and forecast on SO emissions br A story in The Epoch Times in February shared a map from the Internet that falsely alleged massive sulfur dioxide releases from crematoriums during the COVID pandemic in China speculating that bodies may have been burned A fact check by AFP reported that the map was a NASA forecast taken out of context br br br Decline in cellphone subscriptions br There was a decrease of nearly million cellphone subscriptions among the three largest cellphone carriers in China which led to misinformation that this is evidence for millions of deaths due to COVID in China The drop is attributed to cancellations of phone services due to a downturn in the social and economic life during the outbreak br br br In the US br Accusations have been made of under reporting over reporting and other problems Necessary data was corrupted in some places for example on the state level in the United States br The public health handling of the pandemic has been hampered by the use of archaic technology including fax machines and incompatible formats poor data flow and management or even no access to data and general lack of standardization and leadership Privacy laws hampered contact tracing and case finding efforts which resulted in under diagnosis and under reporting br br br Allegations of inflated death counts br In August President Donald Trump retweeted a conspiracy theory alleging that COVID deaths are systematically overcounted and that only of the reported deaths in the United States were actually from the disease This number is based on only counting death certificates where COVID is the sole condition listed The lead mortality statistician at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s CDC National Center for Health Statistics said that those death certificates likely did not include all the steps that led to the death and thus were incomplete The CDC collects data based on case surveillance vital records and excess deaths A FactCheck org article on the issue reported that while of the death certificates included COVID exclusively as the cause of death and had additional conditions that contributed to it COVID was listed as the underlying cause of death in of them as it may directly cause other severe conditions such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome br The U S experienced excess deaths i e deaths above the baseline expected from normal mortality in previous years between February and January which is somewhat higher than the officially recorded mortality from COVID during that period deaths Analysis of weekly data from each U S state shows that the calculated excess deaths are strongly correlated with COVID infections undercutting the notion that the deaths were primarily caused by some factor other than the disease br br br Misleading Johns Hopkins News Letter article br In November an article by Genevieve Briand assistant director for the Master s program in Applied Economics at JHU was published in the student run Johns Hopkins News Letter claiming to have found no evidence that COVID create d any excess deaths The article was later retracted after it was used to promote conspiracy theories on right wing social media accounts and misinformation websites but the presentation was not removed from YouTube where it had been viewed more than times as of December br Briand compared data from spring and January ignoring expected seasonal variations in mortality and unusual peaks in the spring and summer of compared to previous spring and summer months Briand s article failed to account for the total excess mortality from all causes reported during the pandemic with deaths associated with the virus per CDC data in Deaths per age group were also shown as a proportion percentage rather than as raw numbers obscuring the effects of the pandemic when the number of deaths increases but the proportions are maintained The article also suggested that deaths attributed to cardiac and respiratory diseases in infected persons were incorrectly categorized as deaths due to COVID This view fails to recognize that those with such conditions are more vulnerable to the virus and therefore more likely to die from it The retraction of Briand s article went viral on social media under false claims of censorship br br br Misinformation targeting Taiwan br br In February the Taiwanese Central News Agency reported that large amounts of misinformation had appeared on Facebook claiming the pandemic in Taiwan was out of control the Taiwanese government had covered up the total number of cases and that President Tsai Ing wen had been infected The Taiwan fact checking organization had suggested the misinformation on Facebook shared similarities with mainland China due to its use of simplified Chinese characters and mainland China vocabulary The organization warned that the purpose of the misinformation is to attack the government br In March Taiwan s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau warned that China was trying to undermine trust in factual news by portraying the Taiwanese government reports as fake news Taiwanese authorities have been ordered to use all possible means to track whether the messages were linked to instructions given by the Chinese Communist Party The PRC s Taiwan Affairs Office denied the claims calling them lies and said that Taiwan s Democratic Progressive Party was inciting hatred between the two sides They then claimed that the DPP continues to politically manipulate the virus According to The Washington Post China has used organized disinformation campaigns against Taiwan for decades br Nick Monaco the research director of the Digital Intelligence Lab at Institute for the Future analyzed the posts and concluded that the majority appear to have come from ordinary users in China not the state However he criticized the Chinese government s decision to allow the information to spread beyond China s Great Firewall which he described as malicious According to Taiwan News nearly one in four cases of misinformation are believed to be connected to China br In March the American Institute in Taiwan announced that it was partnering with the Taiwan FactCheck Center to help combat misinformation about the COVID outbreak br br br Misrepresented World Population Project map br In early February a decade old map illustrating a hypothetical viral outbreak published by the World Population Project part of the University of Southampton was misappropriated by a number of Australian media news outlets and British tabloids The Sun Daily Mail and Metro which claimed the map represented the COVID pandemic This misinformation was then spread via the social media accounts of the same media outlets and while some outlets later removed the map the BBC reported in February that a number of news sites had yet to retract the map br br br Casedemic br COVID deniers use the word casedemic as a shorthand for a conspiracy theory holding that COVID is harmless and that the reported disease figures are merely a result of increased testing The concept is particularly attractive to anti vaccination activists who use it to argue that public health measures and particularly vaccines are not needed to counter what they say is a fake epidemic br David Gorski writes that the word casedemic was seemingly coined by Ivor Cummins an engineer whose views are popular among COVID deniers in August br The term has been adopted by alternative medicine advocate Joseph Mercola who has exaggerated the effect of false positives in polymerase chain reaction PCR tests to construct a false narrative that testing is invalid because it is not perfectly accurate see also PCR testing above In reality the problems with PCR testing are well known and accounted for by public health authorities Such claims also disregard the possibility of asymptomatic spread the number of potentially undetected cases during the initial phases of the pandemic in comparison to the present due to increased testing and knowledge since and other variables that can influence PCR tests br br br Disease spread br Early in the pandemic little information was known about how the virus spreads when the first people became sick or who was most vulnerable to infection serious complications or death During it became clear that the main route of spread was through exposure to the virus laden respiratory droplets produced by an infected person There were also some early questions about whether the disease might have been present earlier than reported however subsequent research disproved this idea br br br California herd immunity in br In March Victor Davis Hanson publicized a theory that COVID may have been in California in the fall of resulting in a level of herd immunity to at least partially explain differences in infection rates in cities such as New York City vs Los Angeles Jeff Smith of Santa Clara County stated that evidence indicated the virus may have been in California since December Early genetic and antibody analyses refute the idea that the virus was in the United States prior to January br br br Patient Zero br In March conspiracy theorists started the false rumor that Maatje Benassi a US army reservist was Patient Zero of the pandemic the first person to be infected with COVID Benassi was targeted because of her participation in the Military World Games at Wuhan before the pandemic started even though she never tested positive for the virus Conspiracy theorists even connected her family to the DJ Benny Benassi as a Benassi virus plot even though they are not related and Benny had also not had the virus br br br Airborne br Before mid the World Health Organization WHO denied that COVID readily spread through the air although they acknowledged such spread could occur during certain medical procedures as of July In February the Director General of WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus initially stated COVID was airborne during a press conference only to retract this statement a few minutes later In March WHO tweeted FACT COVID is NOT airborne br The air quality researcher Lidia Morawska viewed their initial position as spreading misinformation Hundreds of scientists by mid viewed airborne spread as occurring and called on the WHO to change their position Concerns were raised that conservative voices within the WHO committee tasked with these guidelines were preventing new evidence from being incorporated br br br Surfaces br Early in the pandemic it was claimed that COVID could be spread by contact with contaminated surfaces or fomites even though this is an uncommon transmission route for other respiratory viruses This led to recommendations that high contact surfaces like playground equipment or school desks be frequently deep cleaned and that certain items like groceries or mailed packages be disinfected Ultimately the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC concluded that the likelihood of transmission under these scenarios was less than in They further concluded that handwashing reduced the risk of exposure to COVID but surface disinfection did not br br br Susceptibility based on ethnicity br There have been claims that specific ethnicities are more or less vulnerable to COVID COVID is a new zoonotic disease so no population has yet had the time to develop population immunity br Beginning in February reports quickly spread via Facebook implied that a Cameroonian student in China had been completely cured of the virus due to his African genetics While a student was successfully treated other media sources have indicated that no evidence implies Africans are more resistant to the virus and labeled such claims as false information Kenyan Secretary of Health Mutahi Kagwe explicitly refuted rumors that those with black skin cannot get coronavirus disease while announcing Kenya s first case in March This false claim was cited as a contributing factor in the disproportionately high rates of infection and death observed among African Americans br There have been claims of Indian immunity that the people of India have more immunity to the COVID virus due to living conditions in India This idea was deemed absolute drivel by Anand Krishnan professor at the Centre for Community Medicine of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences AIIMS He said there was no population immunity to the COVID virus yet as it is new and it is not even clear whether people who have recovered from COVID will have lasting immunity as this happens with some viruses but not with others br Iran s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei claimed the virus was genetically targeted at Iranians by the US giving this explanation for the pandemic having seriously affected Iran He did not offer any evidence br A group of Jordanian researchers published a report claiming that Arabs are less vulnerable to COVID due to a genetic variation specific to those of Middle East heritage This paper had not been debunked by November br br br Xenophobic blaming by ethnicity and religion br br COVID related xenophobic attacks have been made against individuals with the attacker blaming the victim for COVID on the basis of the victim s ethnicity People who are considered to look Chinese have been subjected to COVID related verbal and physical attacks in many other countries often by people accusing them of transmitting the virus Within China there has been discrimination such as evictions and refusal of service in shops against people from anywhere closer to Wuhan where the pandemic started and against anyone perceived as being non Chinese especially those considered African as the Chinese government has blamed continuing cases on re introductions of the virus from abroad of reintroduced cases were by Chinese passport holders Neighbouring countries have also discriminated against people seen as Westerners br People have also simply blamed other local groups along the lines of pre existing social tensions and divisions sometimes citing reporting of COVID cases within that group For instance Muslims have been widely blamed shunned and discriminated against in India including some violent attacks amid unfounded claims that Muslims are deliberately spreading COVID and a Muslim event at which the disease did spread has received far more public attention than many similar events run by other groups and the government White supremacist groups have blamed COVID on non whites and advocated deliberately infecting minorities they dislike such as Jews br br br Bat soup br Some media outlets including Daily Mail and RT as well as individuals disseminated a video showing a Chinese woman eating a bat falsely suggesting it was filmed in Wuhan and connecting it to the outbreak However the widely circulated video contains unrelated footage of a Chinese travel vlogger Wang Mengyun eating bat soup in the island country of Palau in Wang posted an apology on Weibo in which she said she had been abused and threatened and that she had only wanted to showcase Palauan cuisine The spread of misinformation about bat consumption has been characterized by xenophobic and racist sentiment toward Asians In contrast scientists suggest the virus originated in bats and migrated into an intermediary host animal before infecting people br br br Large gatherings br South Korean conservative populist Jun Kwang hun told his followers there was no risk to mass public gatherings as the virus was impossible to contract outdoors Many of his followers are elderly br br br Lifetime of the virus br Misinformation has spread that the lifetime of SARS CoV is only hours and that staying home for hours during the Janata curfew would break the chain of transmission Another message claimed that observing the Janata curfew would result in the reduction of COVID cases by br br br Mosquitoes br It has been claimed that mosquitoes transmit COVID There is no evidence that this is true br br br Contaminated objects br A fake Costco product recall notice circulated on social media purporting that Kirkland brand bath tissue had been contaminated with COVID meaning SARS CoV due to the item being made in China No evidence supports that SARS CoV can survive on surfaces for prolonged periods of time as might happen during shipping and Costco has not issued such a recall br A warning claiming to be from the Australia Department of Health said COVID spreads through petrol pumps and that everyone should wear gloves when filling up petrol in their cars br There were claims that wearing shoes in one s home was the reason behind the spread of COVID in Italy br br br Cruise ships as safe havens br br In March the Miami New Times reported that managers at Norwegian Cruise Line had prepared a set of responses intended to convince wary customers to book cruises including blatantly false claims that COVID can only survive in cold temperatures so the Caribbean is a fantastic choice for your next cruise that Scientists and medical professionals have confirmed that the warm weather of the spring will be the end of the Coronavirus sic and that the virus cannot live in the amazingly warm and tropical temperatures that your cruise will be sailing to br Flu is seasonal becoming less frequent in the summer in some countries but not in others While it is possible that COVID will also show some seasonality this has not yet been determined When COVID spread along international air travel routes it did not bypass tropical locations Outbreaks on cruise ships where an older population lives in close quarters frequently touching surfaces which others have touched were common br It seems that COVID can be transmitted in all climates It has seriously affected many warm climate countries For instance Dubai with a year round average daily high of Celsius F and the airport said to have the world s most international traffic has had thousands of cases br br br Breastfeeding br While commercial companies that make breastmilk substitutes promote their products during the pandemic the WHO and UNICEF advise that women should continue to breastfeed during the COVID pandemic even if they have confirmed or suspected COVID Evidence as of May indicates that it is unlikely that COVID can be transmitted through breast milk br br br Sexual transmission and infertility br COVID can persist in men s semen even after they have begun to recover although the virus cannot replicate in the reproductive system br Chinese researchers who found the virus in the semen of men infected with COVID claimed that this opened up a small chance the disease could be sexually transmitted though this claim has been questioned by other academics since this has been shown with many other viruses such as Ebola and Zika br A team of Italian scholars found that of men who recovered from infections or one quarter of the test subjects had either azoospermia no sperm in semen or oligospermia low sperm count Mechanisms through which infectious diseases affect sperm is roughly divided into two categories One involves viruses entering the testes where they attack spermatogonia The other involves high fever exposing the testes to heat and thereby killing sperm br br br Prevention br People tried many different things to prevent infection Sometimes the misinformation was false claims of efficacy such as claims that the virus could not spread during religious ceremonies and at other times the misinformation was false claims of inefficacy such as claiming that alcohol based hand sanitizer did not work In other cases especially with regard to public health advice about wearing face masks additional scientific evidence resulted in different advice over time br br br Hand sanitizer antibacterial soaps br br Claims that hand sanitizer is merely antibacterial not antiviral and therefore ineffective against COVID have spread widely on Twitter and other social networks While the effectiveness of sanitiser depends on the specific ingredients most hand sanitiser sold commercially inactivates SARS CoV which causes COVID Hand sanitizer is recommended against COVID though unlike soap it is not effective against all types of germs Washing in soap and water for at least seconds is recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC as the best way to clean hands in most situations However if soap and water are not available a hand sanitizer that is at least alcohol can be used instead unless hands are visibly dirty or greasy The CDC and the Food and Drug Administration both recommend plain soap there is no evidence that antibacterial soaps are any better and limited evidence that they might be worse long term br br br Public use of face masks br br Authorities especially in Asia recommended wearing face masks in public early in the pandemic In other parts of the world authorities made conflicting or contradictory statements Several governments and institutions such as in the United States initially dismissed the use of face masks by the general population often with misleading or incomplete information about their effectiveness Commentators have attributed the anti mask messaging to attempts at managing mask shortages caused by initial inaction remarking that the claims went beyond the science or were simply lies br br In February U S Surgeon General Jerome Adams tweeted Seriously people STOP BUYING MASKS They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching Coronavirus disease he later reversed his position with increasing evidence that masks can limit the spread of COVID In June Anthony Fauci a key member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force confirmed that the American public were told not to wear masks from the beginning due to a shortage of masks and then explained that masks do actually work br Some media outlets claimed that neck gaiters were worse than not wearing masks at all in the COVID pandemic misinterpreting a study which was intended to demonstrate a method for evaluating masks and not actually to determine the effectiveness of different types of masks The study also only looked at one wearer wearing the one neck gaiter made from a polyester spandex blend which is not sufficient evidence to support the claim about gaiters made in the media The study found that the neck gaiter which was made from a thin and stretchy material appeared to be ineffective at limiting airborne droplets expelled from the wearer Isaac Henrion one of the co authors suggests that the result was likely due to the material rather than the style stating that Any mask made from that fabric would probably have the same result no matter the design Warren S Warren a co author said that they tried to be careful with their language in interviews but added that the press coverage has careened out of control for a study testing a measuring technique br There are false claims spread that the usage of masks causes adverse health related issues such as low blood oxygen levels high blood carbon dioxide levels and a weakened immune system Some also falsely claimed that masks cause antibiotic resistant pneumonia by preventing pathogenic organisms to be exhaled away from the body br Individuals have speciously claimed legal or medical exemptions to avoid complying with mask mandates Individuals have for instance claimed that the Americans with Disabilities Act ADA designed to prohibit discrimination based on disabilities allows exemption from mask requirements The United States Department of Justice DOJ responded that the Act does not provide a blanket exemption to people with disabilities from complying with legitimate safety requirements necessary for safe operations The DOJ also issued a warning about cards sometimes featuring DOJ logos or ADA notices that claim to exempt their holders from wearing masks stating that these cards are fraudulent and not issued by any government agency br br br Alcohol tobacco and other drugs br Contrary to some reports drinking alcohol does not protect against COVID and can increase short term and long term health risks Drinking alcohol is made with pure ethanol Other substances such as hand sanitizer wood alcohol and denatured alcohol contain other alcohols such as isopropanol or methanol These other alcohols are poisonous and may cause gastric ulcers blindness liver failure or death Such chemicals are commonly present in improperly fermented or distilled alcoholic beverages br Several countries including Iran and Turkey have reported incidents of methanol poisoning caused by the false belief that drinking alcohol would cure or protect against COVID alcohol is banned in Iran and bootleg alcohol may contain methanol According to the Associated Press in March people had died and become ill due to methanol poisoning That figure reached by April br In Kenya in April the Governor of Nairobi Mike Sonko came under scrutiny for including small bottles of the cognac Hennessy in care packages falsely claiming that alcohol serves as throat sanitizer br In tobacco smoking spread on social media as a false remedy to COVID after a few small observational studies were published in which tobacco smoking was shown to be preventative against SARS CoV In April researchers at a Paris hospital noted an inverse relationship between smoking and COVID infections which led to an increase in tobacco sales in France These results were at first so astonishing that the French government initiated a clinical trial with transdermal nicotine patches More recent clinical evidence based on larger studies clearly demonstrates that smokers have an increased chance of COVID infection and experience more severe respiratory symptoms br In early several viral tweets spread around Europe and Africa suggesting that snorting cocaine would sterilize one s nostrils of SARS CoV In response the French Ministry of Health released a public service announcement debunking this claim saying No cocaine does NOT protect against COVID It is an addictive drug that causes serious side effects and is harmful to people s health The World Health Organization also debunked the claim br br br Warm or hot drinks br There were several claims that drinking warm drinks at a temperature of around C F protects one from COVID most notably by Alberto Fern ndez the president of Argentina said The WHO recommends that one drink many hot drinks because heat kills the virus Scientists commented that the WHO had made no such recommendation and that drinking hot water can damage the oral mucosa br br br Religious protection br A number of religious groups have claimed protection due to their faith Some refused to stop practices such as gatherings of large groups that promoted the transmission of the virus br In Israel some Ultra Orthodox Jews initially refused to close synagogues and religious seminaries and disregarded government restrictions because The Torah protects and saves which resulted in an eight fold faster rate of infection among some groups br In South Korea the River of Grace Community Church in Gyeonggi Province spread the virus after spraying salt water into their members mouths in the belief that it would kill the virus while the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu where a church leader claimed that no Shincheonji worshipers had caught the virus in February while hundreds died in Wuhan later caused the biggest spread of the virus in the country In Tanzania President John Magufuli instead of banning congregations urged the faithfuls to go to pray in churches and mosques in the belief that it will protect them He said that COVID is a devil therefore cannot survive in the body of Jesus Christ it will burn the body of Jesus Christ refers to the Christian church br Despite the COVID pandemic in March the Church of Greece announced that Holy Communion in which churchgoers eat pieces of bread soaked in wine from the same chalice would continue as a practice The Holy Synod said Holy Communion cannot be the cause of the spread of illness with Metropolitan Seraphim saying the wine was without blemish because it represented the blood and body of Christ and that whoever attends Holy Communion is approaching God who has the power to heal The Church refused to restrict Christians from taking Holy Communion which was supported by several clerics some politicians and health professionals The Greek Association of Hospital Doctors criticized these professionals for putting their religious beliefs before science A review of the medical publications on the subject published by a Greek physician claims that the transmission of any infectious disease through the Holy Communion has never been documented This controversy divided the Greek society the politics and medical experts br The Islamic missionary movement Tablighi Jamaat organised Ijtema mass gatherings in Malaysia India and Pakistan whose participants believed that God will protect them causing the biggest rise in COVID cases in these and other countries In Iran the head of Fatima Masumeh Shrine encouraged pilgrims to visit the shrine despite calls to close the shrine saying that they consider this holy shrine to be a place of healing In Somalia false claims have spread Muslims are immune to the virus br br br Helicopter spraying br In Sri Lanka the Philippines and India it has been claimed that one should stay at home on particular days when helicopters spray COVID disinfectant over homes No such spraying has taken place nor is it planned nor as of July is there any such agent that could be sprayed br br br Food br br In India fake news circulated that the World Health Organization warned against eating cabbage to prevent COVID infection Claims that the poisonous fruit of the Datura plant is a preventive measure for COVID resulted in eleven people being hospitalized in India They ate the fruit following the instructions from a TikTok video that propagated misinformation regarding the prevention of COVID br Claims that vegetarians are immune to COVID spread online in India causing NoMeat NoCoronaVirus to trend on Twitter Such claims are false br br br Vitamin D br br In February claims that Vitamin D pills could help prevent COVID circulated on social media in Thailand Some conspiracy theorists have claimed that vitamin D was being intentionally suppressed as a preventative option by governments br One meta analysis found weak evidence that increased vitamin D levels may reduce the likelihood of intensive care admission for people with COVID but found no effect of mortality br A preprint of a journal article from Indonesia purporting to show a beneficial effect of vitamin D for COVID went viral across social media and was cited several times in mainstream academic literature including in a recommendation from NICE Tabloid newspapers such as the Daily Mail and The Sun likewise promoted the story Subsequent investigation however found none of the authors seemed to be known of at the hospitals listed as their affiliations suggesting the paper was entirely fraudulent br A study of YouTube content concerning vitamin D and COVID in found that over three quarters of the videos analysed as part of the study contained false and misleading information Most alarmingly according to the study s authors the majority of the purveyors of misinformation in these videos were medical professionals The study concluded that much of the advice given by these YouTube videos may result in adverse health outcomes such as increases in rates of skin cancer if viewers followed it br br br Vaccines br br br Hospital conditions br Some conservative figures in the United States such as Richard Epstein downplayed the scale of the pandemic saying it has been exaggerated as part of an effort to hurt President Trump Some people pointed to empty hospital parking lots as evidence that the virus has been exaggerated Despite the empty parking lots many hospitals in New York City and other places experienced thousands of COVID related hospitalizations br In the course of conspiracy theorists used the FilmYourHospital hashtag to encourage people to record videos in seemingly empty or sparsely populated hospitals in order to prove that the pandemic was a hoax br br br Treatment br br Widely circulated posts on social media have made many unfounded claims of treatment methods of COVID Some of these claims are scams and some promoted methods are dangerous and unhealthy br br br Herbal treatments br Various national and party held Chinese media heavily advertised an overnight research report by Wuhan Institute of Virology and Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica Chinese Academy of Sciences on how shuanghuanglian an herb mixture from traditional Chinese medicine TCM can effectively inhibit COVID The report led to a purchase craze of shuanghuanglian br The president of Madagascar Andry Rajoelina launched and promoted in April a herbal drink based on an artemisia plant as a miracle cure that can treat and prevent COVID despite a lack of medical evidence The drink has been exported to other African countries br Based on in vitro studies extracts of E purpurea Echinaforce showed virucidal activity against coronaviruses including SARS CoV Because the data was experimental and solely derived from cell cultures antiviral effects in humans have not been elucidated As a result regulatory agencies have not recommended the use of Echinacea preparations for the prophylaxis and treatment of COVID br br br Vitamin C br br During the early years of the COVID pandemic vitamin C was the subject of more FDA warning letters than any other quack treatment for COVID In April the US National Institutes of Health NIH COVID Treatment Guidelines stated that there are insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of vitamin C for the prevention or treatment of COVID In an update posted December the NIH position was unchanged br br There is insufficient evidence for the COVID Treatment Guidelines Panel the Panel to recommend either for or against the use of vitamin C for the treatment of COVID in nonhospitalized patients br There is insufficient evidence for the Panel to recommend either for or against the use of vitamin C for the treatment of COVID in hospitalized patients br br br Common cold and flu treatments br In March a photo circulated online showing a year old Indian textbook that lists aspirin antihistamines and nasal spray as treatments for coronavirus diseases False claims spread asserting that the book was evidence that COVID started much earlier than reported and that common cold treatments could be a cure for COVID The textbook actually talks about coronaviruses in general as a family of viruses br A rumor circulated on social media posts on Weibo Facebook and Twitter claiming that Chinese experts said saline solutions could kill COVID There is no evidence for this br A tweet from French health minister Olivier V ran a bulletin from the French health ministry and a small speculative study in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine raised concerns about ibuprofen worsening COVID which spread extensively on social media The European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization recommended COVID patients keep taking ibuprofen as directed citing lack of convincing evidence of any danger br br br Cow dung and urine br Indian political activist Swami Chakrapani and Member of the Legislative Assembly Suman Haripriya claimed that drinking cow urine and applying cow dung on the body can cure COVID In Manipur two people were arrested under the National Security Act for social media posts which said cow urine and dung did not cure the virus They were arrested under Section of the Indian Penal Code for allegedly promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion race place of birth residence language etc and acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony br WHO s chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan criticised politicians incautiously spreading such misinformation without evidence br br br Deoxy D glucose br A drug based on deoxy D glucose DG was approved by the Drugs Controller General of India for emergency use as adjunct therapy in moderate to severe COVID patients br The drug was launched at a press conference with a false claim that it was approved by the World Health Organization It was developed by the DRDO along with Dr Reddy s Laboratories who stated in a press release that the drug helps in faster recovery of hospitalised patients and reduces supplemental oxygen dependence The Wire as well as The Hindu noted that the approval was based on poor evidence no journal publication or preprint concerning efficacy and safety are yet available br br br Traditional Chinese Medicine TCM prescriptions br Since its third version the COVID management guidelines from the Chinese National Health Commission recommends using Traditional Chinese medicines to treat the disease In Wuhan China Central Television reported that local authorities have pushed for a set of TCM prescriptions to be used for every case since early February One formula was promoted at the national level by mid February The local field hospitals were explicitly TCM oriented According to state media as of March of all Hubei patients have used TCM with the rate reaching in field hospitals and in bulk quarantine areas In March the online insert of the official People s Daily distributed in The Daily Telegraph published an article stating that Traditional Chinese medicine helps fight coronavirus disease br br br Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine br br There were claims that chloroquine was used to cure more than COVID patients in Nigeria br In March Adrian Bye a tech startup leader who is not a doctor suggested to cryptocurrency investors Gregory Rigano and James Todaro that chloroquine will keep most people out of hospital Bye later admitted that he had reached this conclusion through philosophy rather than medical research Two days later Rigano and Todaro promoted chloroquine in a self published article that claimed affiliation with the Stanford University School of Medicine the National Academy of Sciences and the Birmingham School of Medicine the three institutions mentioned that they had no links to the article and Google removed the article for violating its terms of service br br br Ivermectin br br br Dangerous treatments br Some QAnon proponents including Jordan Sather and others have promoted gargling Miracle Mineral Supplement actually chlorine dioxide a chemical used in some industrial applications as a bleach that may cause life threatening reactions and even death as a way of preventing or curing the disease The Food and Drug Administration has warned multiple times that drinking MMS is dangerous as it may cause severe vomiting and acute liver failure br Twelve people were hospitalized in India when they ingested the poisonous thornapple Datura stramonium AKA Jimsonweed after seeing the plant recommended as a coronavirus disease home remedy in a TikTok video Datura species contain many substances poisonous to humans mainly through anticholinergic effects br br br Silver br In February televangelist Jim Bakker promoted a colloidal silver solution sold on his website as a remedy for COVID naturopath Sherrill Sellman a guest on his show falsely stated that it hasn t been tested on this strain of the coronavirus but it s been tested on other strains of the coronavirus and has been able to eliminate it within hours The US Food and Drug Administration and New York Attorney General s office both issued cease and desist orders against Bakker and he was sued by the state of Missouri over the sales br The New York Attorney General s office also issued a cease and desist order to radio host Alex Jones who was selling silver infused toothpaste that he falsely claimed could kill the virus and had been verified by federal officials causing a Jones spokesman to deny the products had been sold for the purpose of treating any disease The FDA later threatened Jones with legal action and seizure of several silver based products if he continued to promote their use against COVID br br br Mustard oil br The yoga guru Ramdev claimed that one can treat COVID by pouring mustard oil through the nose causing the virus to flow into the stomach where it would be destroyed by gastric acid He also claimed that if a person can hold their breath for a minute it means they do not have any type of coronavirus symptomatic or asymptomatic Both these claims were found to be false br br br Untested treatments br br Misinformation that the Indian government was spreading an anti corona drug in the country during Janata curfew a stay at home curfew enforced in India went viral on social media br Following the first reported case of COVID in Nigeria in February untested cures and treatments began to spread via platforms such as WhatsApp br In March the US Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested actor Keith Lawrence Middlebrook for wire fraud with a fake COVID cure br br br Spiritual healing br Another televangelist Kenneth Copeland claimed on Victory Channel during a programme called Standing Against Coronavirus that he can cure television viewers of COVID directly from the television studio The viewers had to touch the television screen to receive the spiritual healing br br br Organ trafficking br In India baseless rumours spread saying that people were being taken to care centres and killed to harvest their organs with their bodies then being swapped to avoid suspicion These rumours spread more quickly through online platforms such as WhatsApp and resulted in protests attacks against healthcare workers and reduced willingness to seek COVID testing and treatment br br br Other br br br Name of the disease br Social media posts and Internet memes claimed that COVID derives from Chinese Originated Viral Infectious Disease or similar as supposedly the th virus to come out of China In fact the WHO named the disease as follows CO stands for corona VI for virus D for disease and for when the outbreak was first identified December br Another false social media rumor claimed COVID was an acronym derived from a series of ancient symbols interpreted as see a sheep surrender br br br Simpsons prediction br Claims that The Simpsons had predicted the COVID pandemic in accompanied by a doctored screenshot from the episode The Fool Monty where the text Corona Virus was layered over the original text Apocalypse Meow without blocking it from view were later found to be false The claim had been widely spread on social media br br br Return of wildlife br During the pandemic many false and misleading images or news reports about the environmental impact of the COVID pandemic were shared by clickbait journalism sources and social media br A viral post that originated on Weibo and spread on Twitter claimed that a pack of elephants descended on a village under quarantine in China s Yunnan got drunk on corn wine and passed out in a tea garden A Chinese news report debunked the claim that the elephants got drunk on corn wine and noted that wild elephants were a common sight in the village the image attached to the post was originally taken at the Asian Elephant Research Center in Yunnan in December br Following reports of reduced pollution levels in Italy as a result of lockdowns images purporting to show swans and dolphins swimming in Venice canals went viral on social media The image of the swans was revealed to have been taken in Burano where swans are common while footage of the dolphins was filmed at a port in Sardinia hundreds of miles away The Venice mayor s office clarified that the reported water clarity in the canals was due to the lack of sediment being kicked up by boat traffic not a reduction in water pollution as initially reported br Following the lockdown of India a video clip purporting to show the extremely rare Malabar civet a critically endangered possibly extinct species walking the empty streets of Meppayur went viral on social media Experts later identified the civet in the video as actually being the much commoner small Indian civet Another viral Indian video clip showed a pod of humpback whales allegedly returning to the Arabian Sea offshore from Mumbai following the shutdown of shipping routes however this video was found to have actually been taken in in the Java Sea br br br Virus remains in body permanently br It has been wrongly claimed that anyone infected with COVID will have the virus in their bodies for life While there is no curative treatment most infected people recover from the disease and eliminate the virus from their bodies br br br COVID denialism br br COVID denialism or merely COVID denialism is the thinking of those who deny the COVID pandemic or deny that deaths are happening in the manner or proportions scientifically recognized by the World Health Organization The claims that the COVID pandemic has been faked exaggerated or mischaracterized are pseudoscience Some famous people who have engaged in COVID denialism include businessman Elon Musk former U S President Donald Trump and former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro br br br Antisemitism br An October report by the UK based anti racism group Hope not Hate found that COVID conspiracy theories were a primary gateway into antisemitic rhetoric due to what they described as conspiratorial antisemitism According to the report An important bridge between COVID conspiracy theories and antisemitism are ideologies that provide overarching explanations for smaller alleged deceptions For example the need for anti G campaigners to explain why telecom companies healthcare providers and authorities are conspiring to expose the population to supposedly dangerous radiation has driven attention towards superconspiracies br Also in October the fact checking organisation Logically found that antisemitic conspiracy theories related to the pandemic were being promoted on one of the largest COVID conspiracy groups on Telegram including posts highlighting Jewish people in leadership positions at Moderna Pfizer the CDC and US President Joe Biden s White House and claims that mask and vaccine mandates were similar to the Holocaust br br br US anti vax anti China covert operation br At the beginning of the pandemic Philippine President Duterte had sought Chinese assistance for vaccines easing claims in the South China Sea and improving relations between the two countries To counter China s influence in the Philippines under Donald Trump s presidency the US military conducted a covert operation aimed at spreading doubts about the safety of Chinese aid including vaccines This campaign of misinformation has contributed to low vaccination coverage and increased death rates from COVID in the Philippines Health experts condemned these actions pointing out the damage done to public trust and global health The operation involved the creation of fake social media accounts posing as Filipinos and spreading anti vaccine messages The campaign was described by then Defense Secretary Mark Esper as payback for COVID disinformation by China directed against the U S br The operation spread to other regions such as in the Middle East and Central Asia like Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan where the Pentagon aimed to intensify fears that the Chinese vaccine produced by Sinovac Biotech contained pork derivatives and could be considered haram i e forbidden by Islamic law br The operation ended in mid when the Biden administration banned the anti vaccine campaign br br br Efforts to combat misinformation br br In February the World Health Organization WHO described a massive infodemic citing an over abundance of reported information which was false about the virus that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it The WHO stated that the high demand for timely and trustworthy information has incentivised the creation of a direct WHO myth busting hotline where its communication and social media teams have been monitoring and responding to misinformation through its website and social media pages The WHO specifically debunked several claims as false including the claim that a person can tell if they have the virus or not simply by holding their breath the claim that drinking large amounts of water will protect against the virus and the claim that gargling salt water prevents infection br br br Social media br br In early February Facebook Twitter and Google announced that they were working with WHO to address misinformation on their platforms In a blog post Facebook stated that it would remove content flagged by global health organizations and local authorities that violate its content policy on misinformation leading to physical harm Facebook is also giving free advertising to WHO Nonetheless a week after Trump s speculation that sunlight could kill the virus The New York Times found Facebook groups Facebook pages nine Instagram accounts and thousands of tweets pushing UV light therapies material which those companies declined to remove from their platforms In August Facebook removed seven million posts with misinformation about COVID br At the end of February Amazon removed more than a million products that claimed to cure or protect against COVID and removed tens of thousands of listings for health products whose prices were significantly higher than recent prices offered on or off Amazon although numerous items were still being sold at unusually high prices as of February br Millions of instances of COVID misinformation have occurred across multiple online platforms Other researchers monitoring the spread of fake news observed certain rumors started in China many of them later spread to Korea and the United States prompting several universities in Korea to start the multilingual Facts Before Rumors campaign to evaluate common claims seen online The proliferation of such misinformation on social media has led to workshops for the application of machine learning resources to detect misinformation br Party and ideology partisanship has also contributed to the public s lack of trust in messages delivered via social media channels leading to a greater proclivity to follow fake news and misinformation campaigns According to research COVID mass media communication should prioritize increasing trust in scientific medicine over attempting to bridge the issue s partisan divide br In addition the divisive nature of the issue being mired in existing political tensions has led to online bullying of scientists br br br Wikipedia br br The media have praised Wikipedia s coverage of COVID and its combating the inclusion of misinformation through efforts led by the English language Wikipedia s WikiProject Medicine among other groups From May Wikipedia s consensus for the COVID pandemic page has been to not mention the theory that the virus was accidentally
