Fry s Electronics was an American big box store chain It was headquartered in San Jose California in Silicon Valley Fry s retailed software consumer electronics household appliances cosmetics tools toys accessories magazines technical books snack foods electronic components and computer hardware Fry s had in store computer repair and custom computer building services br Fry s began with one store in Sunnyvale California and expanded to stores in nine states at its peak in br On February Fry s filed for bankruptcy announcing the immediate and permanent closure of all of its stores A statement posted on its website cited changes in the retail industry and the challenges posed by the COVID pandemic br br br History br br In Charles Fry sold the Fry s Supermarkets chain based in California for US million to Dillons He gave a portion of the proceeds around million to each of his sons John who had worked as the IT manager for the supermarket chain W Randolph who goes by the nickname Randy and David none of whom had much interest in grocery store retailing Instead on May they joined together with a fourth partner John s former girlfriend Kathryn Kolder to open the first Fry s Electronics store at a sq ft m site in Sunnyvale California Today Fry s Food and Drug stores are owned and operated by Kroger and are not affiliated with Fry s Electronics although they have similar logos br John s idea was to use the model of grocery retailing with which the brothers were familiar to sell computer and electronics supplies The original Sunnyvale store located near the intersection of Oakmead Parkway and Lakeside Drive stocked numerous high tech supplies such as integrated circuits test and measurement equipment and computer components as well as software and various other types of consumer electronics The store was one of the few retail outlets in the country that sold off the shelf microprocessors such as the Intel The store also sold T shirts technical books potato chips and magazines including Playboy At first roughly half the store was stocked with groceries including fresh produce but the groceries section quickly diminished to displays of soft drinks and snack foods The store billed itself as The One Stop Shop for the Silicon Valley Professional as one could buy both electronics and groceries computer chips and potato chips at the same time Most components from most OEMs were available for purchase to assemble a desktop computer la carte br As the business expanded the original Sunnyvale store closed and a newer larger store was opened across Lawrence Expressway on Kern Avenue The second Sunnyvale store was designed to look like the interior of a giant computer the walls were adorned with simulated circuit components and the floor resembled a giant printed circuit board The exterior was painted to mimic a huge DIP integrated circuit and the door handles imitated the ENTER and ESC keys on a computer keyboard since this store has housed a Sports Basement store which still bore some of the door handle keys until sometime between and Fry s moved again to its final Sunnyvale location at E Arques Ave at the corner of Arques and Santa Trinita Ave the former site of a facility of the Link Flight Simulation Division of the Singer Corporation Each of the three Sunnyvale store locations was located within mi km of the others br Because Fry s stores were enormous stocking a wide range of each product category they were popular with electronics and computer hobbyists and professionals One of the few stores to challenge Fry s in all dimensions production selection and store wide themes was Incredible Universe a series of Tandy Radio Shack superstores which were established in bought out and converted into Fry s in Historically Circuit City and CompUSA were major competitors in the computer space but they collapsed during the late s recession leaving Microcenter and Newegg as Fry s main competitors br In August

would close its oldest extant location in Palo Alto by January the company said its lease at the location would not be renewed On September The Mercury News reported that customers were finding barren

ultimately fake marijuana plants This was considered unacceptable by the local community considering marijuana was illegal in the state of Texas br In rumors about the chain folding spread rapidly mainly because shelves were empty for long periods of time and stores seemed to emphasize makeup and fragrances over electronics Fry s responded by stating they were simply switching to a consignment model not closing down entirely From when Fry s put out this statement until early four additional stores closed three were in California and one in Duluth Georgia which further led many to believe that the company would soon go out of business br br br Online sales operation br Fry s Electronics was late in establishing an online sales presence They began offering low cost Internet access in through their original Web address Frys com The company later bought e commerce site Cyberian Outpost in November and started online sales with a different URL Outpost com which confused customers who did not associate the online name with the brick and mortar store For a time in the mid s the Web site identified itself as Fry s Electronics Outpost com using dual branding in an attempt to create a connection in visitors minds In October a grand reopening of Frys com introduced the online store with the same name as the retail outlets The outpost com URL later began redirecting to the Fry s online store br br br Domain name acquisitions br In David Peter or David Peter Burlini who manufactured and sold French fry vending machines under the business name Frenchy Frys owned the domain name

locations were decorated in elaborate themes For example the Burbank store which opened in carried a theme of s and s science fiction movies and featured huge statues of popular characters such as the robot Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still and Darth Vader from the Star Wars movie series In addition giant ants from the movie Them hung from the ceiling and the bodies of Chevys and Buicks
