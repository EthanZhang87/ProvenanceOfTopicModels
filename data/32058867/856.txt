mobile phones in the world It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies alongside Alphabet the parent company of Google Amazon Meta the parent company of Facebook and Microsoft br Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April to produce and market Steve Wozniak s Apple I personal computer The company was incorporated by Wozniak and Steve Jobs in Its second computer the Apple II became a best seller as one of the first mass produced microcomputers Apple introduced the Lisa in and the Macintosh in as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse By the company s internal problems included the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives That year Jobs left Apple to form NeXT Inc and Wozniak withdrew to other ventures The market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the s and Apple lost considerable market share to the lower priced Wintel duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel powered PC clones br In Apple was weeks away from bankruptcy To resolve its failed operating system strategy and entice Jobs s return it bought NeXT Over the next decade Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through several tactics including introducing the iMac iPod iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim launching the Think different campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns opening the Apple Store retail chain and acquiring numerous companies to broaden its product portfolio Jobs resigned in for health reasons and died two months later He was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook br Apple has received criticism regarding its contractors labor practices its environmental practices and its business ethics including anti competitive practices and materials sourcing Nevertheless it has a large following and a high level of brand loyalty It has been consistently ranked as one of the world s most valuable brands br Apple became the first publicly traded U S company to be valued at over trillion in August trillion in August and at trillion in January As of June it was valued at just over trillion br br br History br br br Founding and incorporation br br Apple Computer Company was founded on April by Steve Jobs Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne as a partnership The company s first product is the Apple I a computer designed and hand built entirely by Wozniak To finance its creation Jobs sold his Volkswagen Bus and Wozniak sold his HP calculator Neither received the full selling price but in total earned equivalent to in Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club in July The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU RAM and basic textual video chips a base kit concept which was not yet marketed as a complete personal computer It was priced soon after debut for equivalent to in Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in the number and that he came up with the price because he liked repeating digits br Apple Computer Inc was incorporated on January without Wayne who had left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for only twelve days after having co founded it Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of equivalent to in to Jobs and Wozniak during the incorporation of Apple During the first five years of operations revenues grew exponentially doubling about every four months Between September and September yearly sales grew from to US million an average annual growth rate of br The Apple II also designed by Wozniak was introduced on April at the first West Coast Computer Faire It differs from its major rivals the TRS and Commodore PET because of its character cell based color graphics and open architecture The Apple I and early Apple II models use ordinary audio cassette tapes as storage devices which were superseded by the inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II in br The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first killer application of the business world VisiCalc a spreadsheet program released in VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II compatibility with the office but Apple II market share remained behind home computers made by competitors such as Atari Commodore and Tandy br On December Apple ticker symbol AAPL went public selling million shares at per share per share when adjusting for stock splits as of September generating over million which was more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in By the end of the day millionaires were created including Jobs and Wozniak from a stock price of per share and a market cap of billion br br br Success with Macintosh br br In December Steve Jobs and Apple employees including Jef Raskin visited Xerox PARC where they observed the Xerox Alto featuring a graphical user interface GUI Apple subsequently negotiated access to PARC s technology leading to Apple s option to buy shares at a preferential rate This visit influenced Jobs to implement a GUI in Apple s products starting with the Apple Lisa Despite being pioneering as a mass marketed GUI computer the Lisa suffered from high costs and limited software options leading to commercial failure br Jobs angered by being pushed off the Lisa team took over the company s Macintosh division Wozniak and Raskin had envisioned the Macintosh as a low cost computer with a text based interface like the Apple II but a plane crash in forced Wozniak to step back from the project Jobs quickly redefined the Macintosh as a graphical system that would be cheaper than the Lisa undercutting his former division Jobs was also hostile to the Apple II division which at the time generated most of the company s revenue br In Apple launched the Macintosh the first personal computer without a bundled programming language Its debut was signified by a US million television advertisement directed by Ridley Scott that aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January This was hailed as a watershed event for Apple s success and was called a masterpiece by CNN and one of the greatest TV advertisements of all time by TV Guide br The advertisement created great interest in Macintosh and sales were initially good but began to taper off dramatically after the first three months as reviews started to come in Jobs had required kilobytes of RAM which limited its speed and software in favor of aspiring for a projected price point of equivalent to in The Macintosh shipped for equivalent to in a price panned by critics due to its slow performance In early this sales slump triggered a power struggle between Steve Jobs and CEO John Sculley who had been hired away from Pepsi two years earlier by Jobs saying Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world Sculley removed Jobs as the head of the Macintosh division with unanimous support from the Apple board of directors br The board of directors instructed Sculley to contain Jobs and his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products Rather than submit to Sculley s direction Jobs attempted to oust him from leadership Jean Louis Gass e informed Sculley that Jobs had been attempting to organize a boardroom coup and called an emergency meeting at which Apple s executive staff sided with Sculley and stripped Jobs of all operational duties Jobs resigned from Apple in September and took several Apple employees with him to found NeXT Wozniak had also quit his active employment at Apple earlier in to pursue other ventures expressing his frustration with Apple s treatment of the Apple II division and stating that the company had been going in the wrong direction for the last five years Wozniak remained employed by Apple as a representative receiving a stipend estimated to be per year Jobs and Wozniak remained Apple shareholders following their departures br After the departures of Jobs and Wozniak in Sculley launched the Macintosh K that year with quadruple the RAM and introduced the LaserWriter the first reasonably priced PostScript laser printer PageMaker an early desktop publishing application taking advantage of the PostScript language was also released by Aldus Corporation in July It has been suggested that the combination of Macintosh LaserWriter and PageMaker was responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market br This dominant position in the desktop publishing market allowed the company to focus on higher price points the so called high right policy named for the position on a chart of price vs profits Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher profit margin and appeared to have no effect on total sales as power users snapped up every increase in speed Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market the high right policy was in full force by the mid s due to Jean Louis Gass e s slogan of fifty five or die referring to the profit margins of the Macintosh II br This policy began to backfire late in the decade as desktop publishing programs appeared on IBM PC compatibles with some of the same functionality of the Macintosh at far lower price points The company lost its dominant position in the desktop publishing market and estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford Apple products The Christmas season of was the first in the company s history to have declining sales which led to a drop in Apple s stock price During this period the relationship between Sculley and Gass e deteriorated leading Sculley to effectively demote Gass e in January by appointing Michael Spindler as the chief operating officer Gass e left the company later that year br br br Decline and restructuring br The company pivoted strategy and in October introduced three lower cost models the Macintosh Classic the Macintosh LC and the Macintosh IIsi all of which saw significant sales due to pent up demand In Apple introduced the hugely successful PowerBook with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops The same year Apple introduced System a major upgrade to the Macintosh operating system adding color to the interface and introducing new networking capabilities br br The success of the lower cost Macs and PowerBook brought increasing revenue For some time Apple was doing very well introducing fresh new products at increasing profits The magazine MacAddict named the period between and as the first golden age of the Macintosh br The success of lower cost consumer Macs especially the LC cannibalized higher priced machines To address this management introduced several new brands selling largely identical machines at different price points for different markets the high end Quadra series the mid range Centris series and the consumer marketed Performa series This led to significant consumer confusion between so many models br In the Apple II series was discontinued It was expensive to produce and the company decided it was still absorbing sales from lower cost Macintosh models After the launch of the LC Apple encouraged developers to create applications for Macintosh rather than Apple II and authorized salespersons to redirect consumers from Apple II and toward Macintosh The Apple IIe was discontinued in br Apple experimented with several other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the s including QuickTake digital cameras PowerCD portable CD audio players speakers the Pippin video game console the eWorld online service and Apple Interactive Television Box Enormous resources were invested in the problematic Newton tablet division based on John Sculley s unrealistic market forecasts br Throughout this period Microsoft continued to gain market share with Windows by focusing on delivering software to inexpensive personal computers while Apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response it sued Microsoft for making a GUI similar to the Lisa in Apple Computer Inc v Microsoft Corp The lawsuit dragged on for years and was finally dismissed br The major product flops and the rapid loss of market share to Windows sullied Apple s reputation and in Sculley was replaced as CEO by Michael Spindler br Under Spindler Apple IBM and Motorola formed the AIM alliance in to create a new computing platform the PowerPC Reference Platform or PReP with IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software The AIM alliance hoped that PReP s performance and Apple s software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter the dominance of Windows That year Apple introduced the Power Macintosh the first of many computers with Motorola s PowerPC processor br In the wake of the alliance Apple opened up to the idea of allowing Motorola and other companies to build Macintosh clones Over the next two years distinct Macintosh clone models were introduced However by Apple executives were worried that the clones were cannibalizing sales of its own high end computers where profit margins were highest br In Spindler was replaced by Gil Amelio as CEO who was hired for his reputation as a corporate rehabilitator Amelio made deep changes including extensive layoffs and cost cutting br This period was also marked by numerous failed attempts to modernize the Macintosh operating system MacOS The original Macintosh operating system System was not built for multitasking running several applications at once The company attempted to correct this by introducing cooperative multitasking in System but still decided it needed a more modern approach This led to the Pink project in A UX that year Copland in and evaluated the purchase of BeOS in Talks with Be stalled when the CEO former Apple executive Jean Louis Gass e demanded million instead of Apple s million offer br Only weeks away from bankruptcy Apple s board preferred NeXTSTEP and purchased NeXT in late for million and retained Steve Jobs br br br Return to profitability br The NeXT acquisition was finalized on February and the board brought Jobs back to Apple as an advisor On July Jobs staged a boardroom coup that resulted in Amelio s resignation after overseeing a three year record low stock price and crippling financial losses br The board named Jobs as interim CEO and he immediately reviewed the product lineup Jobs canceled of models ending jobs and paring to the core of its computer offerings The next month in August Steve Jobs convinced Microsoft to make a million investment in Apple and a commitment to continue developing Mac software This was seen as an antitrust insurance policy for Microsoft which had recently settled with the Department of Justice over anti competitive practices in the United States v Microsoft Corp case Around then Jobs donated Apple s internal library and archives to Stanford University to focus more on the present and the future rather than the past He ended the Mac clone deals and in September purchased the largest clone maker Power Computing On November the Apple Store website launched which was tied to a new build to order manufacturing model similar to PC manufacturer Dell s success br The moves paid off for Jobs at the end of his first year as CEO the company had a million profit br br On May Apple introduced a new all in one computer reminiscent of the original Macintosh the iMac The iMac was a huge success with units sold in its first five months and ushered in major shifts in the industry by abandoning legacy technologies like the inch diskette being an early adopter of the USB connector and coming pre installed with Internet connectivity the i in iMac via Ethernet and a dial up modem Its striking teardrop shape and translucent materials were designed by Jonathan Ive who had been hired by Amelio and who collaborated with Jobs for more than a decade to reshape Apple s product design br A little more than a year later on July Apple introduced the iBook consumer laptop It culminated Jobs s strategy to produce only four products refined versions of the Power Macintosh G desktop and PowerBook G laptop for professionals and the iMac desktop and iBook laptop for consumers Jobs said the small product line allowed for a greater focus on quality and innovation br Around then Apple also completed numerous acquisitions to create a portfolio of digital media production software for both professionals and consumers Apple acquired Macromedia s Key Grip digital video editing software project which was launched as Final Cut Pro in April Key Grip s development also led to Apple s release of the consumer video editing product iMovie in October Apple acquired the German company Astarte in April which had developed the DVD authoring software DVDirector which Apple repackaged as the professional oriented DVD Studio Pro and reused its technology to create iDVD for the consumer market In Apple purchased the SoundJam MP audio player software from Casady Greene Apple renamed the program iTunes and simplified the user interface and added CD burning br In Apple changed course with three announcements br First on March Apple announced the release of a new modern operating system Mac OS X This was after numerous failed attempts in the early s and several years of development Mac OS X is based on NeXTSTEP OpenStep and BSD Unix to combine the stability reliability and security of Unix with the ease of use of an overhauled user interface br Second in May the first two Apple Store retail locations opened in Virginia and California offering an improved presentation of the company s products At the time many speculated that the stores would fail but they became highly successful and the first of more than stores around the world br Third on October the iPod portable digital audio player debuted The product was first sold on November and was phenomenally successful with over million units sold within six years br In the iTunes Store was introduced with music downloads for a song and iPod integration It quickly became the market leader in online music services with over five billion downloads by June Two years later the iTunes Store was the world s largest music retailer br In Apple purchased Nothing Real for its advanced digital compositing application Shake and Emagic for the music productivity application Logic The purchase of Emagic made Apple the first computer manufacturer to own a music software company The acquisition was followed by the development of

Pro MacBook and MacBook Pro became their respective successors Apple also introduced Boot Camp in to help users install Windows XP or Windows Vista on their Intel Macs alongside Mac OS X br Apple s success during this period was evident in its stock price Between early and the price of Apple s stock increased more than tenfold from around per share split adjusted to over When Apple surpassed Dell s market cap in January Jobs sent an email to Apple employees saying Dell s CEO Michael Dell should eat his words Nine years prior Dell had said that if he ran Apple he would shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders br br br Success with mobile devices br br During his keynote speech at the Macworld Expo on January Jobs announced the renaming of Apple Computer Inc to Apple

discovered that the iPhone Pro would still show the arrow indicator signifying location services are being used at the top of the screen while the main location services toggle is enabled despite all individual location services being disabled Krebs was unable to replicate this behavior on older models and when asking Apple for comment he was told by Apple that It is expected behavior that the Location Services icon appears in the status bar when Location Services is enabled The icon appears for system services that do not have a switch in Settings br Apple later further clarified that this behavior was to ensure compliance with ultra wideband regulations in specific countries a technology Apple started implementing in iPhones starting with iPhone Pro and emphasized that the management of ultra wideband compliance and its use of location data is done entirely on the device and Apple is not collecting user location data Will Strafach an executive at security firm Guardian Firewall confirmed the lack of evidence that location data was sent off to a remote server Apple promised to add a new toggle for this feature and in later iOS revisions Apple provided users with the option to tap on the location services indicator in Control Center to see which specific service is using the device s location br According to published reports by Bloomberg News on March Apple turned over
