title: BitLocker
id: 4132805
BitLocker is a full volume encryption feature included with Microsoft Windows versions starting with Windows Vista It is designed to protect data by providing encryption for entire volumes By default it uses the Advanced Encryption Standard AES algorithm in cipher block chaining CBC or xor encrypt xor XEX based Tweaked codebook mode with ciphertext Stealing XTS mode with a bit or bit key CBC is not used over the whole disk it is applied to each individual sector br br br History br BitLocker originated as a part of Microsoft s Next Generation Secure Computing Base architecture in as a feature tentatively codenamed Cornerstone and was designed to protect information on devices particularly if a device was lost or stolen Another feature titled Code Integrity Rooting was designed to validate the integrity of Microsoft Windows boot and system files When used in conjunction with a compatible Trusted Platform Module TPM BitLocker can validate the integrity of boot and system files before decrypting a protected volume an unsuccessful validation will prohibit access to a protected system BitLocker was briefly called Secure Startup before Windows Vista s release to manufacturing br BitLocker is available on br br Enterprise and Ultimate editions of Windows Vista and Windows br Pro and Enterprise editions of Windows and br Windows Embedded Standard and Windows Thin PC br Windows Server and later br Pro Enterprise and Education editions of Windows br Pro Enterprise and Education editions of Windows br br br Features br br Initially the graphical BitLocker interface in Windows Vista could only encrypt the operating system volume Starting with Windows Vista with Service Pack and Windows Server volumes other than the operating system volume could be encrypted using the graphical tool Still some aspects of the BitLocker such as turning autolocking on or off had to be managed through a command line tool called manage bde wsf br The version of BitLocker included in Windows and Windows Server Release adds the ability to encrypt removable drives On Windows XP or Windows Vista read only access to these drives can be achieved through a program called BitLocker To Go Reader if FAT FAT or exFAT filesystems are used In addition a new command line tool called manage bde replaced the old manage bde wsf br Starting with Windows Server and Windows Microsoft has complemented BitLocker with the Microsoft Encrypted Hard Drive specification which allows the cryptographic operations of BitLocker encryption to be offloaded to the storage device s hardware In addition BitLocker can now be managed through Windows PowerShell Finally Windows introduced Windows To Go in its Enterprise edition which BitLocker can protect br br br Device encryption br Windows Mobile Windows RT and core editions of Windows include device encryption a feature limited version of BitLocker that encrypts the whole system Logging in with a Microsoft account with administrative privileges automatically begins the encryption process The recovery key is stored to either the Microsoft account or Active Directory Active Directory requires Pro editions of Windows allowing it to be retrieved from any computer While device encryption is offered on all editions of Windows unlike BitLocker device encryption requires that the device meet the InstantGo formerly Connected Standby specifications which requires solid state drives and a TPM chip br Starting with Windows the requirements for device encryption have changed requiring a TPM or module with PCR support UEFI Secure Boot and that the device meets Modern Standby requirements or HSTI validation br In September a new update was released KB changing the default setting for BitLocker when encrypting a self encrypting hard drive Now the default is to use software encryption for newly encrypted drives This is due to hardware encryption flaws and security concerns related to those issues br br br Encryption modes br Three authentication mechanisms can be used as building blocks to implement BitLocker encryption br br Transparent operation mode This mode uses the capabilities of TPM hardware to provide for transparent user experience the user powers up and logs into Windows as usual The key used for disk encryption is sealed encrypted by the TPM chip and will only be released to the OS loader code if the early boot files appear to be unmodified The pre OS components of BitLocker achieve this by implementing a Static Root of Trust Measurement a methodology specified by the Trusted Computing Group TCG This mode is vulnerable to a cold boot attack as it allows a powered down machine to be booted by an attacker It is also vulnerable to a sniffing attack as the volume encryption key is transferred in plain text from the TPM to the CPU during a successful boot br User authentication mode This mode requires that the user provide some authentication to the pre boot environment in the form of a pre boot PIN or password br USB Key Mode The user must insert a USB device that contains a startup key into the computer to be able to boot the protected OS Note that this mode requires that the BIOS on the protected machine supports the reading of USB devices in the pre OS environment BitLocker does not support smart cards for pre boot authentication br The following combinations of the above authentication mechanisms are supported all with an optional escrow recovery key br br TPM only br TPM PIN br TPM PIN USB Key br TPM USB Key br USB Key br Password only br br br Operation br BitLocker is a logical volume encryption system A volume spans part of a hard disk drive the whole drive or more than one drive When enabled TPM and BitLocker can ensure the integrity of the trusted boot path e g BIOS and boot sector in order to prevent most offline physical attacks and boot sector malware br In order for BitLocker to encrypt the volume holding the operating system at least two NTFS formatted volumes are required one for the operating system usually C and another with a minimum size of MB which remains unencrypted and boots the operating system In case of Windows Vista and Windows Server however the volume s minimum size is GB and must have a drive letter Unlike previous versions of Windows Vista s diskpart command line tool includes the ability to shrink the size of an NTFS volume so that this volume may be created from already allocated space A tool called the BitLocker Drive Preparation Tool is also available from Microsoft that allows an existing volume on Windows Vista to be shrunk to make room for a new boot volume and for the necessary bootstrapping files to be transferred to it br Once an alternate boot partition has been created the TPM module needs to be initialized assuming that this feature is being used after which the required disk encryption key protection mechanisms such as TPM PIN or USB key are configured The volume is then encrypted as a background task something that may take a considerable amount of time with a large disk as every logical sector is read encrypted and rewritten back to disk The keys are only protected after the whole volume has been encrypted when the volume is considered secure BitLocker uses a low level device driver to encrypt and decrypt all file operations making interaction with the encrypted volume transparent to applications running on the platform br Encrypting File System EFS may be used in conjunction with BitLocker to provide protection once the operating system is running Protection of the files from processes and users within the operating system can only be performed using encryption software that operates within Windows such as EFS BitLocker and EFS therefore offer protection against different classes of attacks br In Active Directory environments BitLocker supports optional key escrow to Active Directory although a schema update may be required for this to work i e if the Active Directory Services are hosted on a Windows version previous to Windows Server br BitLocker and other full disk encryption systems can be attacked by a rogue boot manager Once the malicious bootloader captures the secret it can decrypt the Volume Master Key VMK which would then allow access to decrypt or modify any information on an encrypted hard disk By configuring a TPM to protect the trusted boot pathway including the BIOS and boot sector BitLocker can mitigate this threat Note that some non malicious changes to the boot path may cause a Platform Configuration Register check to fail and thereby generate a false warning br br br Security concerns br br br TPM alone is not enough br The Transparent operation mode and User authentication mode of BitLocker use TPM hardware to detect whether there are unauthorized changes to the pre boot environment including the BIOS and MBR If any unauthorized changes are detected BitLocker requests a recovery key on a USB device This cryptographic secret is used to decrypt the Volume Master Key VMK and allow the bootup process to continue However TPM alone is not enough br br In February a group of security researchers published details of a so called cold boot attack that allows full disk encryption systems such as BitLocker to be compromised by booting the machine from removable media such as a USB drive into another operating system then dumping the contents of pre boot memory The attack relies on the fact that DRAM retains information for up to several minutes or even longer if cooled after the power has been removed The Bress Menz device described in US Patent can accomplish this type of attack Similar full disk encryption mechanisms of other vendors and other operating systems including Linux and Mac OS X are vulnerable to the same attack The authors recommend that computers be powered down when not in physical control of the owner rather than be left in a sleep mode and that the encryption software be configured to require a password to boot the machine br On November Microsoft released a security update to mitigate a security vulnerability in BitLocker that allowed authentication to be bypassed by employing a malicious Kerberos key distribution center if the attacker had physical access to the machine the machine was part of a domain and had no PIN or USB flash drive protection br BitLocker still does not properly support TPM security features which as a result can lead to a complete bypass of privacy protection when keys are transmitted over Serial Peripheral Interface in a motherboard br All these attacks require physical access to the system and are thwarted by a secondary protector such as a USB flash drive or PIN code br br br Upholding Kerckhoffs s principle br Although the AES encryption algorithm used in BitLocker is in the public domain its implementation in BitLocker as well as other components of the software are proprietary however the code is available for scrutiny by Microsoft partners and enterprises subject to a non disclosure agreement br According to Microsoft sources BitLocker does not contain an intentionally built in backdoor so there is no Microsoft provided way for law enforcement to have guaranteed access to the data on a user s drive In the UK Home Office expressed concern over the lack of a backdoor and tried entering into talks with Microsoft to get one introduced Microsoft developer and cryptographer Niels Ferguson denied the backdoor request and said over my dead body Microsoft engineers have said that United States Federal Bureau of Investigation agents also put pressure on them in numerous meetings to add a backdoor although no formal written request was ever made Microsoft engineers eventually suggested that agents should look for the hard copy of the encryption key that the BitLocker program suggests that its users make br Niels Ferguson s position that back doors are simply not acceptable is in accordance with Kerckhoffs s principle Stated by Netherlands born cryptographer Auguste Kerckhoffs in the th century the principle holds that a cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system except the encryption key is public knowledge br br br Other concerns br Starting with Windows and Windows Server Microsoft removed the Elephant Diffuser from the BitLocker scheme for no declared reason Dan Rosendorf s research shows that removing the Elephant Diffuser had an undeniably negative impact on the security of BitLocker encryption against a targeted attack Microsoft later cited performance concerns and noncompliance with the Federal Information Processing Standards FIPS to justify the diffuser s removal Starting with Windows version however Microsoft added a new FIPS compliant XTS AES encryption algorithm to BitLocker Starting with Windows version Microsoft added a new feature called Kernel Direct Memory access DMA Protection to BitLocker to protect against DMA attacks via Thunderbolt ports Kernel Direct Memory access DMA Protection only protects against attacks through Thunderbolt Direct Memory Access is also possible through PCI Express In this type of attack an attacker would connect a malicious PCI Express Device which can in turn write directly to the memory and bypass the Windows login To protect again this type of attack Microsoft introduced Virtualization based Security br In October it was reported that a flaw enabled private keys to be inferred from public keys which could allow an attacker to bypass BitLocker encryption when an affected TPM chip is used The flaw is the Return of Coppersmith s Attack or ROCA vulnerability which is in a code library developed by Infineon and had been in widespread use in security products such as smartcards and TPMs Microsoft released an updated version of the firmware for Infineon TPM chips that fixes the flaw via Windows Update br br br See also br Features new to Windows Vista br List of
