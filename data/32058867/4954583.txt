FreeOTFE is a discontinued open source computer program for on the fly disk encryption OTFE On Microsoft Windows and Windows Mobile using FreeOTFE PDA it can create a virtual drive within a file or partition to which anything written is automatically encrypted before being stored on a computer s hard or USB drive It is similar in function to other disk encryption programs including TrueCrypt and Microsoft s BitLocker br The author Sarah Dean went absent as of The FreeOTFE website is unreachable as of June and the domain name is now registered by a domain squatter The original program can be downloaded from a mirror at Sourceforge In June a fork of the project now named LibreCrypt appeared on GitHub br br br Overview br FreeOTFE was initially released by Sarah Dean in and was the first open source code disk encryption system that provided a modular architecture allowing rd parties to implement additional algorithms if needed Older FreeOTFE licensing required that any modification to the program be placed in the public domain This does not conform technically to section of the Open Source definition Newer program licensing omits this condition The FreeOTFE license has not been approved by the Open Source Initiative and is not certified to be labeled with the open source certification mark br This software is compatible with Linux encrypted volumes e g LUKS cryptoloop dm crypt allowing data encrypted under Linux to be read and written freely It was the first open source transparent disk encryption system to support Windows Vista and PDAs br Optional two factor authentication using smart cards and or hardware security modules HSMs also termed security tokens was introduced in v using the PKCS Cryptoki standard developed by RSA Laboratories br FreeOTFE also allows any number of hidden volumes to be created giving plausible deniability and deniable encryption and also has the option of encrypting full partitions or disks but not the system partition br br br Portable use br br FreeOTFE can be used in portable or traveller mode which allows it to be kept on a USB drive or other portable media together with its encrypted data and carried around This allows it to be used under Microsoft Windows without installation of the complete program to mount and access the encrypted data through a virtual disk br The use of this mode requires installing device drivers at least temporarily to create virtual disks and as a consequence administrator rights are needed to start this traveller mode As with most open source software that uses device drivers the user must enable test signing when running Windows Vista x and Windows x systems br br br Driverless operation br Packaged with FreeOTFE is another program called FreeOTFE Explorer which provides a driverless system that allows encrypted disks to be used without administrator rights br This allows FreeOTFE encrypted data to be used on for example public computers found in libraries or computer kiosks interactive kiosks where administrator rights are unavailable br Unlike FreeOTFE FreeOTFE Explorer does not provide on the fly encryption through a virtual drive Instead it lets files be stored and extracted from encrypted disk images in a similar manner as ZIP and RAR archives by using a Windows Explorer like interface br br br Algorithms implemented br Due to its architecture FreeOTFE provides great flexibility to the user with its encryption options br br br Ciphers br FreeOTFE implements several ciphers including br br It includes all National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST Advanced Encryption Standard AES finalists and all ciphers can be used with multiple different keylengths br br br Cipher modes br FreeOTFE originally offered encryption using cipher block chaining CBC with encrypted salt sector initialization vector ESSIV though from v introduced LRW and also the more secure XTS mode which supersedes LRW in the IEEE P standard for disk encryption br br br Hashes br As with its cipher options FreeOTFE offers many different hash algorithms br br br See also br Disk encryption br Disk encryption software br On the fly encryption br Comparison of disk encryption software br br br br br br External links br FreeOTFE at the Wayback Machine archived May br FreeOTFE on SourceForge
