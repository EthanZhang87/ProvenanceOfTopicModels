title: Matrix (protocol)
id: 46246817
Matrix sometimes stylized as matrix is an open standard and communication protocol for real time communication It aims to make real time communication work seamlessly between different service providers in the way that standard Simple Mail Transfer Protocol email currently does for store and forward email service by allowing users with accounts at one communications service provider to communicate with users of a different service provider via online chat voice over IP and videotelephony It therefore serves a similar purpose to protocols like XMPP but is not based on any existing communication protocol br From a technical perspective it is an application layer communication protocol for federated real time communication It provides HTTP APIs and open source reference implementations for securely distributing and persisting messages in JSON format over an open federation of servers It can integrate with standard web services via WebRTC facilitating browser to browser applications br br br History br br The initial project was created inside Amdocs while building a chat tool called Amdocs Unified Communications by Matthew Hodgson and Amandine Le Pape Amdocs then funded most of the development work from to October Matrix was the winner of the Innovation award at WebRTC Conference Expo and of the Best in Show award at WebRTC World in The protocol received praise mixed with some cautionary notes after it launched in Reviewers noted that other attempts at defining an open instant messaging or multimedia signalling protocol of this type had difficulties becoming widely adopted e g XMPP and IRCv and have highlighted the challenges involved both technological and political Some were unclear if there was enough demand among users for services which interoperate among providers In a subsidiary of Amdocs was created named Vector Creations Limited and the Matrix staff was moved there br In July the funding by Amdocs was announced to be cut and in the following weeks the core team created their own UK based company New Vector Limited which was mainly built to support the development of Matrix and Riot which was later renamed to Element During this time period there were multiple calls for support to the community and companies that build on Matrix to help pay for the wages of at least part of the core team Patreon and Liberapay crowdfunding accounts were created and the core team started a video podcast called Matrix Live to keep the contributors up to speed with ongoing developments This was expanded by a weekly blog format called This Week in Matrix where interested community members could read or submit their own Matrix related news The company was created with the goal of offering consultancy services for Matrix and paid hosting of Matrix servers as a platform called modular im which was later renamed to Element matrix services to generate income br In the early weeks after its creation the Matrix team and the company Purism published plans to collaborate in the creation of the Librem phone The Librem was intended to be a Matrix native phone where the default pre installed messaging and caller app should use Matrix for audio and video calls and instant messaging br In KDE announced it was working on including support for the protocol in its IRC client Konversation br In late January the company received an investment of US million from Status an Ethereum based startup br In April the French Government announced plans to create their own instant messaging tool Work on the application based on Riot and Matrix protocol called Tchap after French scientist Claude Chappe had started in early and the program was open sourced and released on iOS and Android in April br In October a Community Interest Company called The Matrix org Foundation C I C was incorporated to serve as a neutral legal entity for further development of the standard br In February the KDE community announced plans to adopt Matrix for its internal communications needs as a decentralized alternative to other instant messaging servers like Telegram Slack and Discord and operate its own server instance br In April Matrix org suffered a security breach in which the production servers were compromised br This breach was not an issue with the Matrix protocol and did not directly affect home servers other than matrix org br In June the Matrix protocol left beta phase with the version across all APIs and Synapse at the time the reference home server and the Matrix foundation was officially launched br In October New Vector raised an additional US million to develop Matrix br In December German Ministry of Defense announced a pilot project called BwMessenger for secure instant messaging tool based on Matrix protocol Synapse server and Riot application This is modeled after French Tchap project The long term goal of the Federal Government is the secure use of messenger services that covers all ministries and subordinate authorities br In December Mozilla announced that it would begin to use Matrix as a replacement for IRC In the announcement they said that they would be completing the move in late January The Mozilla IRC server irc mozilla org is said to be removed no later than March of next year In March the IRC server was turned off and users were directed to join chat mozilla org Mozilla s Element instance br In May Matrix enabled end to end encryption by default for private conversations br In October Element acquired Gitter from GitLab This meant that all Gitter users would be transitioned over to Matrix br In March matrix org announced that there are million global visible accounts br In September some security issues were found in the implementation of one client side encryption library Due to the interoperable architecture only the affected client applications needed upgrade and third party implementations were not affected All critical issues were fixed with the remaining ones being either non exploitable in practice or already prominently warned for in the client br In February the Matrix foundation has been invited to the Digital Markets Act stakeholder workshop on Interoperability between messaging services and showcased how a standardised open protocol can be used to interoperate without sacrificing privacy br In June Beeper became the first member of The Matrix Foundation br In April the first elections of the Matrix Foundation s Governing Board were held which is made up of nine different constituency groups across three categories nonprofit and community representatives funder representatives and foundation representatives br br br Protocol br br Matrix targets use cases like voice over IP Internet of things and instant messaging including group communication along with a longer term goal to be a generic messaging and data synchronization system for the web The protocol supports security and replication maintaining full conversation history with no single points of control or failure Existing communication services can integrate with the Matrix ecosystem br Client software is available for open federated Instant Messaging IM voice over IP VoIP and Internet of Things IoT communication br The Matrix standard specifies RESTful HTTP APIs for securely transmitting and replicating JSON data between Matrix capable clients servers and services Clients send data by PUTing it to a room on their server which then replicates the data over all the Matrix servers participating in this room This data is signed using a git style signature to mitigate tampering and the federated traffic is encrypted with HTTPS and signed with each server s private key to avoid spoofing Replication follows eventual consistency semantics allowing servers to function even if offline or after data loss by re synchronizing missing history from other participating servers br br br Olm encryption br The Olm library provides for optional end to end encryption on a room by room basis via a Double Ratchet Algorithm implementation It can ensure that conversation data at rest is only readable by the room participants With it configured data transmitted over Matrix is only visible as ciphertext to the Matrix servers and can be decrypted only by authorized participants in the room The encryption protocol is called Olm Megolm is an expansion of Olm to better suit the need for bigger rooms There are two main implementations br br vodozemac the current reference implementation written in Rust In it has been audited by Least Authority whose findings are publicly available and have been addressed by the Matrix team The review was partially funded by Germany s national agency for the healthcare system digitalisation Gematik br libolm the former reference implementation has been subject of a cryptographic review by NCC Group whose findings are publicly available and have been addressed by the Matrix team The review was sponsored by the Open Technology Fund br Outbound group session keys are needed for initiating new Megolm sessions for group chats In addition cross signing keys are used to verify the overall identity of the user and his her devices When enabling a secure backup all those keys are encrypted using a strong passphrase or a randomly generated recovery key This ensures that even a person who has access to the backup of the keys could not decrypt messages guaranteeing full E EE br br br Bridges br Matrix supports bridging messages from different chat applications into Matrix rooms These bridges are programs that run on the server and communicate with the non Matrix servers Bridges can either be acting as puppets or relays where in the former the individual user s account is visibly posting the messages and in the latter a bot posts the messages for non puppeteered user accounts br Currently there are official bridges for br br Gitter br IRC br Slack Mattermost br XMPP br Bridges for the following notable applications are maintained by the community br br br Adoption br Communication among the public agents of France s central administration happens on a Matrix based internal network named Tchap br br The project is developed by the Interministerial Directorate for Digital Affairs DINUM with the explicit goals of security and digital sovereignty both of which were deemed to be impossible through WhatsApp Telegram and Slack br br Germany s national healthcare system s internal communication network uses a Matrix based br br system Ti Messenger for real time communication among Germany s healthcare organizations and sharing of sensitive patient data and is developed by the national agency for the digitalisation of the healthcare system Gematik GmbH br br Reasons for choosing Matrix included federated identity management which allows to reuse the existing identity infrastructure into the new chat system the decentralized architecture which allows cross linking data from disparate sources and the open protocol which ensures interoperability and future proof data exchange and prevents vendor lock in br br Employees of the Bundeswehr Germany s armed forces communicate with each other and share classified documents German VS NfD on a private Matrix network with a customized version of the Matrix Element app BwMessenger as mentioned above br br Two states of Germany run their own Matrix chat networks for schools Rhineland Palatinate is offering SchulchatRLP as a fork of FluffyChat since the beginning of The server is sized for half a million pupils and deployed on kubernetes and the client was enhanced with features such as read receipt for parents or polls by fairkom who became a silver partner of the Matrix foundation in Bavaria has adapted the Element client as a proprietary ByCS messenger br Luxembourg has developed a Matrix based chat service for government officials named Luxchat Gov planned to be released in the
