title: Push technology
id: 1982854
Push technology also known as server Push refers to a communication method where the communication is initiated by a server rather than a client This approach is different from the pull method where the communication is initiated by a client br In push technology clients can express their preferences for certain types of information or data typically through a process known as the publish subscribe model In this model a client subscribes to specific information channels hosted by a server When new content becomes available on these channels the server automatically sends or pushes this information to the subscribed client br Under certain conditions such as restrictive security policies that block incoming HTTP requests push technology is sometimes simulated using a technique called polling In these cases the client periodically checks with the server to see if new information is available rather than receiving automatic updates br br br General use br Synchronous conferencing and instant messaging are examples of push services Chat messages and sometimes files are pushed to the user as soon as they are received by the messaging service Both decentralized peer to peer programs such as WASTE and centralized programs such as IRC or XMPP allow pushing files which means the sender initiates the data transfer rather than the recipient br Email may also be a push system SMTP is a push protocol see Push e mail However the last step from mail server to desktop computer typically uses a pull protocol like POP or IMAP Modern e mail clients make this step seem instantaneous by repeatedly polling the mail server frequently checking it for new mail The IMAP protocol includes the IDLE command which allows the server to tell the client when new messages arrive The original BlackBerry was the first popular example of push email in a wireless context br Another example is the PointCast Network which was widely covered in the s It delivered news and stock market data as a screensaver Both Netscape and Microsoft integrated push technology through the Channel Definition Format CDF into their software at the height of the browser wars but it was never very popular CDF faded away and was removed from the browsers of the time replaced in the s with RSS a pull system br Other uses of push enabled web applications include software updates distribution push updates market data distribution stock tickers online chat messaging systems webchat auctions online betting and gaming sport results monitoring consoles and sensor network monitoring br br br Examples br br br Web push br The Web push proposal of the Internet Engineering Task Force is a simple protocol using HTTP version to deliver real time events such as incoming calls or messages which can be delivered or pushed in a timely fashion The protocol consolidates all real time events into a single session which ensures more efficient use of network and radio resources A single service consolidates all events distributing those events to applications as they arrive This requires just one session avoiding duplicated overhead costs br Web Notifications are part of the W C standard and define an API for end user notifications A notification allows alerting the user of an event such as the delivery of an email outside the context of a web page As part of this standard Push API is fully implemented in Chrome Firefox and Edge and partially implemented in Safari as of February br br br HTTP server push br HTTP server push also known as HTTP streaming is a mechanism for sending unsolicited asynchronous data from a web server to a web browser HTTP server push can be achieved through any of several mechanisms br As a part of HTML the Web Socket API allows a web server and client to communicate over a full duplex TCP connection br Generally the web server does not terminate a connection after response data has been served to a client The web server leaves the connection open so that if an event occurs for example a change in internal data which needs to be reported to one or multiple clients it can be sent out immediately otherwise the event would have to be queued until the client s next request is received Most web servers offer this functionality via CGI e g Non Parsed Headers scripts on Apache HTTP Server The underlying mechanism for this approach is chunked transfer encoding br Another mechanism is related to a special MIME type called multipart x mixed replace which was introduced by Netscape in Web browsers interpret this as a document that changes whenever the server pushes a new version to the client It is still supported by Firefox Opera and Safari today but it is ignored by Internet Explorer and is only partially supported by Chrome It can be applied to HTML documents and also for streaming images in webcam applications br The WHATWG Web Applications proposal includes a mechanism to push content to the client On September the Opera web browser implemented this new experimental system in a feature called Server Sent Events It is now part of the HTML standard br br br Pushlet br In this technique the server takes advantage of persistent HTTP connections leaving the response perpetually open i e the server never terminates the response effectively fooling the browser to remain in loading mode after the initial page load could be considered complete The server then periodically sends snippets of JavaScript to update the content of the page thereby achieving push capability By using this technique the client doesn t need Java applets or other plug ins in order to keep an open connection to the server the client is automatically notified about new events pushed by the server One serious drawback to this method however is the lack of control the server has over the browser timing out a page refresh is always necessary if a timeout occurs on the browser end br br br Long polling br Long polling is itself not a true push long polling is a variation of the traditional polling technique but it allows emulating a push mechanism under circumstances where a real push is not possible such as sites with security policies that require rejection of incoming HTTP requests br With long polling the client requests to get more information from the server exactly as in normal polling but with the expectation that the server may not respond immediately If the server has no new information for the client when the poll is received then instead of sending an empty response the server holds the request open and waits for response information to become available Once it does have new information the server immediately sends an HTTP response to the client completing the open HTTP request Upon receipt of the server response the client often immediately issues another server request In this way the usual response latency the time between when the information first becomes available and the next client request otherwise associated with polling clients is eliminated br For example BOSH is a popular long lived HTTP technique used as a long polling alternative to a continuous TCP connection when such a connection is difficult or impossible to employ directly e g in a web browser it is also an underlying technology in the XMPP which Apple uses for its iCloud push support br br br Flash XML Socket relays br This technique used by chat applications makes use of the XML Socket object in a single pixel Adobe Flash movie Under the control of JavaScript the client establishes a TCP connection to a unidirectional relay on the server The relay server does not read anything from this socket instead it immediately sends the client a unique identifier Next the client makes an HTTP request to the web server including this identifier with it The web application can then push messages addressed to the client to a local interface of the relay server which relays them over the Flash socket The advantage of this approach is that it appreciates the natural read write asymmetry that is typical of many web applications including chat and as a consequence it offers high efficiency Since it does not accept data on outgoing sockets the relay server does not need to poll outgoing TCP connections at all making it possible to hold open tens of thousands of concurrent connections In this model the limit to scale is the TCP stack of the underlying server operating system br br br Reliable Group Data Delivery RGDD br In services such as Cloud Computing to increase reliability and availability of data it is usually pushed replicated to several machines For example the Hadoop Distributed File System HDFS makes extra copies of any object stored RGDD focuses on efficiently casting an object from one location to many while saving bandwidth by sending minimal number of copies only one in the best case of the object over any link across the network For example Datacast is a scheme for delivery to many nodes inside data centers that relies on regular and structured topologies and DCCast is a similar approach for delivery across data centers br br br Push notification br br A push notification is a message that is pushed from a back end server or application to a user interface e g mobile applications or desktop applications Apple introduced push notifications for iPhone in and in Google released Google Cloud to Device Messaging superseded by Google Cloud Messaging and then by Firebase Cloud Messaging br In November Microsoft announced that the Windows Notification Service would be expanded to make use of the Universal Windows Platform architecture allowing for push data to be sent to Windows Windows Mobile Xbox and other supported platforms using universal API calls and POST requests br Push notifications are mainly divided into two approaches local notifications and remote notifications For local notifications the application schedules the notification with the local device s OS For remote notifications the application sets a timer in the application itself provided it is able to continuously run in the background When the event s scheduled time is reached or the event s programmed condition is met the message is displayed in the application s user interface br Remote notifications are handled by a remote server Under this scenario the client application needs to be registered on the server with a unique key e g a UUID The server then fires the message against the unique key to deliver it to the client via an agreed client server protocol such as HTTP or XMPP and the client displays the message received When the push notification arrives it can transmit short notifications and messages set badges on application icons blink or continuously light up the notification LED or play alert sounds to attract user s attention Push notifications are usually used by applications to bring information to users attention The content of the messages can be classified in the following example categories br br Chat messages from a messaging application such as Facebook Messenger sent by other users br Vendor special offers A vendor may want to advertise their offers to customers br Event reminders Some applications may allow the customer to create a reminder or alert for a specific time br Subscribed topic changes Users may want to get updates regarding the weather in their location or monitor a web page to track changes for instance br Real time push notifications may raise privacy issues since they can be used to bind virtual identities of social network pseudonyms to the real identities of the smartphone owners The use of unnecessary push notifications for promotional purposes has been criticized as an example of attention theft br br br See also br br br br br br External links br W C Push Workshop A workshop that discussed push technology and some early examples thereof br HTTP Streaming with Ajax A
