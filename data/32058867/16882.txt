the Canary Island of Tenerife Spain No one on the KLM survived crew passengers were killed while of the passengers and crew on the Pan Am aircraft survived Pilot error from the KLM aircraft was the primary cause Owing to a communication misunderstanding the KLM captain thought he had clearance for takeoff Another cause was dense fog meaning the KLM flight crew was unable to see the Pan Am aircraft on the runway until immediately prior to the collision The accident had a lasting influence on the industry particularly in the area of communication An increased emphasis was placed on using standardized phraseology in air traffic control ATC communication by both controllers and pilots alike thereby reducing the chance for misunderstandings As part of these changes the word takeoff was removed from general usage and is only spoken by ATC when clearing an aircraft to take off br br br Other accidents and incidents br br br Notable employees br Jacob Veldhuyzen van Zanten pilot
