id: 24806506
Windows is a major release of the Windows NT operating system developed by Microsoft It was released to manufacturing on August made available for download via MSDN and TechNet on August and generally released for retail on October br Windows introduced major changes to the operating system s platform and user interface with the intention to improve its user experience on tablets where Windows competed with mobile operating systems such as Android and iOS In particular these changes included a touch optimized Windows shell and start screen based on Microsoft s Metro design language integration with online services the Windows Store and a new keyboard shortcut for screenshots Many of these features were adapted from Windows Phone Windows also added support for USB Advanced Format near field communication and cloud computing as well as a new lock screen with clock and notifications Additional security features including built in antivirus software integration with Microsoft SmartScreen phishing filtering and support for Secure Boot on supported devices were introduced It was the first Windows version to support ARM architecture under the Windows RT branding CPUs without PAE SSE and NX are unsupported in this version br Windows received a mostly negative reception Although the reaction to its performance improvements security enhancements and improved support for touchscreen devices was positive the new user interface was widely criticized as confusing and unintuitive especially when used with a keyboard and mouse rather than a touchscreen Despite these shortcomings million licenses were sold through January including upgrades and sales to OEMs for new PCs br Windows was succeeded by Windows in October which addressed some aspects of Windows that were criticized by reviewers and early adopters and also incorporated various improvements Support for RTM editions of Windows ended on January and with the exception of Windows Embedded Standard users all users are required to install the Windows update Mainstream support for the Embedded Standard edition of Windows ended on July and extended support ended on July br br br Development br br br Early development br Development started in while Microsoft was finishing work on Windows At the Consumer Electronics Show in January it was announced that the next version of Windows would add support for ARM System on chips alongside the existing bit processors produced by vendors especially AMD and Intel Windows division president Steven Sinofsky demonstrated an early build of the port on prototype devices while Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer announced the company s goal for Windows to be everywhere on every kind of device without compromise Details also began to surface about a new application framework for Windows codenamed Jupiter which would be used to make immersive applications using XAML similarly to Windows Phone and Silverlight that could be distributed via a new packaging system and a rumored application store br The earliest available build of Windows is build compiled in January The build was almost identical to Windows except for the wallpaper being different the same one from the Beta and Release Candidate In addition there were a few references to Windows in this build s Local Group Policy Editor Utility br In late an optional D desktop user interface for high end systems named Wind was rumored br Two milestone releases of Windows and one of Windows Server leaked to the general public Milestone Build was leaked on April It was the first build where the title of a window was written centered instead of aligned to the left It was also probably the first appearance of the Metro style font and its wallpaper had the text shhh let s not leak our hard work However its detailed build number reveals that the build was created on September The leaked copy was Enterprise edition with other editions leaking later In it was discovered that Metro existed in this build after disabling the Redpill feature lockout The start screen was very primitive being a screen with a white background and gray tiles The charms bar was also included but was unusable The OS still reads as Windows Milestone Build was leaked on April The traditional Blue Screen of Death BSoD was replaced by a new black screen although it was later reverted to a different blue color This build introduced a new ribbon in Windows Explorer The Windows logo was temporarily replaced with text displaying Microsoft Confidential Both builds and leaked alongside Windows Server build On June build bit edition was leaked It introduced a new boot screen featuring the same Betta fish as the default Windows Beta wallpaper which was later replaced and the circling dots as featured in the final build although the final version comes with smaller circling dots throbber It also had the text Welcome below them although this was scrapped br On June Microsoft unveiled Windows s new user interface as well as additional features at both Computex Taipei and the D All Things Digital conference in California br The Building Windows blog launched on August featuring details surrounding Windows s features and its development process br br br Previews br br Microsoft would unveil more Windows features and improvements on the first day of the first build conference on September The first public beta build of Windows Windows Developer Preview build was released at the event A Samsung tablet running the build was also distributed to conference attendees br The build was released for download later that day in bit and bit variants and a special bit variant which included SDKs and developer tools Visual Studio Express and Expression Blend for developing Metro style apps The Windows Store was also announced during the presentation but was not available in this build According to Microsoft there were about downloads of the developer preview within the first hours of its release Originally set to expire on March in February the Developer Preview s expiry date was changed to January br On February Microsoft unveiled a new logo for Windows Designed by Pentagram partner Paula Scher the Windows logo was changed to resemble a set of four window panes Additionally the entire logo is now rendered in a single solid color br On February Microsoft released Windows Consumer Preview the beta version of Windows build Alongside other changes the build brought over the big change from build removing the Start button from the taskbar for the first time in a public build since its debut on Windows according to Windows manager Chaitanya Sareen the Start button was removed to reflect their view that on Windows the desktop was an app itself and not the primary interface of the operating system Windows president Steven Sinofsky said more than changes had been made since the developer version went public The day after its release Windows Consumer Preview had been downloaded over one million times Like the Developer Preview the Consumer Preview expired on January br Many other builds may exist or were released until Japan s Developers Day conference when Sinofsky announced that Windows Release Preview build would be released during the first week of June On May Windows Release Preview Standard Simplified Chinese x edition not China specific variant build was leaked online on various Chinese and BitTorrent websites On May Windows Release Preview was released to the public by Microsoft Major items in the Release Preview included the addition of Sports Travel and News apps along with an integrated variant of Adobe Flash Player in Internet Explorer Like the Developer Preview and the Consumer Preview the release preview expired on January br br br Release br br On August Windows build was released to manufacturing with the build number and Microsoft planned to hold a launch event on October before releasing it for general availability the next day However only a day after its release to manufacturing a copy of the final version of Windows Enterprise N a variant for European markets which lacks bundled media players to comply with an antitrust ruling was leaked online followed by leaks of the final versions of Windows Pro and Enterprise a few days later On August Windows was made available to download for MSDN and TechNet subscribers and was made available to Software Assurance customers on August It was made available for students with a DreamSpark Premium subscription on August earlier than advertised Windows became generally available for retail purchase on October br Relatively few changes were made from the Release Preview to the final version These included updated versions of bundled apps the renaming of Windows Explorer to File Explorer the replacement of the Aero Glass theme from Windows Vista and with a new flat and solid color theme as seen in build and the addition of new background options for the Start screen lock screen and desktop Prior to its general availability on October updates were released for some of Windows s bundled apps and a General Availability Cumulative Update which included fixes to improve performance compatibility and battery life was released on Tuesday October Microsoft stated that due to improvements to its testing infrastructure general improvements of this nature were to be released more frequently through Windows Update instead of being relegated to OEMs and service packs only br Microsoft began an advertising campaign centered around Windows and its Surface tablet in October starting with its first television advertisement premiering on October The advertising budget of US billion was significantly larger than the US million campaign used to promote Windows As part of its campaign Microsoft set up pop up stores inside malls to showcase the Surface product line and provided training for retail employees in partnership with Intel In an effort to make retail displays of Windows devices more personal by exemplifying real world usage Microsoft developed a character known in English speaking markets as Allison Brown whose fictional profile including personal photos contacts and emails was featured on in store demo units of Windows devices br br In May Microsoft launched a new television campaign for Windows illustrating the capabilities and pricing of Windows tablets in comparison to the iPad which featured the voice of Siri remarking on the iPad s limitations in a parody of Apple s Get a Mac advertisements On June during game of the Stanley Cup Finals Microsoft premiered the first ad in its Windows Everywhere campaign which promoted Windows Windows Phone and the company s suite of online services as an interconnected platform Microsoft also announced that it would partner with electronics store chain Best Buy to convert PC departments at locations in the United States and Canada into a Windows branded store within a store that would showcase Microsoft products services and Windows devices br br br New and updated features br br New features and functionality in Windows include a faster startup through UEFI integration and the new Hybrid Boot mode which hibernates the Windows kernel on shutdown to speed up the subsequent boot a new lock screen with a clock and notifications and the ability for enterprise users to create live USB variants of Windows also known as Windows To Go It also includes native support for USB devices which allow for faster data transfers and improved power management with compatible devices and hard disk KB Advanced Format support as well as support for near field communication to facilitate sharing and communication between devices br Windows Explorer which has been renamed to File Explorer now includes a ribbon in place of the command bar File operation dialog boxes have been updated to provide more detailed statistics the ability to pause file transfers and improvements in the ability to manage conflicts when copying files A new File History function allows incremental revisions of files to be backed up to and restored from a secondary storage device while Storage Spaces allows users to combine different sized hard disks into virtual drives and specify mirroring parity or no redundancy on a folder by folder basis For easier management of files and folders Windows introduces the ability to move selected files or folders via drag and drop from a parent folder into a subfolder listed within the breadcrumb hierarchy of the address bar in File Explorer br Task Manager has been redesigned including a new processes tab with the option to display fewer or more details of running applications and background processes a heat map using different colors indicating the level of resource usage network and disk counters grouping by process type e g applications background processes and Windows processes friendly names for processes and a new option which allows users to search the web to find information about obscure processes Additionally the Blue Screen of Death has been updated with a simpler and modern design with less technical information displayed br br br Safety and security br New security features in Windows include two new authentication methods tailored towards touchscreens PINs and picture passwords the addition of antivirus capabilities to Windows Defender bringing it in parity with Microsoft Security Essentials SmartScreen filtering integrated into Windows Family Safety offers parental controls which allows parents to monitor and manage their children s activities on a device with activity reports and safety controls Windows also provides integrated system recovery through the new Refresh and Reset functions including system recovery from USB drive Windows s first security patches would be released on November it would contain three fixes deemed critical by the company br Windows supports a feature of the UEFI specification known as Secure boot which uses a public key infrastructure to verify the integrity of the operating system and prevent unauthorized programs such as bootkits from infecting the device s boot process Some pre built devices may be described as certified by Microsoft these must have secure boot enabled by default and provide ways for users to disable or re configure the feature ARM based Windows RT devices must have secure boot permanently enabled br br br Online services and functionality br Windows provides tighter integration with online services from Microsoft and others A user can now log into Windows with a Microsoft account which can be used to access services and synchronize applications and settings between multiple devices A client app for Microsoft s SkyDrive cloud storage service allows apps to save files directly to SkyDrive However a SkyDrive client for the desktop and File Explorer is not included in Windows and must be downloaded separately Bundled multimedia apps are provided under the Xbox brand including Xbox Music Xbox Video and the Xbox SmartGlass companion for use with an Xbox console Games can integrate into an Xbox Live hub app which also allows users to view their profile and Gamerscore Other bundled apps provide the ability to link Flickr and Facebook Due to Facebook Connect service changes Facebook support is disabled in all bundled apps effective June br Internet Explorer is included as two variants a desktop program and a touch optimized app It also includes increased support for HTML CSS and hardware acceleration The app does not support plugins or ActiveX components but includes a variant of Adobe Flash Player that is optimized for touch and low power usage Initially Adobe Flash would only work on sites included on a Compatibility View whitelist however after feedback from users and additional compatibility tests an update in March changed this behavior to use a smaller blacklist of sites with known compatibility issues instead allowing Flash to be used with most sites by default The desktop variant does not contain these limitations br Windows also incorporates improved support for mobile broadband the operating system can now detect the insertion of a SIM card and automatically configure connection settings including APNs and carrier branding and reduce its Internet usage to conserve bandwidth on metered networks An integrated airplane mode setting enables users to globally disable all wireless connectivity Carriers can also offer account management systems through Windows Store apps which can be automatically installed as a part of the connection process and offer usage statistics on their respective tile br br br Windows Store apps br br Windows introduces a new style of application Windows Store apps According to Microsoft developer Jensen Harris these apps are optimized for touchscreen environments and are more specialized than current desktop applications Apps can run either in a full screen mode or be snapped to the side of a screen Apps can provide toast notifications on screen or animate their tiles on the Start screen with dynamic content Apps can use contracts a collection of hooks to provide common functionality that can integrate with other apps including search and sharing Apps can also provide integration with other services for example the People app can connect to a variety of different social networks and services such as Facebook Skype and People service while the Photos app can aggregate photos from services such as Facebook and Flickr br Windows Store apps run within a new set of APIs known as Windows Runtime which supports programming languages such as C C Visual Basic NET C along with HTML and JavaScript If written in some high level languages apps written for Windows Runtime can be compatible with both Intel and ARM variants of Windows otherwise they are not binary code compatible Components may be compiled as Windows Runtime Components permitting their use by all compatible languages To ensure stability and security apps run within a sandboxed environment and require permissions to use certain other functionalities such as accessing the Internet or a camera br Retail variants of Windows are only able to install these apps through Windows Store a namesake distribution platform that offers both apps and listings for desktop programs certified for comparability with Windows A method to sideload apps from outside Windows Store is available to devices running Windows Enterprise and joined to a domain Windows Pro and Windows RT devices that are not part of a domain can also sideload apps but only after special product keys are obtained through volume licensing br The term Immersive app had been used internally by Microsoft developers to refer to the apps prior to the first official presentation of Windows after which they were referred to as Metro style apps in reference to the Metro design language The term was phased out in August a Microsoft spokesperson denied rumors that the change was related to a potential trademark issue and stated that Metro was only a codename that would be replaced prior to Windows s release Following these reports the terms Modern UI style apps Windows style apps and Windows Store apps began to be used in various Microsoft documents and material to refer to the new apps In an interview on September Soma Somasegar vice president of Microsoft s development software division confirmed that Windows Store apps would be the official term for the apps An MSDN page explaining the Metro design language uses the term Modern design to refer to the language as a whole br br br Web browsers br Exceptions to the restrictions faced by Windows Store apps are given to web browsers The user s default browser can distribute a Metro style web browser in the same package as the desktop variant which has access to functionality unavailable to other apps such as being able to permanently run in the background use multiple background processes and use Windows API code instead of WinRT allowing for code to be re used with the desktop variant while still taking advantage of features available to Windows Store apps such as charms Microsoft advertises this exception privilege New experience enabled formerly Metro style enabled br The developers of both Chrome and Firefox committed to developing Metro style variants of their browsers while Chrome s Windows mode discontinued on Chrome version uses a full screen version of the existing desktop interface Firefox s variant which was first made available on the Aurora release channel in September uses a touch optimized interface inspired by the Android variant of Firefox In October Chrome s app was changed to mimic the desktop environment used by ChromeOS Development of the Firefox app for Windows has since been cancelled citing a lack of user adoption of the beta versions br br br Interface and desktop br Windows introduces significant changes to the operating system s user interface many of which are aimed at improving its experience on tablet computers and other touchscreen devices The new user interface is based on Microsoft s Metro design language and uses a Start screen similar to that of Windows Phone as the primary means of launching applications The Start screen displays a customizable array of tiles linking to various apps and desktop programs some of which can display constantly updated information and content through live tiles As a form of multi tasking apps can be snapped to the side of a screen Alongside the traditional Control Panel a new simplified and touch optimized settings app known as PC Settings is used for basic configuration and user settings It does not include many of the advanced options still accessible from the Control Panel br A vertical toolbar known as the charms accessed by swiping from the right edge of a touchscreen swiping from the right edge of a touchpad or pointing the cursor at hotspots in the right corners of a screen provides access to system and app related functions such as search sharing device management settings and a Start button The traditional desktop environment for running desktop applications is accessed via a tile on the Start screen The Start button on the taskbar from previous versions of Windows has been converted into a hotspot or hot corner in the lower left corner of the screen which displays a large tooltip displaying a thumbnail of the Start screen Windows added the start button back to the taskbar after many complaints but removed the preview thumbnail Swiping from the left edge of a touchscreen or clicking in the top left corner of the screen allows one to switch between apps and Desktop Pointing the cursor at the top left corner of the screen and moving down reveals a thumbnail list of active apps Aside from the removal of the Start button and the replacement of the Aero Glass theme with a flatter and solid colored design the desktop interface on Windows is similar to that of Windows br br br Removed features br br Several notable features were removed in Windows support for playing DVD Video was removed from Windows Media Player due to the cost of licensing the necessary decoders especially for devices which do not include optical disc drives at all and the prevalence of online streaming services For the same reasons Windows Media Center is not included by default on Windows but Windows Media Center and DVD playback support could be purchased in the Pro Pack which upgrades the system to Windows Pro or the Media Center Pack add on for Windows Pro As with prior versions third party DVD player software can still be used to enable DVD playback br Backup and Restore the backup component of Windows was deprecated It still shipped with Windows and continues to work on preset schedules but it was pushed to the background and can only be accessed through a Control Panel applet called Windows File Recovery Shadow Copy a component of Windows Explorer that once saved previous versions of changed files no longer protects local files and folders It can only access previous versions of shared files stored on a Windows Server computer The subsystem on which these components worked however is still available for other software to use br br br Hardware requirements br br br PCs br The minimum system requirements for Windows are higher than those of Windows The CPU must support the Physical Address Extension PAE NX bit and SSE Windows Store apps require a screen resolution of or higher to run a resolution of or higher is required to use the snap functionality To receive certification Microsoft requires candidate x systems to resume from standby in seconds or less br br Microsoft s Connected Standby specification which hardware vendors may optionally comply with sets new power consumption requirements that are higher than the above minimum specifications Included in this standard are a number of security specific requirements designed to improve physical security notably against Cold Boot Attacks br bit SKUs of Windows only support a maximum of GB of RAM bit SKUs however support more Windows x supports GB while Windows Pro and Enterprise x support GB br In January Microsoft announced that effective July it would no longer support Windows or on devices using Intel s Skylake CPU family and that all future CPU microarchitectures as well as Skylake systems after this date would only be supported on Windows After the deadline only critical security updates would be released for users on these platforms When this new policy faced criticism from users and enterprise customers Microsoft partially retracted the change and stated that both operating systems would remain supported on Skylake hardware through the end of their extended support lifecycle Windows remains officially unsupported on all newer CPU families and neither AMD or Intel will provide official chipset drivers for Windows operating systems other than Windows However in August Microsoft again extended the Skylake support policy until the end of support for Windows and and respectively br br br Tablets and convertibles br Microsoft released minimum hardware requirements for tablet and laplet devices to be certified for Windows and defined a convertible form factor as a standalone device that combines the PC display and rechargeable power source with a mechanically attached keyboard and pointing device in a single chassis A convertible can be transformed into a tablet where the attached input devices are hidden or removed leaving the display as the only input mechanism On March Microsoft amended its certification requirements to only require that screens on tablets have a minimum resolution of down from the previous The amended requirement is intended to allow greater design flexibility for future products br br Updated certification requirements were implemented to coincide with Windows As of all certified devices with integrated displays must contain a p webcam and higher quality speakers and microphones while all certified devices that support Wi Fi must support Bluetooth as well As of all certified devices must contain Trusted Platform Module chips br br br Editions br br Windows is available in three different editions of which only the base edition branded simply as Windows and Windows Pro were sold at retail in most countries and as pre loaded software on new computers Each edition of Windows includes all of the capabilities and features of the edition preceding it and add additional features oriented towards their market segments For example Pro added BitLocker Hyper V the ability to join a domain and the ability to install Windows Media Center as a paid add on Users of Windows can purchase a Pro Pack license that upgrades their system to Windows Pro through Add features to Windows This license also includes Windows Media Center Windows Enterprise contains additional features aimed towards business environments and is only available through volume licensing A port of Windows for ARM architecture Windows RT is marketed as an edition of Windows but was only included as pre loaded software on devices specifically developed for it br Windows was distributed as a retail box product on DVD and through a digital download that could be converted into DVD or USB install media From its launch until January as part of a launch promotion Microsoft offered Windows Pro upgrades at a discounted price of US online or for a retail box afterward the Windows price has been and the Pro price Those who purchased new PCs pre loaded with Windows Home Basic Home Premium Professional or Ultimate between June and January could digitally purchase a Windows Pro upgrade for US Several PC manufacturers offered rebates and refunds on Windows upgrades obtained through promotions on select models such as those of Hewlett Packard in the U S and Canada on select models and Acer in Europe on selected Ultrabook models During these promotions the Windows Media Center add on for Windows Pro was also offered for free br Unlike previous versions of Windows Windows was distributed at retail only under Upgrade licenses which require an onboard version of Windows to install The full version software SKU which was more expensive but could be installed on computers without an eligible OS or none at all was discontinued In lieu of a full version a specialized System Builder SKU was introduced The System Builder replaced the original equipment manufacturer OEM SKU which was only allowed for use on PCs meant for resale but added a Personal Use License exemption that officially allowed its purchase and personal use by users on homebuilt computers br Retail distribution of Windows has since been discontinued in favor of Windows Unlike Windows is available as full version software as both a packaged DVD and online for download and does not require a previous version of Windows in order to be installed Pricing for these new copies remains identical with that of Windows With the retail release of Windows returning to being full version software the Personal Use License exemption was removed from the OEM SKU meaning that end users building their own PCs for personal use must use the full retail variant in order to satisfy the Windows licensing requirements Windows with Bing is a special OEM specific SKU of Windows subsidized by Microsoft s Bing search engine br br br Software compatibility br The three desktop editions of Windows support bit and bit architectures retail copies of Windows include install DVDs for both architectures while the online installer automatically installs the variant corresponding with the architecture of the system s existing Windows installation The bit variant runs on CPUs compatible with the rd generation of the x architecture known as IA or newer and can run bit and bit applications although bit support must be enabled first bit applications are developed for CPUs compatible with x nd generation first conceived in Microsoft started moving away from this architecture after Windows br The bit variant runs on CPUs compatible with the th generation of x known as x or x or newer and can run bit and bit programs bit programs and operating system are restricted to supporting only gigabytes of memory while bit systems can theoretically support gigabytes of memory bit operating systems require a different set of device drivers than those of bit operating systems br Windows RT the only edition of Windows for systems with ARM processors only supports applications included with the system such as a special variant of Office supplied through Windows Update or Windows Store apps to ensure that the system only runs applications that are optimized for the architecture Windows RT does not support running IA or x applications Windows Store apps can either support both the x and ARM architectures or can be compiled to support another specific architecture br Support for IE on Windows Server and Windows Embedded Standard ended on January br br br Reception br br br Pre release br Following the unveiling of Windows Microsoft faced criticism particularly from free software supporters for mandating that devices receiving its optional certification for Windows have secure boot enabled by default using a key provided by Microsoft Concerns were raised that secure boot could prevent or hinder the use of alternate operating systems such as Linux In a post discussing secure boot on the Building Windows blog Microsoft developer Tony Mangefeste indicated that vendors would provide means to customize secure boot stating that At the end of the day the customer is in control of their PC Microsoft s philosophy is to provide customers with the best experience first and allow them to make decisions themselves Microsoft s certification guidelines for Windows ultimately revealed that vendors would be required to provide means for users to re configure or disable secure boot in their device s UEFI firmware It also revealed that ARM devices Windows RT would be required to have secure boot permanently enabled with no way for users to disable it However Tom Warren of The Verge noted that other vendors have implemented similar hardware restrictions on their own ARM based tablet and smartphone products including those running Microsoft s own Windows Phone platform but still argued that Microsoft should keep a consistent approach across ARM and x though not least because of the number of users who d love to run Android alongside Windows on their future tablets No mandate was given regarding the installation of third party certificates that would enable running alternative programs br Several notable video game developers criticized Microsoft for making its Windows Store a closed platform subject to its own regulations as it conflicted with their view of the PC as an open platform Markus Notch Persson creator of the indie game Minecraft Gabe Newell co founder of Valve and developer of software distribution platform Steam and Rob Pardo from Activision Blizzard voiced concern about the closed nature of the Windows Store However Tom Warren of The Verge stated that Microsoft s addition of the Store was simply responding to the success of both Apple and Google in pursuing the curated application store approach br br br Critical reception br Reviews of the various editions of Windows were mixed to negative Tom Warren of The Verge said that although Windows s emphasis on touch computing was significant and risked alienating desktop users he felt that Windows tablets make an iPad feel immediately out of date due to the capabilities of the operating system s hybrid model and increased focus on cloud services David Pierce of The Verge described Windows as the first desktop operating system that understands what a computer is supposed to do in and praised Microsoft s no compromise approach and the operating system s emphasis on Internet connectivity and cloud services Pierce also considered the Start Screen to be a brilliant innovation for desktop computers when compared with folder littered desktops on every other OS because it allows users to interact with dynamic information In contrast an ExtremeTech article said that Windows was Microsoft flailing and a review in PC Magazine condemned the Metro style user interface Some of the included apps in Windows were considered to be basic and lacking in functionality but the Xbox apps were praised for their promotion of a multi platform entertainment experience Other improvements and features such as File History Storage Spaces and the updated Task Manager were also regarded as positive changes Peter Bright of Ars Technica wrote that while its user interface changes may overshadow them Windows s improved performance updated file manager new storage functionality expanded security features and updated Task Manager were still positive improvements for the operating system Bright also said that Windows s duality towards tablets and traditional PCs was an extremely ambitious aspect of the platform as well but criticized Microsoft for emulating Apple s model of a closed distribution platform when implementing the Windows Store br The user interface of Windows has been the subject of negative reaction Bright wrote that its system of hot corners and edge swiping wasn t very obvious due to the lack of instructions provided by the operating system on the functions accessed through the user interface even by the video tutorial added on the RTM release which only instructed users to point at corners of the screen or swipe from its sides Despite this stumbling block Bright said that Windows s interface worked well in some places but began to feel incoherent when switching between the Metro and desktop environments sometimes through inconsistent means Tom Warren of The Verge wrote that the new interface was as stunning as it is surprising contributing to an incredibly personal experience once it is customized by the user but had a steep learning curve and was awkward to use with a keyboard and mouse He noted that while forcing all users to use the new touch oriented interface was a risky move for Microsoft as a whole it was necessary in order to push the development of apps for the Windows Store Others such as Adrian Kingsley Hughes from ZDNet considered the interface to be clumsy and impractical due to its inconsistent design going as far as considering it two operating systems unceremoniously bolted together and concluded that Windows wasn t born out of a need or demand it was born out of a desire on Microsoft s part to exert its will on the PC industry and decide to shape it in a direction touch and tablets that allows it to compete against and remain relevant in the face of Apple s iPad br In Frank X Shaw a Microsoft corporate vice president said that while many of the negative reviews were extreme it was a good thing that Microsoft was listening to feedback and improving a product br The American Customer Satisfaction Index ACSI reported a decline in Microsoft s customer satisfaction the lowest it has been since Windows Vista br br br Market share and sales br Microsoft says that about million users upgraded to Windows over the weekend after its release which CNET says was well below Microsoft s internal projections and was described inside the company as disappointing br On November Microsoft announced that it had sold million licenses of Windows in the first month surpassing the pace of Windows br However according to research firm NPD sales of devices running Windows in the United States had declined percent compared to the same time period in As the holiday shopping season wrapped up Windows sales continued to lag even as Apple reported brisk sales The market research firm IDC reported an overall drop in PC sales for the quarter and said the drop may have been partly due to consumer reluctance to embrace the new features of the OS and poor support from OEM for these features This capped the first year of declining PC sales to the Asia Pacific region as consumers bought more mobile devices than Windows PCs br Windows surpassed Windows Vista in market share with a usage rate according to numbers posted in July by Net Applications with usage on a steady upward trajectory However intake of Windows still lagged behind that of Windows Vista and Windows at the same point in their release cycles Windows s tablet market share also grew steadily with of tablets running Windows in Q according to Strategy Analytics up from nothing just a year before However this was still well below Android and iOS which posted and market share respectively although both operating systems had been on the market much longer than Windows Strategy Analytics also noted a shortage of top tier apps for Windows tablets despite Microsoft strategy of paying developers to create apps for the operating system in addition to those for Windows Phone br In March Microsoft also amended its certification requirements to allow tablets to use the resolution as a minimum this change is expected to allow the production of certified Windows tablets in smaller form factors a market which is currently dominated by Android based tablets Despite the reaction of industry experts Microsoft reported that they had sold million licenses in the first six months This matched sales of Windows over a similar period This statistic includes shipments to channel warehouses which now need to be sold in order to make way for new shipments br In January Hewlett Packard began a promotion for desktops running Windows saying that it was back by popular demand Outside sources have suggested that this might be because HP or its customers thought the Windows platform would be more appropriate for mobile computing than desktop computing or that they were looking to attract customers forced to switch from XP who wanted a more familiar interface br In February Bloomberg reported that Microsoft would be lowering the price of Windows licenses by for devices that retail under US alongside the announcement that an update to the operating system would allow OEMs to produce devices with as little as GB of RAM and GB of storage critics felt that these changes would help Windows compete against Linux based devices in the low end market particularly those running ChromeOS Microsoft had similarly cut the price of Windows XP licenses to compete against the early waves of Linux based netbooks Reports also indicated that Microsoft was planning to offer cheaper Windows licenses to OEMs in exchange for setting Internet Explorer s default search engine to Bing Some media outlets falsely reported that the SKU associated with this plan Windows with Bing was a variant which would be a free or low cost variant of Windows for consumers using older versions of Windows On April Microsoft ultimately announced that it would be removing license fees entirely for devices with screens smaller than inches and officially confirmed the rumored Windows with Bing OEM SKU on May br Based on information gathered by Net Applications the market share of Windows had consistently dropped below the mark by June br br br Chinese government ban br In May the Government of China banned the internal purchase of Windows based products under government contracts requiring energy efficient devices The Xinhua News Agency claimed that Windows was being banned in protest of Microsoft s support lifecycle policy and the end of support for Windows XP which as of January had a market share of in China as the government obviously cannot ignore the risks of running an OS without guaranteed technical support However Ni Guangnan of the Chinese Academy of Sciences had also previously warned that Windows could allegedly expose users to surveillance by the United States government due to its heavy use of Internet based services br In June state broadcaster China Central Television CCTV broadcast a news story further characterizing Windows as a threat to national security The story featured an interview with Ni Guangnan who stated that operating systems could aggregate sensitive user information that could be used to understand the conditions and activities of our national economy and society and alleged that per documents leaked by Edward Snowden the U S government had worked with Microsoft to retrieve encrypted information Yang Min a computer scientist at Fudan University also stated that the security features of Windows are basically to the benefit of Microsoft allowing them control of the users data and that poses a big challenge to the national strategy for information security Microsoft denied the claims in a number of posts on the Chinese social network Sina Weibo posts which stated that the company had never assisted any government in an attack of another government or clients or provided client data to the U S government never provided any government the authority to directly visit or placed any backdoors in its products and services and that it had never concealed government requests for client data br br br Windows br br A feature update to Windows known as Windows was officially announced by Microsoft on May Following a presentation devoted to it at Build a public beta version of the upgrade was released on June Windows was released to OEM hardware partners RTM on August and released publicly as a free upgrade through Windows Store on October Volume license customers and subscribers to MSDN Plus and TechNet Plus were initially unable to obtain the RTM version upon its release a spokesperson said the policy was changed to allow Microsoft to work with OEMs to ensure a quality experience at general availability However after criticism Microsoft reversed its decision and released the RTM build on MSDN and TechNet on September br Windows addressed a number of criticisms faced by Windows upon its release with additional customization options for the Start screen the restoration of a visible Start button on the desktop the ability to snap up to four apps on a single display and the ability to boot to the desktop instead of the Start screen Windows s stock apps were also updated a new Bing based unified search system was added SkyDrive now OneDrive was given tighter integration with the operating system and a number of new stock apps along with a tutorial were added Windows also added support for D printing Miracast media streaming NFC printing and Wi Fi Direct br Microsoft marketed Windows as an update rather than as a service pack as it had done with such revisions for previous versions of Windows Nonetheless Microsoft s support lifecycle policy treats Windows similarly to previous Windows service packs With the exception of Windows Embedded Standard users upgrading to has been required to maintain access to mainstream support and updates after January Although Windows RTM is unsupported Microsoft released an emergency security
