id: 16179920
The App Store is an app marketplace developed and maintained by Apple for mobile apps on its iOS and iPadOS operating systems The store allows users to browse and download approved apps developed within Apple s iOS SDK Apps can be downloaded on the iPhone iPod Touch or iPad and some can be transferred to the Apple Watch smartwatch or th generation or newer Apple TVs as extensions of iPhone apps br The App Store opened on July with an initial applications available The number of apps peaked at around million in but declined slightly over the next few years as Apple began a process to remove old or bit apps As of the store features more than million apps br While Apple touts the role of the App Store in creating new jobs in the app economy and claims to have paid over billion to developers the App Store has also attracted criticism from developers and government regulators that it operates a monopoly and that Apple s cut of revenues from the store is excessive In October the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets ACM concluded that in app commissions from Apple s App Store are anti competitive and would demand that Apple change its in app payment system policies br br br History br br While originally developing iPhone prior to its unveiling in Apple s then CEO Steve Jobs did not intend to let third party developers build native apps for iOS instead directing them to make web applications for the Safari web browser However backlash from developers prompted the company to reconsider with Jobs announcing in October that Apple would have a software development kit available for developers by February The SDK was released on March br The iPhone App Store opened on July On July the iPhone G was released and came pre loaded with support for App Store Initially apps could be free or paid but then in Apple added the ability to add in app purchases which quickly became the dominant way to monetize apps especially games br After the success of Apple s App Store and the launch of similar services by its competitors the term app store has been adopted to refer to any similar service for mobile devices However Apple applied for a U S trademark on the term App Store in which was tentatively approved in early In June U S District Judge Phyllis Hamilton who was presiding over Apple s case against Amazon said she would probably deny Apple s motion to stop Amazon from using the App Store name In July Apple was denied preliminary injunction against Amazon s Appstore by a federal judge br The term app has become a popular buzzword in January app was awarded the honor of being s Word of the Year by the American Dialect Society App has been used as shorthand for application since at least the late s and in product names since at least for example then named Google Apps br Apple announced Mac App Store a similar app distribution platform for its macOS personal computer operating system in October with the official launch taking place in January with the release of its Snow Leopard update br In February Apple informed developers that they could begin using appstore com for links to their apps In June at its developer conference Apple announced an upcoming Kids section in App Store a new section featuring apps categorized by age range and the section was launched alongside the release of iOS in September br In multiple media outlets reported that apps had decreased significantly in popularity Recode wrote that The app boom is over an editorial in TechCrunch stated that The air of hopelessness that surrounds the mobile app ecosystem is obvious and demoralizing and The Verge wrote that the original App Store model of selling apps for a buck or two looks antiquated Issues included consumer boredom a lack of app discoverability and as stated by a report from a lack of new app downloads among smartphone users br In October in an effort to improve app discoverability Apple rolled out the ability for developers to purchase advertising spots in App Store to users in the United States The ads shown at the top of the search results are based strictly on relevant keywords and are not used to create profiles on users Apple expanded search ads to the United Kingdom Australia and New Zealand in April along with more configurable advertising settings for developers Search ads were expanded to Canada Mexico and Switzerland in October In December Apple revamped its search ads program to offer two distinctive versions Search Ads Basic is a pay per install program aimed at smaller developers in which they only pay when users actually install their app Search Ads Basic also features an easier setup process and a restricted monthly budget Search Ads Advanced is a new name given to the older method in which developers have to pay whenever users tap on their apps in search results along with unlimited monthly budgets br In January reports surfaced that documentation for a new beta for the then upcoming release of iOS detailed that Apple would let developers respond to customer reviews in the App Store marking a significant change from the previous limitation which prevented developers from communicating with users The functionality was officially enabled on March when iOS was released to users br Apple also offered an iTunes Affiliate Program which lets people refer others to apps and other iTunes content along with in app purchases for a percentage of sales The commission rate for in app purchases was reduced from to in May and discontinued completely in br In September App Store received a major design overhaul with the release of iOS The new design features a greater focus on editorial content and daily highlights and introduces a cleaner and more consistent and colorful look similar to several of Apple s built in iOS apps br Prior to September Apple offered a way for users to manage their iOS app purchases through the iTunes computer software In September version of iTunes was released removing the App Store section in the process However the following month iTunes was also released retaining the App Store with to Mac noting that the secondary release was positioned by Apple as necessary for some businesses performing internal app deployments br In December Apple announced that developers could offer applications for pre order letting them make apps visible in the store between days ahead of release br On January Apple announced that the App Store had a record breaking holiday season according to a new press release During the week starting on Christmas Eve a record number of customers made App Store purchases spending more than million in that seven day period On New Year s Day alone customers made million in purchases br In September Apple launched Apple Arcade a subscription service for video games within the App Store br In March Apple made Sign in with Apple mandatory for any apps that use third party logins such as signing in with a Google account etc As part of the new App Store guidelines the deadline for developers to implement the feature was April br In and Apple was frequently criticized by other companies such as Spotify Airbnb and Hey and regulators for potentially running the App Store as a monopoly and overcharging developers and was the target of lawsuits and investigations in the EU and United States A conflict between Epic Games the creator of the Fortnite game and Apple led to the lawsuit Epic Games v Apple In December Apple announced that they would introduce a Small Business Program which lowers Apple s revenue cut for app developers making less than USD million per year from to Additionally governments such as in China India and Russia have increasingly required Apple to remove specific apps with the threatened removal of some apps often becoming part of geopolitical feuds br In January Apple added support for unlisted apps to the App Store These apps can only be downloaded via direct links and do not appear as search results br Later in December a report by Bloomberg noted that the company had begun making preparations for opening up sideloading and alternative app stores on iOS as compliance with the EU s Digital Markets Act that had passed in September of that year The same report also noted Apple planned to open up the NFC and camera systems on iOS and the Find My network to AirTag competitors like Tile br Following a European Commission antitrust investigation on January Apple allowed game streaming apps and services such as Xbox Cloud Streaming and GeForce Now on the App Store Apple also allowed iPhone users in the European Union to use third party app stores and browser engines br br br Development and monetization br br br iOS SDK br br The iOS SDK Software development kit allows for the development of mobile apps on iOS It is a free download for users of Mac personal computers It is not available for Microsoft Windows PCs The SDK contains sets giving developers access to various functions and services of iOS devices such as hardware and software attributes It also contains an iPhone simulator to mimic the look and feel of the device on the computer while developing New versions of the SDK accompany new versions of iOS In order to test applications get technical support and distribute apps through App Store developers are required to subscribe to the Apple Developer Program br Combined with Xcode the iOS SDK helps developers write iOS apps using officially supported programming languages including Swift and Objective C Other companies have also created tools that allow for the development of native iOS apps using their respective programming languages br br br Monetization br To publish apps on App Store developers must pay a yearly fee for access to Apple s Developer Program Apple announced that in the United States starting in it would waive the fee for nonprofit organizations and governments Fee waivers have since been extended to non profits educational organizations and governments in additional countries br Developers have a few options for monetizing their applications The Free Model enables free apps increasing likelihood of engagement The Freemium Model makes the app download free but users are offered optional additional features in app that require payments The Subscription Model enables ongoing monetization through renewable transactions The Paid Model makes the app itself a paid download and offers no additional features Less frequently the Paymium Model has both a paid app downloads and paid in app content br In app subscriptions were originally introduced for magazines newspapers and music apps in February giving developers of revenue earned and Apple Publishers could also sell digital subscriptions through their website bypassing Apple s fees but were not allowed to advertise their website alternative through the apps themselves br In an interview with The Verge in June Phil Schiller Apple s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing said that Apple had a renewed focus and energy on the App Store and announced multiple significant changes including advertisements in search results and a new app subscription model The subscription model saw the firmly established revenue split between developers and Apple change into a new revenue split if a user stays subscribed to the developer s app for a year and opens the possibility of subscriptions to all apps not just select categories br App data and insights analyst company App Annie released a report in October announcing that China had overtaken the United States as Apple s biggest market in App Store revenue In the third quarter of Chinese users spent billion vs approximately billion by American users br In June Apple announced that App Store had generated over billion in revenue for developers since its launch By this had increased to billion br br br tvOS apps br br The App Store is also available on tvOS the operating system for the Apple TV It was announced on September at the Apple September event alongside the th generation Apple TV br tvOS ships with development tools for developers tvOS adds support for an SDK for developers to build apps for the TV including all of the APIs included in iOS such as Metal It also adds an which allows users to browse download and install a wide variety of applications In addition developers can now use their own interface inside of their application rather than only being able to use Apple s interface Since tvOS is based on iOS it is easy to port existing iOS apps to the Apple TV with Xcode while making only a few refinements to the app to better suit the larger screen Apple provides Xcode free of charge to all registered Apple developers To develop for the new Apple TV it is necessary to make a parallax image for the application icon In order to do this Apple provides a Parallax exporter and previewer in the development tools for the Apple TV br br br Number of iOS applications br On July Apple s then CEO Steve Jobs told USA Today that App Store contained third party applications for the iPhone and the iPod Touch and of these were free Ten million downloads were recorded in the first weekend By September the number of available apps had increased to with over million downloads br br Over the years the store has surpassed multiple major milestones including million and million apps The billionth application was downloaded on April br The number of apps on the app store shrank for the first time in as Apple began to remove older apps which did not comply with current app guidelines and technologies As of it was estimated to house around million apps br br br Number of iPad applications br The iPad was released in April with approximately apps available By July months after the release there were over apps available designed specifically for the device br br br Most downloaded apps br br br Yearly br Apple publishes a list on a yearly basis giving credit to the apps with the highest number of downloads in the past year br br br Of all time br These are the most downloaded iOS applications and the highest revenue generating iOS applications of all time from to br br br Application ratings br Apple rates applications worldwide based on their content and determines the age group for which each is appropriate According to the iPhone OS launch event the iPhone will allow blocking of objectionable apps in the iPhone s settings The following are the ratings that Apple has detailed br br br App approval process br br Applications are subject to approval by Apple as outlined in the SDK agreement for basic reliability testing and other analysis Applications may still be distributed ad hoc if they are rejected by the author manually submitting a request to Apple to license the application to individual iPhones although Apple may withdraw the ability for authors to do this at a later date br As of Apple employed mostly static analysis for their app review process which means that dynamic code reassembly techniques could defeat the review process br In June Apple updated its App Store review guidelines to specify that app developers will no longer have the ability to use custom prompts for encouraging users to leave reviews for their apps With the release of iOS in late Apple also let developers choose whether to keep current app reviews when updating their apps or to reset Additionally another update to App Store policies allows users to optionally tip content creators by voluntarily sending them money br br br Privacy br br A privacy experiment conducted in by the Washington Post determined that third party apps transmitted a host of personal data without the user s knowledge or consent including phone number email exact location device model and IP address to a dozen marketing companies research firms and other personal data guzzlers via hidden app trackers Some of the information shared with third parties was found to be in violation of the apps own privacy regulations Apple responded to the controversy by introducing privacy nutrition labels on the App Store forcing all apps to disclose their data use br br br Controversial apps and removals br br In November Boyfriend Maker which is a dating sim game was removed due to reports of references to violent sexual acts and paedophilia deemed inappropriate to Boyfriend Maker s age rating of A revised version called Boyfriend Plus was approved by Apple in April br In March HiddenApps was approved and appeared in App Store The app provided access to developer diagnostic menus allowed for stock apps to be hidden and enabled an opt out feature for iAds Apple s developer driven advertisement system The app was removed shortly afterwards for violating guidelines br In April Apple removed AppGratis a then successful app store market that promoted paid apps by offering one for free each day Apple told All Things Digital that the app violated two of its developer agreement clauses including Apps that display Apps other than your own for purchase or promotion in a manner similar to or confusing with the App Store will be rejected and Apps cannot use Push Notifications to send advertising promotions or direct marketing of any kind Apple did however tell the developers they were welcome to resubmit after changing the app though there was not much hope that it could survive in anything like its current incarnation br In November Apple removed the marijuana social networking app MassRoots with the reason given that it encourage d excessive consumption of alcohol or illegal substances In February MassRoots was reintroduced into the store after Apple changed its enforcement guidelines to allow cannabis social apps in the states where it is legal br In September it was discovered that hundreds of apps submitted and approved on App Store were using XcodeGhost a malicious version of the Xcode development software The issues prompted Apple to remove infected apps from the store and issue a statement that it was working with the developers to make sure they re using the proper version of Xcode A security firm later published lists of infected apps including a China only version of Angry Birds CamCard Lifesmart TinyDeal com and WeChat In the aftermath Apple stated that it would make Xcode faster to download in certain regions outside the United States and contacted all developers to ensure they only download the code from the Mac App Store or Apple s website and provided a code signature for developers to test if they are running a tampered version of Xcode br In June a scamming trend was discovered on the store in which developers make apps built on non existent services attach in app purchase subscriptions to the opening dialogue then buy App Store search advertising space to get the app into the higher rankings In one instance an app by the name of Mobile protection Clean Security VPN sic would require payments of for a seven day subscription after a short trial Apple has not yet responded to the issues br In addition Apple has removed software licensed under the GNU General Public License GPL from App Store due to text in Apple s Terms of Service agreement imposing digital rights management and proprietary legal terms incompatible with the terms of the GPL br br br Large scale app removals br On September Apple announced that starting September it would be removing old apps that do not function as intended or that do not follow current review guidelines Developers will be warned and given days to update their apps but apps that crash on startup will be removed immediately Additionally the app names registered by developers cannot exceed characters in an attempt to stop developers from inserting long descriptions or irrelevant terms in app names to improve the app s ranking in App Store search results App intelligence firm Sensor Tower revealed in November that Apple as promised from its September announcement of removing old apps had removed apps from App Store in October a percent increase of its prior number of average monthly app removals br In June TechCrunch reported that Apple had turned its app removal focus on apps copying functionality from other popular apps An example cited included if a popular game like Flappy Bird or Red Ball hits the charts there will be hundreds or thousands of clones within weeks that attempt to capitalize on the initial wave of popularity The report also noted removals of music apps serving pirated tracks The publication wrote that since the initial September app removals began Apple had removed multiple hundreds of thousands of apps br In December a new report from TechCrunch stated that Apple had begun enforcing new restrictions on the use of commercialized template or app generation services Originally introduced as part of Apple s developer conference new App Store guidelines allow the company to ban apps making use of templates or commercial app services This affected many small businesses with TechCrunch s report citing that local retailers restaurants small fitness studios nonprofits churches and other organizations benefit from using templates or app services due to minimal costs Developers had received notice from Apple with a January deadline to change their respective apps The news caught the attention of Congress with Congressman Ted Lieu writing a letter to Apple at the beginning of December asking it to reconsider writing that It is my understanding that many small businesses research organizations and religious institutions rely on template apps when they do not possess the resources to develop apps in house and that the new rules cast too wide a net specifically invalidating apps from longstanding and legitimate developers who pose no threat to the App Store s integrity Additionally the news of stricter enforcement caused significant criticism from app development firms one company told TechCrunch that it chose to close down its business following the news saying that The rule enforcement was just a final drop that made us move on a bit faster with that decision to close and another company told the publication that There was no way in June when the guidelines changed that we would have said that s going to target our apps Apple had told us you aren t being targeted by this from a quality standpoint So being hit now under the umbrella of spam is shocking to every quality developer out there and all the good actors Furthermore the latter company stated that there s only so much you can do with apps that perform the same utility ordering food A third company said that Rule is a concrete illustration of the danger of Apple s dominant position and a fourth said that They ve wiped out pretty much an entire industry Not just DIY tools like AppMakr but also development suites like Titanium Towards the end of the year Apple updated the guideline to clarify that companies and organizations are allowed to use template apps but only as long as they directly publish their app on their own it remained a violation of the rule for commercial app services to publish apps for the respective clients br br br Censorship by governments br br br China br In January Apple complied with a request from the Chinese government to remove the Chinese version of The New York Times app This followed the government s efforts in to block the Times website after stories of hidden wealth among family members of then leader of China Wen Jiabao were published In a statement an Apple spokesperson told the media that we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations though would not specify which regulations and added that As a result the app must be taken down off the China app store When this situation changes the app store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China The following July it was reported that Apple had begun to remove listings in China for apps that circumvent government Internet censorship policies and new laws restricting virtual private network VPN services Apple issued a statement explaining that the app removals were a result of developers not complying with new laws in China requiring a government license for businesses offering VPNs and that These apps remain available in all other markets where they do business In an earnings call the following month Cook elaborated on the recent news explainining that We would obviously rather not remove the apps but like we do in other countries we follow the law wherever we do business Besides VPN services a number of Internet calling apps including Microsoft s Skype were also removed from the Chinese App Store in with Apple telling The New York Times that similar to the VPN apps these new apps also violated local law Microsoft explained to BBC News that its Skype app had been temporarily removed and that it was working to reinstate the app as soon as possible though many news outlets reported on the Chinese government s increased efforts and pressure to crack down on Internet freedom br Following Apple CEO Tim Cook s appearance at China s World Internet Conference in December in which Cook stated that Apple and China share a vision of developing a digital economy for openness and shared benefits free speech and human rights activists criticized Cook and the company Maya Wang at Human Rights Watch told The Washington Post that Cook s appearance lends credibility to a state that aggressively censors the internet throws people in jail for being critical about social ills and is building artificial intelligence systems that monitors everyone and targets dissent The version of cyberspace the Chinese government is building is a decidedly dystopian one and I don t think anyone would want to share in this common future Apple should have spoken out against it not endorsed it U S Senator Patrick Leahy told CNBC that American tech companies have become leading champions of free expression But that commitment should not end at our borders Global leaders in innovation like Apple have both an opportunity and a moral obligation to promote free expression and other basic human rights in countries that routinely deny these rights br Cook told Reuters that My hope over time is that some of the things the couple of things that s been pulled come back I have great hope on that and great optimism on that However TechCrunch s Jon Russell criticized this line of thinking writing that Firstly Apple didn t just remove a couple of things from the reach of China based users but rather a couple of hundred apps acknowledging that even that is under counting Furthermore Russell listed censorship efforts by the Chinese government including VPN bans and restrictions on live video and messaging apps and wrote that Apple had little choice but to follow Beijing s line in order to continue to do business in the lucrative Chinese market but statements like Cook s today are dangerous because they massively underplay the severity of the situation Florida Senator Marco Rubio also criticized Cook s appearance at the World Internet Conference describing the situation as here s an example of a company in my view so desperate to have access to the Chinese market place that they are willing to follow the laws of that country even if those laws run counter to what those companies own standards are supposed to be In August as a result of Chinese regulations illegal apps were pulled down by Apple from the App Store in China br In October Apple rejected approved and finally removed an app used by participants in the Hong Kong protests br Apple began removing thousands of video game apps from their platform in China during December in accordance to regulations regarding licensing enacted by the country s Cyberspace Administration in many cases without explicitly stating the offences grounding their removal Apple released a memo that month telling developers of premium games and apps with in app purchases had until the st of December to submit proof of a government license Research from the Campaign for Accountability notes there are more than apps not appearing in China which are available in other countries a third of which the advocacy group claims to have been removed due to advocating for various human rights issues including LGBTQ rights and the Hong Kong protests A director of the aforementioned campaign Katie Paul criticised Apple s removals stating if it s going to bend to political pressure the company should explain why and what they would lose if they didn t do that CEO Tim Cook has previously defended such company actions stating in a memo to employees in that national and international debates will outlive us all and while important they do not govern the facts br In August at the request of the Chinese government Apple took down more than AI related apps similar to Chat GPT in the Chinese app store br According to the regulations of Chinese government new apps on the China app store from September must be licensed by the Chinese government Older apps must obtain a license before March br br br Russia br Apple removed the Smart Voting app from the App Store before the Russian legislative election The application which had been created by associates of imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny offered voting advice for all voting districts in Russia It was removed after a meeting with Russian Federation Council officials on September Apple also reportedly disabled its iCloud Private Relay privacy feature which masks users browsing activity Russian opposition figures condemned these moves as political censorship br br br Removal of vaping apps br In November Apple removed all applications related to vaping from the App Store citing warning from health experts Apple made this decision to reduce the promotion of e cigarette use br br br Antitrust allegations br br Apple has faced criticism lawsuits and government investigations alleging that its control over the distribution of iOS and iPadOS apps through the App Store constituted monopolistic practices br br br Epic Games br br Since as early as Tim Sweeney had questioned the need for digital storefronts like Valve s Steam Apple s iOS App Store and Google Play to take a revenue sharing cut and argued that when accounting for current rates of content distribution and other factors needed a revenue cut of should be sufficient to run any digital storefront profitably br On August Epic Games updated Fortnite across all platforms including the iOS version to reduce the price of V Bucks the in game currency by if they purchased directly from Epic For iOS users if they purchased through the Apple storefront they were not given this discount as Epic said they could not extend the discount due to the revenue cut taken by Apple Within hours Apple had removed Fortnite from their storefronts stating the means of bypassing their payment systems violated the terms of service Epic immediately filed separate lawsuits against Apple and Google for antitrust and anticompetitive behavior in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California Epic did not seek monetary damages in either case but instead was seeking injunctive relief to allow fair competition in these two key markets that directly affect hundreds of millions of consumers and tens of thousands if not more of third party app developers In comments on social media the next day Sweeney said that they undertook the actions as we re fighting for the freedom of people who bought smartphones to install apps from sources of their choosing the freedom for creators of apps to distribute them as they choose and the freedom of both groups to do business directly The primary opposing argument is Smartphone makers can do whatever they want This as an awful notion We all have rights and we need to fight to defend our rights against whoever would deny them br Apple responded to the lawsuit that it would terminate Epic s developer accounts by August leading Epic to file a motion for a preliminary injunction to force Apple to return Fortnite to the App Store and prevent them from terminating Epic s developer accounts as the latter action would leave Epic unable to update the Unreal Engine for any changes to iOS or macOS and leave developers that relied on Unreal at risk The court granted the preliminary injunction against Apple from terminating the developer accounts as Epic had shown potential significant damage to both the Unreal Engine platform itself and to the gaming industry generally but refused to grant the injunction related to Fortnite as The current predicament appears of Epic s own making br br br See
