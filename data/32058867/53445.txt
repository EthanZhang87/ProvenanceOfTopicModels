Palo Alto PAL oh AL toh Spanish for tall stick is a charter city in the northwestern corner of Santa Clara County California United States in the San Francisco Bay Area named after a coastal redwood tree known as El Palo Alto br The city of Palo Alto was established in by the American industrialist Leland Stanford when he founded Stanford University in memory of his son Leland Stanford Jr Palo Alto later expanded and now borders East Palo Alto Mountain View Los Altos Los Altos Hills Stanford Portola Valley and Menlo Park As of the census the population was Palo Alto has one of the highest costs of living in the United States and its residents are among the most educated in the country However it has a youth suicide rate four times higher than the national average often attributed to academic pressure br As one of the principal cities of Silicon Valley Palo Alto is home to the headquarters of multiple tech companies including HP Space Systems Loral VMware and PARC Palo Alto has also served as headquarters or the founding location of several other tech companies including Apple Google Facebook Logitech Tesla Intuit IDEO Pinterest and PayPal Ford Motor Company and Lockheed Martin each additionally maintain major research and technology facilities within Palo Alto br br br History br br Before the arrival of Europeans the Ohlone lived on the San Francisco peninsula in particular the Puichon Ohlone lived in the Palo Alto area The area of modern Palo Alto was first recorded by the party of Gaspar de Portol a man horse expedition setting out from San Diego to find Monterey Bay The group trekked past the bay without recognizing it and continued north When they reached modern day Pacifica they ascended Sweeney Ridge and saw the San Francisco Bay on November Portol descended from Sweeney Ridge southeast down San Andreas Creek to Laguna Creek now Crystal Springs Reservoir thence to the San Francisquito Creek watershed ultimately camping from November by a tall redwood later to be known as El Palo Alto br In Father Junipero Serra established the Mission Santa Clara de Asis whose northern boundary was San Francisquito Creek and whose lands included modern Palo Alto The area was under the control of the viceroy of Mexico and ultimately under the control of Spain On November Pueblo de San Jose de Guadalupe now the city of San Jose a few miles to the south of what was to be Palo Alto was established by order of the viceroy despite the displeasure of the local mission The Mexican War of Independence ending in led to Mexico becoming an independent country though San Jose did not recognize rule by the new Mexico until May Mexico proceeded to sell off or grant much of the mission land br During the Mexican American War the United States seized Alta California in however this was not legalized until the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed on July Mexican citizens in the area could choose to become United States citizens and their land grants were to be recognized if they chose to do so though many legal disputes arose over this br The land grant Rancho Rinconada del Arroyo de San Francisquito of about acres km on the lower reaches of San Francisquito Creek i e parts of modern Menlo Park and northern Palo Alto was given to Maria Antonia Mesa in She and her husband Rafael Soto who had died in had settled in near present day Newell and Middlefield roads and sold supplies In their daughter Mar a Luisa Soto married John Coppinger who was to be in the grantee of Rancho Ca ada de Raymundo in modern San Mateo county Upon Coppinger s death in Maria inherited it and later married a visiting boat captain John Greer Greer owned a home on the site that is now Town Country Village on Embarcadero and El Camino Real Greer Avenue and Court are named for him br br To the south of the Sotos the brothers Secundino and Teodoro Robles in bought Rancho Rincon de San Francisquito from Jos Pe a the grantee The grant covered the area south of Rancho Rinconada del Arroyo de San Francisquito to more or less present day Mountain View The grant was bounded on the south by Mariano Castro s Rancho Pastoria de las Borregas grant across San Antonio Road This later became the Robles Rancho which constitutes about of Palo Alto and Stanford University today In it was whittled down in the courts to acres km Stories say the grand hacienda was built on the former meager adobe of Jos Pe a near Ferne off San Antonio Road midway between Middlefield and Alma Street Their hacienda hosted fiestas and bull fights It was ruined in the earthquake and its lumber was used to build a large barn nearby which was said to have lingered until the early s On April acres km comprising the present day Barron Park Matadero Creek and Stanford Business Park was sold for to Elisha Oscar Crosby who called his new property Mayfield Farm The name of Mayfield was later attached to the community that started nearby On September the Crosby land was transferred to Sarah Wallis to satisfy a debt he owed her In Secundino Robles father to twenty nine children still lived just south of Palo Alto near the location of the present day San Antonio Shopping Center in Mountain View br br Many of the Spanish names in the Palo Alto area represent the local heritage descriptive terms and former residents Pena Court Miranda Avenue which was essentially Foothill Expressway was the married name of Juana Briones and the name occurs in Courts and Avenues and other street names in Palo Alto and Mountain View in the quadrant where she owned vast areas between Stanford University Grant Road in Mountain View and west of El Camino Real Yerba Buena was to her credit Rinconada was the major Mexican land grant name br The township of Mayfield was formed in around the site of a stagecoach stop and saloon known as Uncle Jim s Cabin near the intersection of El Camino Real and today s California Avenue in what is now southern Palo Alto In October the San Francisco to San Jose railroad had been built as far as Mayfield and service started between San Francisco and Mayfield the station is now California Avenue train service all the way to San Jose started in January El Camino became Main Street the northeast southwest cross streets were named for Civil War heroes with California Avenue originally being Lincoln Street The town had its own newspaper by the Mayfield Enterprise in English and Spanish incorporated in and had breweries and a cannery br In French financier Jean Baptiste Paulin Caperon better known as Peter Coutts purchased land in Mayfield and four other parcels around three sides of today s College Terrace more than a thousand acres km extending from today s Page Mill Road to Serra Street and from El Camino Real to the foothills Coutts named his property Ayrshire Farm His fanciful foot tall m brick tower near Matadero Creek likely marked the south corner of his property Leland Stanford started buying land in the area in for a horse farm called the Palo Alto Stock Farm Stanford bought Ayrshire Farm in br br br Creation of the town br br In Leland Stanford and his wife Jane lost their only child Leland Stanford Jr when he died of typhoid fever at age and decided to create a university in his memory In they proposed having the university s gateway be Mayfield However they had one condition alcohol had to be banned from the town Known for its rowdy saloons Mayfield rejected his request This led them to drive the formation of a new temperance town with the help of their friend Timothy Hopkins of the Southern Pacific Railroad who in bought acres km of private land for the new townsite This Hopkins Tract bounded by El Camino Real San Francisquito Creek Boyce Channing Melville and Hopkins Avenues and Embarcadero Road was proclaimed a local Heritage District during Palo Alto s centennial in The Stanfords set up their university Stanford University and a train stop on University Avenue by the new town This new community was initially called University Park the name Palo Alto at that time was attached to what is now College Terrace but was incorporated in with the name Palo Alto With the Stanfords support Palo Alto grew to the size of Mayfield Mayfield eventually passed an ordinance banning saloons that took effect in January br br br Later history br On July Palo Alto voters approved the annexation of Mayfield and the two communities were officially consolidated on July As a result Palo Alto has two downtown areas one along University Avenue and one along California Avenue renamed after the annexation since Palo Alto already had a Lincoln Avenue br The Mayfield News wrote its own obituary four days later br br It is with a feeling of deep regret that we see on our streets today those who would sell or give our beautiful little city to an outside community We have watched Mayfield grow from a small hamlet when Palo Alto was nothing more than a hayfield to her present size and it is with a feeling of sorrow that we contemplate the fact that there are those who would sell or give the city away br br Palo Alto continued to annex more land including the Stanford Shopping Center area in Stanford Research Park Embarcadero Road northeast of Bayshore and the West Bayshore San Antonio Road area were also annexed during the s Large amounts of land west of Foothill Expressway were annexed between and this is mostly undeveloped and includes Foothills Park and Arastradero Preserve The last major annexations were of Barron Park in and in a large area of marshlands bordering the bay br Many of Stanford University s first faculty members settled in the Professorville neighborhood of Palo Alto Professorville now a registered national historic district is bounded by Kingsley Lincoln and Addison Avenues and the cross streets of Ramona Bryant and Waverley The district includes a large number of well preserved residences dating from the s including Kingsley Lincoln and Kingsley Bryant was the home of Russell Varian co inventor of the Klystron tube The Federal Telegraph laboratory site situated at Channing is a California Historical Landmark recognizing Lee de Forest s invention of the vacuum tube and electronic oscillator at that location While not open to the public the garage that housed the launch of Hewlett Packard is located at Addison Avenue Hewlett Packard recently restored the house and garage A second historic district on Ramona Street can be found downtown between University and Hamilton Avenues The Palo Alto Chinese School is the oldest in the entire Bay Area It is also home to the second oldest opera company in California the West Bay Opera br One early major business was when Thomas Foon Chew owner of the Bayside Canning Company in Alviso founded by his father expanded his business by starting a cannery in in what was then Mayfield that initially employed workers but later expanded In the s the Bayside Canning Company became one of the largest in the world In the Palo Alto cannery now part of the Sutter Packing Company under the ownership of Safeway closed at the time it was the largest employer in Palo Alto with about a workers Various businesses used the building since including Fry s Electronics br Palo Alto is also home to a long standing baseball tradition The Palo Alto Oaks are a collegiate summer baseball club that has been in the Bay Area since eight years longer than the San Francisco Giants The Oaks were originally managed by Tony Makjavich for years The Oaks were going to fold before the summer season but were taken on by Daniel Palladino and Whaylan Price Bay Area baseball coaches who did not want to see the team die The Oaks have a rich history within the Palo Alto community br br br Geography br br Palo Alto lies in the southeastern section of the San Francisco Peninsula br It consists of two large parcels of land connected by a narrow corridor The southern inland section located south of Interstate is hilly rural and lightly populated and is the site of Pearson Arastradero Preserve and Foothills Park both part of the Palo Alto park system and also large parts of the Los Trancos and Monte Bello Open Space Preserves part of the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District The city extends as far as Skyline Boulevard along the ridge of the Santa Cruz Mountains br The northern more densely populated parcel is bordered by San Francisquito Creek with Menlo Park and East Palo Alto in adjacent San Mateo County beyond to the north San Francisco Bay to the north east Mountain View Los Altos and Los Altos Hills to the east and south east and Stanford University to the south west and west Several major transit routes cross this parcel from the north west to the south east The biggest and closest to the bay is the Bayshore Freeway and going inland are Alma Street Central Expressway El Camino Real and Foothill Expressway Interstate is parallel and crosses the narrow corridor of land that connects the two parcels that makeup Palo Alto Somewhat perpendicular to these roads are Sand Hill Road from El Camino until it crosses San Francisquito Creek into Menlo Park Embarcadero Road Oregon Expressway Page Mill Road Arastradero Road East Charleston Road and San Antonio Road the last forms part of the boundary with Mountain View br According to the United States Census Bureau the city has a total area of square miles km of which square miles km is land and square miles km comprising is water br The official elevation is feet m above sea level but the city boundaries reach well into the northern section of the Santa Cruz Mountains br br br Water br Palo Alto is crossed by several creeks that flow north in the direction of the San Francisco Bay Adobe Creek near its eastern boundary San Francisquito Creek on its western boundary and Matadero Creek in between the other two Arastradero Creek is a tributary to Matadero Creek and Barron Creek is now diverted to Adobe Creek just south of Highway by a diversion channel The San Francisquito Creek mainstem is formed by the confluence of Corte Madera Creek and Bear Creek

zone providing feeding areas for a variety of shorebirds and other estuarine wildlife br br br Climate br Typical of the South Peninsula region of the San Francisco Bay Area Palo Alto has a Mediterranean climate with mild moderately wet winters and warm dry summers Typically in the warmer months as the sun goes down the fog bank flows over the foothills to the west and covers the night sky thus creating a blanket that helps trap the summer warmth absorbed during the day Even so it is rare for the overnight low temperature to exceed F C br In January average daily temperatures range from a low of F C to a high of F C In July average temperatures range from to F to C The record high temperature was F C on September and the record low temperature was F C on January and December Temperatures reach F C or higher on an average of days Temperatures drop to F C or lower on an average of days br Due to the Santa Cruz Mountains to the west there is a rain shadow in Palo Alto resulting in an average annual rainfall of only inches mm Measurable rainfall occurs on an average of days annually The wettest year on record was with inches mm and the driest year was with inches mm The most rainfall in one month was inches mm in February and the most rainfall in one day was inches mm on February Measurable snowfall is very rare in the populated areas of Palo Alto but inches cm

for very low income housing br br br History of housing br In the s racial covenants were used that banned persons of African Japanese Chinese or Mongolian descent from purchasing or renting homes in many neighborhoods throughout Palo Alto In the s some movements opposed these policies including the Palo Alto Fair Play Association as well as architect and developer Joseph Eichler who built almost homes in Palo Alto br Blockbusting strategies were also employed to instill fear in white neighborhoods and cause White flight out of areas on the outskirts of the city Blockbusting refers to a practice realtors adopted in which they would advertise the incoming presence of a black family to a neighborhood causing panic among the white residents who would consequently sell their houses at deflated prices very quickly One famous blockbusting event is responsible for the prevailing demographic divides between Palo Alto and East Palo Alto br One of the most destructive policies at the time was redlining Redlining was a policy put in place by the Federal Housing Association starting in Through the program the association could rank neighborhoods from Type A which was desirable to Type D outlined in red which was deemed hazardous Residents in Type D neighborhoods were ineligible for loans to buy or fix houses The program was implemented in a way so that neighborhoods with any kind of African American population were ranked type C or D This was also the case in Palo Alto and the surrounding areas Palo Alto s White neighborhoods were ranked mostly Type A and B allowing for wealth accumulation and eventually resulting in the high housing prices we see today On the other hand the surrounding areas were all marked Type C and D and African Americans found themselves being driven to the outskirts of Palo Alto what is now mostly East Palo Alto where there was no money from loans in the economy leading to a state of decay br However for the most part Palo Alto s housing was built on policies that are still reflected in the current demographics br br br Economy br br Palo Alto serves as a central economic focal point of the Silicon Valley and is home to more than

crossings and even proposed closing the Churchill Ave crossing completely to road traffic but the project has been a hot button issue for local residents and politicians for over a decade The current proposed solution is elevating the tracks above grade while lowering the roadway below grade A subway tunnel underneath the right of way and converting the old track bed into a park was also proposed

city in the Bay Area and third highest in the United States after Davis California and Boulder Colorado Since Palo Alto has received a Bicycle Friendly Community status of Gold from the League of American Bicyclists br The city s flat terrain and many quiet tree shaded residential streets offer comfort and safety to cyclists and the temperate climate makes year round cycling convenient Palo Alto pioneered the bicycle boulevard concept in the early s enhancing residential Bryant Street to prioritize it for cyclists by removing stop signs providing special traffic signals and installing traffic diverters and a bicycle pedestrian bridge over Matadero Creek However busy arterial streets which often offer the fastest and most direct route to many destinations are dangerous for cyclists due to high volumes of fast moving traffic and the lack of bicycle lanes El Camino Real Alma Street and Embarcadero and Middlefield roads all identified as high priorities for adding bicycle lanes to improve safety by the Palo Alto Bicycle Transportation Plan still contain no provisions for cyclists br The Palo Alto Police Department decided to stop using tasers to detain bicyclists after a incident in which a year old boy who had bicycled through a stop sign was injured after police officers pursued him fired a taser at him and suddenly braked their patrol car in front of him causing the boy to crash br br br Walking br Conditions for walking are excellent in Palo Alto except for crossing high volume arterial streets such as El Camino Real and Oregon Expressway Sidewalks are available on nearly every city street with the notable exception of the Barron Park neighborhood which was the last to be incorporated into the city Palo Alto s Street grid is well connected with few

vehicle traffic of residents walk to work br br br Sister cities br Palo Alto has seven sister cities as designated by Sister Cities International br br Heidelberg Germany since br In Palo Alto received a gift of a large whimsical wooden sculpture called Foreign Friends Fj rran V nner of a man woman dog and bird sitting on a park bench from Link ping The sculpture was praised by some called grotesque by others and became a lightning rod for vandals It was covered with a large addressed postcard marked Return to Sender A former Stanford University professor was arrested for attempting to light it on fire It was also doused with paint When the original heads were decapitated on Halloween the statue became a shrine flowers bouquets and cards were placed upon it Following an anonymous donation the heads were restored Within weeks the restored heads were decapitated again this time disappearing The heads were eventually replaced with new ones which generated even more distaste as many deemed the new heads even less attractive br A few months later the man s arm was chopped off the woman s lap was vandalized the bird was stolen and the replacements heads were decapitated and stolen The sculpture was removed from its location on Embarcadero Road and Waverley Avenue in dismantled and placed in storage until it was destroyed in Ironically the statue was designed not as a
