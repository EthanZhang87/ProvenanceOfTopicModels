Electronic Arts Inc EA is an American video game company headquartered in Redwood City California Founded in May by former Apple employee Trip Hawkins the company was a pioneer of the early home computer game industry and promoted the designers and programmers responsible for its games as software artists EA published numerous games and some productivity software for personal computers all of which were developed by external individuals or groups until s Skate or Die The company shifted toward internal game studios often through acquisitions such as Distinctive Software becoming EA Canada in br Into the s EA develops and publishes games of established franchises including Battlefield Need for Speed The Sims Medal of Honor Command Conquer Dead Space Mass Effect Dragon Age Army of Two Apex Legends and Star Wars as well as the EA Sports titles FC FIFA Madden NFL NBA Live NHL PGA and UFC Since their desktop titles appear on self developed EA App an online gaming digital distribution platform for PCs and a direct competitor to Valve s Steam and Epic Games Store EA also owns and operates major gaming studios such as DICE Motive Studio BioWare and Respawn Entertainment br br br History br br br Trip Hawkins era founding and early success br br Trip Hawkins had been an Apple Inc employee since at a time when the firm had only about fifty employees Over the next four years the market for home personal computers skyrocketed By Apple had completed its initial public offering IPO and become a Fortune company with over one thousand employees In February Hawkins arranged a meeting with Don Valentine of Sequoia Capital to discuss financing his new venture Amazin Software Valentine encouraged Hawkins to leave Apple where the latter served as Director of Product Marketing and allowed Hawkins to use Sequoia Capital s spare office space to start the company Trip Hawkins incorporated and established the company with a personal investment of an estimated US on May br For more than seven months Hawkins refined his Electronic Arts business plan With aid from his first employee with whom he worked in marketing at Apple Rich Melmon the original plan was written mostly by Hawkins on an Apple II in Sequoia Capital s office in August During that time Hawkins also employed two of his former staff from Apple Dave Evans and Pat Marriott as producers and a Stanford MBA classmate Jeff Burton from Atari for international business development The business plan was again refined in September and reissued on October By November the employee headcount rose to including Tim Mott Bing Gordon David Maynard and Steve Hayes Having outgrown the office space provided by Sequoia Capital the company relocated to a San Mateo office that overlooked the San Francisco Airport landing path br When he incorporated the company Hawkins originally chose Amazin Software as their company name but his other early employees of the company universally disliked the name as a result the company changed its name to Electronic Arts in November He scheduled an off site meeting in the Pajaro Dunes where the company once held such off site meetings Hawkins had developed the ideas of treating software as an art form and calling the developers software artists Hence the latest version of the business plan suggested the name SoftArt Hawkins and Melmon knew the founders of Software Arts the creators of VisiCalc and thought their permission should be obtained Dan Bricklin did not want the name used because it sounded too similar perhaps confusingly similar to Software Arts however the name concept was liked by all the attendees Hawkins had also recently read a bestselling book about the film studio United Artists and liked the reputation that the company had created Hawkins said everyone had a vote but they would lose it if they went to sleep br br Hawkins liked the word electronic and various employees had considered the phrases Electronic Artists and Electronic Arts When Gordon and others pushed for Electronic Artists in tribute to the film company United Artists Steve Hayes opposed saying We re not the artists they the developers are This statement from Hayes immediately tilted sentiment towards Electronic Arts and the name was unanimously endorsed and adopted later in He recruited his original employees from Apple Atari Xerox PARC and VisiCorp and got Steve Wozniak to agree to sit on the board of directors Hawkins was determined to sell directly to buyers Combined with the fact that Hawkins was pioneering new game brands this made sales growth more challenging Retailers wanted to buy known brands from existing distribution partners Former CEO Larry Probst arrived as VP of Sales in late and helped expand the already successful company This policy of dealing directly with retailers gave EA higher margins and better market awareness key advantages the company leveraged to leapfrog its early competitors br Promoting its developers was a trademark of EA s early days Games were sold in square packages modeled after album covers such as those for s M U L E and Pinball Construction Set Hawkins thought the packaging would both save costs and convey an artistic feeling EA routinely referred to their developers as artists and gave them photo credits in their games and full page magazine ads Their first such ad accompanied by the slogan We see farther was the first video game advertisement to feature software designers EA shared lavish profits with their developers which added to their industry appeal br br In the mid s Electronic Arts aggressively marketed products for the Amiga a home computer introduced in Commodore had given EA development tools and prototype machines before Amiga s actual launch For Amiga EA published some notable non game titles A drawing program Deluxe Paint and its subsequent versions became perhaps the most famous piece of software available for Amiga platform In addition EA s Jerry Morrison conceived the idea of a file format that could store images animations sounds and documents simultaneously and would be compatible with third party software He wrote and released to the public the Interchange File Format which soon became an Amiga standard Other Amiga programs released by EA included Deluxe Music Construction Set Instant Music and Deluxe Paint Animation Some of them most notably Deluxe Paint were ported to other platforms For Macintosh EA released a black white animation tool called Studio and a series of Paint titles called Studio and Studio br Relationships between Electronic Arts and their external developers often became difficult when the latter missed deadlines or diverged from the former s creative directions In EA released Skate or Die their first internally developed game EA continued publishing their external developers games while experimenting with their internal development strategy This led to EA s decision of purchasing out a series of companies they identify as successful as well as the decision to release annualized franchises to cut budget costs Because of Trip Hawkins obsession of simulating a sports game he signed a contract with football coach John Madden that led to EA s developing and releasing annual Madden NFL games br In EA published a flight simulator game exclusively for Amiga F A Interceptor with filled polygon graphics that were advanced for the time Another significant Amiga release also initially available for Atari ST later converted for other platforms was Populous developed by Bullfrog Productions It was a pioneering title in the genre that was later called god games In Electronic Arts began producing console games for the Nintendo Entertainment System after previously licensing its computer games to other console game publishers br br br Larry Probst era continuous expansion and success into the new millennium br In Trip Hawkins stepped down as EA s CEO and was succeeded by Larry Probst Hawkins went on to found the now defunct DO Company but still remained EA s chair until July In October DO developed the DO Interactive Multiplayer which at the time was the most powerful game console Once a critic of game consoles Hawkins had conceived a console that unlike its competitors would not require a first party license to be marketed and was intended to appeal to the PC market Electronic Arts was The DO Company s primary partner in sponsoring their console showcasing on it their latest games With a retail price of US equivalent to in compared to its competitors the console lagged in sales and with the arrival to North America of Sony s PlayStation a cheaper and more powerful alternative combined with a lower quality of the DO s software library as a backfiring of its liberal license policy it fell further behind and lost competition Electronic Arts dropped its support for DO in favor of the PlayStation DO s production ceased in and for the remainder of the company s lifetime DO developed video games for other consoles and the IBM PC until it folded in br br In Electronic Arts and THQ signed a licensing agreement to develop and release EA s titles like John Madden Football FIFA International Soccer Shaq Fu Jungle Strike and Urban Strike for various consoles In Electronic Arts won the European Computer Trade Show award for best software publisher of the year As

Electronic Arts as the only company to regularly profit from video games over the past five years and noted it had a critical track record second to none In EA replaced their long running Shapes logo

Sports brand was retained for major sports titles the new EA Sports Big label would be used for casual sports titles with an arcade twist and the full Electronic Arts name would be used for co

the Collegiate Licensing Company CLC for exclusive rights to college football content br Much of EA s success both in terms of sales and with regards to its stock market valuation is due to its strategy of platform agnostic development and the creation of strong multi year franchises EA was the first publisher to release yearly updates of its sports franchises Madden FIFA NHL NBA Live Tiger Woods etc with updated player rosters and small graphical and gameplay tweaks Recognizing the risk of franchise fatigue among consumers EA announced in that it would concentrate more of its effort on

own product development and publishing the city state model The goal of the reorganization was to empower the labels to operate more autonomously streamline decision making increase creativity and quality and get games into the market faster This reorganization came after years of consolidation and acquisition by EA of smaller studios which some in the industry blamed for a decrease in quality of EA titles In at the DICE Summit Riccitiello called the earlier approach of buy and assimilate a mistake often stripping smaller studios of its creative talent Riccitiello said that the city state model allows independent developers to remain autonomous to a large extent and cited Maxis and BioWare as examples of studios thriving under the new structure br During EA announced that it would be

had a poorer than expected holiday season moving it in February to cut approximately jobs which it said represented about of its workforce It also closed of their facilities Riccitiello in a

Glass Studios MGM Interactive for the rights to the James Bond property DreamWorks Interactive and eventually DICE in the latter two cases these studios were acquired by EA as part of the EA DICE family In EA s president John Riccitiello pushed for a renaming of the EA Distribution label seeing the potential to bring in more independent developers and additional revenue streams While they rebranded the label as EA Partners in Riccitiello left EA the following year which disrupted the direction the label had been aiming to go br Oddworld Inhabitants who had signed on with EA Partner for their next Oddworld games found the situation difficult as EA Partners was reluctant to support games where they did not own the intellectual property rights and instead favored internal development The situation with EA Partners switched gears in after EA and Valve signed an EA Partners deal for the physical distribution of The Orange Box EA Partners realized it needed to be flexible to handle the different publishing opportunities presented to them A similar breakthrough was reached with signing on Harmonix for the distribution of the Rock Band games requiring them to work closely with MTV Games on the plastic instrument controllers necessary for the titles A number of major partnerships were made over the next few years including Namco Bandai Crytek Starbreeze Studios id Software Epic Games and People Can Fly Double Fine Productions Grasshopper Manufacture Spicy Horse and Realtime Worlds While many of these partnerships proved successful the division had two major marks on its name It was associated with the situation around Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning developed by Studios which had been significantly backed by loans from taxpayer funds from the state of Rhode Island Kingdoms failed to be commercially successful and EA Partners pulled out of making a sequel leaving Studios in default of its loan payback to the state Secondly while The Secret World from Funcom launched as a subscription game Funcom had to switch their monetization model to free to play to improve their revenues which further affected EA Partners br Around April as part of a large employee layoff many reporters claimed that EA Partners was also being shut down for its poor commercial performance but the program remained active as the company refocused its efforts The label remained dormant over the next several years while Letts expanded on the EA Originals program but following the move of EA Partners and EA Origins into the Strategic Growth group in August the label was revived on the March
