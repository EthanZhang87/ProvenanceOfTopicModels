project Soon thereafter Nosek s friend Max Levchin described to Thiel his cryptography related company idea which became their first venture called Fieldlink later renamed Confinity in br br br PayPal br br With Confinity Thiel realized they could develop software to bridge a gap in making online payments Although the use of credit cards and expanding automated teller machine networks provided consumers with more payment options not all merchants had the necessary hardware to accept credit cards Thus consumers had to pay with exact cash or check Thiel wanted to create a type of digital wallet for consumer convenience and security by encrypting data on digital devices and in Confinity launched PayPal br PayPal promised to open up new possibilities for handling money Thiel viewed PayPal s mission as liberating people from the erosion of the value of their currencies due to inflation Thiel spoke in br br We re definitely onto something big The need PayPal answers is monumental Everyone in the world needs money to get paid to trade to live Paper money is an ancient technology and an inconvenient means of payment You can run out of it It wears out It can get lost or stolen In the twenty first century people need a form of money that s more convenient and secure something that can be accessed from anywhere with a PDA or an Internet connection Of course what we re calling convenient for American users will be revolutionary for the developing world Many of these countries governments play fast and loose with their currencies They use inflation and sometimes wholesale currency devaluations like we saw in Russia and several Southeast Asian countries last year referring to the Russian and Asian financial crisis to take wealth away from their citizens Most of the ordinary people there never have an opportunity to open an offshore account or to get their hands on more than a few bills of a stable currency like U S dollars Eventually PayPal will be able to change this In the future when we make our service available outside the U S and as Internet penetration continues to expand to all economic tiers of people PayPal will give citizens worldwide more direct control over their currencies than they ever had before It will be nearly impossible for corrupt governments to steal wealth from their people through their old means because if they try the people will switch to dollars or Pounds or Yen in effect dumping the worthless local currency for something more secure br When PayPal launched at a press conference in representatives from Nokia and Deutsche Bank sent million in venture funding to Thiel using PayPal on their PalmPilots PayPal then continued to grow through mergers in with Elon Musk s online financial services company X com and with Pixo a company specializing in mobile commerce These mergers allowed PayPal to expand into the wireless phone market and transformed it into a safer and more user friendly tool by enabling users

running out of oil and that there were no easy alternatives br In Thiel successfully bet that the United States dollar would weaken In Thiel spoke of the dot com bubble having migrated in effect into a growing bubble in the financial sector and specified General Electric and Walmart as vulnerable In Clarium saw a return as Thiel predicted that the dollar would rally br However Clarium faltered in with a loss Thereafter the firm sought to profit in the long term from its petrodollar analysis which foresaw the impending decline in oil supplies Clarium s assets under management grew after achieving a return in to more than billion by the first quarter of but fell later in the year and again in after financial markets collapsed By after missing out on the economic rebound many key

company named after the Tolkien artifact He continues to serve as its chairman as of Thiel stated that the idea for the company was based on the realization that the approaches that PayPal had used to fight fraud could be extended into other contexts like fighting terrorism He also stated that after the September attacks the debate in the United States was will we have more security with less

reached million users by the end of Although Facebook narrowly missed the target Thiel allowed the loan to be converted to equity anyway Thiel said of his investment br br I was comfortable with them pursuing their original vision And it was a very reasonable valuation I thought it was going to be a pretty safe investment br In September Thiel while expressing skepticism about the potential for
