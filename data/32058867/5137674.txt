Network Security Services NSS is a collection of cryptographic computer libraries designed to support cross platform development of security enabled client and server applications with optional support for hardware TLS SSL acceleration on the server side and hardware smart cards on the client side NSS provides a complete open source implementation of cryptographic libraries supporting Transport Layer Security TLS Secure Sockets Layer SSL and S MIME NSS releases prior to version are tri licensed under the Mozilla Public License the GNU General Public License and the GNU Lesser General Public License Since release NSS releases are licensed under GPL compatible Mozilla Public License br br br History br NSS originated from the libraries developed when Netscape invented the SSL security protocol br br br FIPS validation and NISCC testing br The NSS software crypto module has been validated five times in and for conformance to FIPS at Security Levels and NSS was the first open source cryptographic library to receive FIPS validation The NSS libraries passed the NISCC TLS SSL and S MIME test suites million test cases of invalid input data br br br Applications that use NSS br AOL Red Hat Sun Microsystems Oracle Corporation Google and other companies and individual contributors have co developed NSS Mozilla provides the source code repository bug tracking system and infrastructure for mailing lists and discussion groups They and others named below use NSS in a variety of products including the following br br Mozilla client products including Firefox Thunderbird SeaMonkey and Firefox for mobile br AOL Communicator and AOL Instant Messenger AIM br Open source client applications such as Evolution Pidgin and OpenOffice org onward and its descendants br Server products from Red Hat Red Hat Directory Server Red Hat Certificate System and the mod nss SSL module for the Apache web server br Sun server products from the Sun Java Enterprise System including Sun Java System Web Server Sun Java System Directory Server Sun Java System Portal Server Sun Java System Messaging Server and Sun Java System Application Server open source version of Directory Server OpenDS br Libreswan IKE IPsec requires NSS It is a fork of Openswan which could optionally use NSS br br br Architecture br NSS includes a framework to which developers and OEMs can contribute patches such as assembly code to optimize performance on their platforms Mozilla has certified NSS x on platforms NSS makes use of Netscape Portable Runtime NSPR a platform neutral open source API for system functions designed to facilitate cross platform development Like NSS NSPR has been used heavily in multiple products br br br Software development kit br In addition to libraries and APIs NSS provides security tools required for debugging diagnostics certificate and key management cryptography module management and other development tasks NSS comes with an extensive and growing set of documentation including introductory material API references man pages for command line tools and sample code br Programmers can utilize NSS as source and as shared dynamic libraries Every NSS release is backward compatible with previous releases allowing NSS users to upgrade to new NSS shared libraries without recompiling or relinking their applications br br br Interoperability and open standards br NSS supports a range of security standards including the following br br TLS RFC RFC RFC and RFC The Transport Layer Security TLS protocol from the IETF supersedes SSL v while remaining backward compatible with SSL v implementations br SSL The Secure Sockets Layer SSL protocol allows mutual authentication between a client and server and the establishment of an authenticated and encrypted connection br DTLS RFC and RFC br DTLS SRTP RFC br The following PKCS standards br PKCS RSA standard that governs implementation of public key cryptography based on the RSA algorithm br PKCS RSA standard that governs implementation of Diffie Hellman key agreement br PKCS RSA standard that governs password based cryptography for example to encrypt private keys for storage br PKCS RSA standard that governs the application of cryptography to data for example digital signatures and digital envelopes br PKCS RSA standard that governs the storage and encryption of private keys br PKCS RSA standard that governs selected attribute types including those used with PKCS PKCS and PKCS br PKCS RSA standard that governs the syntax for certificate requests br PKCS RSA standard that governs communication with cryptographic tokens such as hardware accelerators and smart cards and permits application independence from specific algorithms and implementations br PKCS RSA standard that governs the format used to store or transport private keys certificates and other secret material br Cryptographic Message Syntax used in S MIME RFC and RFC IETF message specification based on the popular Internet MIME standard that provides a consistent way to send and receive signed and encrypted MIME data br X v ITU standard that governs the format of certificates used for authentication in public key cryptography br OCSP RFC The Online Certificate Status Protocol OCSP governs real time confirmation of certificate validity br PKIX Certificate and CRL Profile RFC The first part of the four part standard under development by the Public Key Infrastructure X working group of the IETF known as PKIX for a public key infrastructure for the Internet br RSA DSA ECDSA Diffie Hellman EC Diffie Hellman AES Triple DES Camellia IDEA SEED DES RC RC SHA SHA SHA SHA MD MD HMAC Common cryptographic algorithms used in public key and symmetric key cryptography br FIPS pseudorandom number generator br br br Hardware support br NSS supports the PKCS interface for access to cryptographic hardware like TLS SSL accelerators hardware security modules and smart cards Since most hardware vendors such as SafeNet AEP and Thales also support this interface NSS enabled applications can work with high speed crypto hardware and use private keys residing on various smart cards if vendors provide the necessary middleware NSS version and above support the Advanced Encryption Standard New Instructions AES NI br br br Java support br Network Security Services for Java JSS consists of a Java interface to NSS It supports most of the security standards and encryption technologies supported by NSS JSS also provides a pure Java interface for ASN types and BER DER encoding br br br See
