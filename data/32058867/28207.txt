Short Message Service commonly abbreviated as SMS is a text messaging service component of most telephone Internet and mobile device systems It uses standardized communication protocols that let mobile phones exchange short text messages Additionally an intermediary service can facilitate a text to voice conversion to be sent to landlines br Developed as part of the GSM standards SMS rolled out commercially on digital cellular networks starting in The service allows users to send and receive messages of up to characters when entirely alpha numeric to and from GSM as well as CDMA and Digital AMPS mobile phones In addition to recreational texting between people SMS is also used in mobile marketing a type of direct marketing as well as for two factor authentication logging in security br The SMS standard has been hugely popular worldwide as a method of text communication By the end of SMS was the most widely used data application with an estimated billion active users or about of all mobile phone subscribers The global SMS messaging business was estimated to be worth over US billion in accounting for almost half of all revenue generated by mobile messaging See also text messaging and instant messaging br br br History br SMS technology originated from radio telegraphy in radio memo pagers that used standardized phone protocols These were defined in as part of the Global System for Mobile Communications GSM series of standards The first SMS message was sent on December when Neil Papworth a test engineer for Sema Group sent Merry Christmas to the Orbitel phone of colleague Richard Jarvis br br br Initial concept br br Adding text messaging functionality to mobile devices began in the early s The first action plan of the CEPT Group GSM was approved in December requesting that The services and facilities offered in the public switched telephone networks and public data networks should be available in the mobile system This plan included the exchange of text messages either directly between mobile stations or transmitted via message handling systems in use at that time br The SMS concept was developed in the Franco German GSM cooperation in by Friedhelm Hillebrand and Bernard Ghillebaert The GSM is optimized for telephony since this was identified as its main application The key idea for SMS was to use this telephone optimized system and to transport messages on the signalling paths needed to control the telephone traffic during periods when no signalling traffic existed In this way unused resources in the system could be used to transport messages at minimal cost However it was necessary to limit the length of the messages to bytes later improved to seven bit characters so that the messages could fit into the existing signalling formats Based on his personal observations and on analysis of the typical lengths of postcard and Telex messages Hillebrand argued that characters was sufficient for most brief communications br SMS could be implemented in every mobile station by updating its software Hence a large base of SMS capable terminals and networks existed when people began to use SMS A new network element required was a specialized short message service centre and enhancements were required to the radio capacity and network transport infrastructure to accommodate growing SMS traffic br br br Early development br The technical development of SMS was a multinational collaboration supporting the framework of standards bodies Through these organizations the technology was made freely available to the whole world br The first proposal which initiated the development of SMS was made by a contribution of Germany and France in the GSM group meeting in February in Oslo This proposal was further elaborated in GSM subgroup WP Services Chairman Martine Alvernhe France Telecom based on a contribution from Germany There were also initial discussions in the subgroup WP network aspects chaired by Jan Audestad Telenor The result was approved by the main GSM group in a June document which was distributed to industry The input documents on SMS had been prepared by Friedhelm Hillebrand of Deutsche Telekom with contributions from Bernard Ghillebaert of France T l com The definition that Friedhelm Hillebrand and Bernard Ghillebaert brought into GSM called for the provision of a message transmission service of alphanumeric messages to mobile users with acknowledgement capabilities The last three words transformed SMS into something much more useful than the electronic paging services used at the time that some in GSM might have had in mind br SMS was considered in the main GSM group as a possible service for the new digital cellular system In GSM document Services and Facilities to be provided in the GSM System both mobile originated and mobile terminated short messages appear on the table of GSM teleservices br The discussions on the GSM services were concluded in the recommendation GSM TeleServices supported by a GSM PLMN Here a rudimentary description of the three services was given br br Short message mobile terminated SMS MT Point to Point the ability of a network to transmit a Short Message to a mobile phone The message can be sent by phone or by a software application br Short message mobile originated SMS MO Point to Point the ability of a network to transmit a Short Message sent by a mobile phone The message can be sent to a phone or to a software application br Short message cell broadcast br The material elaborated in GSM and its WP subgroup was handed over in Spring to a new GSM body called IDEG the Implementation of Data and Telematic Services Experts Group which had its kickoff in May under the chairmanship of Friedhelm Hillebrand German Telecom The technical standard known today was largely created by IDEG later WP as the two recommendations GSM the two point to point services merged and GSM cell broadcast br WP created a Drafting Group Message Handling DGMH which was responsible for the specification of SMS Finn Trosby of Telenor chaired the draft group through its first three years in which the design of SMS was established DGMH had five to eight participants and Finn Trosby mentions as major contributors Kevin Holley Eija Altonen Didier Luizard and Alan Cox The first action plan mentions for the first time the Technical Specification Technical Realisation of the Short Message Service Responsible editor was Finn Trosby The first and very rudimentary draft of the technical specification was completed in November However drafts useful for the manufacturers followed at a later stage in the period A comprehensive description of the work in this period is given in br The work on the draft specification continued in the following few years where Kevin Holley of Cellnet now Telef nica O UK played a leading role Besides the completion of the main specification GSM the detailed protocol specifications on the system interfaces also needed to be completed br br br Support in other architectures br The Mobile Application Part MAP of the SS protocol included support for the transport of Short Messages through the Core Network from its inception MAP Phase expanded support for SMS by introducing a separate operation code for Mobile Terminated Short Message transport Since Phase there have been no changes to the Short Message operation packages in MAP although other operation packages have been enhanced to support CAMEL SMS control br From GPP Releases and onwards CAMEL Phase introduced the ability for the Intelligent Network IN to control aspects of the Mobile Originated Short Message Service while CAMEL Phase as part of GPP Release and onwards provides the IN with the ability to control the Mobile Terminated service CAMEL allows the gsmSCP to block the submission MO or delivery MT of Short Messages route messages to destinations other than that specified by the user and perform real time billing for the use of the service Prior to standardized CAMEL control of the Short Message Service IN control relied on switch vendor specific extensions to the Intelligent Network Application Part INAP of SS br br br Early implementations br The first SMS message was sent over the Vodafone GSM network in the United Kingdom on December from Neil Papworth of Sema Group now Mavenir Systems using a personal computer to Richard Jarvis of Vodafone using an Orbitel handset The text of the message was Merry Christmas br The first commercial deployment of a short message service center SMSC was by Aldiscon part of Logica now part of CGI with Telia now TeliaSonera in Sweden in followed by Fleet Call now Nextel in the US Telenor in Norway and BT Cellnet now O UK later in All first installations of SMS gateways were for network notifications sent to mobile phones usually to inform of voice mail messages br The first commercially sold SMS service was offered to consumers as a person to person text messaging service by Radiolinja now part of Elisa in Finland in Most early GSM mobile phone handsets did not support the ability to send SMS text messages and Nokia was the only handset manufacturer whose total GSM phone line in supported user sending of SMS text messages According to Matti Makkonen an engineer at Nokia at the time the Nokia which was released in January was the first mobile phone to support composing SMSes easily br Initial growth was slow with customers in sending on average only messages per GSM customer per month Initially networks in the UK only allowed customers to send messages to other users on the same network limiting the usefulness of the service This restriction was lifted in br Over time this issue was eliminated by switch billing instead of billing at the SMSC and by new features within SMSCs to allow blocking of foreign mobile users sending messages through it By the end of the average number of messages reached per user per month and on Christmas Day over million messages were sent in the UK alone br br br Text messaging outside GSM br br SMS was originally designed as part of GSM but is now available on a wide range of networks including G networks However not all text messaging systems use SMS and some notable alternative implementations of the concept include J Phone s SkyMail and NTT Docomo s Short Mail both in Japan Email messaging from phones as popularized by NTT Docomo s i mode and the RIM BlackBerry also typically uses standard mail protocols such as SMTP over TCP IP br br br SMS today br br In trillion SMS text messages were sent which is an average of SMS per second SMS has become a large commercial industry earning billion globally in The global average price for an SMS message is US while mobile networks charge each other interconnect fees of at least US when connecting between different phone networks br In the actual cost of sending an SMS in Australia was found to be per SMS br In Caktus Group developed the world s first SMS based voter registration system in Libya As of February more than million people have registered using that system providing Libyan voters with unprecedented access to the democratic process br SMS is being increasingly challenged by Internet Protocol based messaging services such as RCS Matrix Apple s iMessage Signal Facebook Messenger WhatsApp Telegram Viber WeChat in China and Line in Japan available on smart phones with internet connections For example between and SMS telecom revenue in India dropped percent while revenue share per user from data usage grew over times br SMS is still used today mainly for iOS users to communicate with Android devices Apple announced that in iOS RCS would become an option br br br SMS Enablement br SMS enablement allows individuals to send an SMS message to a business phone number traditional landline and receive a SMS in return Providing customers with the ability to text to a phone number allows organizations to offer new services that deliver value Examples include chat bots and text enabled customer service and call centers br br br Technical details br br br GSM br br The Short Message Service Point to Point SMS PP was originally defined in GSM recommendation which is now maintained in GPP as TS GSM now GPP TS defines the Short Message Service Cell Broadcast SMS CB which allows messages advertising public information etc to be broadcast to all mobile users in a specified geographical area br Messages are sent to a short message service center SMSC which provides a store and forward mechanism It attempts to send messages to the SMSC s recipients If a recipient is not reachable the SMSC queues the message for later retry Some SMSCs also provide a forward and forget option where transmission is tried only once Both mobile terminated MT for messages sent to a mobile handset and mobile originating MO for those sent from the mobile handset operations are supported Message delivery is best effort so there are no guarantees that a message will actually be delivered to its recipient but delay or complete loss of a message is uncommon typically affecting less than percent of messages Some providers allow users to request delivery reports either via the SMS settings of most modern phones or by prefixing each message with or N However the exact meaning of confirmations varies from reaching the network to being queued for sending to being sent to receiving a confirmation of receipt from the target device and users are often not informed of the specific type of success being reported br SMS is a stateless communication protocol in which every SMS message is considered entirely independent of other messages Enterprise applications using SMS as a communication channel for stateful dialogue where an MO reply message is paired to a specific MT message requires that session management be maintained external to the protocol br br br Message size br Transmission of short messages between the SMSC and the handset is done whenever using the Mobile Application Part MAP of the SS protocol Messages are sent with the MAP MO and MT ForwardSM operations whose payload length is limited by the constraints of the signaling protocol to precisely bytes bytes bits byte bits br Short messages can be encoded using a variety of alphabets the default GSM bit alphabet the bit data alphabet and the bit UCS or UTF alphabets Depending on which alphabet the subscriber has configured in the handset this leads to the maximum individual short message sizes of bit characters bit characters or bit characters GSM bit alphabet support is mandatory for GSM handsets and network elements but characters in languages such as Hindi Arabic Chinese Korean Japanese or Cyrillic alphabet languages e g Russian Ukrainian Serbian Bulgarian etc must be encoded using the bit UCS character encoding see Unicode Routing data and other metadata is additional to the payload size br Larger content concatenated SMS multipart or segmented SMS or long SMS can be sent using multiple messages in which case each message will start with a User Data Header UDH containing segmentation information Since UDH is part of the payload the number of available characters per segment is lower for bit encoding for bit encoding and for bit encoding The receiving handset is then responsible for reassembling the message and presenting it to the user as one long message While the standard theoretically permits up to segments segments is the practical maximum with some carriers and long messages are often billed as equivalent to multiple SMS messages In some cases segments are supported but software limitations in some SMS applications do not permit this Some providers have offered length oriented pricing schemes for messages although that type of pricing structure is rapidly disappearing br br br Gateway providers br SMS gateway providers facilitate SMS traffic between businesses and mobile subscribers including SMS for enterprises content delivery and entertainment services involving SMS e g TV voting Considering SMS messaging performance and cost as well as the level of messaging services SMS gateway providers can be classified as aggregators or SS providers br The aggregator model is based on multiple agreements with mobile carriers to exchange two way SMS traffic into and out of the operator s SMSC also known as local termination model Aggregators lack direct access into the SS protocol which is the protocol where the SMS messages are exchanged SMS messages are delivered to the operator s SMSC but not the subscriber s handset the SMSC takes care of further handling of the message through the SS network br Another type of SMS gateway provider is based on SS connectivity to route SMS messages also known as international termination model The advantage of this model is the ability to route data directly through SS which gives the provider total control and visibility of the complete path during SMS routing This means SMS messages can be sent directly to and from recipients without having to go through the SMSCs of other mobile operators Therefore it is possible to avoid delays and message losses offering full delivery guarantees of messages and optimized routing This model is particularly efficient when used in mission critical messaging and SMS used in corporate communications Moreover these SMS gateway providers are providing branded SMS services with masking but after misuse of these gateways most countries governments have taken serious steps to block these gateways br br br Interconnectivity with other networks br Message Service Centers communicate with the Public Land Mobile Network PLMN or PSTN via Interworking and Gateway MSCs br Subscriber originated messages are transported from a handset to a service center and may be destined for mobile users subscribers on a fixed network or Value Added Service Providers VASPs also known as application terminated Subscriber terminated messages are transported from the service center to the destination handset and may originate from mobile users from fixed network subscribers or from other sources such as VASPs br On some carriers nonsubscribers can send messages to a subscriber s phone using an Email to SMS gateway Additionally many carriers including AT T Mobility T Mobile USA Sprint and Verizon Wireless offer the ability to do this through their respective websites br For example an AT T subscriber whose phone number was would receive emails addressed to txt att net as text messages Subscribers can easily reply to these SMS messages and the SMS reply is sent back to the original email address Sending email to SMS is free for the sender but the recipient is subject to the standard delivery charges Only the first characters of an email message can be delivered to a phone and only characters can be sent from a phone However longer messages may be broken up into multiple texts depending upon the telephone service provider br Text enabled fixed line handsets are required to receive messages in text format However messages can be delivered to non enabled phones using text to speech conversion br Short messages can send binary content such as ringtones or logos as well as Over the air programming OTA or configuration data Such uses are a vendor specific extension of the GSM specification and there are multiple competing standards although Nokia s Smart Messaging is common br SMS is used for M M Machine to Machine communication For instance there is an LED display machine controlled by SMS and some vehicle tracking companies use SMS for their data transport or telemetry needs SMS usage for these purposes is slowly being superseded by GPRS services owing to their lower overall cost GPRS is offered by smaller telco players as a route of sending SMS text to reduce the cost of SMS texting internationally br br br AT commands br Many mobile and satellite transceiver units support the sending and receiving of SMS using an extended version of the Hayes command set The extensions were standardised as part of the GSM Standards and extended as part of the GPP standards process br The connection between the terminal equipment and the transceiver can be realized with a serial cable e g USB a Bluetooth link an infrared link etc Common AT commands include AT CMGS send message AT CMSS send message from storage AT CMGL list messages and AT CMGR read message br However not all modern devices support receiving of messages if the message storage for instance the device s internal memory is not accessible using AT commands br br br Premium rated short messages br br Short messages may be used normally to provide premium rate services to subscribers of a telephone network br Mobile terminated short messages can be used to deliver digital content such as news alerts financial information logos and ring tones The first premium rate media content delivered via the SMS system was the world s first paid downloadable ringing tones as commercially launched by Saunalahti later Jippii Group now part of Elisa Group in Initially only Nokia branded phones could handle them By the ringtone business globally had exceeded billion of service revenues and nearly US billion by Today they are also used to pay smaller payments online for example for file sharing services in mobile application stores or VIP section entrance Outside the online world one can buy a bus ticket or beverages from ATM pay a parking ticket order a store catalog or some goods e g discount movie DVDs make a donation to charity and much more br The Value added service provider VASP providing the content submits the message to the mobile operator s SMSC s using a TCP IP protocol such as the short message peer to peer protocol SMPP or the External Machine Interface EMI The SMSC delivers the text using the normal Mobile Terminated delivery procedure The subscribers are charged extra for receiving this premium content the revenue is typically divided between the mobile network operator and the VASP either through revenue share or a fixed transport fee Submission to the SMSC is usually handled by a third party br Mobile originated short messages may also be used in a premium rated manner for services such as televoting In this case the VASP providing the service obtains a short code from the telephone network operator and subscribers send texts to that number The payouts to the carriers vary by carrier percentages paid are greatest on the lowest priced premium SMS services Most information providers should expect to pay about percent of the cost of the premium SMS up front to the carrier The submission of the text to the SMSC is identical to a standard MO Short Message submission but once the text is at the SMSC the Service Center SC identifies the Short Code as a premium service The SC will then direct the content of the text message to the VASP typically using an IP protocol such as SMPP or EMI Subscribers are charged a premium for the sending of such messages with the revenue typically shared between the network operator and the VASP Short codes only work within one country they are not international br An alternative to inbound SMS is based on long numbers international number format such as which can be used in place of short codes for SMS reception in several applications such as TV voting product promotions and campaigns Long numbers work internationally allow businesses to use their own numbers rather than short codes which are usually shared across many brands Additionally long numbers are nonpremium inbound numbers br br br Threaded SMS br Threaded SMS is a visual styling orientation of SMS message history that arranges messages to and from a contact in chronological order on a single screen br It was first invented by a developer working to implement the SMS client for the BlackBerry who was looking to make use of the blank screen left below the message on a device with a larger screen capable of displaying far more than the usual characters and was inspired by threaded Reply conversations in email br Visually this style of representation provides a back and forth chat like history for each individual contact Hierarchical threading at the conversation level as typical in blogs and on line messaging boards is not widely supported by SMS messaging clients This limitation is due to the fact that there is no session identifier or subject line passed back and forth between sent and received messages in the header data as specified by SMS protocol from which the client device can properly thread an incoming message to a specific dialogue or even to a specific message within a dialogue br Most smart phone text messaging clients are able to create some contextual threading of group messages which narrows the context of the thread around the common interests shared by group members On the other hand advanced enterprise messaging applications which push messages from a remote server often display a dynamically changing reply number multiple numbers used by the same sender which is used along with the sender s phone number to create session tracking capabilities analogous to the functionality that cookies provide for web browsing As one pervasive example this technique is used to extend the functionality of many Instant Messenger IM applications such that they are able to communicate over two way dialogues with the much larger SMS user base In cases where multiple reply numbers are used by the enterprise server to maintain the dialogue the visual conversation threading on the client may be separated into multiple threads br br br Application to person A P SMS br While SMS reached its popularity as a person to person messaging another type of SMS is growing fast application to person A P messaging A P is a type of SMS sent from a subscriber to an application or sent from an application to a subscriber It is commonly used by businesses such as banks e gaming logistic companies e commerce to send SMS messages from their systems to their customers br In the US carriers have traditionally preferred that A P messages must be sent using a short code rather than a standard long code However recently multiple US carriers including Verizon have announced plans to officially support A P messages over long codes In the United Kingdom A P messages can be sent with a dynamic character sender ID however short codes are used for OPTOUT commands br br br Satellite phone networks br All commercial satellite phone networks except ACeS and OptusSat support SMS While early Iridium handsets only support incoming SMS later models can also send messages The price per message varies for different networks Unlike some mobile phone networks there is no extra charge for sending international SMS or to send one to a different satellite phone network SMS can sometimes be sent from areas where the signal is too poor to make a voice call br Satellite phone networks usually have web based or email based SMS portals where one can send free SMS to phones on that particular network br br br Unreliability br Unlike dedicated texting systems like the Simple Network Paging Protocol and Motorola s ReFLEX protocol SMS message delivery is not guaranteed and many implementations provide no mechanism through which a sender can determine whether an SMS message has been delivered in a timely manner SMS messages are generally treated as lower priority traffic than voice and various studies have shown that around to of messages are lost entirely even during normal operation conditions and others may not be delivered until long after their relevance has passed The use of SMS as an emergency notification service in particular has been questioned br br br Vulnerabilities br br The Global Service for Mobile communications GSM with the greatest worldwide number of users succumbs to several security vulnerabilities In the GSM only the airway traffic between the Mobile Station MS and the Base Transceiver Station BTS is optionally encrypted with a weak and broken stream cipher A or A The authentication is unilateral and also vulnerable There are also many other security vulnerabilities and shortcomings Such vulnerabilities are inherent to SMS as one of the superior and well tried services with a global availability in the GSM networks SMS messaging has some extra security vulnerabilities due to its store and forward feature and the problem of fake SMS that can be conducted via the Internet When a user is roaming SMS content passes through different networks perhaps including the Internet and is exposed to various vulnerabilities and attacks Another concern arises when an adversary gets access to a phone and reads the previous unprotected messages br In October researchers from Pennsylvania State University published an analysis of vulnerabilities in SMS capable cellular networks The researchers speculated that attackers might exploit the open functionality of these networks to disrupt them or cause them to fail possibly on a nationwide scale br br br SMS spoofing br br The GSM industry has identified a number of potential fraud attacks on mobile operators that can be delivered via abuse of SMS messaging services The most serious threat is SMS Spoofing which occurs when a fraudster manipulates address information in order to impersonate a user that has roamed onto a foreign network and is submitting messages to the home network Frequently these messages are addressed to destinations outside the home network with the home SMSC essentially being hijacked to send messages into other networks br The only sure way of detecting and blocking spoofed messages is to screen incoming mobile originated messages to verify that the sender is a valid subscriber and that the message is coming from a valid and correct location This can be implemented by adding an intelligent routing function to the network that can query originating subscriber details from the home location register HLR before the message is submitted for delivery This kind of intelligent routing function is beyond the capabilities of legacy messaging infrastructure br br br Limitation br In an effort to limit telemarketers who had taken to bombarding users with hordes of unsolicited messages India introduced new regulations in September including a cap of SMS messages per subscriber per month or an average of per subscriber per day Due to representations received from some of the service providers and consumers TRAI Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has raised this limit to SMS messages per SIM per day in case of prepaid services and up to SMS messages per SIM per month in case of postpaid services with effect from November However it was ruled unconstitutional by the Delhi high court but there are some limitations br br br Flash SMS br A Flash SMS is a type of SMS that appears directly on the main screen without user interaction and is not automatically stored in the inbox It can be useful in emergencies such as a fire alarm or cases of confidentiality as in delivering one time passwords br br br Silent SMS br In Germany almost half a million silent SMS messages were sent by the federal police customs and the secret service Verfassungsschutz offices for protection of the constitution These silent messages also known as silent TMS stealth SMS stealth ping or Short Message Type are used to locate a person and thus to create a complete movement profile They do not show up on a display nor trigger any acoustical signal when received Their primary purpose was to deliver special services of the network operator to any cell phone br br br See also br br br br br br
