Gpg win is an email and file encryption package for most versions of Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Outlook which utilises the GnuPG framework for symmetric and public key cryptography such as data encryption digital signatures hash calculations etc br br br History of Gpg win br The original creation of Gpg win was initiated and funded by Germany s Federal Office for Information Security BSI in resulting in the release of Gpg win on April however Gpg win and all included tools are free and open source software and it is typically the non proprietary option for privacy recommended to Windows users br As Gpg win v was a much overhauled derivate of GnuPP both were using GnuPG v for cryptographic operations and thus only supported OpenPGP as cryptography standard br Hence in the development of a fundamentally enhanced version was started also with support from the German BSI Federal Office for Information Security this effort culminated in the release of Gpg win on August after a protracted beta testing phase which was based on GnuPG included S MIME support Kleopatra as a new certificate manager the Explorer plug in GpgEX for cryptography operations on files basic support of smart cards a full set of German dialogue texts in addition to the English ones new manuals in English and German plus many other enhancements br In contrast to Gpg win v which focused on new features and software components the development of Gpg win v focused on usability plus consolidation of code and features This resulted in the release of Gpg win on September with proper support for Elliptic Curve Cryptography ECC by utilising GnuPG instead of broadened stabilised and enhanced smart card support a fundamentally overhauled Outlook plug in GpgOL for Outlook and newer support of bit versions of Outlook and newer supporting dialogues in all languages which KDE supports etc It is also distributed as GnuPG VS Desktop with commercial support and approval for handling NATO RESTRICTED RESTREINT UE EU RESTRICTED and German VS NfD documents which in turn has become the major source of revenue for maintaining and further developing the GnuPG framework and Gpg win br Gpg win released on December switched to using GnuPG from and continued to refine and enhance the feature set of Gpg win v br br br Contents of Gpg win Installer br GnuPG the core cryptography framework br Certificate managers br Kleopatra certificate manager for OpenPGP and X br GPA an alternative certificate manager GNU for OpenPGP and X br Plug ins for email and file cryptography br GpgOL a plug in for Microsoft Outlook to provide email encryption and signing br GpgEX a plug in for the Windows Explorer to provide file encryption signing and hash calculations br Gpg win Compendium an introduction to encryption OpenPGP and X and user manual for Gpg win br br br See also br br E mail privacy br br br br br br External links br Official website
