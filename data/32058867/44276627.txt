Ricochet or Ricochet IM is a free software multi platform instant messaging software project originally developed by John Brooks and later adopted as the official instant messaging client project of the Invisible im group A goal of the Invisible im group is to help people maintain privacy by developing a metadata free instant messaging client br br br History br Originally called Torsion IM Ricochet was renamed in June Ricochet is a modern alternative to TorChat which hasn t been updated in several years and to Tor Messenger which is discontinued On September it was announced that the Invisible im group would be working with Brooks on further development of Ricochet in a Wired article by Kim Zetter Zetter also wrote that Ricochet s future plans included a protocol redesign and file transfer capabilities The protocol redesign was implemented in April br In February Ricochet s developers made public a security audit that had been sponsored by the Open Technology Fund and carried out by the NCC Group in November The results of the audit were reasonably positive The audit identified multiple areas of improvement and one vulnerability that could be used to deanonymize users According to Brooks the vulnerability has been fixed in the latest release br br br Technology br Ricochet is a decentralized instant messenger meaning there is no server to connect to and share metadata with Further using Tor Ricochet starts a Tor hidden service locally on a person s computer and can communicate only with other Ricochet users who are also running their own Ricochet created Tor hidden services This way Ricochet communication never leaves the Tor network A user screen name example ricochet hslmfsg dmcqctb is auto generated upon first starting Ricochet the first half of the screen name is the word ricochet with the second half being the address of the Tor hidden service Before two Ricochet users can talk at least one of them must privately or publicly share their unique screen name in some way br br br Privacy benefits br Ricochet does not reveal user IP addresses or physical locations because it uses Tor br Message content is cryptographically authenticated and private br There is no need to register anywhere in order to use Ricochet particularly with a fixed server br Contact list information is stored locally and it would be very difficult for passive surveillance techniques to determine whom the user is chatting with br Ricochet does not save chat history When the user closes a conversation the chat log is not recoverable br The use of Tor hidden services prevents network traffic from ever leaving the Tor network thereby preserving anonymity and complicating passive network surveillance br Ricochet is a portable application users do not need to install any software to use Ricochet Ricochet connects to the Tor network automatically br br br See also br Comparison of instant messaging clients br Jami br Tox protocol br br br br br br External links br Ricochet on GitHub br https www ricochetrefresh net
