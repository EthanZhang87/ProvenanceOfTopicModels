Cypress Semiconductor was an American semiconductor design and manufacturing company It offered NOR flash memories F RAM and SRAM Traveo microcontrollers PSoCs PMICs capacitive touch sensing controllers Wireless BLE Bluetooth Low Energy and USB connectivity solutions br Its headquarters were in San Jose California with operations in the United States Ireland India and the Philippines br In April Cypress Semiconductors announced the acquisition of Broadcom s Wireless Internet of Things Business The deal was closed in July br In June Infineon Technologies announced it would acquire Cypress for billion The deal closed in April making Infineon one of the world s top semiconductor manufacturers br Some of its main competitors included Microchip Technology NXP Semiconductors Renesas Electronics and Micron Technology br br br History br br br Founding and early years br It was founded by T J Rodgers and others Fritz Beyerlein Fred Jenne Steven H Kaplan R Michael Starnes and Lowell Turriff from Advanced Micro Devices It was formed in with backing by Sevin Rosen and went public in The company initially focused on the design and development of high speed CMOS SRAMs EEPROMs PAL devices and TTL devices Two years after going public the company switched from the NASDAQ to the New York Stock Exchange In October the company announced it would switch its listing to the NASDAQ on November br The AgigA Tech Inc subsidiary sells non volatile random access memory RAM It was acquired during the Simtek purchase in August and marks the second time that Cypress acquired a start up venture from founder Ron Sartore who also co founded Anchor Chips The division was sold to the Unigen Corporation in May br In November Cypress also backed a packaging firm called Deca Technologies Inc br br br br In December Cypress Semiconductor merged with Spansion in an all stock deal worth billion The merger represented the combination of two companies that were No in their respective memory markets and have successfully diversified into embedded processing br In March Cypress and Spansion completed of the transactions of the merger in an all stock tax free transaction valued at approximately billion Cypress shareholders approved the issuance of shares of Cypress stock to Spansion shareholders for each Spansion share they own The merger is expected to achieve more than million in cost synergies on an annualized basis within three years and to be accretive to non GAAP earnings within the first full year after the transaction closes At the time of its merger with Spansion in Cypress Semiconductor had more than US and foreign patents Cypress Semiconductor is a component of the Ocean Tomo Patent Index br Cypress attempted to acquire Integrated Silicon Solution Inc in but was thwarted by a competing bid by Chinese buyer consortium Uphill Investment Co which included GigaDevice a major competitor in the NOR flash market This buyer consortium offered a higher bid than Cypress and successfully acquired ISSI for million br Also in Cypress tried to acquire Atmel but was outbid by Dialog Semiconductor in the end Microchip Technology made the deal br br br br In April Cypress announced the acquisition of Broadcom s Wireless Internet of Things IoT business and related assets in an all cash transaction valued at million Under the terms of the deal Cypress will acquire Broadcom s Wi Fi Bluetooth and Zigbee IoT product lines and intellectual property along with its WICED brand and developer ecosystem br In April it was announced that Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Inc will invest million in Deca and will license Deca s M Series fan out wafer level packaging FOWLP technologies and processes As part of the agreement ASE Group and Deca will jointly develop the M Series fan out manufacturing process and will expand production of chip scale packages using this technology br Cypress named Hassane El Khoury its president and chief executive officer and announced he will join the board of directors on Aug br br br board dispute br In April Delaware Chancery Court decided Cypress Semiconductor Corp had to give former CEO Rodgers insight into internal documents related to possible violations of Cypress s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by executive chairman Ray Bingham br Bingham who is a founding member of venture capital firm Canyon Bridge Capital Partners Inc a China state backed private equity fund was criticized for the conflict of interest leading Cypress and Canyon Bridge as both companies possibly focus on the same acquisition targets br Rodgers ran a proxy contest against the board aiming for veteran tech industry board directors Daniel McCranie and Camillo Martino to replace Ray Bingham and Cypress director ric Benhamou br On June it was made public that Ray Bingham stepped down from the board Prior to Bingham s resignation shareholder advisory firms ISS Glass Lewis and Egan Jones had recommended McCranie and Martino Rodgers s nominees citing additional and sharper questions not only regarding the board s handling of this situation but also regarding the potential for conflicts of interest inherent in Bingham s dual roles br On June both of Rodgers s nominees won victories by substantial margins br br br merger br In under CEO Hassane El Khouri the company agreed to the offer of Infineon Technologies valued about billions that represents the all cash buyout price of per share This purchase price premium of was the th highest premium paid for a public semiconductor company with greater than Billion in value since The price also represented times next twelve month average analyst EBITDA estimates which was the th highest EBITDA multiple paid for a public semiconductor company with a value greater than Billion since The acquisition was announced complete on April ending the independent history of Cypress Semiconductors br br br Locations br Cypress was headquartered in San Jose CA and had manufacturing plants in Austin TX and Bloomington MN assembly and test operations in the Philippines and Bangkok Thailand Cypress had design facilities in the United States including San Jose CA Lynnwood WA Colorado Springs CO Lexington KY San Diego CA and Beaverton OR Japan Tokyo Germany Langen and Munich India Bangalore China Shanghai Ukraine Lviv Ireland Dublin and Cork Malaysia Penang and other locations Cypress had previously divested a large portion of its San Jose campus to SVTC SunPower and Second Harvest of Silicon Valley br br br List of acquisitions br br Since its founding Cypress has acted as an incubator for wholly owned subsidiaries which are given a degree of autonomy and has acquired other small technology companies In addition Cypress has been an active acquirer of smaller technology companies In addition Cypress has incorporated some of its technology into subsidiaries to speed up development of such products as the PSoC Programmable System on Chip SoC that integrates analog and digital components with a microcontroller on a single chip to form a complete solution for embedded systems Since the early s acquisitions have included
