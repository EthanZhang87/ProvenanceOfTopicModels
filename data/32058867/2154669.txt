Independent Television through various joint ventures br br br History br br br Doordarshan era br In the journalist Radhika Roy and her economist husband Prannoy Roy founded New Delhi Television The company began operation as a production house of news segments for the public broadcaster Doordarshan and international satellite news channels It was converted into a commercial news network in and became the first independent television news network in India Doordarshan allotted a slot to the network to air a weekly broadcast called The World This Week a news magazine programme that was commissioned by the director general of the public broadcaster Bhaskar Ghose and covered international news The weekly news bulletin was described as an instant hit among its Indian viewers br The network was then contracted by Doordarshan to produce its coverage of the Indian general elections and budget session specials which too became widely popular The first election result telecast produced by NDTV was that of the Indian general election which was also the first televised live coverage of an election result in India it employed hot lines across the country and featured visual graphics discussions and debates The format developed by NDTV was contrasted with the simple official announcements publicised by Doordarshan in previous elections and was adopted as a template by news broadcasters over the following decades The terms of agreement between Doordarshan and NDTV were modified in the same year and the company began paying a fee for its weekly slot instead of being a contractor under the public broadcaster During the initial years there was a delay of minutes between telecast and production of live news due to government regulations which later shifted to five minutes br The World This Week continued to be aired till It was aired on Fridays at pm and was described as the only India based programme which looked out at the rest of the world In CNN began collaborating with NDTV to produce select coverage for the weekly news bulletin The weekly was the first privately produced news bulletin in India and became one of the top rated programmes on Doordarshan According to Prannoy Roy it was not difficult to appear good in comparison to Doordarshan which he described as more radio than television and that they were aided by the time period being most newsiest in television history The news bulletin covered a number of major events such as the Tiananmen Square protests the Fall of the Berlin Wall the Dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Breakup of Yugoslavia some of which were covered live from the respective countries by NDTV br In NDTV presented a proposal to Doordarshan to move its production to a daily half hourly news bulletin on the second Doordarshan channel DD Metro The proposal was accepted and the news bulletin called News Tonight was launched The Roys approached five major Indian business houses for investments and secured agreements with all five of them including the multinational Tata Group The bulletin was the first daily domestic news broadcast in the country The company also began producing shows such as The News Hour and Good Morning India for Doordarshan Prannoy Roy was the anchor of the NDTV news bulletins who in the process acquired a reputation for reliable authentic and sophisticated news reporting The news bulletins had gained both in credibility and were competing with entertainment channels in terms of viewership which made the network sought after for partnerships by international news networks such as BBC and Rupert Murdoch s Star Network at a time when restrictions on private participation in television broadcasting were being lifted and Doordarshan s monopoly broken by satellite television br In the director general of Doordarshan Rathikant Basu left the public broadcaster and joined its multinational rival the Star Network The resignation brought about a call for scrutinising his activities during his tenure as the director general a parliamentary committee was assigned to examine the finances of Doordarshan which alleged irregularities in its dealings with NDTV On January the Central Bureau of Investigation CBI filed a number of cases against the former director general five other officials of the public broadcaster and against Prannoy Roy who was the managing director of NDTV The cases went on for several years in the form of a protracted dispute until CBI filed a closure report in and the charges were quashed by the Delhi High Court with the verdict that there was no evidence of wrongdoing br br br Rupert Murdoch and Star News br In NDTV entered into five year contract with Rupert Murdoch s Star Network Under the terms of the agreement NDTV would produce all news content for the network while News Television India subsidiary of Murdoch s News Corporation would finance the endeavor The CEO of Star India had stated that NDTV was an obvious choice for a partnership due its recognition and infrastructure Star News was launched in February and was the first independent x news channel in India It was a bilingual channel and aired both Hindi and English language programs NDTV productions were also slotted on two pm news bulletins in the channels of Star Plus and Star World In NDTV launched its own news website called ndtv com which streamed live webcasts of its productions and generated daily views within a month of its launch Over the following years it also made its first foray into regional markets and began a Tamil language news bulletin on Vijay TV a channel owned by the Star Network br Star News was an immediate success its revenue made the channel break even at the onset Star India was also able to capitalise on the experience gained in NDTV s earlier collaboration with CNN one of its multinational competitors The financial support provided by the multinational gave the channel an advantage over its emerging competitors such as Aaj Tak the Hindi language channel founded by Living Media Prannoy Roy remained as the face of the network while Radhika Roy who was known for being low profile operated the editorial process and reportedly demanded high standards for credibility impartiality and independence The channel developed sophisticated production values and a reputation for journalistic integrity In a study conducted with Indian journalists Star News was found to be perceived as the most professionally produced among Indian networks and was regularly viewed by a majority of journalists alongside Doordarshan and BBC World br In the partnership NDTV was given editorial independence and produced the entire editorial content including in its packaging and presentation It was noted that the channel occasionally used its own branded equipment such as microphones with NDTV imprints without any dispute Under the agreement the profits belonged to Star News and NDTV was paid a fee which began with US million under an escalation clause and reserved intellectual property rights over its productions This arrangement reportedly became an issue of contention between the sales team of Star India which were under pressure to generate revenues and NDTV which intended to maintain in its editorial independence In the NDTV news bulletin on Star Plus was removed which was speculated to have been a signifier of the closeted conflict br In an anecdotal testimony Peter Mukerjea who was CEO of Star India between and states that an advertiser with the network who was the chairman of a major textile company had complained to him about a news report about environmental issues in a town which operated one of their plants and held Star India responsible for the reporters not taking into account the views of the company Star News covered the Gujarat riots with investigative reports in depth analyses and live reporting of events The channel s coverage resulted in it being blacked out for a day by the Gujarat Government under Narendra Modi The censorship came a day after the Minister of Law Arun Jaitley had accused some networks of conspiracy against the government on a live telecast of Zee News a network that had assured him that they were not such networks on the same telecast br In Star was willing to continue the contract but without complete editorial control being granted to NDTV which was unacceptable to the Roys In the end the negotiations between NDTV and Star India fell apart and the contract was not renewed NDTV kept producing news segments for Star News till March The company s unwillingness to succumb to government pressure or pro right wing editorial intervention from Rupert Murdoch cemented his decision to exit the partnership as well Murdoch went on secure a partnership with the Anandabazar Patrika Group for Star News which was converted into a Hindi language news channel and was noted to have become far less critical in its news coverage following the transition br br br Independent broadcasting network br Following the end of the partnership with Star India NDTV began its venture as an independent broadcaster The company had acquired equity capital from investment banks including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Standard Chartered invested US million and acquired a share of in the company Media commentators at the time had speculated that Star News would remain the market leader and decimate NDTV Before the launch of the network s independent channels under its own brand it had invested US million into advertising For distribution it entered into a tie up with the network of One Alliance a joint venture between Sony and Discovery Inc br NDTV launched two channels NDTV India and NDTV x in NDTV India was a Hindi language news channel and NDTV x was an English language news channel Soon after its launch NDTV x became the frontrunner in the English news segment while NDTV India had the second highest viewership following Aaj Tak in the Hindi language segment which pushed Star News to the place of fourth highest viewership in the process The channels introduced the concept of break away broadcasting in India with integrated receiver decoder IRD which could provide segmented region or city specific news and with optional local language dubbings to viewers of the same channel In NDTV became a publicly traded company and the board members reportedly included N R Narayana Murthy the founder of Infosys and Tarun Das the chief mentor of the Confederation of Indian Industry as independent directors In December it stood as the media company with the highest market capitalisation at a valuation of crore equivalent to billion or US million in br The network was successful in pursuing a strategy of promoting anchors as TV stars in an attempt to both consolidate its brand name and as an incentive for drawing and retaining a talent pool of journalists Some of their journalists eventually started branching out to begin their own ventures and a number of top executive employees left the network including both the managing editor Rajdeep Sardesai and the chief financial officer Sameer Manchanda who left the network to join hands with the entrepreneur Raghav Bahl who went on to launch CNN IBN The resignations reportedly caused a number of problems for the network the morale in the newsroom dipped and the network began finding it difficult to remain on top with an emergence of a crowded market with high competition as newer channels had more room for experimentation Manchanda s resignation made the company s advertisers the primary source of revenue to become vulnerable as the network which was solely in news broadcasting did not have extensive connections unlike others in the industry br br Due to the founder of CNN IBN being from NDTV among other examples the network is widely credited for having created a category of media professionals with high credibility in the Indian broadcasting industry In an effort to check further loss of employees the company began offering extensive salary raises and stock options to its employees after the departure of Sardesai It was noted in that the company had a high distribution of its wealth with stock options worth million equivalent to million or US in being available to over employees of

borrowings from various multinationals NDTV also made a series of divestments of its assets through a number of sales in the following period In August the chain borrowings had eventually led the promoters debt being transferred to a shell company which was owned by a subsidiary of Reliance Industries and in October NBCUniversal decided to pull out of the partnership and sold off its share
