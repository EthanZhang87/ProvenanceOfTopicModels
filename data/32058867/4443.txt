a transport hub with the Port of Barcelona being one of Europe s principal seaports and busiest European passenger port an international airport Barcelona El Prat Airport which handles over million passengers per year an extensive motorway network and a high speed rail line with a link to France and the rest of Europe br br br Names br The name Barcelona comes from the ancient Iberian Ba keno attested in an ancient coin inscription found on the right side of the coin in Iberian script as in ancient Greek sources as Barkin n and in Latin as Barcino Barcilonum and Barcenona br Oder sources suggest that the city may have been named after the Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca who was supposed to have founded the city in the rd century BC but there is no evidence its name in antiquity Barcino was connected with the Barcid family of Hamilcar During the Middle Ages the city was variously known as Barchinona Bar alona Barchelonaa and Barchenona br An abbreviated form sometimes used by locals for the city is Barna Bar a is only applied to the local football club FC Barcelona not to the city Another common abbreviation is BCN which is also the IATA airport code of the Barcelona El Prat Airport br The city is referred to as the Ciutat Comtal in Catalan and Ciudad Condal in Spanish i e Comital City or City of Counts owing to its past as the seat of the Count of Barcelona br br br History br br br Legendary Founding br The origin of the earliest settlement at the site of present day Barcelona is unclear The ruins of an early settlement have been found including different tombs and dwellings dating to earlier than BC In Greek mythology the founding of Barcelona had been attributed to the mythological Hercules br br br Punic Barcelona br According to tradition Barcelona was founded by Punic Phonecian settlers who had trading posts along the Catalonian coast In particular some historians attribute the foundation of the city directly to the historical Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca father of Hannibal who supposedly named the city Barcino after his family in the rd century BC but this theory has been questioned Archeological evidence in the form of coins from the rd century BC have been found on the hills at the foot of Montju c with the name B rkeno written in an ancient script in the Iberian language Thus we can conclude that the Laietani an ancient Iberian pre Roman people of the Iberian peninsula who inhabited the area occupied by the city of Barcelona around BC called the area B rkeno which means The Place of the Plains Barrke plains terrace br br br Roman Barcelona br br In about BC the Romans redrew the town as a castrum Roman military camp centred on the Mons Taber a little hill near the Generalitat Catalan Government and city hall buildings The Roman Forum at the crossing of the Cardo Maximus and Decumanus Maximus was approximately placed where current Pla a de Sant Jaume is Thus the political centre of the city Catalonia and its domains has remained in the same place for over years br Under the Romans it was a colony with the surname of Faventia or in full Colonia Faventia Julia Augusta Pia Barcino or Colonia Julia Augusta Faventia Paterna Barcino Pomponius Mela mentions it among the small towns of the district probably as it was eclipsed by its neighbour Tarraco modern Tarragona but it may be gathered from later writers that it gradually grew in wealth and consequence favoured as it was with a beautiful situation and an excellent harbour It enjoyed immunity from imperial burdens The city minted its own coins some from the era of Galba survive br Important Roman vestiges are displayed in Pla a del Rei underground as a part of the Barcelona City History Museum MUHBA the typically Roman grid plan is still visible today in the layout of the historical centre the Barri G tic Gothic Quarter Some remaining fragments of the Roman walls have been incorporated into the cathedral The cathedral Catedral Bas lica Metropolitana de Barcelona is also sometimes called La Seu which simply means cathedral and see among other things in Catalan It is said to have been founded in br br br Medieval Barcelona br The city was conquered by the Visigoths in the early th century becoming for a few years the capital of all Hispania After being conquered by the Umayyads in the early th century it was conquered after a siege in by Charlemagne s son Louis who made Barcelona the seat of the Carolingian Hispanic March Marca Hispanica a buffer zone ruled by the Count of Barcelona br br The Counts of Barcelona became increasingly independent and expanded their territory to include much of modern Catalonia although in Barcelona was sacked by the army of Almanzor The sack was so traumatic that most of Barcelona s population was either killed or enslaved In Aragon and the County of Barcelona merged in dynastic union by the marriage of Ramon Berenguer IV and Petronilla of Aragon their titles finally borne by only one person when their son Alfonso II of Aragon ascended to the throne in His territories were later to be known as the Crown of Aragon which conquered many overseas possessions and ruled the western Mediterranean Sea with outlying territories in Naples and Sicily and as far as Athens in the th century br Barcelona was the leading slave trade centre of the Crown of Aragon up until the th century when it was eclipsed by Valencia It initially fed from eastern and Balkan slave stock later drawing from a Maghribian and ultimately Subsaharan pool of slaves br The Bank or Taula de canvi de Barcelona often viewed as the oldest public bank in Europe was established by the city magistrates in It originated from necessities of the state as did the Bank of Venice and the Bank of Genoa br br br Barcelona under the Spanish monarchy br The marriage of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile in united the two royal lines Madrid became the centre of political power whilst the colonization of the Americas reduced the financial importance at least in relative terms of Mediterranean trade Barcelona was a centre of Catalan separatism including the Catalan Revolt against Philip IV of Spain The great plague of halved the city s population br br In the th century a fortress was built at Montju c that overlooked the harbour In this fortress was used by the French astronomer Pierre Fran ois Andr M chain for observations relating to a survey stretching to Dunkirk that provided the official basis of the measurement of a metre The definitive metre bar manufactured from platinum was presented to the French legislative assembly on June Much of Barcelona was negatively affected by the Napoleonic wars but the start of industrialization saw the fortunes of the province improve br br br Transforming the city br In the mid s Barcelona was struggling with population density as it became an industrial port city and European capital The city s density was at people per hectare more than double that of Paris Mortality rates were on the rise and any outbreaks of disease would devastate the population To solve the issue a civil engineer named Ildefons Cerd proposed a plan for a new district known as the Eixample The citizens of Barcelona had begun to demolish the medieval wall surrounding and constricting the city Cerd thought it best to transform the land outside the walls into an area characterized by a scientific approach to urbanization His proposal consisted of a grid of streets to unite the old city and surrounding villages There would also be wide streets to allow people to breathe clean air gardens in the centre of each street block integration of rich and poor giving both groups access to the same services and smooth flowing traffic Urban quality egalitarianism hygiene sunlight and efficiency were all major keys for Cerd s vision Not everything he imagined would be realized within the Eixample district but the iconic octagonal superblocks with chamfered corners for better visibility are his direct brainchild and remain immensely helpful even years later The district and its ideals were not appreciated at the time The city council awarded the design of the extension plan to another architect The Spanish government was the one to step in and impose Cerd s plan laying the groundwork for many more tensions between the Spanish and Catalan administrations Regardless some of the upper class citizens of Barcelona were excited by the new plan and began a race to build the biggest tallest most attractive house in the district Their interest and money fueled the rich diversity that we now see in the district s architecture In the end Cerd s ideas would have a lasting impact on Barcelona s development earning it international recognition for its highly efficient approach to urban planning and design br br br The Spanish Civil War and the Franco period br br During the Spanish Civil War the city and Catalonia in general were resolutely Republican Many enterprises and public services were collectivized by the CNT and UGT unions As the power of the Republican government and the Generalitat diminished much of the city was under the effective control of anarchist groups The anarchists lost control of the city to their own allies the Communists and official government troops after the street fighting of the Barcelona May Days The fall of the city on January caused a mass exodus of civilians who fled to the French border The resistance of Barcelona to Franco s coup d tat was to have lasting effects after the defeat of the Republican government The autonomous institutions of Catalonia were abolished and the use of the Catalan language in public life was suppressed Barcelona remained the second largest city in Spain at the heart of a region which was relatively industrialized and prosperous despite the devastation of the civil war The result was a large scale immigration from poorer regions of Spain particularly Andalusia Murcia and Galicia which in turn led to rapid urbanization br br br Late twentieth century br In Barcelona hosted the Summer Olympics The after effects of this are credited with driving major changes in what had up until then been a largely industrial city As part of the preparation for the games industrial buildings along the sea front were demolished and km mi of beach were created New construction increased the road capacity of the city by the sewage handling capacity by and the amount of new green areas and beaches by Between and the number of hotel rooms in the city doubled Perhaps more importantly the outside perception of the city was changed making by Barcelona the th most popular city destination in the world and the th amongst European cities br br br Recent history br br The death of Franco in brought on a period of democratization throughout Spain Pressure for change was particularly strong in Barcelona which considered that it had been punished during nearly forty years of Francoism for its support of the Republican government Massive but peaceful demonstrations on September assembled over a million people in the streets of Barcelona to call for the restoration of Catalan autonomy It was granted less than a month later br The development of Barcelona was promoted by two events in Spanish accession to the European Community and particularly Barcelona s designation as host city of the Summer Olympics The process of urban regeneration has been rapid and accompanied by a greatly increased international reputation of the city as a tourist destination The increased cost of housing has led to a slight decline in the population over the last two decades of the th century as many families move out into the suburbs This decline has been reversed since as a new wave of immigration particularly from Latin America and from Morocco has gathered pace br In an ETA car bombing at Hipercor killed people On August a van was driven into pedestrians on La Rambla killing and injuring at least one of whom later died Other attacks took place elsewhere in Catalonia The Prime Minister of Spain Mariano Rajoy called the attack in Barcelona a jihadist attack Amaq News Agency attributed indirect responsibility for the attack to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ISIL During the s Barcelona became the focus city for the ongoing Catalan independence movement its consequent standoff between the regional and national government and later protests br In July Barcelona was announced as the UNESCO UIA World Capital of Architecture for the term This means it will be the hub for discussion around global challenges including culture heritage urban planning and architecture In addition to being the capital through it will also host the UIA World Congress of Architects for that year The honour is befitting of Barcelona as its history is peppered with architectural achievement and various iconic styles and influences From its ancient Roman roots to the Gothic and Modernisme movements Barcelona has thrived through the way it ties together architecture and culture br br br Geography br br br Location br br Barcelona is located on
