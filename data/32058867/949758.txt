GnuTLS the GNU Transport Layer Security Library is a free software implementation of the TLS SSL and DTLS protocols It offers an application programming interface API for applications to enable secure communication over the network transport layer as well as interfaces to access X PKCS OpenPGP and other structures br br br Features br GnuTLS consists of a library that allows client applications to start secure sessions using the available protocols br It also provides command line tools including an X certificate manager a test client and server and random key and password generators br GnuTLS has the following features br br TLS TLS TLS TLS and SSL protocols br Datagram TLS DTLS and DTLS protocols br TLS SRP Secure remote password protocol SRP for TLS authentication br TLS PSK Pre shared key PSK for TLS authentication br X and OpenPGP certificate handling br CPU assisted cryptography and cryptographic accelerator support dev crypto VIA PadLock and AES NI instruction sets br Support for smart cards and for hardware security modules br Storage of cryptographic keys in the system s Trusted Platform Module TPM br br br History br br br Origin br GnuTLS was initially created around March to November by Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos to allow applications of the GNU Project to use secure protocols such as TLS Although OpenSSL already existed OpenSSL s license is not compatible with the GPL thus software under the GPL such as GNU software could not use OpenSSL without making a GPL linking exception br br br License br The GnuTLS library was licensed originally under the GNU Lesser General Public License v while included applications to use the GNU General Public License br In August the library was updated to the LGPLv After it was noticed that there were new license compatibility problems introduced especially with other free software with the license change after discussions the license was downgraded again to LGPLv in March br br br Split from GNU br GnuTLS was created for the GNU Project but in December its maintainer Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos dissociated the project from GNU after policy disputes with the Free Software Foundation Richard Stallman opposed this move and suggested forking the project instead Soon afterward developer Paolo Bonzini ended his maintainership of GNU Sed and Grep expressing concerns similar to those of GnuTLS maintainer Mavrogiannopoulos br br br Deployment br br Software packages using GnuTLS include d br br GNOME br CenterIM br Exim br WeeChat br Mutt br Wireshark br slrn br Lynx br CUPS br gnoMint br GNU Emacs br Synology DiskStation Manager br OpenConnect br br br See also br br Comparison of TLS implementations br wolfSSL previously CyaSSL br mbed TLS previously PolarSSL br List of free and open source software packages br Network Security Services br br br br br br External links br Official website br GNU Friends An Interview with GNU TLS developer Nikos Mavroyanopoulos a interview br Fellowship interview with Simon Josefsson a interview
