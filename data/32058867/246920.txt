Visa Inc is an American multinational payment card services corporation headquartered in San Francisco California It facilitates electronic funds transfers throughout the world most commonly through Visa branded credit cards debit cards and prepaid cards Visa is one of the world s most valuable companies br Visa does not issue cards extend credit or set rates and fees for consumers rather Visa provides financial institutions with Visa branded payment products that they then use to offer credit debit prepaid and cash access programs to their customers In the Nilson Report a publication that tracks the credit card industry found that Visa s global network known as VisaNet processed billion transactions during with a total volume of US trillion br Visa was founded in by Bank of America BofA as the BankAmericard credit card program In response to competitor Master Charge now Mastercard BofA began to license the BankAmericard program to other financial institutions in By BofA gave up direct control of the BankAmericard program forming a cooperative with the other various BankAmericard issuer banks to take over its management It was then renamed Visa in br Nearly all Visa transactions worldwide are processed through the company s directly operated VisaNet at one of four secure data centers located in Ashburn Virginia Highlands Ranch Colorado London England and Singapore These facilities are heavily secured against natural disasters crime and terrorism can operate independently of each other and from external utilities if necessary and can handle up to simultaneous transactions and up to billion computations every second br Visa is the world s second largest card payment organization debit and credit cards combined after being surpassed by China UnionPay in based on annual value of card payments transacted and number of issued cards However because UnionPay s size is based primarily on the size of its domestic market in China Visa is still considered the dominant bankcard company in the rest of the world where it commands a market share of total card payments br br br History br br On September Bank of America BofA officially launched its BankAmericard credit card program in Fresno California In the weeks leading up to the launch of BankAmericard BofA had saturated Fresno mailboxes with an initial mass mailing or drop as they came to be called of unsolicited credit cards BankAmericard was the brainchild of BofA s in house product development think tank the Customer Services Research Group and its leader Joseph P Williams Williams convinced senior BofA executives in to let him pursue what became the world s first successful mass mailing of unsolicited credit cards actual working cards not mere applications to a large population br Williams pioneering accomplishment was that he brought about the successful implementation of the all purpose credit card in the sense that his project was not canceled outright not in coming up with the idea By the mid s the typical middle class American already maintained revolving credit accounts with several different merchants which was clearly inefficient and inconvenient due to the need to carry so many cards and pay so many separate bills each month The need for a unified financial instrument was already evident to the American financial services industry but no one could figure out how to do it There were already charge cards like Diners Club which had to be paid in full at the end of each billing cycle and by the mid s there had been at least a dozen attempts to create an all purpose credit card However these prior attempts had been carried out by small banks which lacked the resources to make them work Williams and his team studied these failures carefully and believed they could avoid replicating those banks mistakes they also studied existing revolving credit operations at Sears and Mobil Oil to learn why they were successful Fresno was selected for its population of big enough to make a credit card work small enough to control initial startup cost BofA s market share of that population and relative isolation to control public relations damage in case the project failed According to Williams Florsheim Shoes was the first major retail chain which agreed to accept BankAmericard at its stores br br The test at first went smoothly but then BofA panicked when it confirmed rumors that another bank was about to initiate its own drop in San Francisco BofA s home market By March drops began in San Francisco and Sacramento by June BofA was dropping cards in Los Angeles by October the entire state of California had been saturated with over million credit cards and BankAmericard was being accepted by merchants However the program was riddled with problems as Williams who had never worked in a bank s loan department had been too earnest and trusting in his belief in the basic goodness of the bank s customers and he resigned in December Twenty two percent of accounts were delinquent not the expected and police departments around the state were confronted by numerous incidents of the brand new crime of credit card fraud Both politicians and journalists joined the general uproar against Bank of America and its newfangled credit card especially when it was pointed out that the cardholder agreement held customers liable for all charges even those resulting from fraud BofA officially lost over million on the launch of BankAmericard but when the full cost of advertising and overhead was included the bank s actual loss was probably around million br However after Williams and some of his closest associates left BofA management realized that BankAmericard was salvageable They conducted a massive effort to clean up after Williams imposed proper financial controls published an open letter to million households across the state apologizing for the credit card fraud and other issues their card raised and eventually were able to make the new financial instrument work By May the BankAmericard program became profitable for the first time At the time BofA deliberately kept this information secret and allowed then widespread negative impressions to linger in order to ward off competition This strategy worked until when BankAmericard s profitability had become far too big to hide br The original goal of BofA was to offer the BankAmericard product across California but in BofA began to sign licensing agreements with a group of banks outside of California in response to a new competitor Master Charge now MasterCard which had been created by an alliance of several regional bankcard associations to compete against BankAmericard BofA itself like all other U S banks at the time could not expand directly into other states due to federal restrictions not repealed until Over the following years various banks licensed the card system from Bank of America thus forming a network of banks backing the BankAmericard system across the United States The drops of unsolicited credit cards continued unabated thanks to BofA and its licensees and competitors until they were outlawed in but not before over million credit cards had been distributed into the American population br During the late s BofA also licensed the BankAmericard program to banks in several other countries which began issuing cards with localized brand names For example br br In Canada an alliance of banks including Toronto Dominion Bank Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Royal Bank of Canada Banque Canadienne Nationale and Bank of Nova Scotia issued credit cards under the Chargex name from to br In France it was known as Carte Bleue Blue Card The logo still appears on many French issued Visa cards today br In Japan The Sumitomo Bank issued BankAmericards through the Sumitomo Credit Service br In the UK the only BankAmericard issuer for some years was Barclaycard The branding still exists today but is used not only on Visa cards issued by Barclays but on its MasterCard and American Express cards as well br In Spain until the only issuer was Banco de Bilbao br In a manager at the National Bank of Commerce later Rainier Bancorp Dee Hock was asked to supervise that bank s launch of its own licensed version of BankAmericard in the Pacific Northwest market Although Bank of America had cultivated the public image that BankAmericard s troubled startup issues were now safely in the past Hock realized that the BankAmericard licensee program itself was in terrible disarray because it had developed and grown very rapidly in an ad hoc fashion For example interchange transaction issues between banks were becoming a very serious problem which had not been seen before when Bank of America was the sole issuer of BankAmericards Hock suggested to other licensees that they form a committee to investigate and analyze the various problems with the licensee program they promptly made him the chair of that committee br After lengthy negotiations the committee led by Hock was able to persuade Bank of America that a bright future lay ahead for BankAmericard outside Bank of America In June Bank of America gave up control of the BankAmericard program The various BankAmericard issuer banks took control of the program creating National BankAmericard Inc NBI an independent Delaware corporation which would be in charge of managing promoting and developing the BankAmericard system within the United States In other words BankAmericard was transformed from a franchising system into a jointly controlled consortium or alliance like its competitor Master Charge Hock became NBI s first president and CEO br However Bank of America retained the right to directly license BankAmericard to banks outside the United States and continued to issue and support such licenses By licenses had been granted in countries The international licensees soon encountered a variety of problems with their licensing programs and they hired Hock as a consultant to help them restructure their relationship with BofA as he had done for the domestic licensees As a result in the International Bankcard Company IBANCO a multinational member corporation was founded in order to manage the international BankAmericard program br br In the directors of IBANCO determined that bringing the various international networks together into a single network with a single name internationally would be in the best interests of the corporation however in many countries there was still great reluctance to issue a card associated with Bank of America even though the association was entirely nominal in nature For this reason in BankAmericard Barclaycard Carte Bleue Chargex Sumitomo Card and all other licensees united under the new name Visa which retained the distinctive blue white and gold flag NBI became Visa USA and IBANCO became Visa International br The term Visa was conceived by the company s founder Dee Hock He believed that the word was instantly recognizable in many languages in many countries and that it also denoted universal acceptance br The announcement of the transition came on December with VISA cards to replace expiring BankAmericard cards starting on March initially with both the BankAmericard name and the VISA name on the same card and the various Bank of America issued cards worldwide being phased out by the end of October br In October Bank of America announced it was resurrecting the BankAmericard brand name as the BankAmericard Rewards Visa br Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in March Visa announced that it would suspend all business operations in Russia br br br Corporate structure br Prior to October Visa comprised four non stock separately incorporated companies that employed people worldwide the worldwide parent entity Visa International Service Association Visa Visa USA Inc Visa Canada Association and Visa Europe Ltd The latter three separately incorporated regions had the status of group members of Visa International Service Association br The unincorporated regions Visa Latin America LAC Visa Asia Pacific and Visa Central and Eastern Europe Middle East and Africa CEMEA were divisions within Visa br br br Billing and finance charge methods br Initially signed copies of sales drafts were included in each customer s monthly billing statement for verification purposes an industry practice known as country club billing By the late s however billing statements no longer contained these enclosures but rather a summary statement showing posting date purchase date reference number merchant name and the dollar amount of each purchase At the same time many issuers particularly Bank of America were in the process of changing their methods of finance charge calculation Initially a previous balance method was used calculation of finance charge on the unpaid balance shown on the prior month s statement Later it was decided to use average daily balance which resulted in increased revenue for the issuers by calculating the number of days each purchase was included on the prior month s statement Several years later new average daily balance in which transactions from previous and current billing cycles were used in the calculation was introduced By the early s many issuers introduced the concept of the annual fee as yet another revenue enhancer br br br IPO and restructuring br On October Visa announced that some of its businesses would be merged and become a publicly traded company Visa Inc br Under the IPO restructuring Visa Canada Visa International and Visa USA were merged into the new public company Visa s Western Europe operation became a separate company owned by its member banks who will also have a minority stake in Visa Inc In total more than investment banks participated in the deal in several capacities most notably as underwriters br On October Visa completed its corporate restructuring with the formation of Visa Inc The new company was the first step towards Visa s IPO The second step came on November when the new Visa Inc submitted its billion IPO filing with the U S

share count to million and bringing the total proceeds to US billion Visa now trades under the ticker symbol V on the New York Stock Exchange br br br Visa Europe br Visa Europe Ltd was a membership association and cooperative of over European banks and other payment service providers that operated Visa branded products and services within Europe Visa Europe was a company entirely separate from Visa Inc having gained independence of Visa International Service Association in October when Visa Inc became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange Visa Inc announced the plan to acquire Visa Europe on November creating a single global company On April the agreement was amended in response to the feedback of European Commission The acquisition of Visa Europe was completed on June br br br Failed acquisition of Plaid br On January Plaid announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by Visa for billion The deal was double the company s most recent Series C round valuation of billion and was expected to close in the next months subject to regulatory review and closing conditions According to the deal Visa would pay billion in cash and approximately million of retention equity and deferred equity according to a presentation deck prepared by Visa br On November the United States Department of Justice filed a lawsuit seeking to block

WikiLeaks and its fundraising body the Sunshine Press found no proof of any wrongdoing Salon reported in January that Visa Europe would continue blocking donations to the secret spilling site until it completes its own investigation br The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay stated that Visa may be violating WikiLeaks right to freedom of expression by withdrawing their services br In July the Reykjav k District Court in Iceland decided that Valitor the Icelandic partner of Visa and MasterCard was violating the law when it prevented donations to the site by credit card It was ruled that the donations be allowed to return to the site within days or they would be fined in the amount of US per day br br br Litigation and regulatory actions br br br Anti competitive conduct in Australia br In the Australian Federal Court ordered Visa to pay a pecuniary penalty of million including legal fees for engaging in anti competitive conduct against dynamic currency conversion operators in proceedings brought by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission br br br Antitrust lawsuit by ATM operators br In MasterCard and Visa were sued in a class action by ATM operators claiming the credit card networks rules effectively fix ATM access fees The suit claimed that this is a restraint on trade in violation of US federal law The lawsuit was filed by the National ATM Council and independent operators of automated teller machines More specifically it is alleged that MasterCard s and Visa s network rules prohibit ATM operators from offering lower prices for transactions over PIN debit networks that are not affiliated with Visa or MasterCard The suit says that this price fixing artificially raises the price that consumers pay using ATMs limits the revenue that ATM operators earn and violates the Sherman Act s prohibition against unreasonable restraints of trade br Johnathan Rubin an attorney for the plaintiffs said Visa and MasterCard are the ringleaders organizers and enforcers of a conspiracy among U S banks to fix the price of ATM access fees in order to keep the competition at bay br In a US district court denied the ATM operators request to stop Visa from enforcing the ATM fees br br br Debit card swipe fees br In a class of U S merchants including Walmart brought an antitrust lawsuit against Visa and MasterCard over their

reported to have been the larger br br br U S Justice Department actions br In the Department of Justice sued Visa over rules prohibiting its issuing banks from doing business with American Express and Discover The Department of Justice won its case at trial in and the verdict was upheld on appeal American Express and Discover filed suit as well br In October Visa and MasterCard reached a settlement with the U S Justice Department in another antitrust case The companies agreed to allow merchants displaying their logos to decline certain types of cards because interchange fees differ or to offer consumers discounts for using cheaper cards br br br Antitrust issues in Europe br In the European Commission exempted Visa s multilateral interchange fees from Article of the EC Treaty that prohibits anti competitive arrangements However this exemption expired on December In the United Kingdom Mastercard has reduced its interchange fees while it is under investigation by the Office of Fair Trading br In January the European Commission issued the results of a two year inquiry into the retail banking sector The report focuses on payment cards and interchange fees Upon publishing the report Commissioner Neelie Kroes said the present level of interchange fees in many of the schemes we have examined does not seem justified The report called for further study of the issue br On March the European Commission opened an investigation into Visa s multilateral interchange fees for cross border transactions within the EEA as well as into the Honor All Cards rule under which merchants are required to accept all valid Visa branded cards br The antitrust authorities of EU member states other than the United Kingdom also investigated Mastercard s and Visa s interchange fees For example on January the Polish Office of Competition and Consumer Protection fined twenty banks a total of PLN million about million for jointly setting Mastercard s and Visa s interchange fees br In December Visa reached a settlement with the European Union in yet another antitrust case promising to reduce debit card payments to percent of a purchase A senior official from the European Central Bank called for a break up of the Visa Mastercard duopoly by creation of a new European debit card for use in the Single Euro Payments Area SEPA After Visa s blocking of payments to WikiLeaks members

Visa and Mastercard in the European payment system br br br Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation br br On November a federal judge entered an order granting preliminary approval to a proposed settlement to a class action lawsuit filed in by merchants and trade associations against Mastercard and Visa The suit was filed due to alleged price fixing practices employed by Mastercard and Visa About one quarter of the named class plaintiffs have decided to opt out of the settlement Opponents object to provisions that would bar future lawsuits and even prevent merchants from opting out of significant portions of the proposed settlement br Plaintiffs allege that Visa and Mastercard fixed interchange fees also known as swipe fees that are charged to merchants for the privilege of accepting payment cards In their complaint the plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unfairly interfere with merchants from encouraging customers to use less expensive forms of payment such as lower cost cards cash and checks br A settlement of US billion has been reached and a court is scheduled to approve or deny the agreement on November br br br High swipe fees in Poland br Visa s interchange fee of in Poland started discussion about the need for increased government regulation surrounding the topic The high fees encouraged merchants to create new payment systems which avoid using Visa as a middleman For example mobile applications were created by major banks proprietary payment systems were created by franchises and public transport authorities created ticketing systems br br br Confrontation with Walmart over high fees br In June the Wall Street Journal reported that Walmart threatened to stop accepting Visa cards in Canada Visa objected saying that consumers should not be dragged into a dispute between the companies In January Walmart Canada and Visa reached a deal to allow the continued acceptance of Visa br br br Dispute

October Kroger has settled their dispute with Visa and is now accepting the payment method br br br Antitrust investigation over debit card practices br In March the United States Justice Department announced its investigation with Visa to discover if the company is engaging in anticompetitive practices in the debit card market The main question at hand is whether or not Visa is limiting merchants ability to route debit card transactions over card networks that are often less expensive focusing more so on online debit card transactions The probe highlights the role of network fees which are invisible to consumers and place pressure on merchants who mitigate the fees by raising prices of goods for customers The probe was confirmed through a regulatory filing on March stating they will be cooperating with the Justice Department Visa s shares fell more than following the announcement br br br Corporate affairs br br br Headquarters br br Visa was traditionally headquartered

discriminatory Other rules govern what creates an enforceable proof of authorization by the cardholder br The rules prohibit merchants from imposing a minimum or maximum purchase amount in order to

card branding on Visa Debit and Visa Electron although not as the company s logotype br br br Card design br In most Visa cards around the world began to feature a hologram of a dove on its face generally under the last four digits of the Visa number This was implemented as a security feature true holograms would appear three dimensional and the image would change as the card was turned At the same time the Visa logo which had previously covered the whole card face was reduced in size to a strip on the card s right incorporating the hologram This allowed issuing banks to customize the appearance of the card Similar changes were implemented with MasterCard cards Today cards may be co branded with various merchants airlines etc and marketed as reward cards br On older Visa cards holding the face of the card under an ultraviolet light will reveal the dove picture dubbed the Ultra Sensitive Dove as an additional security test On newer Visa cards the UV dove is replaced by a small V over the Visa logo br Beginning in the Visa standard was changed to allow for the hologram to be placed on the back of the card or to be replaced with a holographic magnetic stripe HoloMag The
