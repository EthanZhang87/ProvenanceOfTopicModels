Imation Brocade Xyratex and Hutchinson Technology According to a IDC report NetApp ranked second in the network storage industry Big s list behind EMC Dell and ahead of IBM HP and Hitachi br br br Products br br br Hardware Appliances br br NetApp s FAS Fabric Attached Storage AFF All Flash FAS and ASA All SAN Array storage systems are the company s flagship products Such products are made up of storage controllers and one or more enclosures of hard disks known as shelves br In the early s NetApp s storage systems initially offered NFS and SMB protocols based on standard local area networks LANs whereas block storage consolidation required storage area networks SANs implemented with the Fibre Channel FC protocol br In in an attempt to increase market share NetApp added block storage access as well supporting the Fibre Channel and iSCSI protocols As of NetApp systems support Fibre Channel iSCSI Fibre Channel over Ethernet FCoE and the FC NVMe protocol br br br ONTAP br br Many of NetApp s products use the company s proprietary ONTAP data management operating system under continuous development since which includes code from Berkeley Net BSD Unix Spinnaker Networks technology and other operating systems There are three ONTAP platforms FAS AFF systems software on commodity servers ONTAP Select as virtual machine or in the cloud Cloud Volumes ONTAP All ONTAP systems use WAFL file systems which provide basis for snapshots and other snapshot based and data protection technologies Key IP from ONTAP is also used in NetApp Astra a newer data management as a service system built for Kubernetes br br br Cloud Backup br Previously known as Riverbed SteelStor before its acquisition by NetApp this product was later renamed to AltaVault and then to Cloud Backup Cloud Backup was initially available in three forms as a hardware appliance virtual appliance and cloud appliance Later NetApp announced the end of sale for hardware and virtual appliances Data placed on NAS share on Cloud Backup deduplicated compressed encrypted and transferred to object storage systems like Amazon S Azure Blob Storage or StorageGRID thus Cloud Backup appears as a transparent gateway for archiving data to a private or public cloud br br br NetApp HCI br br NetApp Hyper converged infrastructure HCI or sometimes referred by NetApp as Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure

password and storage nodes br br br U HCI Chassis with four half width blade servers br br Each storage node drive set consists of six SSD drives directly connected to a dedicated storage node and installed in front of the blade chassis Each storage and compute blade nodes have Gigabit Ethernet ports which could be used as Gbit s ports as well as dedicated Gb ports for management purposes Network switches were not included and in NetApp HCI with Element software release NetApp announced H Series Switch as part of HCI so all hardware components must be bought from NetApp ONTAP Select available as SDS on NetApp HCI for customers interested in NAS protocols The self service portal allows automating common provisioning and management tasks br br br SolidFire br br SolidFire storage system uses an OS called NetApp Element Software formally SolidFire Element OS based on Linux and designed for SSDs and scale out architecture with the ability to expand up to nodes and provide access to data through SAN protocols iSCSI natively and Fiber Channel with two gateway nodes Element OS provides a REST based API for storage automation configuration management and consumption Element SW version will not support FC SolidFire uses iSCSI login redirection to distribute reads and writes across the cluster using helix algorithm Each node has pre installed SSD drives which must all be of the same type and capacity Each SolidFire cluster can have a mix of different node models and generations br br br StorageGRID br br StorageGRID is a software defined storage system which provides access to data via object IP based protocols like S and OpenStack Swift It is available in the form of hardware or as software br br br E Series br br Previously known as LSI Engenio RDAC after NetApp acquisition the product renamed to NetApp E Series It is a general purpose enterprise storage system with two controllers for SAN protocols such as Fibre Channel iSCSI SAS and InfiniBand includes SRP iSER and NVMe over Fabrics protocol NetApp E Series platform uses proprietary OS SANtricity and proprietary RAID called Dynamic Disk Pool DDP alongside traditional RAIDs like RAID RAID RAID etc In DDP pool each D Stripe works similar to traditional RAID and RAID but on block level instead of entire disk level therefore have no dedicated parity drives DDP compare to traditional RAID groups restores data from lost disk drive to multiple drives which provide a few times faster reconstruction time while traditional RAIDs restores lost disk drive to a dedicated parity drive Starting with SANtricity E Series systems EF and E support NVMe over Ethernet RoCEv with Gbit s Ethernet ports and NVMe over InfiniBand Starting with EF systems are end to end NVMe and capable of NVMe FC in addition to NVMe RoCE and NVMe InfiniBand Sync and async mirroring are supported with SANtricity SANtricity Unified Manager is a web based manager that supports up to EF E Series arrays and supports LDAP RBAC CA and SSL for authorization and authentication In August NetApp announced E with support for NVMe IB NVMe RoCE NVMe FC protocols up to GBps of bandwidth and full function embedded REST API br br br
