Threema is a paid cross platform encrypted instant messaging app developed by Threema GmbH in Switzerland and launched in The service operates on a decentralized architecture and offers end to end encryption Users can make voice and video calls send photos files and voice notes share locations and make groups Unlike many other popular secure messaging apps Threema does not require phone numbers or email addresses for registration only a one time purchase that can be paid via an app store or anonymously with Bitcoin or cash br Threema is available on iOS and Android and has clients for Windows macOS Linux and HarmonyOS and can be accessed via web browser but requires a mobile app to function br br br Features br The service claims to be based on the privacy by design principles by not requiring a phone number or other personally identifiable information This helps anonymize the users to a degree br Threema uses a user ID created after the initial app launch by a random generator instead of requiring a linked email address or phone number to send messages It is possible to find other users by phone number or email address if the user allows the app to synchronize their address book Linking a phone number or email address to a Threema ID is optional Hence the service can be used anonymously Users can verify the identity of their Threema contacts by scanning their QR code when they meet physically The QR code contains the public key of the user which is cryptographically tied to the ID and will not change during the lifetime of the identity Using this strong authentication feature users can make sure they have the correct public key from their chat partners which provides additional security against a Man in the middle attack Threema knows three levels of authentication trust levels of the contact s identity The verification level of each contact is displayed in the Threema application as dots next to the corresponding contact br In addition to text messaging users can make voice and video calls send multimedia locations voice messages and files A web app version Threema Web can be used on desktop devices but only as long as the phone with the Threema installation of the user is online There is a beta for iOS users where it is possible to take the phone offline and still use the desktop app br In addition to one on one chats Threema offers group chats up to people Users can make voice and video calls send text and voice messages multimedia locations and files of any type up to MB per file It is also possible to create polls in personal or group chats br br br Software br Threema is developed by the Swiss company Threema GmbH The servers are in Switzerland and the development is based in Pf ffikon SZ As of May Threema had million users and the business version Threema Work was used by million users across companies and organizations br At the end of July Threema introduced the ability for companies to host the messenger on their own server primarily intended for companies with significantly high privacy concerns br br br Clients br With Threema Web a client for web browsers Threema can be used from other devices like desktop computers though only as long as the original device is online br Threema optionally supports Android Wear smartwatch and Android Auto Threema launched support for end to end encrypted video calls on August The calls are person to person with group calls unavailable br The application does not allow the self deletion of messages after a period defined by the interlocutors br The application does prevent screenshots in conversations when configured to do so br br br Architecture br The entire communication via Threema is end to end encrypted During the initial setup the application generates a key pair and sends the public key to the server while keeping the private key on the user s device The application then encrypts all messages and files that are sent to other Threema users with their respective public keys Once a message is delivered successfully it is immediately deleted from the servers br The encryption process used by Threema is based on the open source library NaCl library Threema uses asymmetric ECC based encryption with bit strength Threema offers a Validation Logging feature that makes it possible to confirm that messages are end to end encrypted using the NaCl Networking and Cryptography library In August Threema was subjected to an external security audit Researchers from cnlab confirmed that Threema allows secure end to end encryption and claimed that they were unable to identify any weaknesses in the implementation Cnlab researchers also confirmed that Threema provides anonymity to its users and handles contacts and other user data as advertised br br br History br Threema was founded in December by Manuel Kasper The company was initially called Kasper Systems GmbH Martin Blatter and Silvan Engeler were later recruited to develop an Android application that was released in early br In Summer the Snowden leaks helped create an interest in Threema boosting the user numbers to the hundreds of thousands When Facebook took over WhatsApp in February Threema got new users doubling its userbase in hours Around percent of those new users came from Germany By March Threema had million users br In Spring operations were transferred to the newly created Threema GmbH br In December Apple listed Threema as the most sold app of at the German App Store br In Threema expanded with video calls plans to open source its client side apps and introduce reproducible builds of them as well as introduce Threema Education a variation of Threema intended for education institutions br During the second week of Threema saw a quadrupling of daily downloads spurred on by controversial privacy changes in the WhatsApp messaging service A spokesperson for the company also confirmed that Threema had risen to the top of the charts for paid applications in Germany Switzerland and Austria This trend continued into the third week of the year with the head of Marketing Sales confirming that downloads had increased to ten times the regular amount leading to hundreds of thousands of new users each day br In October researchers from ETH Zurich reported multiple vulnerabilities affecting Threema s security against network server and client based attacks A new release fixing these issues was released in November and the vulnerabilities were announced publicly in January br br br Related products br Threema Work On May Threema Work a corporate version of Threema was released Threema Work offers extended administration and deployment capabilities Threema Work is based on a yearly subscription model br Threema Gateway On March Threema released a gateway for companies Similar to an SMS gateway businesses can use it to send messages to their users who have Threema installed The code for the Threema Gateway SDK is open for developers and available on GitHub br Threema Broadcast On August Threema released Threema Broadcast a tool for top down communication Similar to emails in electronic newsletters Threema messages can be sent to any number of feed subscribers and the Threema Broadcast allows to create chatbots br Threema Education On September Threema released Threema Education a version of its messenger designed for education institutions The app integrates Threema Broadcast and requires a one time payment for each device used It s intended for use by teachers students and parents br Threema OnPrem On July Threema released Threema OnPrem a version of the messenger which could be hosted on a company s own servers for maximum security purposes br br br Privacy br Since Threema s servers are in Switzerland they are subject to the Swiss federal law on data protection The data center is ISO IEC certified Linking a phone number and or email address to a Threema ID is optional when doing so only checksum values SHA HMAC with a static key of the email address and or phone number are sent to the server Due to the small number of possible digit combinations of a telephone number the phone number associated with a checksum could be determined by brute force The transmitted data is TLS secured The address book data is kept only in the volatile memory of the server and is deleted immediately after synchronizing contacts If a user chooses to link a phone number or email address with their Threema ID they can remove the phone number or email address at any time Should a user ever lose their device and their private key they can revoke their Threema ID if a revocation password for that ID has been set br Groups are solely managed on users devices and group messages are sent to each recipient as an individual message encrypted with the respective public key Thus group compositions are not directly exposed to the server br Data including media files stored on the users devices is encrypted with AES On Android it can be additionally protected by a passphrase br Since Threema GmbH publishes a transparency report where public authority inquiries are disclosed br On March Threema was listed in the Register of organizers of information dissemination in the Internet operated by the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications Information Technology and Mass Media of the Russian Federation br In a response a Threema spokesperson publicly stated We operate under Swiss law and are neither allowed nor willing to provide any information about our users to foreign authorities br On April Threema won a significant case at the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland against the Swiss Federal Department of Police and Justice who wished to classify the company as a telecommunications provider Had they lost the case Threema would have had a legal requirement to identify users and send information about their users to law enforcement br Starting January Swiss Armed Forces suggested that the troops should use Threema instead of WhatsApp Telegram and Signal citing Threema being Swiss based without servers in the United States and thus not subject to the CLOUD Act also promising that soldiers would be reimbursed for the cost br br br Reception br In February German consumer organisation Stiftung Warentest evaluated several data protection aspects of Threema WhatsApp Telegram BlackBerry Messenger and Line It considered the security of the data transmission between clients the services terms of use the transparency of the service providers the availability of the source code and the apps overall availability Threema was the only app rated as non critical unkritisch in relation to data and privacy protection but lost marks due to its closed source nature though this has changed for its frontend clients since the end of br Along with Cryptocat and Surespot Threema was ranked first in a study evaluating the security and usability of instant messaging encryption software conducted by the German PSW Group in June br As of November Threema had a score of out of points on the now withdrawn and outdated Electronic Frontier Foundation s Secure Messaging Scorecard It received points for having communications encrypted in transit having communications encrypted with keys the provider doesn t have access to i e having end to end encryption making it possible for users to independently verify their correspondent s identities having past communications secure if the keys are stolen i e implementing forward secrecy having its security design well documented and having completed an independent security audit It lost a point because its source code was not open to independent review i e it was not open source though in late its frontend apps were open sourced leaving only its server component proprietary br br br See also br Comparison of instant messaging clients br br br br br br External links br Official website br
