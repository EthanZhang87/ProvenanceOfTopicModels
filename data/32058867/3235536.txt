Google Translate is a multilingual neural machine translation service developed by Google to translate text documents and websites from one language into another It offers a website interface a mobile app for Android and iOS as well as an API that helps developers build browser extensions and software applications As of July Google Translate supports languages at various levels It claimed over million total users as of April with more than billion words translated daily after the company stated in May that it served over million people daily br Launched in April as a statistical machine translation service it originally used United Nations and European Parliament documents and transcripts to gather linguistic data Rather than translating languages directly it first translated text to English and then pivoted to the target language in most of the language combinations it posited in its grid with a few exceptions including Catalan Spanish During a translation it looked for patterns in millions of documents to help decide which words to choose and how to arrange them in the target language In recent years it has used a deep learning model to power its translations Its accuracy which has been criticized on several occasions has been measured to vary greatly across languages In November Google announced that Google Translate would switch to a neural machine translation engine Google Neural Machine Translation GNMT which translated whole sentences at a time rather than just piece by piece It uses this broader context to help it figure out the most relevant translation which it then rearranges and adjusts to be more like a human speaking with proper grammar br br br History br Google Translate is a web based free to use translation service developed by Google in April It translates multiple forms of texts and media such as words phrases and webpages br Originally Google Translate was released as a statistical machine translation SMT service The input text had to be translated into English first before being translated into the selected language Since SMT uses predictive algorithms to translate text it had poor grammatical accuracy Despite this Google initially did not hire experts to resolve this limitation due to the ever evolving nature of language br In January Google introduced an Android app and iOS version in February to serve as a portable personal interpreter As of February it was integrated into browsers such as Chrome and was able to pronounce the translated text automatically recognize words in a picture and spot unfamiliar text and languages br In May Google acquired Word Lens to improve the quality of visual and voice translation It is able to scan text or a picture using the device and have it translated instantly Moreover the system automatically identifies foreign languages and translates speech without requiring individuals to tap the microphone button whenever speech translation is needed br In November Google transitioned its translating method to a system called neural machine translation It uses deep learning techniques to translate whole sentences at a time which has been measured to be more accurate between English and French German Spanish and Chinese No measurement results have been provided by Google researchers for GNMT from English to other languages other languages to English or between language pairs that do not include English As of it translates more than billion words a day br In Google Translate was used during a court hearing when court officials at Teesside Magistrates Court failed to book an interpreter for the Chinese defendant br At the end of September Google Translate was discontinued in mainland China which Google said was due to low usage br In a record of languages including Cantonese Tok Pisin and some regional languages in Russia including Bashkir Chechen Ossetian and Crimean Tatar were added br br br Functions br Google Translate can translate multiple forms of text and media which includes text speech and text within still or moving images Specifically its functions include br br Written Words Translation a function that translates written words or text to a foreign language br Website Translation a function that translates a whole webpage to selected languages br Document Translation a function that translates a document uploaded by the users to selected languages The documents should be in the form of doc docx odf pdf ppt pptx ps rtf txt xls xlsx br Speech Translation a function that instantly translates spoken language into the selected foreign language br Mobile App Translation in Google introduced its new Google Translate feature called Tap to Translate which made instant translation accessible inside any app without exiting or switching it br Image Translation a function that identifies text in a picture taken by the users and translates text on the screen instantly by images br Handwritten Translation a function that translates language that are handwritten on the phone screen or drawn on a virtual keyboard without the support of a keyboard br Bilingual Conversation Translation a function that translates conversations in multiple languages br Transcription a function that transcribes speech in different languages br For most of its features Google Translate provides the pronunciation dictionary and listening to translation Additionally Google Translate has introduced its own Translate app so translation is available with a mobile phone in offline mode br br br Features br br br Web interface br Google Translate produces approximations across languages of multiple forms of text and media including text speech websites or text on display in still or live video images For some languages Google Translate can synthesize speech from text and in certain pairs it is possible to highlight specific corresponding words and phrases between the source and target text Results are sometimes shown with dictional information below the translation box but it is not a dictionary and has been shown to invent translations in all languages for words it does not recognize If Detect language is selected text in an unknown language can be automatically identified In the web interface users can suggest alternate translations such as for technical terms or correct mistakes These suggestions may be included in future updates to the translation process If a user enters a URL in the source text Google Translate will produce a hyperlink to a machine translation of the website Users can save translation proposals in a phrasebook for later use and a shareable URL is generated for each translation For some languages text can be entered via an on screen keyboard whether through handwriting recognition or speech recognition It is possible to enter searches in a source language that are first translated to a destination language allowing one to browse and interpret results from the selected destination language in the source language br Texts written in the Arabic Cyrillic Devanagari and Greek scripts can be automatically transliterated from their phonetic equivalents written in the Latin alphabet The browser version of Google Translate provides the option to show phonetic equivalents of text translated from Japanese to English The same option is not available on the paid API version br br Many of the more popular languages have a text to speech audio function that is able to read back a text in that language up to several hundred words or so In the case of pluricentric languages the accent depends on the region for English in the Americas most of the Asia Pacific and West Asia the audio uses a female General American accent whereas in Europe Hong Kong Malaysia Singapore Guyana and all other parts of the world a female British Received Pronunciation accent is used except for a special General Australian accent used in Australia New Zealand and Norfolk Island and an Indian English accent used in India for Spanish in the Americas a Latin American accent is used while in other parts of the world a Castilian accent is used for French a Quebec accent is used in Canada while in other parts of the world a standard European accent is used for Bengali a male Bangladeshi accent is used except in India where a special female Indian Bengali accent is used instead Until March some less widely spoken languages used the open source eSpeak synthesizer for their speech producing a robotic awkward voice that may be difficult to understand br br br Browser integration br Google Translate is available in some web browsers as an optional downloadable extension that can run the translation engine which allow right click command access to the translation service In February Google Translate was integrated into the Google Chrome browser by default for optional automatic webpage translation br br br Mobile app br br The Google Translate app for Android and iOS supports languages and can propose translations for languages via photo via voice in conversation mode and via live video imagery in augmented reality mode br The Android app was released in January and for iOS on February after an HTML web application was released for iOS users in August The Android app is compatible with devices running at least Android while the iOS app is compatible with iPod Touches iPads and iPhones updated to iOS br A January Android version experimented with a Conversation Mode that aims to allow users to communicate fluidly with a nearby person in another language Originally limited to English and Spanish the feature received support for new languages still in testing the following October br The Camera input functionality allows users to take a photograph of a document signboard etc Google Translate recognises the text from the image using optical character recognition OCR technology and gives the translation Camera input is not available for all languages br In January the apps gained the ability to propose translations of physical signs in real time using the device s camera as a result of Google s acquisition of the Word Lens app The original January launch only supported seven languages but a July update added support for new languages with the release of a new implementation that utilizes convolutional neural networks and also enhanced the speed and quality of Conversation Mode translations augmented reality The feature was subsequently renamed Instant Camera The technology underlying Instant Camera combines image processing and optical character recognition then attempts to produce cross language equivalents using standard Google Translate estimations for the text as it is perceived br On May Google introduced Tap to Translate for Google Translate for Android Upon highlighting text in an app that is in a foreign language Translate will pop up inside of the app and offer translations br br br API br On May Google announced that the Google Translate API for software developers had been deprecated and would cease functioning The Translate API page stated the reason as substantial economic burden caused by extensive abuse with an end date set for December In response to public pressure Google announced in June that the API would continue to be available as a paid service br Because the API was used in numerous third party websites and apps the original decision to deprecate it led some developers to criticize Google and question the viability of using Google APIs in their products br br br Google Assistant br Google Translate also provides translations for Google Assistant and the devices that Google Assistant runs on such as Google Nest and Pixel Buds br br br Supported languages br As of July the following languages and languages varities are supported by Google Translate br br br Stages br br br Translation methodology br In April Google Translate launched with a statistical machine translation engine br Google Translate does not apply grammatical rules since its algorithms are based on statistical or pattern analysis rather than traditional rule based analysis The system s original creator Franz Josef Och has criticized the effectiveness of rule based algorithms in favor of statistical approaches Original versions of Google Translate were based on a method called statistical machine translation and more specifically on research by Och who won the DARPA contest for speed machine translation in Och was the head of Google s machine translation group until leaving to join Human Longevity Inc in July br Google Translate does not directly translate from one language to another L L Instead it often translates first to English and then to the target language L EN L However because English like all human languages is ambiguous and depends on context this can cause translation errors For example translating vous from French to Russian gives vous you OR B If Google were using an unambiguous artificial language as the intermediary it would be vous you B OR tu thou Such a suffixing of words disambiguates their different meanings Hence publishing in English using unambiguous words providing context or using expressions such as you all may or may not make a better one step translation depending on the target language br The following languages do not have a direct Google translation to or from English These languages are translated through the indicated intermediate language which in most cases is closely related to the desired language but more widely spoken in addition to through English br br Belarusian be ru en other br Catalan ca es en other br Galician gl pt en other br Haitian Creole ht fr en other br Korean ko ja en other br Slovak sk cs en other br Ukrainian uk ru en other br Urdu ur hi en other br According to Och a solid base for developing a usable statistical machine translation system for a new pair of languages from scratch would consist of a bilingual text corpus or parallel collection of more than million words and two monolingual corpora each of more than a billion words Statistical models from these data are then used to translate between those languages To acquire this huge amount of linguistic data Google used United Nations and European Parliament documents and transcripts The UN typically publishes documents in all six official UN languages which has produced a very large language corpus Google representatives have been involved with domestic conferences in Japan where it has solicited bilingual data from researchers br When Google Translate generates a translation proposal it looks for patterns in hundreds of millions of documents to help decide on the best translation By detecting patterns in documents that have already been translated by human translators Google Translate makes informed guesses AI as to what an appropriate translation should be br Before October for languages other than Arabic Chinese and Russian Google Translate was based on SYSTRAN a software engine which is still used by several other online translation services such as Babel Fish now defunct From October Google Translate used proprietary in house technology based on statistical machine translation instead before transitioning to neural machine translation br br br Google Translate Community br Google used to have crowdsourcing features for volunteers to be a part of its Translate Community intended to help improve Google Translate s accuracy Volunteers could select up to five languages to help improve translation users could verify translated phrases and translate phrases in their languages to and from English helping to improve the accuracy of translating more rare and complex phrases In August a Google Crowdsource app was released for Android users in which translation tasks are offered There were three ways to contribute First Google showed a phrase that one should type in the translated version Second Google showed a proposed translation for a user to agree disagree or skip Third users could suggest translations for phrases where they think they can improve on Google s results Tests in languages showed that the suggest an edit feature led to an improvement in a maximum of of cases over four years Despite its role in improving translation quality and expanding language coverage Google closed the Translate Community in March br br br Statistical machine translation br Although Google has deployed a new system called neural machine translation for better quality translation there are languages that still use the traditional translation method called statistical machine translation It is a rule based translation method that uses predictive algorithms to guess ways to translate texts in foreign languages It aims to translate whole phrases rather than single words then gather overlapping phrases for translation Moreover it also analyzes bilingual text corpora to generate a statistical model that translates texts from one language to another br br br Neural machine translation br In September a research team at Google announced the development of the Google Neural Machine Translation system GNMT to increase fluency and accuracy in Google Translate and in November announced that Google Translate would switch to GNMT br Google Translate s neural machine translation system used a large end to end artificial neural network that attempts to perform deep learning in particular long short term memory networks GNMT improved the quality of translation over SMT in some instances because it uses an example based machine translation EBMT method in which the system learns from millions of examples According to Google researchers it translated whole sentences at a time rather than just piece by piece It uses this broader context to help it figure out the most relevant translation which it then rearranges and adjusts to be more like a human speaking with proper grammar GNMT s proposed architecture of system learning has been implemented on over a hundred languages supported by Google Translate With the end to end framework Google states but does not demonstrate for most languages that the system learns over time to create better more natural translations The GNMT network attempts interlingual machine translation which encodes the semantics of the sentence rather than simply memorizing phrase to phrase translations and the system did not invent its own universal language but uses the commonality found in between many languages GNMT was first enabled for eight languages to and from English and Chinese French German Japanese Korean Portuguese Spanish and Turkish In March it was enabled for Hindi Russian and Vietnamese followed by Bengali Gujarati Indonesian Kannada Malayalam Marathi Punjabi Tamil and Telugu in April br Since Google has phased out GNMT and has implemented deep learning networks based on transformers br br br Accuracy br Google Translate is not as reliable as human translation When text is well structured written using formal language with simple sentences relating to formal topics for which training data is ample it often produces conversions similar to human translations between English and a number of high resource languages Accuracy decreases for those languages when fewer of those conditions apply for example when sentence length increases or the text uses familiar or literary language For many other languages vis vis English it can produce the gist of text in those formal circumstances Human evaluation from English to all languages shows that the main idea of a text is conveyed more than of the time for languages For languages a minimally comprehensible result is not achieved of the time or greater A few studies have evaluated Chinese French German and Spanish to English but no systematic human evaluation has been conducted from most Google Translate languages to English Speculative language to language scores extrapolated from English to other measurements indicate that Google Translate will produce translation results that convey the gist of a text from one language to another more than half the time in about of language pairs where neither language is English Research conducted in showed that Google Translate got a slightly higher score than the UCLA minimum score for the English Proficiency Exam Due to its identical choice of words without considering the flexibility of choosing alternative words or expressions it produces a relatively similar translation to human translation from the perspective of formality referential cohesion and conceptual cohesion Moreover a number of languages are translated into a sentence structure and sentence length similar to a human translation Furthermore Google carried out a test that required native speakers of each language to rate the translation on a scale between and and Google Translate scored on average br When used as a dictionary to translate single words Google Translate is highly inaccurate because it must guess between polysemic words Among the top words in the English language which make up more than of all written English the average word has more than senses which makes the odds against a correct translation about to if each sense maps to a different word in the target language Most common English words have at least two senses which produces odds in the likely case that the target language uses different words for those different senses The odds are similar from other languages to English Google Translate makes statistical guesses that raise the likelihood of producing the most frequent sense of a word with the consequence that an accurate translation will be unobtainable in cases that do not match the majority or plurality corpus occurrence The accuracy of single word predictions has not been measured for any language Because almost all non English language pairs pivot through English the odds against obtaining accurate single word translations from one non English language to another can be estimated by multiplying the number of senses in the source language with the number of senses each of those terms have in English When Google Translate does not have a word in its vocabulary it makes up a result as part of its algorithm br br br Limitations br Google Translate like other automatic translation tools has its limitations struggles with polysemy the multiple meanings a word may have and multiword expressions terms that have meanings that cannot be understood or translated by analyzing the individual word units that compose them A word in a foreign language might have two different meanings in the translated language This might lead to mistranslation Additionally grammatical errors remain a major limitation to the accuracy of Google Translate Google Translate struggles to differentiate between imperfect and perfect aspects in Romance languages The subjunctive mood is often erroneous Moreover the formal second person vous is often chosen whatever the context Since its English reference material contains only you forms it has difficulty translating a language with you all or formal you variations br Due to differences between languages in investment research and the extent of digital resources the accuracy of Google Translate varies greatly among languages Some languages produce better results than others Most languages from Africa Asia and the Pacific tend to score poorly in relation to the scores of many well financed European languages Afrikaans and Chinese being the high scoring exceptions from their continents No languages indigenous to Australia are included within Google Translate Higher scores for European can be partially attributed to the Europarl Corpus a trove of documents from the European Parliament that have been professionally translated by the mandate of the European Union into as many as languages A analysis indicated that French to English translation is relatively accurate and and analyses showed that Italian to English translation is relatively accurate as well However if the source text is shorter rule based machine translations often perform better this effect is particularly evident in Chinese to English translations While edits of translations may be submitted in Chinese specifically one cannot edit sentences as a whole Instead one must edit sometimes arbitrary sets of characters leading to incorrect edits br The service can be used as a dictionary by typing in words One can translate from a book by using a scanner and an OCR like Google Drive In its Written Words Translation function there is a word limit on the amount of text that can be translated at once Therefore long text should be transferred to a document form and translated through its Document Translate function br br br Open source licenses and components br br Irish language data from

Google won an international competition for English Arabic and English Chinese machine translation br br br Translation mistakes and oddities br Since Google Translate uses statistical matching to translate translated text can often include apparently nonsensical and obvious errors often swapping common terms for similar but nonequivalent common terms in the other language as well as inverting sentence meaning Novelty websites like Bad Translator and Translation Party have used the service to produce humorous text by translating back and forth between multiple languages similar to the
