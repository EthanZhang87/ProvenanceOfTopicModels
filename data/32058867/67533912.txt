possible winter surge in infections but that preparatory work on the terms of reference would start earlier as would choosing a chair br On December Heather Hallett was announced as the chair of the

Henry Cook from January to February br Johnson had provided materials to the Cabinet Office although it later emerged that he had only provided WhatsApp messages from May when he got a new phone following a security breach on his previous phone br The Cabinet Office supplied redacted versions saying they had removed material not relevant to the Inquiry but the Inquiry asked for the unredacted material using a Section notice leading to a dispute in May with the government The Cabinet Office launched legal action a judicial review on June over their concerns that handing over all the material would compromise ministers and other individuals right to privacy The legal action argued against the inquiry having the power to compel production of documents and messages which are unambiguously irrelevant to the inquiry s work On July the High Court ruled that the government must release the documents to the inquiry and the government said it accepted the ruling br br br Module The resilience and preparedness of the United Kingdom br Public hearings for Module resilience and preparedness began on June Former prime minister David Cameron told the inquiry that his government had focussed too much on preparations for an influenza pandemic and that there were failures to act on findings from the Exercise Alice simulation he denied that austerity measures had weakened the health service George Osborne former chancellor argued that austerity had left Britain better prepared making money available for furlough and other programmes Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock criticised the government s preparedness for a pandemic saying it was too focused on handling the aftermath of a pandemic rather than preventing one and that resources were prioritised on planning for the event of a no deal Brexit Former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the inquiry that Scotland did not have a set plan to deal with a pandemic such as Covid She also stated that the Scottish government was not happy that potential pandemic planning resources were reallocated to plan for a possible no deal Brexit instead br br br Module Decision making and political governance br Hearings for module two of the inquiry Decision making and Political Governance began on October Former Chief Adviser to the Prime Minister Dominic Cummings gave evidence on October In WhatsApp messages sent to senior adviser Lee Cain Cummings said that then prime minister Boris Johnson believed that the pandemic would be like the swine flu In other messages in reference to deputy cabinet secretary Helen MacNamara he called her propriety and ethics bullshit and said that it was designed to waste huge amounts of his time He also said that he wanted to personally handcuff her and escort her from the building and that answering her questions was like dodging stilettos Cummings was asked if these statements were misogynistic which he denied In other messages Cummings called ministers useless fuckpigs sic cunts and morons br br br Critical response br The Covid Inquiry was criticised by the director of the University of Oxford s Centre for Evidence Based Medicine Carl Heneghan who gave evidence to the inquiry for refusing to engage in the core issues of the pandemic and silencing science and being too concerned with the offensiveness of language in private messages Heneghan criticised the inquiry for attempting to attack his credentials while ignoring previous publications and ignoring generalist analysis which he said would have been useful during the pandemic br Heneghan said that the inquiry should consider the side effects of the Protect the NHS messaging that Heneghan believes reduced care for diseases other than covid whether the confinement of care home residents was a good policy which he believes was both ineffective and had immense human costs the reliability of test and trace and the accuracy and use of epidemiological modelling in decision making br Michael Simmons writing in The Spectator said that the Inquiry was asking the wrong questions and had learned nothing about the problems of the use of modelling which he thought had led to inaccuracies in decision making He says that the models failed to consider the effects of behaviour change citing historic work by Neil Ferguson and evidence given Ben Warner br Heneghan argues that there was a need for a red team to challenge government policy during future pandemics given Heneghan s belief that young academics were unable to challenge an orthodoxy during the pandemic Writing in the Financial Times Camilla Cavendish says that by June she had formed an opinion that the government needed a red team to challenge assumptions she argues that such a team could have answered legitimate questions about whether lockdowns were working the balance between the young and the old and the accuracy of scientific models br Heneghan said that rather than assessing whether lockdowns were an effective policy the inquiry assumed that the correct policy was to impose more severe lockdown restrictions earlier Simmons said that the Inquiry should answer whether lockdowns worked definitively citing evidence given by Simon Stevens that expressed the same view br br br See also br Coronakommissionen a Swedish independent commission to evaluate the government s response to COVID
