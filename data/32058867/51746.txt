security videoconferencing and energy management with products including Webex OpenDNS Jabber Duo Security Silicon One and Jasper br Cisco Systems was founded in December by Leonard Bosack and Sandy Lerner two Stanford University computer scientists who had been instrumental in connecting computers at Stanford They pioneered the concept of a local area network LAN being used to connect distant computers over a multiprotocol router system The company went public in and by the end of the dot com bubble in the year had a market capitalization of billion surpassing Microsoft as the world s most valuable company br Cisco stock CSCO was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average on June and is also included in the S P Nasdaq the Russell and the Russell Growth Stock indices br br br History br br br Origins and initial growth br br Cisco Systems was founded in December by Sandy Lerner along with her husband Leonard Bosack Lerner was the director of computer facilities for the Stanford University Graduate School of Business Bosack was in charge of the Stanford University computer science department s computers br Cisco s initial product has roots in Stanford University s campus technology In the early s students and staff at Stanford including Bosack used technology on the campus to link all of the school s computer systems to talk to one another creating a box that functioned as a multiprotocol router called the Blue Box The Blue Box used circuitry made by Andy Bechtolsheim and software that was originally written at Stanford by research engineer William Yeager Due to the underlying architecture and its ability to scale well Yeager s well designed invention became a key to Cisco s early success br In Bosack and Stanford employee Kirk Lougheed began a project to formally network Stanford s campus They adapted Yeager s software into what became the foundation for Cisco IOS despite Yeager s claims that he had been denied permission to sell the Blue Box commercially On July Bosack and Lougheed were forced to resign from Stanford and the university contemplated filing criminal complaints against Cisco and its founders for the theft of its software hardware designs and other intellectual properties In Stanford licensed the router software and two computer boards to Cisco In addition to Bosack Lerner Lougheed Greg Satz a programmer and Richard Troiano who handled sales completed the early Cisco team The company s first CEO was Bill Graves who held the position from to In John Morgridge was appointed CEO br The name Cisco was derived from the city name San Francisco which is why the company s engineers insisted on using the lower case cisco in its early years The logo is intended to depict the two towers of the Golden Gate Bridge br On February Cisco Systems went public with a market capitalization of million and was listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange On August Lerner was fired Upon hearing the news her husband Bosack resigned in protest br Although Cisco was not the first company to develop and sell dedicated network nodes it was one of the first to sell commercially successful routers supporting multiple network protocols Classical CPU based architecture of early Cisco devices coupled with flexibility of operating system IOS allowed for keeping up with evolving technology needs by means of frequent software upgrades Some popular models of that time such as Cisco managed to stay in production for almost a decade virtually unchanged The company was quick to capture the emerging service provider environment entering the SP market with product lines such as Cisco and Cisco br Between and Cisco acquired several companies in Ethernet switching such as Kalpana Grand Junction and most notably Mario Mazzola s Crescendo Communications which together formed the Catalyst business unit At the time the company envisioned layer routing and layer Ethernet Token Ring switching as complementary functions of different intelligence and architecture the former was slow and complex the latter was fast but simple This philosophy dominated the company s product lines throughout the s br In John Morgridge was succeeded by John T Chambers br br br Internet and silicon intelligence br br The Internet Protocol IP became widely adopted in the mid to late s Cisco introduced products ranging from modem access shelves AS to core GSR routers making them a major player in the market In late March at the height of the dot com bubble Cisco became the most valuable company in the world with a market capitalization of more than billion As of July with a market cap of about US billion it was still one of the most valuable companies br The perceived complexity of programming routing functions in silicon led to the formation of several startups determined to find new ways to process IP and MPLS packets entirely in hardware and blur boundaries between routing and switching One of them Juniper Networks shipped their first product in and by chipped away about from Cisco SP Market share In response Cisco later developed homegrown ASICs and fast processing cards for GSR routers and Catalyst switches In Cisco also started the migration to new high end hardware CRS and software architecture IOS XR br br br The Human Network br br As part of a rebranding campaign in Cisco Systems adopted the shortened name Cisco and created The Human Network advertising campaign These efforts were meant to make Cisco a household brand a strategy designed to support the low end Linksys products and future consumer products br On the more traditional business side Cisco continued to develop its routing switching and security portfolio The quickly growing importance of Ethernet also influenced the company s product lines Limits of IOS and aging Crescendo architecture also forced Cisco to look at merchant silicon in the carrier Ethernet segment This resulted in a new ASR product family intended to consolidate the company s carrier Ethernet and subscriber management business around EZChip based hardware and IOS XR br Throughout the mid s Cisco also built a significant presence in India
