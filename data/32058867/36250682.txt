t know because we re just going to be very data driven and user feedback driven on making that decision Facebook told TechCrunch that the advertisements placement in the inbox depends on factors such as thread count phone screen size and pixel density In a TechCrunch editorial by Devin Coldewey he described the ads as huge in the space they occupy intolerable in the way they appear in the user interface and irrelevant due to the lack of context Coldewey finished by writing Advertising is how things get paid for on the internet including TechCrunch so I m not an advocate of eliminating it or blocking it altogether But bad advertising experiences can spoil a perfectly good app like for the purposes of argument Messenger Messaging is a personal purposeful use case and these ads are a bad
