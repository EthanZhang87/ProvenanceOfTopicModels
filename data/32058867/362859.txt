House of Commons for running a sustained vendetta against the British Royal Family in the Express titles In the same month the Duke of Edinburgh described the Express as a bloody awful newspaper It is full of lies scandal and imagination It is a vicious paper At the height of Beaverbrook s control in he told a Royal Commission on the press that he ran his papers purely for the purpose of making propaganda The arrival of television and the public s changing interests took their toll on circulation and following Beaverbrook s death in the paper s circulation declined for several years During this period the Express practically alone among mainstream newspapers was vehemently opposed to entry into what became the European Economic Community br br Partially as a result of the rejuvenation of the Daily Mail under David English and the emergence of The Sun under Rupert Murdoch and editorship of Larry Lamb average daily sales of the Express dropped below four million in below three million in and below two million in The Daily Express switched from broadsheet to tabloid in the Mail having done so six years earlier and was bought by the construction company Trafalgar House in the

Controversy surrounded the deal since Desmond also owned softcore pornography magazines As a result many staff left including editor Rosie Boycott and columnist Peter Hitchens Hitchens moved to The Mail on Sunday saying working for the new owner was a moral conflict of interest since he had always attacked the pornographic magazines that Desmond published Despite their divergent politics Desmond respected Hitchens br In Express Newspapers left the National Publishers Association due to unpaid fees Since payments to the NPA fund the Press Complaints Commission it is possible that the Express

Express group lost prominent libel cases in it paid damages to people involved in the Madeleine McCann case see below a member of the Muslim Council of Britain footballer Marco Materazzi and sports agent Willie McKay The losses led the media commentator Roy Greenslade to conclude that Express Newspapers which also publishes the Star titles paid more in libel damages over that period than any other newspaper group Although most of the individual amounts paid were not disclosed the total damages were recorded at Greenslade characterised Desmond as a rogue proprietor br In late Express Newspapers began cutting jobs to reduce costs by million however too few staff were willing to take voluntary redundancy In early a previous cost cutting exercise triggered the first hour national press strike in the UK for years In late August came plans for a further redundancies affecting journalists across Express Newspapers including the Daily and Sunday Express the Daily Star and the Daily Star Sunday br In August the Advertising Standards Authority criticised the company for advertorials as features alongside adverts for the same products The ASA noted that the pieces were always and uniquely favourable to the product featured in the ads and contained claims that have been or were likely to be prohibited in advertisements br In January the Daily Express was censured by the Advertising Standards Authority over a front page promotion for free fireworks This led to comment that the Express has become the Ryanair of Fleet Street in that it is a frequent offender which pays little heed to the ASA s criticisms br In May Desmond announced a commitment of million over five years to buy new equipment for the printing plants beginning with the immediate purchase of four new presses amid industry rumours that he was going to establish a printing plant at Luton br On December the Express with all the media titles in Desmond s Northern Shell group were excluded from the

of murdering up to wealthy patients in Eastbourne The press egged on by police leaks unanimously declared Adams guilty except for Percy Hoskins chief crime reporter for the Express Hoskins was adamant that Adams was a naive doctor prosecuted by an overzealous detective Herbert Hannam whom Hoskins disliked from previous cases The Express under Hoskins s direction was the only major paper to defend Adams causing Lord Beaverbrook to question Hoskins s stance br Adams was cleared in of the murder of Edith Alice Morrell a second count was withdrawn controversially After the case Beaverbrook phoned Hoskins and said Two people were acquitted today meaning Hoskins as well The Express carried an exclusive interview with Adams whom Hoskins interviewed in a safe house away from other newspapers According to archives released in Adams was thought by police to have killed patients br br br Dunblane br br On March the Scottish edition of the Sunday Express published a front page article critical of survivors of the Dunblane massacre entitled Anniversary Shame of Dunblane Survivors The article criticised the year old survivors for posting shocking blogs and photographs of themselves on the internet revealing that they drank alcohol made rude gestures and talked about their sex lives The article provoked complaints leading to a front page apology a fortnight later The Press Complaints Commission described the article as a serious error of judgement and said Although the editor had taken steps to resolve the complaint and rightly published an apology the breach of the Code was so serious that no apology could remedy it br br br Diana Princess of Wales br The Daily Express gained a reputation for printing conspiracy theories about the death of Diana Princess of Wales as front page news The Independent and The Guardian in both published a selection of then recent Express headlines on the topic This practice was satirised in Private Eye as the Diana Express or the Di ly Express and has been attributed to Desmond s friendship with regular Eye target Mohamed Fayed The articles regularly quoted Fayed with the newspaper describing its campaign as Our relentless crusade for the truth In and these front page stories consistently appeared on Mondays and ended only when the paper focused instead on the Madeleine McCann story see below br Even on July the anniversary of the London bombings used by most other newspapers to publish commemorations the front page was given over to Diana This tendency was also mocked on Have I Got News for You when on November the day other papers reported the death sentence given to Saddam Hussein on their front pages the Express led with SPIES COVER UP DIANA MURDER br According to The Independent The Diana stories appear on Mondays because Sunday is often a quiet day In February and March the paper returned to featuring Diana stories on the front page on Mondays br In September following an allegation raised by the estranged wife of an SAS operative the Daily Express returned to running daily Princess Diana cover stories br br br Madeleine McCann br In the second half of the Daily Express gave a large coverage to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann From August to November the Express dedicated at least part of the next front pages to her Of those used the headline to feature the details of the disappearance often stylised by MADELEINE in red block capitals plus a picture of the child br Though the family initially said some journalists may have overstepped their mark they acknowledged the benefits in keeping the case in the public eye but said coverage needed to be toned down since daily headlines were not necessarily helpful In March the McCanns launched a libel suit against the Daily Express and the Daily Star as well as their Sunday equivalents following their coverage The action concerned more than stories across the four newspapers which accused the McCanns of causing and covering up their daughter s death Express Newspapers pulled all references to Madeleine from its websites br In a settlement at the High Court of Justice the newspapers ran a front page apology to the McCanns on March another apology on the front of the Sunday editions of March and a statement of apology at the High Court The newspapers also agreed to pay costs and damages which the McCanns said they would use to fund the search for their daughter Guardian media commentator Roy Greenslade said it was unprecedented for four major newspapers to offer front page apologies but also said it was more than warranted given that the papers had committed a substantial libel that shamed the British press Craig Silverman of Regret the Error a blog that reports media errors argued that given how many of the stories appeared on the front page anything less than a front page apology would have been unacceptable br In its apology the Express said a number of articles in the newspaper have suggested that the couple caused the death of their missing daughter Madeleine and then covered it up We acknowledge that there is no evidence whatsoever to support this theory and that Kate and Gerry are completely innocent of any involvement in their daughter s disappearance This was followed in October by an apology and payout forwarded to the fund again to a group who had become known as the Tapas Seven in relation to the case br br br Accusations of xenophobia and hate speech br In the paper launched a crusade against new European Union rules on migrants from Bulgaria and Romania inviting readers to sign a petition against lifting restrictions on immigration The front page on Thursday October declared Britain is full and fed up Today join your Daily Express Crusade to stop new flood of Romanian and Bulgarian migrants The Aberystwyth University Student Union announced a ban on the sale of the paper This ban was overturned in March following a student vote UKIP Leader Nigel Farage declared that he had signed the Crusade petition and urged others to do the same Romanian politician C t lin Ivan expressed outrage at the campaign br In a statement released by The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights OHCHR on April the tabloid s name was mentioned in an accusation of producing hate speech initially referring to an article in The Sun To give just one glimpse of the scale of the problem back in the Daily Express ran negative front pages stories about asylum seekers and refugees in a single day period the High Commissioner noted that Article of the ICCPR as well as elements relating to hate speech in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination both of which have been ratified by the UK as well as by all other EU countries were rooted in the desire to outlaw the type of anti Semitic and other racially based hate speech used by the Nazi media during the s br Appearing in April before Parliament s Home Affairs Select Committee which was investigating the treatment of minority groups in print media Daily Express editor Gary Jones said that he would be looking to change the tone of the paper Jones said that he had found past pages of the newspaper downright offensive adding that they made him feel very uncomfortable and contributed to an Islamophobic sentiment in the media br br
