wolfSSL is a small portable embedded SSL TLS library targeted for use by embedded systems developers It is an open source implementation of TLS SSL TLS and DTLS and written in the C programming language It includes SSL TLS client libraries and an SSL TLS server implementation as well as support for multiple APIs including those defined by SSL and TLS wolfSSL also includes an OpenSSL compatibility interface with the most commonly used OpenSSL functions br A predecessor of wolfSSL yaSSL is a C based SSL library for embedded environments and real time operating systems with constrained resources br br br Platforms br wolfSSL is currently available for Microsoft Windows Linux macOS Solaris ESP ESP Threadx VxWorks FreeBSD NetBSD OpenBSD embedded Linux Yocto Project OpenEmbedded WinCE Haiku OpenWrt iPhone Android Wii and GameCube through DevKitPro support QNX MontaVista Tron variants NonStop OS OpenCL Micrium s MicroC OS II FreeRTOS SafeRTOS Freescale MQX Nucleus

yet another SSL dates to OpenSSL was available at the time and was dual licensed under the OpenSSL License and the SSLeay license yaSSL alternatively was developed and dual licensed under both a commercial license and the GPL yaSSL offered a more modern API commercial style developer support and was complete with an OpenSSL compatibility layer The first major user of wolfSSL CyaSSL yaSSL was MySQL Through bundling with MySQL yaSSL has achieved extremely high distribution volumes in the millions br In February Daniel Stenberg the creator of cURL was hired by the wolfSSL project to work on cURL br br br Protocols br br The wolfSSL lightweight SSL library implements the following protocols br br SSL TLS TLS TLS TLS br DTLS DTLS DTLS br Extensions Server Name Indication SNI Maximum

Standard br Protocol Notes br br SSL SSL was deprecated prohibited in by RFC wolfSSL does not support it br SSL SSL was deprecated prohibited in by RFC In response to the POODLE attack SSL has been disabled by default since wolfSSL but can be enabled with a compile time option br br br Algorithms br wolfSSL uses the following cryptography libraries br br br wolfCrypt br By default wolfSSL uses the cryptographic services provided by wolfCrypt wolfCrypt Provides RSA ECC DSS Diffie Hellman EDH NTRU DES Triple DES AES CBC CTR CCM GCM Camellia IDEA ARC HC ChaCha MD MD MD SHA SHA SHA BLAKE RIPEMD Poly Random Number Generation Large Integer support and base encoding decoding br wolfCrypt also includes support for the recent X and Ed algorithms br wolfCrypt acts as a back end crypto implementation for several popular software packages and libraries including MIT Kerberos where it can be enabled using a build option br br br NTRU br CyaSSL includes NTRU public key encryption The addition of NTRU in CyaSSL was a result of the partnership between yaSSL and Security Innovation NTRU works well in mobile and embedded environments due to the reduced bit size needed to provide the same security as other public key systems In addition it s not known to be vulnerable to quantum attacks Several cipher suites utilizing NTRU are available with CyaSSL including AES RC and HC br br br
