The Quest is a virtual reality VR headset developed by Reality Labs a division of Meta Platforms It was unveiled on June and released on October as a successor to the Quest and as the rd generation of the Meta Quest br The headset features updated hardware with elements of the Quest Pro including a thinner form factor and lenses and additional sensors and color passthrough cameras intended for mixed reality software br The Quest can run as either a standalone headset or use the Quest Link feature to function as a VR headset for a personal computer connected via a cable or wirelessly Air Link br br br Specifications br br br Hardware br The Quest s design is an evolution of that of the Quest combined with elements of the Meta Quest Pro It uses a pair of LCD displays with a per eye resolution of p which is a roughly increase over the p resolution of the Quest Although the latter using a single LCD display panel with only the lenses above it being movable for simple x step IPD adjustment compared to each lens and separate display panel moving together as a single assembly on Quest allowing for full and precise IPD adjustability the Quest s effective visible resolution is actually closer to x p This means that the fully movable dual display Quest s resolution improvement is notably bigger in practice than it is on paper and essentially allows the device s wider FOV to be a free upgrade in terms of the otherwise inevitable regression in visible pixel density br The new dual LCD display panels are viewed through in house custom designed x element pancake lenses similar to those in the Quest Pro to enable significantly better image clarity from edge to edge FOV improvement and a thinner device enclosure br The face of the headset is adorned with three pills containing sensors and cameras The two outer pills each contain a hybrid monochrome visible light infrared camera whose captured format alternates between frames and which are used for positional tracking of both the headset itself using the monochrome feed for inside out optical SLAM and the Touch Plus controllers using the IR feed to track embedded IR LED s along with a MP RGB color camera for mixed reality passthrough which are actually MP sensors using pixel binning to decrease the need for high exposure times and thus allow for a more realtime feed to be shown And in addition to the two located inside said outer pills on the device s front there are another two of these exact same dual role IR tracking cameras on the bottom left and right sides of the headset giving it x in total so as to give it a suitably large tracking volume br While the center pill on the other hand contains an IR patterned light emitter in line projector form marketed as a depth sensor which is used in combination with the two front facing IR cameras to understand the depth and distance of the user s surroundings for boundaries and mixed reality experiences br The Quest uses the Snapdragon XR Gen a system on chip manufactured by Qualcomm and based on their Snapdragon Gen flagship mobile phone SoC which Meta has touted as having more than twice the raw graphics GPU performance of the Snapdragon XR Gen used by the Quest and other similar standalone headsets br The headset ships with Touch Plus controllers they are similar in design to the Touch Pro controllers used by Quest Pro and replace the infrared sensor ring with infrared sensors in the body of the controller augmented by internal sensors and input from the headset s hand tracking Unlike the Touch Pro controllers they do not use a dedicated processor and cameras for on board positional tracking and are powered by AA batteries rather than rechargeable batteries Quest is also compatible with the Touch Pro controllers br In December an API was added for inside out body tracking which uses computer vision and the headset s side cameras to track upper body and arm motions This can be combined with the generative legs API which uses a machine learning model to estimate the motion of the user s legs to provide a degree of full body motion tracking without additional sensors A depth API was also added to improve the quality of mixed reality rendering br br br Software br br The Quest is backward compatible with all Quest software Existing software may receive updates to add higher fidelity graphics including high resolution textures when running on Quest due to platform limitations it is difficult to distribute separate packages targeting Quest and Quest on Quest Store which may result in software consuming additional storage on Quest due to the inclusion of Quest specific assets in a unified package br During a private presentation to employees Meta virtual reality vice president Mark Rabkin stated that there were plans for new Quest apps and games to be released at launch during a digital presentation on June Meta showcased Quest titles scheduled for the late launch window such as Assassin s Creed Nexus VR Asgard s Wrath Ghostbusters Rise of the Ghost Lord I Expect You to Die Onward PowerWash Simulator Samba de Amigo Virtual Party Stranger Things VR and Vampire The Masquerade Justice among others During Connect Meta announced that Xbox Cloud Gaming would be available as an app for Meta Quest in December br br br Release br According to a roadmap obtained by The Verge in February Meta planned for the Quest internally codenamed Stinson to be released later that year The Verge s roadmap corroborated files on the Quest including schematics shared in September by virtual reality analyst Brad Lynch br Ahead of an official announcement Bloomberg writer Mark Gurman published a newsletter on May reporting from a private event where he had received a hands on demo of a Quest prototype codenamed Eureka Ahead of a VR gaming digital presentation later that day Meta officially revealed the Quest on June via a video on Mark Zuckerberg s Instagram account The teaser announced that the Quest would be released in late and be priced at US for a GB model with larger storage options to be announced in the future Several publications noted the timing of the announcement as it came four days prior to Apple s Worldwide Developers Conference WWDC where the company was expected to announce an augmented reality headset br The Meta Quest was made available for pre order on September with orders shipping the following month and the GB and GB models priced at US and US respectively All pre order units were bundled with Asgard s Wrath and pre orders of the GB model were also bundled with six months of Meta Quest subscription service br br br Reception br In a hands on report published prior to the official unveiling Bloomberg writer Mark Gurman found that the new AR passthrough mode was significantly better than any previous Meta products including Quest Pro with it being good enough to clearly read and use one s phone through but that controller tracking was less accurate Meta explained that it will improve the controller tracking accuracy over time before launch with a variety of already discovered but then not yet implemented tracking technologies and software updates br Wired praised the upgraded hardware of the Quest and its form factor for having a more comfortable and secure fit It was felt that the color passthrough cameras were better than the previous monochrome cameras but still had a blurry appearance and that the available apps did not use mixed reality to its full potential The user interface was also criticized for being largely unchanged from past models lacking in application management functions and having unclear migration paths for cloud save data from previous Quest headsets In conclusion it was argued that everything it does it does well but it does nothing at the apex of its class and that the Quest might not be enough to make mainstream adoption of VR or MR an actual reality br Polygon similarly praised the technical and ergonomic updates to the Quest and described the device as being much more complete out of the box with fewer obvious areas for improvement than the Quest It was noted that not many games had been specifically updated for Quest at launch but that those which did had improved visual fidelity such as Red Matter which was described as approaching the fidelity of Half Life Alyx and that performance improvements were not universal among existing titles not yet updated It was argued that the headset s library of native software had worthwhile experiences but that Meta s feed of new interesting games is slow compared to the release rhythm set by traditional game consoles and that the Quest feels kind of like a mid generation console refresh but without the benefit of having dozens of amazing games that feel greatly improved out of the gate br br br br br br External links br Official website
