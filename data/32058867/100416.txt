id: 100416
Lynching is an extrajudicial killing by a group It is most often used to characterize informal public executions by a mob in order to punish an alleged transgressor punish a convicted transgressor or intimidate people It can also be an extreme form of informal group social control and it is often conducted with the display of a public spectacle often in the form of a hanging for maximum intimidation Instances of lynchings and similar mob violence can be found in all societies br In the United States where the word for lynching likely originated lynchings of African Americans became frequent in the South during the period after the Reconstruction era especially during the nadir of American race relations br br br Etymology br The origins of the word lynch are obscure but it likely originated during the American Revolution The verb comes from the phrase Lynch Law a term for a punishment without trial Two Americans during this era are generally credited for coining the phrase Charles Lynch and William Lynch both of whom lived in Virginia in the s Charles Lynch is more likely to have coined the phrase as he was known to have used the term in while William Lynch is not known to have used the term until much later There is no evidence that death was imposed as a punishment by either of the two men In Charles Lynch wrote that his assistant had administered Lynch s law to Tories for Dealing with the negroes c br Charles Lynch was a Virginia Quaker ff planter and Patriot who headed a county court in Virginia which imprisoned Loyalists during the American Revolutionary War occasionally imprisoning them for up to a year Although he lacked proper jurisdiction for detaining these persons he claimed this right by arguing wartime necessity Lynch was concerned that he might face legal action from one or more of those whom he had imprisoned notwithstanding that the Patriots had won the war This action by the Congress provoked controversy and it was in connection with this that the term Lynch law meaning the assumption of extrajudicial authority came into common parlance in the United States Lynch was not accused of racist bias He acquitted Black people accused of murder on three occasions He was accused however of ethnic prejudice in his handling of Welsh miners br William Lynch from Virginia claimed that the phrase was first used in a compact signed by him and his neighbors in Pittsylvania County br A th century legend of James Lynch fitz Stephen who was Mayor of Galway in Ireland in says that when his son was convicted of murder the mayor hanged him from his own house The story was proposed by as the origin of the word lynch It is dismissed by etymologists both because of the distance in time and place from the alleged event to the word s later emergence and because the incident did not constitute a lynching in the modern sense br The archaic verb linch to beat severely with a pliable instrument to chastise or to maltreat has been proposed as the etymological source but there is no evidence that the word has survived into modern times so this claim is also considered implausible br Since the s and especially since the s there has been a false etymology claiming that the word lynching comes from a fictitious William Lynch speech that was given by an especially brutal slaveholder to other slaveholders to explain how to control their slaves Although a real person named William Lynch might have been the origin of the word lynching the real life William Lynch definitely did not give this speech and it is unknown whether the real William Lynch even owned slaves at all br br br By country and region br Lynchings took place in many parts of the world over the centuries br br br United States br br Lynchings took place in the United States both before and after the American Civil War most commonly in Southern states and Western frontier settlements and most frequently in the late th century They were often performed by self appointed commissions mobs or vigilantes as a form of punishment for presumed criminal offences From to there were victims of lynching Of these were male and female were of unknown sex but are assumed to be likely male In terms of ethnicity were black were white were Mexican or of Mexican descent were American Indian ten were Chinese and one was Japanese At the first recorded lynching in St Louis in a Black man named McIntosh who killed a deputy sheriff while being taken to jail was captured chained to a tree and burned to death on a corner lot downtown in front of a crowd of over people br br Mob violence arose as a means of enforcing White supremacy and it frequently verged on systematic political terrorism After the American Civil War secret white supremacist terrorist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan instigated extrajudicial assaults and killings due to a perceived loss of white power in America Mobs usually alleged crimes for which they lynched Black people in order to instil fear In the late th century however journalist Ida B Wells showed that many presumed crimes were either exaggerated or had not even occurred The magnitude of the extralegal violence which occurred during election campaigns to prevent blacks from voting reached epidemic proportions The ideology behind lynching directly connected to the denial of political and social equality was stated forthrightly in by United States Senator Benjamin Tillman who was previously governor of South Carolina We of the South have never recognized the right of the negro to govern white men and we never will We have never believed him to be the equal of the white man and we will not submit to his gratifying his lust on our wives and daughters without lynching him br Members of mobs that participated in lynchings often took photographs of what they had done to their victims Souvenir taking such as the taking of pieces of rope clothing branches and sometimes body parts was not uncommon Some of those photographs were published and sold as postcards br br br Anti lynching legislation and the civil rights movement br The Dyer Anti Lynching Bill was first introduced to the United States Congress in by Republican Congressman Leonidas C Dyer of St Louis Missouri The bill was passed by the United States House of Representatives in and in the same year it was given a favorable report by the United States Senate Committee Its passage was blocked by White Democratic senators from the Solid South the only representatives elected since the southern states had disenfranchised African Americans around the start of the th century The Dyer Bill influenced later anti lynching legislation including the Costigan Wagner Bill which was also defeated in the US Senate br The song Strange Fruit was composed by Abel Meeropol in inspired by the photograph of a lynching in Marion Indiana Meeropol said that the photograph haunted me for days It was published as a poem in the New York Teacher and later in the magazine New Masses in both cases under the pseudonym Lewis Allan The poem was set to music also by Meeropol and the song was performed and popularized by Billie Holiday The song has been performed by many other singers including Nina Simone br By the s the civil rights movement was gaining new momentum It was spurred by the lynching of Emmett Till a year old youth from Chicago who was killed while visiting an uncle in Mississippi His mother insisted on having an open casket funeral so that people could see how badly her son had been beaten The Black community throughout the U S became mobilized Vann R Newkirk wrote the trial of his killers became a pageant illuminating the tyranny of white supremacy The state of Mississippi tried two defendants but they were acquitted by an all White jury David Jackson writes that it was the photograph of the child s ravaged body that forced the world to reckon with the brutality of American racism br Most lynchings ceased by the s but even in there were claims that racist lynchings still happen in the United States being covered up as suicides br In the National Memorial for Peace and Justice was opened in Montgomery Alabama a memorial that commemorates the victims of lynchings in the United States br On March President Joe Biden signed the Emmett Till Antilynching Act of into law which classified lynching as a federal hate crime br br br Europe br br In Liverpool a series of race riots broke out in after the end of the First World War between White and Black sailors many of whom had been demobilized After a Black sailor had been stabbed by two White sailors in a pub for refusing to give them a cigarette his friends attacked them the next day in revenge wounding a policeman in the process The police responded by launching raids on lodging houses in primarily Black neighborhoods with casualties on both sides A White lynch mob gathered outside the houses during the raids and chased a Black sailor Charles Wootton into the Mersey River where he drowned The Charles Wootton College in Liverpool has been named in his memory br In Wolfgang Rosterg a German prisoner of war known to be unsympathetic to the Nazi regime was lynched by other German prisoners of war in Cultybraggan Camp a prisoner of war camp in Comrie Scotland At the end of the Second World War five of the perpetrators were hanged at Pentonville Prison the largest multiple execution in th century Britain br The situation is less clear with regards to reported lynchings in Germany Nazi propaganda sometimes tried to depict state sponsored violence as spontaneous lynchings The most notorious instance of this was Kristallnacht which the government portrayed as the result of popular wrath against Jews but it was carried out in an organised and planned manner mainly by SA and SS men Similarly the approximately confirmed murders of surviving crew members of crashed Allied aircraft in revenge for what Nazi propaganda called Anglo American bombing terror were chiefly conducted by German officials and members of the police or the Gestapo although civilians sometimes took part in them The execution of enemy aircrew without trial in some cases had been ordered by Hitler personally in May It was publicly announced that enemy pilots would no longer be protected from public wrath There were secret orders issued that prohibited policemen and soldiers from interfering in favor of the enemy in conflicts between civilians and Allied forces or prosecuting civilians who engaged in such acts In summary br br the assaults on crashed allied aviators were not typically acts of revenge for the bombing raids which immediately preceded them The perpetrators of these assaults were usually National Socialist officials who did not hesitate to get their own hands dirty The lynching murder in the sense of self mobilizing communities or urban quarters was the exception br On March two plain clothes British soldiers drove straight towards a Provisional IRA funeral procession near Milltown Cemetery in Andersonstown Belfast The men were mistaken for Special Air Service members surrounded by the crowd dragged out beaten kicked stabbed and eventually shot dead at a waste ground br Lynching of members of the Turkish Armed Forces occurred in the aftermath of the Turkish coup d tat attempt br br br Latin America br br br Mexico br Lynchings have been present since the colonial period Lynchings are a persistent form of extralegal violence in post Revolutionary Mexico A number

San Miguel Canoa in the state of Puebla after Enrique Meza P rez the local priest incited the villagers to murder the employees who he believed were communists The five victims intended to enjoy their holiday climbing La Malinche a nearby mountain but they had to stay in the village due to adverse weather conditions Two of the employees and the owner of the house where they were staying for the night were killed the three survivors sustained serious injuries including finger amputations The alleged main instigators were not prosecuted The few arrested were released after no evidence was found against them br On November in the Tl huac lynching three Mexican undercover federal agents investigating a narcotics related crime were lynched in the town of San Juan Ixtayopan Mexico City by an angry crowd who saw them taking photographs and suspected that they were trying to abduct children from a primary school The agents immediately identified themselves but they were held and beaten for several hours before two of them were killed and set on fire The incident was covered by the media almost from the beginning including their pleas for help and their murder br By the time police rescue units arrived two of the agents were reduced to charred corpses and the third was seriously injured Authorities suspect that the lynching was provoked by the persons who were being investigated Both local and federal authorities had abandoned the agents saying that the town was too far away for them to try to intervene Some officials said they would provoke a massacre if the authorities tried to rescue the men from the mob br br br Brazil br According to The Wall Street Journal Over the past years as many as million Brazilians have taken part in lynchings In Brazil mobs now kill or try to kill more than one suspected lawbreaker a day according to University of S o Paulo sociologist Jos de Souza Martins Brazil s leading expert on lynchings br br br Dominican Republic br

survey the Dominican Republic had the highest rate of acceptance in Latin America of such unlawful measures These issues are particularly evident in the Northern Region br br br Haiti br After the earthquake the slow distribution of relief supplies and the large number of affected people created concerns about civil unrest marked by looting and mob justice against suspected looters In a news story CNN reported At least people most of them Vodou priests have been lynched in Haiti since the beginning of the cholera epidemic by angry mobs blaming them for the spread of the disease officials said br br br Africa br br br South Africa br br The practice of whipping and necklacing offenders and political opponents evolved in the s during the apartheid era in South Africa Residents of Black townships formed people s courts and used whip lashings and deaths by necklacing in order to terrorize fellow Blacks who were seen as collaborators with the government Necklacing is the torture and execution of a victim by igniting a kerosene filled rubber tire that has been forced around the victim s chest and arms Necklacing was used to punish victims who were alleged to be traitors to the Black liberation movement along with their relatives and associates Sometimes the people s courts made mistakes or they used the system to punish those whom the anti Apartheid movement s leaders opposed A tremendous controversy arose when the practice was endorsed by Winnie Mandela then the wife of the then imprisoned Nelson Mandela and a senior member of the African National Congress br More recently drug dealers and other gang members have been lynched by People Against Gangsterism and Drugs a vigilante organization br br br Nigeria br The practice of extrajudicial punishments including lynching is referred to as jungle justice in Nigeria The practice is widespread and an established part of Nigerian society predating the existence of the police Exacted punishments vary between a muddy treatment that is being made to roll in the mud for hours and severe beatings followed by necklacing The case of the Aluu four sparked national outrage The absence of a functioning judicial system and law enforcement coupled with corruption are blamed for the continuing existence of the practice br br br Kenya br There are frequent lynchings in Kenya often as a mob executes a person they

window and stamped and beaten by the frenzied crowd One of the two was shot set on fire and his head beaten to a pulp Soon after the crowd dragged the two mutilated bodies to Al Manara Square in the city center and began an impromptu victory celebration Police officers proceeded to try and confiscate footage from reporters br On October an Eritrean asylum seeker Haftom Zarhum was lynched by a mob of vengeful Israeli soldiers in Be er Sheva s central bus station Israeli security forces misidentified Haftom as the person who shot an Israeli police bus and shot him Moments after other security
