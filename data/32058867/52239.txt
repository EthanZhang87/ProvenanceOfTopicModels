id: 52239
A hoax is a widely publicised falsehood so fashioned as to invite reflexive unthinking acceptance by the greatest number of people of the most varied social identities and of the highest possible social pretensions to gull its victims into putting up the highest possible social currency in support of the hoax br Whereas the promoters of frauds fakes and scams devise them so that they will withstand the highest degree of scrutiny customary in the affair hoaxers are confident justifiably or not that their representations will receive no scrutiny at all They have such confidence because their representations belong to a world of notions fundamental to the victims views of reality but whose truth and importance they accept without argument or evidence and so never question br Some hoaxers intend eventually to unmask their representations as in fact a hoax so as to expose their victims as fools seeking some form of profit other hoaxers hope to maintain the hoax indefinitely so that it is only when skeptical persons willing to investigate their claims publish their findings that at last they stand revealed as hoaxers br br br History br br Zhang Yingyu s The Book of Swindles c published during the late Ming dynasty is said to be China s first collection of stories about fraud swindles hoaxes and other forms of deception Although practical jokes have likely existed for thousands of years one of the earliest recorded hoaxes in Western history was the drummer of Tedworth in The communication of hoaxes can be accomplished in almost any manner that a fictional story can be communicated in person via word of mouth via words printed on paper and so on As communications technology has advanced the speed at which hoaxes spread has also advanced a rumour about a ghostly drummer spread by word of mouth will affect a relatively small area at first then grow gradually However hoaxes could also be spread via chain letters which became easier as the cost of mailing a letter dropped The invention of the printing press in the th century brought down the cost of a mass produced books and pamphlets and the rotary printing press of the th century reduced the price even further see yellow journalism During the th century the hoax found a mass market in the form of supermarket tabloids and by the st century there were fake news websites which spread hoaxes via social networking websites in addition to the use of email for a modern type of chain letter br br br Etymology br The English philologist Robert Nares says that the word hoax was coined in the late th century as a contraction of the verb hocus which means to cheat to impose upon or according to Merriam Webster to befuddle often with drugged liquor Hocus is a shortening of the magic incantation hocus pocus whose origin is disputed br br br Definition br Robert Nares defined the word hoax as meaning to cheat dating from Thomas Ady s book A candle in the dark or a treatise on the nature of witches and witchcraft br The term hoax is occasionally used in reference to urban legends and rumours but the folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand argues that most of them lack evidence of deliberate creations of falsehood and are passed along in good faith by believers or as jokes so the term should be used for only those with a probable conscious attempt to deceive As for the closely related terms practical joke and prank Brunvand states that although there are instances where they overlap hoax tends to indicate relatively complex and large scale fabrications and includes deceptions that go beyond the merely playful and cause material loss or harm to the victim br According to Professor Lynda Walsh of the University of Nevada Reno some hoaxes such as the Great Stock Exchange Fraud of labelled as a hoax by contemporary commentators are financial in nature and successful hoaxers such as P T Barnum whose Fiji mermaid contributed to his wealth often acquire monetary gain or fame through their fabrications so the distinction between hoax and fraud is not necessarily clear Alex Boese the creator of the Museum of Hoaxes states that the only distinction between them is the reaction of the public because a fraud can be classified as a hoax when its method of acquiring financial gain creates a broad public impact or captures the imagination of the masses br One of the earliest recorded media hoaxes is a fake almanac published by Jonathan Swift under the pseudonym of Isaac Bickerstaff in Swift predicted the death of John Partridge one of the leading astrologers in England at that time in the almanac and later issued an elegy on the day Partridge was supposed to have died Partridge s reputation was damaged as a result and his astrological almanac was not published for the next six years br It is possible to perpetrate a hoax by making only true statements using unfamiliar wording or context such as in the Dihydrogen monoxide hoax Political hoaxes are sometimes motivated by the desire to ridicule or besmirch opposing politicians or political institutions often before elections br A hoax differs from a magic trick or from fiction books film theatre radio television etc in that the audience is unaware of being deceived whereas in watching a magician perform an illusion the audience expects to be tricked br A hoax is often intended as a practical joke or to cause embarrassment or to provoke social or political change by raising people s awareness of something It can also emerge from a marketing or advertising purpose For example to market a romantic comedy film a director staged a phony incident during a supposed wedding which showed a bride and preacher getting knocked into a pool by a clumsy fall from a best man A resulting video clip of Chloe and Keith s Wedding was uploaded to YouTube and was viewed by over million people and the couple was interviewed by numerous talk shows Viewers were deluded into thinking that it was an authentic clip of a real accident at a real wedding but a story in USA Today in revealed it was a hoax br br Governments sometimes spread false information to facilitate their objectives such as going to war These often come under the heading of black propaganda There is often a mixture of outright hoax and suppression and management of information to give the desired impression In wartime and times of international tension rumours abound some of which may be deliberate hoaxes br Examples of politics related hoaxes br br Belgium is a country with a Flemish speaking region and a French speaking region In French speaking television channel RTBF interrupted programming with a spoof report claiming that the country had split in two and the royal family had fled br On March the Imedi television station in Georgia broadcast a false announcement that Russia had invaded Georgia br Psychologist Peter Hancock has identified six steps which characterise a truly successful hoax br br Identify a constituency a person or group of people who for reasons such as piety or patriotism or greed will truly care about your creation br Identify a particular dream which will make your hoax appeal to your constituency br Create an appealing but under specified hoax with ambiguities br Have your creation discovered br Find at least one champion who will actively support your hoax br Make people care either positively or negatively the ambiguities encourage interest and debate br br br Types br br Hoaxes vary widely in their processes of creation propagation and entrenchment over time Examples include br br Academic hoaxes br The Sokal affair br The Grievance studies affair br Art world hoaxes br The Bruno Hat art hoax arranged in London in July involved staging a convincing public exhibition of paintings by an imaginary reclusive artist Bruno Hat All the perpetrators were well educated and did not intend a fraud as the newspapers were informed the next day Those involved included Brian Howard Evelyn Waugh Bryan Guinness John Banting and Tom Mitford br Nat Tate An American Artist a art world hoax by William Boyd br Disumbrationism a modern art hoax br Pierre Brassau exposing art critics to modern paintings made by a chimpanzee br Spectra A Book of Poetic Experiments a modernist poetry hoax br Ern Malley the popular but fictitious Australian poet br Apocryphal claims that originate as a hoax gain widespread belief among members of a culture or organisation become entrenched as persons who believe it repeat it in good faith to others and continue to command that belief after the hoax s originators have died or departed br Computer virus hoaxes became widespread as viruses themselves began to spread A typical hoax is an email message warning recipients of a non existent threat usually forging quotes supposedly from authorities such as Microsoft and IBM In most cases the payload is an exhortation to distribute the message to everyone in the recipient s address book Thus the e mail warning is itself the virus Sometimes the hoax is more harmful e g telling the recipient to seek a particular file usually in a Microsoft Windows operating system if the file is found the computer is deemed to be infected unless it is deleted In reality the file is one required by the operating system for correct functioning of the computer br Criminal hoax admissions such as the case of John Samuel Humble also known as Wearside Jack Criminal hoax admissions divert time and money of police investigations with communications purporting to come from the actual criminal Once caught hoaxers are charged under criminal codes such as perverting the course of justice and wasting police time br Factoids br Hoaxes formed by making minor or gradually increasing changes to a warning or other claims widely circulated for legitimate purposes br Hoax of exposure is a semi comical or private sting operation It usually encourages people to act foolishly or credulously by falling for patent nonsense that the hoaxer deliberately presents as reality A related activity is culture jamming br Hoax news br Hoaxes perpetrated by scare tactics appealing to the audience s subjectively rational belief that the expected cost of not believing the hoax the cost if its assertions are true times the likelihood of their truth outweighs the expected cost of believing the hoax cost if false times likelihood of falsity such as claims that a non malicious but unfamiliar program on one s computer is malware br Hoaxes perpetrated on occasions when their initiation is considered socially appropriate such as April Fools Day br Humbugs br Internet hoaxes became more common after the start of social media Some websites have been used to hoax millions of people on the Web br Paleoanthropological hoaxes anthropologists were taken in by the Piltdown Man discovery that was widely believed from to br Religious hoaxes br UFO hoaxes br Urban legends and rumours with a probable conscious attempt to deceive br br br Hoax news br br Hoax news also referred to as fake news is a news report containing facts that are either inaccurate or false but which are presented as genuine A hoax news report conveys a half truth used deliberately to mislead the public br Hoax may serve the goal of propaganda or disinformation using social media to drive web traffic and amplify their effect Unlike news satire fake news websites seek to mislead rather than entertain readers for financial or political gain br Hoax news is usually released with the intention of misleading to injure an organisation individual or person and or benefit financially or politically sometimes utilising sensationalist deceptive or simply invented headlines to maximise readership Likewise clickbait reports and articles from this operation gain advertisement revenue br br br See also br br br br br br Further reading br MacDougall Curtis D Hoaxes revised ed New York Dover br
