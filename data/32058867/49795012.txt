opposition to the former PT government and ran in favor of expanding gun ownership in response to high crime legalizing the death penalty and the privatization of state owned companies For the position of Vice President Bolsonaro chose Hamilton Mour o a conservative retired general in the Brazilian Army During the campaign Bolsonaro was the subject of widespread protests for his homophobic racist and misogynistic beliefs Former Governor of S o Paulo Geraldo Alckmin who ran as a member of the previously dominant centre right Brazilian Social Democracy Party PSDB received the worst result for a presidential nominee of his party in Brazilian history br Former President Lula da Silva who left office in with high approval ratings intended to run for president as the candidate of the PT with former Mayor of S o Paulo Fernando Haddad as his running mate Polling taken during the campaign found Lula as the favorite in both the first and second rounds of the election However Lula s

Manuela d Avila of Rio Grande do Sul serving as his running mate His major opponent on the left was Ciro Gomes a mainstay of Brazilian politics who ran a centre left campaign as a member of the Democratic Labour Party PDT Following Haddad s advancement to the second round Ciro did not endorse his campaign though he did signal opposition to Bolsonaro br The campaign was marked by political violence with Bolsonaro being a victim of a stabbing attack at a campaign rally in Minas Gerais and supporters of both Haddad and Bolsonaro falling victim to politically motivated attacks Fake news

her from the crimes charged Vice President Michel Temer of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party assumed her powers and duties as Acting President of Brazil during the suspension On August the Senate voted in favor of impeachment finding Rousseff guilty of breaking budgetary laws and removing her from office Critics of the impeachment saw it as a legislative coup d tat Vice President Temer

and heated political periods of modern Brazilian history br Temer was barred from running for a full term in He had been convicted of campaign law violations in and was banned from holding any
