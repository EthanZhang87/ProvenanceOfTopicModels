id: 276753
The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of CFAA is a United States cybersecurity bill that was enacted in as an amendment to existing computer fraud law U S C which had been included in the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of Prior to computer specific criminal laws computer crimes were prosecuted as mail and wire fraud but the applying law was often insufficient br The original bill was enacted in response to concern that computer related crimes might go unpunished The House Committee Report to the original computer crime bill characterized the techno thriller film WarGames in which a young teenager played by Matthew Broderick from Seattle breaks into a U S military supercomputer programmed to predict possible outcomes of nuclear war and unwittingly almost starts World War III as a realistic representation of the automatic dialing and access capabilities of the personal computer br The CFAA was written to extend existing tort law to intangible property while in theory limiting federal jurisdiction to cases with a compelling federal interest i e where computers of the federal government or certain financial institutions are involved or where the crime itself is interstate in nature but its broad definitions have spilled over into contract law see Protected Computer below In addition to amending a number of the provisions in the original section the CFAA also criminalized additional computer related acts Provisions addressed the distribution of malicious code and denial of service attacks Congress also included in the CFAA a provision criminalizing trafficking in passwords and similar items br Since then the Act has been amended a number of times in in by the USA PATRIOT Act and in by the Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act With each amendment of the law the types of conduct that fell within its reach were extended br In January President Barack Obama proposed expanding the CFAA and the RICO Act in his Modernizing Law Enforcement Authorities to Combat Cyber Crime proposal DEF CON organizer and Cloudflare researcher Marc Rogers Senator Ron Wyden and Representative Zoe Lofgren stated opposition to this on the grounds it would make many regular Internet activities illegal and moved further away from what they were trying to accomplish with Aaron s Law br br br Protected computers br The only computers in theory covered by the CFAA are defined as protected computers They are defined under section U S C e to mean a computer br br exclusively for the use of a financial institution or the United States Government or any computer

criminals engaging with minors over cellphones br United States v Kane Exploiting a software bug in a poker machine does not constitute hacking because the poker machine in question failed to

precedent The Supreme Court ruled in June that under CFAA that a person exceeds authorized access of a computer system they otherwise have access to when they access files and other content that are off limits to the portions of the computer system they were authorized to access Their opinion restricted CFAA from applying to cases where a person obtains information from areas they do have authorized access to but uses that information for improper reasons br br br Civil cases br Theofel v Farey Jones U S App Lexis decided August U S Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit holding that

its classified ads without consent In August US federal judge found Taps s actions violated CFAA and that it faces civil damages for unauthorized access Judge Breyer wrote in his decision that the average person does not use anonymous proxies to bypass an IP block set up to enforce a banning communicated via personally addressed cease and desist letter He also noted Congress apparently knew how to restrict the reach of the CFAA to only certain kinds of information and it appreciated the public v nonpublic distinction but the relevant section contains no such restrictions or modifiers br Lee v PMSI Inc PMSI Inc sued former employee Lee for violating the CFAA by browsing Facebook and checking personal email in violation of the company s acceptable use policy The court found that breaching an employer s acceptable use policy was not unauthorized access under the act and therefore did not violate the CFAA br Sony Computer Entertainment America v George Hotz and Hotz v SCEA SCEA sued

decision The Ninth Circuit ultimately affirmed its original decision br Sandvig v Barr The Federal District Court of D C ruled that the CFAA does not criminalize the violation of a website s terms of service br br br Criticism br There have been criminal convictions for CFAA violations in the context of civil law for breach of contract or terms of service violations Many common and insignificant online acts such as password sharing and copyright infringement can transform a CFAA misdemeanor into a felony The punishments are severe similar to sentences for selling or importing drugs and may be disproportionate Prosecutors have used the CFAA to protect private business interests and to intimidate free culture activists deterring undesirable yet legal conduct br One such example regarding the harshness of the law was shown in United States vs Tyler King where King refused initial offers by the government for involvement in a conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to a computer system for a small company that an ex girlfriend of King worked for His role even while not directly involved resulted in years imprisonment No financial motive was established A non profit was started to advocate against further harshness against others targeted under the broad law br Tim Wu called the CFAA the worst law in technology br Professor of Law Ric Simmons notes that many provisions of the CFAA merely combine identical language to pre existing federal laws with the element of access ing a protected computer without authorization or by exceed ing authorized access meaning that the CFAA merely provides an additional charge for prosecutors to bring if the defendant used a computer while committing the crime Professor Joseph Olivenbaum has similarly criticized the CFAA s computer specific approach noting both the risk of redundancy and resultant definitional problems br The CFAA increasingly presents real obstacles to journalists reporting stories important to the public s interest As data journalism increasingly becomes a good way of getting to the truth of things in this post truth era as one data journalist told Google the need for further clarity around the CFAA increases br As per Star Kashman an expert in cybersecurity law the CFAA presents some challenges in cases related to Search Engine Hacking also known as Google Dorking Although Kashman states that accessing publicly available information is legal under the CFAA she also notes that in many cases Search Engine Hacking is ultimately prosecuted under the CFAA Kashman believes prosecuting cases of Google Dorking under the CFAA could render the CFAA void for vagueness by making it illegal to access publicly available information br br br Aaron Swartz br br In the wake of the prosecution and subsequent suicide of Aaron Swartz who used a script to download scholarly research articles in excess of what JSTOR terms of service allowed lawmakers proposed amending the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act Representative Zoe Lofgren drafted a bill that would help prevent what happened to Aaron from happening to other Internet users Aaron s Law H R S would exclude terms of service violations from the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and from the wire fraud statute br In addition to Lofgren s efforts Representatives Darrell Issa and Jared Polis also on the House Judiciary Committee raised questions in the immediate aftermath of Swartz s death regarding the government s handling of the case Polis called the charges ridiculous and trumped up referring to Swartz as a martyr Issa chair of the House Oversight Committee announced an investigation of the Justice Department s prosecution br By May Aaron s Law had stalled in committee Filmmaker Brian Knappenberger alleges this occurred due to Oracle Corporation s financial interest in maintaining the status quo br Aaron s Law was reintroduced in May H R S and again stalled There has been no further introduction of related bills br br br
