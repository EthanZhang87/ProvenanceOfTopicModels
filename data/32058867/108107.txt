East Palo Alto was founded as an unincorporated community and was incorporated in July The two cities are separated only by San Francisquito Creek and largely the Bayshore Freeway the vast majority of East Palo Alto is northeast of the freeway while all of the residential part of Palo Alto is southwest of the freeway The revitalization projects in and high income high tech professionals moving into new developments including employees from Google and Facebook have begun to slowly eliminate the historically wide cultural and economic differences between the two cities East Palo Alto and Palo Alto

while were Latinos As of African Americans were while Latinos are about A small minority of Pacific Islanders also reside in East Palo Alto most of Tongan Samoan and Fijian origin br The prosperity that benefited Silicon Valley during the dot com boom of the late s largely bypassed East Palo Alto The Ravenswood City School District which serves East Palo Alto and part of adjoining Menlo Park has struggled with low academic performance Eventually however the Peninsula s shortage of land and soaring property prices meant that East Palo Alto became an option for urban regeneration br East Palo Alto includes a small piece of land southwest of the Bayshore Freeway U S Route across the freeway from the Gateway shopping center This land is roughly triangular and sits between the freeway and San Francisquito Creek This land was formerly the site of a two block long retail business district known as Whiskey Gulch Since Stanford University on the west side of Palo Alto prohibited alcohol sales within a radius of mile km from the campus Whiskey Gulch which was just outside these limits became home to a number of liquor stores bars and music venues The rules were relaxed in but the neighborhood still retained this character until when the city tore down Whiskey Gulch and replaced it with the University Circle office complex A room Four Seasons hotel opened in University Circle in br Over of East Palo Alto acres has been bulldozed and replaced with brand new housing and brand name retail establishments since approximately attracting an entirely new demographic The University Square community has become particularly appealing to young high tech professionals and high income couples including many employees from Google Facebook Sun Microsystems Yahoo and various other software and startup companies br br br History br br The Ohlone tribe of Native Americans inhabited this area at least by to BC One tumulus was discovered in during development of the University Village subdivision near today s Costa o School After a year long excavation of graves and artifacts researchers concluded Native Americans had utilized the area as a cemetery and camp rather than as a permanent settlement In later years another mound was found near Willow Road and the railroad right of way br br From the s through the s the area which was to become East Palo Alto went through many changes In Isaiah Churchill Woods attempted to make the area around what is now Cooley Landing in the northeast of the current city a major shipping town and named the area Ravenswood In after Woods investments failed he sold the wharf to Lester Phillip Cooley who leased the land to the brick factory Hunter and Schakleford When the brick factory left the landing in the land around the landing was reverted to a ranch br With the outbreak of World War I the north side of East Palo Alto became a military training ground of which only the Veterans Administration Hospital in Menlo Park still exists now as part of the VA Sierra Pacific Network In the s East Palo Alto was a farming community with many Japanese residents During the war the Japanese were forced out many to relocation centers and did not return after the war br In the s the farms were built over with cheap housing and many African American families moved in the result of redlining housing policies In particular in the then president of the California Real Estate Association Floyd Lowe implemented a strategy that turned a neighborhood on the East side of Palo Alto from predominantly white to predominantly black in a very short amount of time He did this by blockbusting which is a strategy that was employed all over the country to similar results Blockbusting involves instilling panic in white neighborhoods by warning of a Negro invasion when a black family considers purchasing a house in an area in order to produce white flight and an ensuing drop in property values which can then be purchased at a heavy discount and sold or rented to African Americans for a profit In Lowe alerted the neighborhood that a Negro invasion was imminent and as intended white flight ensued Lowe profited due to the low prices at which the white families fleeing were willing to sell their homes and within a few years the demographics of the area had flipped As white owned businesses fled the area it became poorer and overcrowded a legacy that has persisted This segregationist act was never questioned by the government and it led to many of the demographic and socioeconomic differences that exist between Palo Alto and East Palo Alto today br These differences in demographics and wealth perversely accelerated with the introduction of the Community Reinvestment Act of which banned redlining Home prices doubled by and many of the more educated and upwardly mobile African Americans took advantage of their newfound freedom to move into wealthier communities with more amenities leaving the remaining community even poorer and with less access to home ownership than had been the case before the Act br br During the civil rights movement of the s there was a renewed interest in African history one expression of which was a fad for Swahili In the area was almost renamed Nairobi after the center of the Swahili speaking area to reflect the population s African roots Critics of the change pointed out that Nairobi was the capital of Kenya in East Africa and had little to do with the cultural roots of most black Americans In the end the change was not made br Historically East Palo Alto had relatively little shopping and business compared to surrounding areas and most of it constituted an unincorporated island within San Mateo County depending on county government for services and on the San Mateo County Sheriff for police protection and ineligible for many revenue benefits requiring city status After several years of pro incorporation campaigning by local community groups including Barbara A Mouton and East Palo Alto s Senior Citizen Center president Ruth I Myers ballot measure that was stopped by a lawsuit and a subsequent election the next year East Palo Alto became a city on July with Barbara A Mouton as its first Mayor However because of subsequent legal challenges to the last ballot measure it was not until that the city was officially recognized as such The legal challenges were led by former U S Congress member Pete McCloskey who represented one of the real estate brokers whose original blockbusting campaign had turned EPA into a mostly black town The final tally was for and against a margin of votes and a majority of br In the s large numbers of Hispanics moved into East Palo Alto and by the city had lost its Black majority population which declined from percent in to percent in while the Hispanic population increased from percent to percent br Significant gentrification occurred in East Palo Alto from around the founding of Facebook with the construction of a large shopping center named Ravenswood and several upscale housing communities intended for high earning Silicon Valley workers This development faced opposition from some residents who charged that it priced locals out of one of the region s only affordable communities while providing only low paying retail jobs and consuming disproportionate land area square miles Supporters pointed to an increased tax base br In after twenty years without a supermarket East Palo Alto individuals and organizations established the East Palo Alto Community Farmers Market In November the Mi Pueblo Food
