id: 35930482
The technology company Facebook Inc held its initial public offering IPO on Friday May The IPO was one of the biggest in technology and Internet history with a peak market capitalization of over billion br br br Context br br For years Facebook and Zuckerberg resisted both buyouts and taking the company public The main reason that the company decided to go public is because it crossed the threshold of shareholders according to Reuters financial blogger Felix Salmon br Facebook reportedly turned down a million offer from Viacom in That same year Yahoo attempted to buy the company for billion but Zuckerberg refused Also that year BusinessWeek reported a billion valuation for the company br Facebook did accept investments from companies and these investments suggested fluctuating valuations for the firm In Microsoft beat out Google to purchase a stake for million giving Facebook a notional value of billion at the time Microsoft purchased preferred stock which meant that the company s actual valuation would be considerably lower than billion Meanwhile that valuation dropped to billion in when Digital Sky Technologies bought a nearly stake for million a larger stake than Microsoft had purchased at a lower price An investment report in valued the company at billion br Zuckerberg wanted to wait to conduct an initial public offering saying in that we are definitely in no rush But since by Facebook had more than round lot over shares stockholders Facebook was subject to the SEC disclosure rules starting the next year Zuckerberg had little choice as to whether an IPO had to be done at once br br br Preparation br br br Filing and roadshow br Facebook filed for an initial public offering on February by filing their S document with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC The preliminary prospectus announced that the company had million active monthly users and that its website featured billion daily likes and comments The filing noted that the company s increases in membership as well as its incomes were slowing and that the deceleration was likely to continue br To ensure that early investors would retain control of the company Facebook in instituted a dual class stock structure After the IPO Zuckerberg was to retain a ownership share in Facebook and was to own of the voting shares The document also stated that the company was seeking to raise US billion which would make it one of the largest IPOs in tech history and the biggest in Internet history br The roadshow faced a rough start initially Zuckerberg raised controversy for wearing a hoodie rather than a customary business suit to the first meeting with investors Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter called it a mark of immaturity A half hour long video played during that meeting also frustrated investors who wanted to discuss more technical details and was dropped for future meetings br br br Valuation br br Prior to the official valuation the target price of the stock steadily increased In early May the company was aiming for a valuation somewhere from to per share billion to billion On May it raised the targets from to per share Some investors even suggested a valuation although a dip in the stock market on the day before the IPO ended such speculation br Strong demand especially from retail investors suggested Facebook could choose a relatively high offering price Ultimately underwriters settled on a price of per share at the top of its target range This price valued the company at billion the largest valuation to date for a newly public company br On May two days before the IPO Facebook announced that it would sell more shares than originally planned due to high demand This meant the stock would debut with million shares br The Facebook IPO brought inevitable comparisons with other technology company offerings Some investors expressed keen interest in Facebook because they felt they had missed out on the massive gains Google saw in the wake of its IPO LinkedIn stock meanwhile had doubled on its first day br At per share which Facebook closed at a week after its IPO Facebook was valued like an ultra growth company according to Robert Leclerc of the Financial Post Its PE ratio was despite a decline in both earnings and revenue in the first quarter of br A number of commentators argued retrospectively that Facebook had been heavily overvalued because of an illiquid private market on SecondMarket where trades of stock were minimal and thus pricing unstable Facebook s aggregate valuation went up from January to April before plummeting after the IPO in May but this was in a largely illiquid market with less than trades each quarter during and Valuations in the private market are going to make it difficult to go public according to Mary Meeker an American venture capitalist and former Wall Street securities analyst br br br Price targets br Prior to the IPO several investors set price targets for the company On May before the offering price was announced Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia pegged the company at in an interview with The Street The interviewer cautioned Bhatia against what she perceived as Bhatia s low valuation suggesting the stock could rise to dollars and could shoot up to on the first day of trading On May the day before the offering analyst Jim Krapfel of Morningstar suggested that only a or better increase on the first day would be seen positively anything under that would be underwhelming Lee Simmons of Dun Bradstreet predicted more modest first day gains in the range of to No analysts Reuters interviewed projected a first day decrease Others were less optimistic Much of Wall Street expressed concerns over what it saw as a high valuation Citing the price to earnings ratio of for critics stated that the company would have to undergo almost ridiculous financial growth for the valuation to make sense Other companies trade at far lower ratios although there are notable exceptions Writers at TechCrunch expressed similar skepticism stating That s a big multiple to live up to and Facebook will likely need to add bold new revenue streams to justify the mammoth valuation br Early investors themselves were said to express similar skepticism Warning signs before the IPO indicated that several such investors were interested in selling their shares of the company Accel Partners planned to offload as many as of their shares while Goldman Sachs was ready to sell up to of theirs Rolfe Winkler of the Wall Street Journal suggested that given insider worries the public should avoid snapping up the stock Facebook employees were less concerned with Mark Zuckerberg planning to sell just br br br Analysis of fundamentals br Striking an optimistic tone The New York Times predicted that the offering would overcome questions about Facebook s difficulties in attracting advertisers to transform the company into a must own stock Jimmy Lee of JPMorgan Chase described it as the next great blue chip br Some analysts expressed concern over Facebook s revenue model namely its advertising practices Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research Group argued that Although Facebook is very promising it s an unproven ad model To better monetize user involvement the company could improve advertising Yet such efforts could undermine user privacy Also some advertisers expressed concern over the value of the advertisements they purchased on Facebook General Motors announced it would pull its million campaign from the social network just days before the IPO The automobile company asked for bigger flashier advertisements but Facebook refused br br br Public trading br In the immediate build up to the offering public interest swelled Some said it is as much a cultural phenomenon as it is a business story Meanwhile Facebook itself celebrated the occasion with an all night hackathon on the night before the IPO Zuckerberg rang a bell from Hacker Square on Facebook campus in Menlo Park California to announce the offering as is customary for CEOs on the day their companies go public br br br First day br br Trading was to begin at am Eastern Time on Friday May However trading was delayed until am Eastern Time due to technical problems with the NASDAQ exchange Those early jitters would foretell ongoing problems the first day of trading was marred by numerous technical glitches that prevented orders from going through or even confused investors as to whether or not their orders were successful br Initial trading saw the stock shoot up to as much as Yet the early rally was unsustainable The stock struggled to stay above the IPO price for most of the day forcing underwriters to buy back shares to support the price Only the aforementioned technical glitches and underwriter support prevented the stock price from falling below the IPO price on the first day of trading br At closing bell shares were valued at only above the IPO price and down from the opening bell value The opening was widely described by the financial press as a disappointment br Despite technical problems and a relatively low closing value the stock set a new record for trading volume of an IPO million shares The IPO also ended up raising billion making it the third largest in U S history just ahead of AT T Wireless and behind only General Motors and Visa Inc The stock price left the company with a higher market capitalization than all but a few U S corporations surpassing heavyweights such as Amazon com McDonald s Disney and Kraft Foods and made Zuckerberg s stock worth billion br br br Subsequent days br Facebook s share value fell during nine of the next thirteen trading days posting gains during just four The next day of trading after the IPO May the stock closed below its offering price at The stock saw another large loss the next day closing at A circuit breaker was used in an attempt to slow down the decline in the stock price The stock increased modestly in coming days and Facebook closed its first full week of trading at The stock returned to losses for most of its second full week and had lost over a quarter of its starting value by the end of May This led the Wall Street Journal to call the IPO a fiasco The stock closed its second full week of trading on June at By June investors had lost billion Facebook ended its third full week at slightly lower than a week previous The stock stayed below the mark for months and finally bottomed out in September below br The shares did not get back to the initial again until August the following year a full months later br br Price targets for the new stock ranged considerably On June seven of fifteen analysts polled by FactSet Research suggested prices above the stock s price effectively advising a buy Four of fifteen suggested a hold while another four of fifteen suggested sell Sanford Bernstein was the lowest of the group pegging the stock at br On December Standard Poor s announced that Facebook would join its S P index after the close of trading on December Reuters reported br br br Aftermath br br br Financial br The IPO had immediate impacts on the stock market Other technology companies took hits while the exchanges as a whole saw dampened prices Investment firms faced considerable losses due to technical glitches Bloomberg estimated that retail investors may have lost approximately million on Facebook stock since its debut UBS alone may have lost as much as million The Nasdaq stock exchange offered million to investment firms plagued by offering day computer glitches While considerably higher than the usual million limit on reimbursements it was unlikely to make up for large investor losses Additionally the rival New York Stock Exchange lampooned the move as a harmful precedent and an unnecessary subsidy in the wake of Nasdaq s missteps Nasdaq claimed to fix the problems that beset the offering and hired IBM for a technical review br The IPO impacted both Facebook investors and the company itself It was said to provide healthy rewards for venture capitalists who finally saw the fruits of their labor In contrast it was said to negatively affect individual investors such as Facebook employees who saw once valuable shares become less lucrative More generally the disappointing IPO was said to lower interest in the stock by investors That would make it more difficult for the company to accumulate cash reserves for large future expenditures such as acquisitions CBS News said the Facebook brand takes a pretty big hit for this mostly because of the public interest that had surrounded the offering br Some suggested implications for companies other than Facebook specifically The IPO could jeopardize profits for underwriters who face investors skeptical of the technology industry In the long run the troubled process makes it harder for the next social media company that wants to go public While the Wall Street Journal called for a broad perspective on the issue they agreed that valuations and funding for future startup IPOs could take a hit Online travel company Kayak com delayed its IPO roadshow in the wake of Facebook s troubles Analyst Trip Chowdhry suggested an even broader conclusion with regards to IPOs arguing that hype doesn t sell anymore short of fundamentals CBS News compared the situation to the dot com bubble warning that You d think we all would have learned our lesson from that period of overvaluation br While expected to provide significant benefits to Nasdaq the IPO resulted in a strained relationship between Facebook and the exchange Facebook has considered moving its listing to a competing exchange br br br Legal br br More than lawsuits were filed regarding the Facebook IPO in the month that followed br Reuters Alistair Barr reported that Facebook s lead underwriters Morgan Stanley MS JP Morgan JPM and Goldman Sachs GS all cut their earnings forecasts for the company in the middle of the IPO roadshow Some have filed lawsuits alleging that an underwriter for Morgan Stanley selectively revealed adjusted earnings estimates to preferred clients The remaining underwriters MS JPM GS and Facebook s CEO and board are also facing litigation It is believed that adjustments to earnings estimates were communicated to the underwriters by a Facebook financial officer who in turn used the information to cash out on their positions while leaving the general public with overpriced shares br Additionally a class action lawsuit is being prepared due to the trading glitches which led to botched orders Apparently the glitches prevented a number of investors from selling the stock during the first day of trading while the stock price was falling forcing them to incur bigger losses when their trades finally went through br In June Facebook asked for all the lawsuits to be consolidated into one because of overlap in their content br Morgan Stanley settled allegations of improperly influencing research analysts for million in December br br br Regulatory br Facebook s IPO is now under investigation and has been compared to pump and dump schemes Government officials called for investigations in the following weeks Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA Chairman Rick Ketchum called for a review of the circumstances surrounding the troubled IPO On May regulators from Wall Street s Financial Industry Regulatory Authority announced that they had begun to investigate whether banks underwriting Facebook had improperly shared information only with select clients rather than the general public Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin subpoenaed Morgan Stanley over the same issue The allegations sparked fury among some investors and led to the immediate filing of several lawsuits one of them a class action suit claiming more than billion in losses due to the IPO br br br Secondary exchanges br Before the creation of secondary market exchanges like SecondMarket and SharesPost shares of private companies had very little liquidity however this is no longer the case Facebook employees had been finding private buyers to unload their shares as early as and when SharesPost launched in early employees started exiting en masse Class B shares of Facebook traded as high as share share after commissions on SharesPost prior to the IPO br br br Reputational br The reputation of both Morgan Stanley the primary IPO underwriter and NASDAQ were damaged in the fallout from the botched offering br In interviews with the media bankers seemed sanguine about the outcome We think Morgan has done pretty well on the deal one person at a bank that was one of Facebook s other underwriters told CNN Money Reputation of the bank aside Facebook hasn t been a bad trade for Morgan This is because even as the share prices dropped Morgan racked up big profits trading the shares br Morgan s reputation in technology IPOs was in trouble after the Facebook offering Underwriting equity offerings became an important part of Morgan s business after the financial crisis generating billion in fees since But by signing off on an offering price that was too high or attempting to sell too many shares to the market Morgan compounded problems senior editor for CNN Money Stephen Gandel writes According to Brad Hintz an analyst at Sanford Bernstein this is something that other banks will be able to use against them when competing for deals br br br Notes br br br
