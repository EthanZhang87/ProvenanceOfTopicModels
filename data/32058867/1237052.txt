The Audio Engineering Society AES is a professional body for engineers scientists other individuals with an interest or involvement in the professional audio industry The membership largely comprises engineers developing devices or products for audio and persons working in audio content production It also includes acousticians audiologists academics and those in other disciplines related to audio The AES is the only worldwide professional society devoted exclusively to audio technology br Established in the Society develops reviews and publishes engineering standards for the audio and related media industries and produces the AES Conventions which are held twice a year alternating between Europe and the US The AES and individual regional or national sections also hold AES Conferences on different topics during the year br br br History br The idea of a society dedicated solely to audio engineering had been discussed for some time before the first meeting but was first proposed in print in a letter by Frank E Sherry of Victoria Texas in the December issue of the magazine Audio Engineering A New York engineer and audio consultant C J LeBel then published a letter agreeing and saying that a group of audio professionals had already been discussing such a thing and that they were interested in holding an organizational meeting He asked interested persons to contact him for details The response was enthusiastic and encouraging Fellow engineer Norman C Pickering published the date for an organizational meeting and announced the appointment of LeBel as acting chairman and himself as acting secretary br The organizational meeting was held at the RCA Victor Studios in New York City on February Acting chairman LeBel spoke first emphasizing the professional non commercial independent nature of the proposed organization Acting Secretary Norman Pickering then discussed the need for a professional organization that could foster an exchange of knowledge in this quickly growing field The group agreed to form the Audio Engineering Society and confirmed the acting executive committee which consisted of John D Colvin C J LeBel C G McProud Norman C Pickering and Chester O Rackey br The first AES technical membership meeting followed on March with about attendees The guest speaker at the first meeting was Harry F Olson a prominent engineer and scientist at RCA and author of Acoustical Engineering who spoke on Problems of High Fidelity Reproduction br br br Membership br As of has over members Members elect a Board of Governors and officers who jointly set policies and procedures for the Society The AES is a tax exempt c non profit corporation headquartered in New York br br br Journal br The AES publishes a peer reviewed journal the Journal of the Audio Engineering Society JAES br br br Conventions and conferences br The AES produces two conventions each year as well as a number of topic specific conferences The fall convention is in North America and the spring convention is in Europe The first convention was in br br br Technical Council br Technical Committees advise the AES Technical Council on emerging trends and areas of interest in the audio engineering community The Committee meetings held at Conventions are open to participation by members and non members alike and are the venue for planning workshops seminars and conferences in specific technical areas br br br Standards br The AES has been involved in setting technical standards for audio since The AES Standards Committee AESSC through a consensus system open to anyone materially affected by such standards develops and publishes a number of standards on the subject of analog and digital audio recording transmission and or reproduction Notable standards include br br AES also commonly known as AES EBU for digital audio interconnection br AES also commonly known as MADI for multichannel digital audio interconnection br AES for digital audio synchronization br AES file exchange format br AES for digitally interfaced microphones br AES AES and AES for sending AES digital audio data over Asynchronous Transfer Mode networks br AES on interconnections grounding and EMC practices and shields of connectors in audio equipment containing active circuitry br AES for coarse groove mechanical audio recordings br AES for audio over IP interoperability br AESSC also provides input to IEC for development and revision of international standards in audio engineering br AES does not charge for participation in the standards process but does charge non members for online copies of published standards Printed copies are available for a charge to both members and non members br br br Gold Medal recipients br The AES Gold Medal is the Society s highest honor and given in recognition of outstanding achievements sustained over a period of years in the field of Audio Engineering The award was established in it was formerly known as the John H Potts Memorial Award br br br Awardees in chronological order br br br British section br The AES British Section which was the first and is also the largest outside the US issues a monthly newsletter and holds regular lectures usually in London with occasional visits to studios and other places of interest Lectures which are often on topics of topical interest to audio enthusiasts are usually recorded with past lectures available to all as free MP downloads sometimes with accompanying slides in PDF format br br br Connection with the VDT br Although there are several German sections of the AES and there is no formal connection to the Verband Deutscher Tonmeister the goals and activities of both organizations are closely related and there are several instances of double memberships e g in the persons of Benjamin Bernfeld Gerhard Steinke and G nther Theile br br br See also br Acoustical Society of America br Institute of Acoustics Chinese Academy of Sciences br
