cruel war br According to Khashoggi Lebanon s Prime Minister Saad Hariri s forced resignation in a live television broadcast from Saudi Arabia on November could in part be due to the Trump effect particularly the U S president s strong bond with MBS The two despise Iran and its proxy Hezbollah a sentiment the Israelis share br Khashoggi wrote in August that Saudi Arabia s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman known by his initials MBS is signaling that any open opposition to Saudi domestic policies even ones as egregious as the punitive arrests of reform seeking Saudi women is intolerable According to Khashoggi while MBS is right to free Saudi Arabia from ultra conservative religious forces he is wrong to advance a new radicalism that while seemingly more liberal and appealing to the West is just as intolerant of dissent Khashoggi also wrote that MBS s rash actions are deepening tensions and undermining the security of the Gulf states and the region as a whole br Khashoggi criticized Abdel Fatteh el Sisi s government in Egypt According to Khashoggi Egypt has jailed opposition members and is deserving of criticism as well Khashoggi wrote that despite U S President Barack

Arabia According to CNN he also had embraced the Enlightenment and the American idea of the separation of church and state According to Egypt Today Khashoggi revealed yes I joined the Muslim Brotherhood organization when I was at university and I was not alone Some of the current ministers and deputies did but later every one of us developed their own political tendencies and views

no political reform and democracy in any Arab country without accepting that political Islam is a part of it The Irish Times journalist Lara Marlowe wrote that If Christian democracy was possible in Europe why could Arabs not be ruled by Muslim democracy Jamal asked That may explain his friendship with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan Erdogan constituted the greatest hope of Muslim

according to experts on the Middle East who have tracked his career br Donald Trump Jr promoted the idea that Khashoggi was a jihadist According to David Ignatius Khashoggi was in his early s a passionate member of the Muslim Brotherhood The brotherhood was a secret underground fraternity that wanted to purge the Arab world of the corruption and autocratic rule it saw as a legacy of Western colonialism According to The New York Times Khashoggi balanced what appears to have been a private affinity for democracy and political Islam with his long service to the royal Saudi family and that His attraction to political Islam helped him forge a personal bond with President Erdogan of Turkey It also states that Several of his friends say that early on Mr Khashoggi also joined the Muslim Brotherhood and that Although he later stopped attending meetings of the Brotherhood he remained conversant in its conservative Islamist and often anti Western rhetoric which he could deploy or hide depending on whom he was seeking to befriend The newspaper also writes that By the time he reached his s Mr Khashoggi s relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood was ambiguous Several Muslim Brothers said this week that they always felt he was with them Many of his secular friends would not have believed it br According to Anthony Cordesman the national security analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies Khashoggi s ties to the Muslim Brotherhood do not seem to have involved any links to extremism According to The Spectator Khashoggi and his fellow travellers believe in imposing Islamic rule by engaging in the democratic process and that In truth Khashoggi never had much time for western style pluralistic democracy and that he was a political Islamist until the end

committee for support to the Afghan mujahideen for unwisely funding Salafist extremist groups that were undermining the war br Al Arabiya reported that Khashoggi once tried to persuade bin Laden to quit violence In he was sent to Khartoum by the Saudi government to convince bin Laden to abandon jihad which Crown Prince Abdullah promised would be reciprocated with a restoration of bin Laden s Saudi citizenship and readmission into Saudi Arabia During their first meeting bin Laden claimed to have moved on to peaceful agricultural and construction projects and repeatedly condemned the use of violence but refused to allow Khashoggi to record his statements During their second meeting bin Laden became more belligerent and called for a military campaign to drive the United States out of the Arabian Peninsula On the third meeting bin Laden refused to publicly condemn the use of violence without Saudi concessions such as a full pardon or an American military withdrawal br Khashoggi said I was very much surprised in to see Osama turning into radicalism the way he did Khashoggi was the only non royal Saudi Arabian who knew of the royals intimate dealing with al Qaeda in the lead up to the September attacks He dissociated himself from bin Laden following the attacks br Khashoggi wrote in response to September attacks The most pressing issue now is to ensure that our children can never be influenced by extremist ideas like those Saudis who were misled into hijacking four planes that fine September day piloting them and us straight into the jaws of hell br The New York Times describes that after SEAL Team Six killed Osama bin Laden in Khashoggi mourned his old acquaintance and what he had become He wrote on Twitter I collapsed crying a while ago heartbroken for you Abu

On November U S President Donald Trump rejected the CIA s conclusion that Crown Prince bin Salman had ordered the killing He issued a statement saying it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event maybe he did and maybe he didn t and that In any case our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Two days later Trump denied that the CIA had even reached a conclusion His statements were criticized by Congressional representatives from both parties who promised to investigate the matter Adam Schiff the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee who was briefed by the CIA on the agency assessment accused President Trump of lying about the CIA findings br On December in opposition to the Trump administration s position the United States Senate unanimously passed a resolution that held bin Salman personally responsible for the death of Khashoggi On the same day the Senate voted to pass legislation to end U S military aid for the Saudi Arabian led intervention in Yemen a vote attributable to senators desires to punish Saudi Arabia for the Khashoggi murder and for the humanitarian crisis in Yemen including a famine and human rights violations This was the first ever invocation of the War Powers Act by the Senate The U S House of Representatives narrowly blocked consideration of any War Powers Resolution restricting U S actions relating to Yemen for the rest of the year br In June when President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with bin Salman to discuss military matters they did not bring up the subject of Khashoggi s assassination A week later at the G Osaka summit during a group photo of international leaders Trump shook bin Salman s hand Pompeo reiterated his efforts to minimize Saudi responsibility in the killing in a book released in January Never Give an Inch Fighting for the America I Love when he returned to his theme that the gruesome death was of little consequence that the victim was only an activist He further described Khashoggi as being cozy with the terrorist supporting the Muslim Brotherhood br On March the U S State Department in its Country Reports on Human Rights Practices

six other federal agencies disclose all records relating to the assassination br According to Bob Woodward s book Rage Trump protected bin Salman from Congress following the murder of Khashoggi According to an interview with Woodward mentioned in the book Trump boasted of saving bin Salman s reputation saying I saved his ass Trump also claimed that Saudi Arabia has invested hundreds of billions of dollars into U S military equipment and training and defended his decision to preserve the Saudi relationship as a means of protecting the billions of dollars of annual arms sales between the two countries br In January with the incoming U S administration under Joe Biden the newly confirmed Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines was pressured to declassify the report on Khashoggi s assassination without delay The Trump administration had blocked its declassification despite being legally required to release it U S senator Ron Wyden asked Haines during her confirmation hearing on January where she confirmed Yes senator absolutely We will follow the law Agn s Callamard the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings praised the move saying the information would provide the one essential missing piece of the puzzle of the execution of Jamal Khashoggi br In September The Wall Street Journal reported that the Public Interest Declassification Board PIDB advised President Biden to declassify the full U S intelligence report on the murder of Khashoggi in June weeks before Biden traveled to Saudi Arabia and met with bin Salman A declassified summary had been previously released in February prompting the U S to impose sanctions and travel bans on several Saudi security officials albeit without targeting bin Salman directly br In response to the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi Judge John Bates was said to produce his judgement against crown prince Mohammed bin Salman s involvement in the murder The decision came to a contradiction whether to consider the prince as an heir to the Saudi throne and thus grant him immunity from the U S courts or not since he was still a king in waiting On being allowed to proceed the case would allow going into the details of the assassination and the potential deposition of the prince or his brother the Saudi ambassador to the U S at the time Judge Bates decision is said to be reliant on that of the Biden administration whose siding with the prince would lead to havoc amongst human rights advocates Biden administration s opinion was said to be filed in the court by no later than November Keith Harper leading the case against the Saudi prince is a former Obama administration official who has criticized the Saudi prince s designation as a Prime Minister a means of attempting to manipulate the court s jurisdiction br On November the Biden administration ruled that Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has immunity from a lawsuit over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi Senior Democratic lawmakers sharply criticized the Biden administration s action Legal experts said that the U S government s position will likely lead judge John Bates to dismiss a civil case brought against Prince Mohammed and his alleged accomplices by Hatice Cengiz br On November following the assertion from the Biden administration that Mohammed bin Salman was immune to liability as a foreign head of state Hatice Cengiz urged a U S judge to allow her lawsuit to move forward against Saudi Arabian Crown Prince But on December U S federal judge John D Bates dismissed the lawsuit citing Joe Biden s granting of immunity to the prince Bates also issued a dismissal for two top Mohammed bin Salman aides as well Saud al Qahtani and Ahmed al Assiri on jurisdictional grounds br br br Commentary br The Middle East correspondent of The Independent Patrick Cockburn wrote that the killing of Jamal Khashoggi is by no means the worst act carried out by Saudi Arabia since though it is much the best publicised Saudi leaders imagined that having got away with worse atrocities in Yemen that any outcry over the death of a single man in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul was something they could handle br Vanity Fair reported that several House Republicans have mounted a whisper campaign to discredit Khashoggi or at least to knock his reputation down a few notches based on his ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and his role as an embedded journalist who covered Osama bin Laden The campaign to discredit Khashoggi which might have once been executed surreptitiously is now front and center on Twitter and echoing on Fox News br br br Personal life br Khashoggi was described as an observant Muslim br Khashoggi was reportedly married and divorced at least three times though there is

outside the Saudi embassy one month after Khashoggi disappeared into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul br In Washington D C a petition was started to rename the Foggy Bottom street on which the Saudi embassy in Washington DC stands as Jamal Khashoggi Way In late November local officials voted to rename the street in honor of Jamal Khashoggi subject to approval by the city council The city council
