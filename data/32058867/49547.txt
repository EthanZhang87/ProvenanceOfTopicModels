title: Hyperlink
id: 49547
In computing a hyperlink or simply a link is a digital reference to data that the user can follow or be guided to by clicking or tapping A hyperlink points to a whole document or to a specific element within a document Hypertext is text with hyperlinks The text that is linked from is known as anchor text A software system that is used for viewing and creating hypertext is a hypertext system and to create a hyperlink is to hyperlink or simply to link A user following hyperlinks is said to navigate or browse the hypertext br The document containing a hyperlink is known as its source document For example in content from Wikipedia or Google Search many words and terms in the text are hyperlinked to definitions of those terms Hyperlinks are often used to implement reference mechanisms such as tables of contents footnotes bibliographies indexes and glossaries br In some hypertext hyperlinks can be bidirectional they can be followed in two directions so both ends act as anchors and as targets More complex arrangements exist such as many to many links br The effect of following a hyperlink may vary with the hypertext system and may sometimes depend on the link itself for instance on the World Wide Web most hyperlinks cause the target document to replace the document being displayed but some are marked to cause the target document to open in a new window or perhaps in a new tab Another possibility is transclusion for which the link target is a document fragment that replaces the link anchor within the source document Not only persons browsing the document may follow hyperlinks These hyperlinks may also be followed automatically by programs A program that traverses the hypertext following each hyperlink and gathering all the retrieved documents is known as a Web spider or crawler br br An inline link displays remote content without the need for embedding the content The remote content may be accessed with or without the user following the link br An inline link may display a modified version of the content for instance instead of an image a thumbnail low resolution preview cropped section or magnified section may be shown The full content is then usually available on demand as is the case with print publishing software e g with an external link This allows for smaller file sizes and quicker response to changes when the full linked content is not needed as is the case when rearranging a page layout br br An anchor hyperlink anchor link is a link bound to a portion of a document which is often called a fragment The fragment is generally a portion of text or a heading though not necessarily For instance it may also be a hot area in an image image map in HTML a designated often irregular part of an image br Fragments are marked with anchors in any of various ways which is why a link to a fragment is called an anchor link that is a link to an anchor For example in XML the element anchor id name provides anchoring capability as long as the DTD or schema defines it and in wiki markup anchor name is a typical example of implementing it In word processor apps anchors can be inserted where desired and may be called bookmarks In URLs the hash character precedes the name of the anchor for the fragment br One way to define a hot area in an image is by a list of coordinates that indicate its boundaries For example a political map of Africa may have each country hyperlinked to further information about that country A separate invisible hot area interface allows for swapping skins or labels within the linked hot areas without repetitive embedding of links in the various skin elements br Text hyperlink Hyperlink is embedded into a word or a phrase and makes this text clickable br Image hyperlink Hyperlink is embedded into an image and makes this image clickable br Bookmark hyperlink Hyperlink is embedded into a text or an image and takes visitors to another part of a web page br E mail hyperlink Hyperlink is embedded into e mail address and allows visitors to send an e mail message to this e mail address br br A fat link also known as a one to many link an extended link or a multi tailed link is a hyperlink which leads to multiple endpoints the link is a set valued function br br Tim Berners Lee saw the possibility of using hyperlinks to link any information to any other information over the Internet Hyperlinks were therefore integral to the creation of the World Wide Web Web pages are written in the hypertext mark up language HTML br This is what a hyperlink to the home page of the W C organization could look like in HTML code br br This HTML code consists of several tags br br The hyperlink starts with an anchor opening tag a and includes a hyperlink reference href https www w org to the URL for the page The URL is enclosed in quotes br The URL is followed by marking the end of the anchor opening tag br The words that follow identify what is being linked this is the only part of the code that is ordinarily visible on the screen when the page is rendered but when the cursor hovers over the link many browsers display the target URL somewhere on the screen such as in the lower left hand corner br Typically these words are underlined and colored for example blue for a link that has not yet been visited and purple for a link already visited br The anchor closing tag a terminates the hyperlink code br The a tag can also consist of various attributes such as the rel attribute which specifies the relationship between the current document and linked document br Webgraph is a graph formed from web pages as vertices and hyperlinks as directed edges br br The W C recommendation called XLink describes hyperlinks that offer a far greater degree of functionality than those offered in HTML These extended links can be multidirectional remove linking from within and between XML documents It can also describe simple links which are unidirectional and therefore offer no more functionality than hyperlinks in HTML br br Permalinks are URLs that are intended to remain unchanged for many years into the future yielding hyperlinks that are less susceptible to link rot Permalinks are often rendered simply that is as friendly URLs so as to be easy for people to type and remember Permalinks are used in order to point and redirect readers to the same Web page blog post or any online digital media br The scientific literature is a place where link persistence is crucial to the public knowledge A study in BMC Bioinformatics analyzed links in abstracts from Thomson Reuters Web of Science citation index founding that the median lifespan of Web pages was years and just were archived The median lifespan of a Web page constitutes high degree variable but its order of magnitude usually is of some months br br A link from one domain to another is said to be outbound from its source anchor and inbound to its target br The most common destination anchor is a URL used in the World Wide Web This can refer to a document e g a webpage or other resource or to a position in a webpage The latter is achieved by means of an HTML element with a name or id attribute at that position of the HTML document The URL of the position is the URL of the webpage with a fragment identifier id attribute appended br When linking to PDF documents from an HTML page the id attribute can be replaced with syntax that references a page number or another element of the PDF for example page br br A web browser usually displays a hyperlink in some distinguishing way e g in a different color font or style or with certain symbols following to visualize link target or document types This is also called link decoration The behavior and style of links can be specified using the Cascading Style Sheets CSS language br In a graphical user interface the appearance of a mouse cursor may change into a hand motif to indicate a link In most graphical web browsers links are displayed in underlined blue text when they have not been visited but underlined purple text when they have When the user activates the link e g by clicking on it with the mouse the browser displays the link s target If the target is not an HTML file depending on the file type and on the browser and its plugins another program may be activated to open the file br The HTML code contains some or all of the five main characteristics of a link br br link destination href pointing to a URL br link label br link title br link target br link class or link id br It uses the HTML element a with the attribute href HREF is an abbreviation for Hypertext REFerence and optionally also the attributes title target and class or id br br a href URL title link title target link target class link class link label a br To embed a link into a web page blogpost or comment it may take this form br br a href https example com Example a br In a typical web browser this would display as the underlined word Example in blue which when clicked would take the user to the example com website This contributes to a clean easy to read text or document br By default browsers will usually display hyperlinks as such br br An unvisited link is usually blue and underlined br A visited link is usually purple and underlined br An active link is usually red and underlined br When the cursor hovers over a link depending on the browser and graphical user interface some informative text about the link can be shown popping up not in a regular window but in a special hover box which disappears when the cursor is moved away sometimes it disappears anyway after a few seconds and reappears when the cursor is moved away and back Mozilla Firefox IE Opera and many other web browsers all show the URL In addition the URL is commonly shown in the status bar br Normally a link opens in the current frame or window but sites that use frames and multiple windows for navigation can add a special target attribute to specify where the link loads If no window exists with that name a new window is created with the ID which can be used to refer to the window later in the browsing session br Creation of new windows is probably the most common use of the target attribute To prevent accidental reuse of a window the special window names blank and new are usually available and always cause a new window to be created It is especially common to see this type of link when one large website links to an external page The intention in that case is to ensure that the person browsing is aware that there is no endorsement of the site being linked to by the site that was linked from However the attribute is sometimes overused and can sometimes cause many windows to be created even while browsing a single site br Another special page name is top which causes any frames in the current window to be cleared away so that browsing can continue in the full window br br The term link was coined in or possibly by Ted Nelson at the start of Project Xanadu Nelson had been inspired by As We May Think a popular essay by Vannevar Bush In the essay Bush described a microfilm based machine the Memex in which one could link any two pages of information into a trail of related information and then scroll back and forth among pages in a trail as if they were on a single microfilm reel br In a series of books and articles published from through Nelson transposed Bush s concept of automated cross referencing into the computer context made it applicable to specific text strings rather than whole pages generalized it from a local desk sized machine to a theoretical proprietary worldwide computer network and advocated the creation of such a network Though Nelson s Xanadu Corporation was eventually funded by Autodesk in the s it never created this proprietary public access network Meanwhile working independently a team led by Douglas Engelbart with Jeff Rulifson as chief programmer was the first to implement the hyperlink concept for scrolling within a single document and soon after for connecting between paragraphs within separate documents with NLS Ben Shneiderman working with graduate student Dan Ostroff designed and implemented the highlighted link in the HyperTIES system in HyperTIES was used to produce the world s first electronic journal the July Communications of the ACM which was cited as the source for the link concept in Tim Berners Lee s Spring manifesto for the Web In Ben Shneiderman and Greg Kearsley used HyperTIES to publish Hypertext Hands On the world s first electronic book br Released in for the Apple Macintosh the database program HyperCard allowed for hyperlinking between various pages within a document as well as to other documents and separate applications on the same computer In Windows Help which was introduced with Microsoft Windows had widespread use of hyperlinks to link different pages in a single help file together in addition it had a visually different kind of hyperlink that caused a popup help message to appear when clicked usually to give definitions of terms introduced on the help page The first widely used open protocol that included hyperlinks from any Internet site to any other Internet site was the Gopher protocol from It was soon eclipsed by HTML after the release of the Mosaic browser which could handle Gopher links as well as HTML links HTML s advantage was the ability to mix graphics text and hyperlinks unlike Gopher which just had menu structured text and hyperlinks br br While hyperlinking among webpages is an intrinsic feature of the web some websites object to being linked by other websites some have claimed that linking to them is not allowed without permission br Contentious in particular are deep links which do not point to a site s home page or other entry point designated by the site owner but to content elsewhere allowing the user to bypass the site s own designated flow and inline links which incorporate the content in question into the pages of the linking site making it seem part of the linking site s own content unless an explicit attribution is added br In certain jurisdictions it is or has been held that hyperlinks are not merely references or citations but are devices for copying web pages In the Netherlands Karin Spaink was initially convicted in this way of copyright infringement by linking although this ruling was overturned in The courts that advocate this view see the mere publication of a hyperlink that connects to illegal material to be an illegal act in itself regardless of whether referencing illegal material is illegal In Josephine Ho was acquitted of hyperlinks that corrupt traditional values in Taiwan br In British Telecom sued Prodigy claiming that Prodigy infringed its patent U S patent on web hyperlinks After litigation a court found for Prodigy ruling that British Telecom s patent did not cover web hyperlinks br In United States jurisprudence there is a distinction between the mere act of linking to someone else s website and linking to content that is illegal e g gambling illegal in the US or infringing e g illegal MP copies Several courts have found that merely linking to someone else s website even if by bypassing commercial advertising is not copyright or trademark infringement regardless of how much someone else might object Linking to illegal or infringing content can be sufficiently problematic to give rise to legal liability Compare for a summary of the current status of US copyright law as to hyperlinking see the discussion regarding the Arriba Soft and Perfect cases br Somewhat controversially Vuestar Technologies has tried to enforce patents applied for by its owner Ronald Neville Langford around the world relating to search techniques using hyperlinked images to other websites or web pages br br Backlink br Dereference operator br Internal link br Link building br Link rot br Object hyperlinking br Overlinking br
