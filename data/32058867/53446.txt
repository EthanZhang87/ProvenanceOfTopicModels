as the Pueblo de San Jos de Guadalupe the first city founded in the Californias It became a part of Mexico in after the Mexican War of Independence br Following the American Conquest of California during the Mexican American War the territory was ceded to the United States in After California achieved statehood two years later San Jose was designated as the state s first capital Following World War II San Jose experienced an economic boom with a rapid population growth and aggressive annexation of nearby cities and communities carried out in the s and s The rapid growth of the high

San Jose based on local usage and the formal incorporated name br In the s and s some residents and officials advocated for returning to the original spelling of San Jos with the acute accent on the e to acknowledge the city s Mexican origin and Mexican American population On June the city adopted a flag designed by historian Clyde Arbuckle that prominently featured the inscription SAN JOS CALIFORNIA On June San Jose State College officially adopted San Jos as the city s name including in the college s own name On August the San Jose City Council approved a proposal by Catherine Linquist to rename the city San Jos but reversed itself a week later under pressure from residents concerned with the cost of changing typewriters documents and signs On April the city council once again adopted San Jos as the spelling of the city name on the city seal official stationery office titles and department names As late as the city charter stated the name of the municipal corporation as City of San Jose without the accent mark but later editions have added the accent mark br By convention the spelling San Jos is only used when the name is spelled in mixed upper and lowercase letters but not when the name is spelled only in uppercase letters as on the city logo The accent reflects the Spanish version of the name and the dropping of accents in all capital writing was once typical in Spanish While San Jos is commonly spelled both with and without the acute accent over the e the city s official guidelines indicate that it should be spelled with the accent most of the time and sets forth narrow exceptions such as when the spelling is in URLs when the name appears in all capital letters when the name is used on social media sites where the diacritical mark does not render properly and where San Jose is part of the proper name of another organization or business such as San Jose Chamber of Commerce that has chosen not to use the accent marked name br br br

dramatically From onward most of the Tamien people were forcibly enslaved at Mission Santa Clara de As s or Mission San Jos where they were baptized and educated to be Catholic neophytes also known as Mission Indians This continued until the mission was secularized by the Mexican Government in A large majority of the Tamien died either from disease in the missions or as a result of the state sponsored genocide Some surviving families remained intact migrating to Santa Cruz after their ancestral lands were granted to Spanish and Mexican Immigrants br br br Spanish period br br California was claimed as part of the Spanish Empire in when explorer Juan Rodr guez Cabrillo charted the Californian coast During this time Alta California and the Baja California peninsula were administered together as Province of the Californias Spanish Provincia de las Californias For nearly years the Californias remained a distant frontier region largely controlled by the numerous Native Nations and largely ignored by the government of the Viceroyalty of New Spain in Mexico City Shifting power dynamics in North America including the British American victory and acquisition of North America east of the Mississippi following the Treaty of Paris as well as the start of Russian colonization of northwestern North America prompted Spanish Mexican authorities to sponsor the Portol Expedition to survey Northern California in br In the Californias were included as part of the Captaincy General of the Provincias Internas a large administrative division created by Jos de G lvez Spanish Minister of the Indies in order to provide greater autonomy for the Spanish Empire s borderlands That year King Carlos III of Spain approved an expedition by Juan Bautista de Anza to survey the San Francisco Bay Area in order to choose the sites for two future settlements and their accompanying mission De Anza initially chose the site for a military settlement in San Francisco for the Royal Presidio of San Francisco and Mission San Francisco de As s On his way back to Mexico from San Francisco de Anza chose the sites in Santa Clara Valley for a civilian settlement San Jose on the eastern bank of the Guadalupe River and a mission on its western bank Mission Santa Clara de As s br br San Jose was officially founded as California s first civilian settlement on November as the Pueblo de San Jos de Guadalupe by Jos Joaqu n Moraga under orders of Antonio Mar a de Bucareli y Urs a Viceroy of New Spain San Jose served as a strategic settlement along El Camino Real connecting the military fortifications at the Monterey Presidio and the San Francisco Presidio as well as the California mission network In due to the severe flooding which characterized the pueblo San Jose s settlement was moved approximately a mile south centered on the Pueblo Plaza modern day Plaza de C sar Ch vez br In due to the growing population in the northern part of the Californias Diego de Borica Governor of the Californias officially split the province into two parts Alta California Upper California which would eventually become several western U S states and Baja California Lower California which would eventually become two Mexican states br br br Mexican period br br San Jose became part of the First Mexican Empire in after Mexico s War of Independence was won against the Spanish Crown and in part of the First Mexican Republic With its newfound independence and the triumph of the republican movement Mexico set out to diminish the Catholic Church s power within Alta California by secularizing the California missions in br In in order to promote settlement and economic activity within sparsely populated California the Mexican government began an initiative for Mexican and foreign citizens alike to settle unoccupied lands in California Between and thirty eight rancho land grants were issued in the Santa Clara Valley of which were located within modern day San Jose s borders Numerous prominent historical figures were among those granted rancho lands in the Santa Valley including James A Forbes founder of Los Gatos California granted Rancho Potrero de Santa Clara Antonio Su ol Alcalde of San Jose granted Rancho Los Coches and Jos Mar a Alviso Alcalde of San Jose granted Rancho Milpitas br In San Jose s population of approximately people included foreigners primarily

growth campaign The city annexed adjacent areas such as Alviso and Cambrian Park providing large areas for suburbs An anti growth reaction to the effects of rapid development emerged in the s championed by mayors Norman Mineta and Janet Gray Hayes Despite establishing an urban growth boundary development fees and the incorporations of Campbell and Cupertino development was not slowed but rather directed into already incorporated areas br br San Jose s position in Silicon Valley triggered further economic and population growth Results from the U S Census indicated that San Jose surpassed San Francisco as the most populous city in the Bay Area for the first time This growth led to the highest housing cost increase in the nation between and Efforts to increase density continued into the s when an update of the urban plan kept the urban growth boundaries intact and voters rejected a ballot measure to ease development restrictions in the foothills As of sixty percent of the housing built in San Jose since and over three quarters of the housing built since have been multifamily structures reflecting a political propensity toward Smart Growth planning principles br br br Geography br br San Jose is located at N W San Jose is located within the Santa Clara Valley in the southern part of the Bay Area in Northern California The northernmost portion of San Jose

property times growing the city from to sq mi to km absorbing the communities named above changing their status to neighborhoods br br They say San Jos is going to become another Los Angeles Believe me I m going to do everything in my power to make that come true br Sales taxes were a chief source of revenue Hamann would determine where major shopping areas would be and then annex narrow bands of land along major roadways leading to those locations pushing tentacles across the Santa Clara Valley and in turn walling off the expansion of adjacent communities br br During his reign it was said the City Council would vote according to Hamann s nod In the State of California imposed Local Agency Formation Commissions statewide but largely to try to maintain order with San Jose s aggressive growth Eventually the political forces against growth grew as local neighborhoods bonded together to elect their own candidates ending Hamann s influence and leading to his resignation While the job was not complete the trend was set The city had defined its sphere of influence in all directions sometimes chaotically leaving unincorporated pockets to be swallowed up by the behemoth sometimes even at the objection of the residents br Major thoroughfares in the city include Monterey Road the Stevens Creek Boulevard San Carlos Street corridor Santa Clara Street Alum Rock Avenue corridor Almaden

somewhat more sheltered from rain barely avoiding a cold semi arid BSk climate br Like most of the Bay Area San Jose is made up of dozens of microclimates Because of a more prominent rain shadow from
