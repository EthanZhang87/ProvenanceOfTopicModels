The Invisible Internet Project I P is an anonymous network layer implemented as a mix network that allows for censorship resistant peer to peer communication Anonymous connections are achieved by encrypting the user s traffic by using end to end encryption and sending it through a volunteer run network of roughly computers distributed around the world Given the high number of possible paths the traffic can transit a third party watching a full connection is unlikely The software that implements this layer is called an I P router and a computer running I P is called an I P node I P is free and open sourced and is published under multiple licenses br br br Technical design br I P started in as a fork of Freenet br The network is strictly message based like IP but a library is available to allow reliable streaming communication on top of it similar to Non blocking IO based TCP although from version a new Secure Semi reliable UDP transport is used All communication is end to end encrypted in total four layers of encryption are used when sending a message through garlic routing and even the end points destinations are cryptographic identifiers essentially a pair of public keys so that neither senders nor recipients of messages need to reveal their IP address to the other side or to third party observers br Although many developers had been a part of the Invisible IRC Project IIP and Freenet communities significant differences exist between their designs and concepts IIP was an anonymous centralized IRC server Freenet is a censorship resistant distributed data store I P is an anonymous peer to peer distributed communication layer designed to run any traditional internet service e g Usenet email IRC file sharing Web hosting and HTTP or Telnet as well as more traditional distributed applications e g a distributed data store a web proxy network using Squid or DNS br Many developers of I P are known only under pseudonyms While the previous main developer jrandom is currently on hiatus others such as zzz killyourtv and Complication have continued to lead development efforts and are assisted by numerous contributors br I P uses bit ElGamal AES SHA Session Tags encryption and Ed EdDSA ECDSA signatures br br br Releases br br I P has had a stable release every six to eight weeks Updates are distributed via I P torrents and are signed by the release manager generally zzz or str d br br br Funding br The website states that funding for I P comes entirely from donations Admins and managers of the project said that the core project itself doesn t take donations These should instead go to secondary applications or be spent on hiring others to work on I P Support for the onboarding for I P came from the Open Technology Fund In contrast to The Tor Project I P has not the financial or legal infrastructure to support a network of exit nodes The reseed servers a sort of bootstrap nodes which connect the user with the initial set of peers to join the I P network should be run by volunteers br br br Software br br Since I P is an anonymizing network layer it is designed so other software can use it for anonymous communication As such there are a variety of tools currently available for I P or in development br The I P router is controlled through the router console which is a web frontend accessed through a web browser br br br General networking br I PTunnel is an application embedded into I P that allows arbitrary TCP IP applications to communicate over I P by setting up tunnels which can be accessed by connecting to pre determined ports on localhost br SAM Simple Anonymous Messaging is a protocol which allows a client application written in any programming language to communicate over I P by using a socket based interface to the I P router br BOB Basic Open Bridge is a less complex app to router protocol similar to SAM br Orchid Outproxy Tor plugin br As of version released in July I P no longer allows I P access over Tor connections br br br Chat br Any IRC client made for the Internet Relay Chat can work once connected to the I P IRC server on localhost I P have the option to create tunnels that are specific for this usage where certain commands that could de anonymize the user are filtered out br Some XMPP clients like Gajim Pidgin or a modified Conversations client can work with I P XMPP servers using Prosody that are using the mod darknet module br br br File sharing br Several programs provide BitTorrent functionality for use within the I P network Users cannot connect to non I P torrents or peers from within I P nor can they connect to I P torrents or peers from outside I P I PSnark included in the I P install package is a port of the BitTorrent client named Snark Vuze formerly known as Azureus is a BitTorrent client that includes a plugin for I P allowing anonymous swarming through this network This plugin is still in an early stage of development however it is already fairly stable I P BT is a BitTorrent client for I P that allows anonymous swarming for file sharing This client is a modified version of the original BitTorrent program which runs on MS Windows and most dialects of Unix in a GUI and command line environment It was developed by the individual known as duck on I P in cooperation with smeghead It is no longer being actively developed however there is a small effort to upgrade the I P BT client up to par with the BitTorrent release I PRufus is an I P port of the Rufus BitTorrent client Robert P P Software is the most actively maintained I PRufus fork XD is a standalone BitTorrent client written in Go BiglyBT is a bittorrent client based on Vuze which also allows the use of i p for downloading seeding Additionally there exists a torrent index named Postman ran by the individual with the same name its rules says that it does not allow illegal content but warez and piracy is accepted br Two Kad network clients exist for the I P network iMule and Nachtblitz iMule invisible Mule is a port of eMule for I P network iMule has not been developed since iMule is made for anonymous file sharing In contrast to other eDonkey clients iMule only uses the Kademlia for proceeding to connect through I P network so no servers are needed Nachtblitz is a custom client built on the NET Framework The latest version is released on March Nachtblitz includes a time lock to disable the software one year after its release date br I Phex is a port of the popular Gnutella client Phex to I P It is stable and fairly functional br Tahoe LAFS has been ported to I P This allows for files to be anonymously stored in Tahoe LAFS grids br MuWire is a file sharing program inspired by the LimeWire Gnutella client that works atop the I P network The development of MuWire halted on February th br br br Bridging to clearnet br Currently Vuze and BiglyBT are the torrent clients that make clearnet connections not through I P torrents available on I P and vice versa Depending on the client settings torrents from the internet can be made available on I P via announcements to I P s DHT network and torrents from I P can be made available to the internet For this reason torrents previously published only on I P can be made available to the entire Internet and users of I P can often download popular content from the Internet while maintaining the anonymity of I P As of August the default outproxy is exit stormycloud i p which is run by StormyCloud Inc br br br Email br br I P Bote is a free fully decentralized and distributed anonymous email system with a strong focus on security It supports multiple identities and does not expose email metadata As of it is still considered beta software I P Bote is accessible via the I P web console interface or using standard email protocols i e IMAP SMTP All bote mails are transparently end to end encrypted and signed by the sender s private key thus removing the need for PGP or other email encryption software I P Bote offers additional anonymity by allowing for the use of mail relays with variable length delays Since it is decentralized there is no centralized email server that could correlate different email identities as communicating with each other i e profiling Even the nodes relaying the mails do not know the sender and apart from sender and receiver only the end of the high latency mail route and the storing nodes will know to whom which I P Bote address the user s IP address is still hidden by I P the mail is destined The original sender could have gone offline long before the email becomes available to the recipient No account registration is necessary all you have to do in order to use it is create a new identity I P Bote can be installed as an I P plugin br I P also has a free pseudonymous e mail service run by an individual called Postman Susimail is a web based email client intended primarily for use with Postman s mail servers and is designed with security and anonymity in mind Susimail was created to address privacy concerns in using these servers directly using traditional email clients such as leaking the user s hostname while communicating with the SMTP server It is currently included in the default I P distribution and can be accessed through the I P router console web interface Mail i p can contact both I P email users and public internet email users br Bitmessage ch can be used over I P br br br Instant messaging br I P Messenger is a simple Qt based serverless end to end encrypted instant messenger for I P No servers can log the user s conversations No ISP can log with whom the user chats when or for how long As it is serverless it can make use of I P s end to end encryption preventing any node between two parties from having access to the plain text I P Messenger can be used for fully anonymous instant communication with persons the user doesn t even know or alternatively to communicate securely and untraceably with friends family members or colleagues In addition to messaging file transfer is also supported br I P Talk is another simple instant messenger incompatible with I P Messenger but having the same security properties br br br Publishing br Syndie is a content distribution application suitable for blogs newsgroups forums and small media attachments Syndie is designed for network resilience It supports connections to I P the Tor network Syndie does not support Socks proxies workaround needed for Tor access Freenet and the regular internet Server connections are intermittent and support higher latency communications Connections can be made to any number of known servers Content is spread efficiently using a Gossip protocol br Aktie is an anonymous file sharing and distributed Web of trust forums system Aktie can connect to I P with its internal router or use an external router To fight spam hash payments proof of CPU work is computed for every published item br br br Routers br br i pd is a light weight I P router written in C stripping the excessive applications such as e mail torrents and others that can be regarded as bloat The I PSnark standalone BitTorrent client by I P Team can still be used with it br br br The Privacy Solutions project br The Privacy Solutions project a new organization that develops and maintains I P software launched several new development efforts designed to enhance the privacy security and anonymity for users based on I P protocols and technology br These efforts include br br The Abscond browser bundle br i pd an alternate implementation of I P written in C rather than Java br The BigBrother I P network monitoring project br The code repository and download sections for the i pd and Abscond project is available for the public to review and download br Effective January i pd is operating under PurpleI P br br br Android br br Release builds of an I P Router application for Android can be found on the Google Play store under The Privacy Solutions Project s Google Play account or on an F Droid repository hosted by the developers br Nightweb is an Android application that utilizes I P and Bittorrent to share blog posts photos and other similar content It can also be run as a desktop application It is no longer in development br br br Cryptocurrency br Some cryptocurrencies that support I P are listed below br br Bitcoin br Monero br Verge br br br Terminology br br Eepsite br Eepsites are websites that are hosted anonymously within the I P network Eepsite names end in i p such as ugha i p or forum i p EepProxy can locate these sites through the cryptographic identifier keys stored in the hosts txt file found within the I P program directory Typically I P is required to access these eepsites br i p br I p is a pseudo top level domain which is only valid within the I P overlay network scope i p names are resolved by browsers by submitting requests to EepProxy which will resolve names to an I P peer key and will handle data transfers over the I P network while remaining transparent to the browser br EepProxy br The EepProxy program handles all communication between the browser and any eepsite It functions as a proxy server that can be used by any web browser br Peers I P nodes br Other machines using I P that are connected to user s machine within the network Each machine within the network shares the routing and forwarding of encrypted packets br Tunnels br Every ten minutes a connection is established between the user s machine and another peer Data to and from the user along with the data for other peers routed through the user s machine pass through these tunnels and are forwarded to their final destination may include more jumps br netDb br The distributed hash table DHT database based on the Kademlia algorithm that holds information on I P nodes and I P eepsites This database is split up among routers known as floodfill routers When a user wants to know how to contact an eepsite or where more peers are they query the database br br br Vulnerabilities br Denial of service attacks are possible against websites hosted on the network though a site operator may secure their site against certain versions of this type of attack to some extent br A zero day vulnerability was discovered for I P in and was exploited to de anonymize at least users This included users of the operating system Tails This vulnerability was later patched br A study examining how forensic investigators might exploit vulnerabilities in I P software to gather useful evidence indicated that a seized machine which had been running I P router software may hold unencrypted local data that could be useful to law enforcement Records of which eepsites a user of a later seized machine was interested in may also be inferred The study identified a trusted I P domain registrar NO i p which appeared to have been abandoned by its administrator and which the study identified as a potential target for law enforcement takeover It alternatively suggested waiting for NO i p s server to fail only to social engineer the I P community into moving to a phony replacement Another suggestion the study proposed was to register a mirror version of a target website under an identical domain br br br I PCon br br From August to August an I P convention was held in Toronto Ontario The conference was hosted by a local hackerspace Hacklab The conference featured presentations from I P developers and security
