Western Tourkia and Khazaria Eastern Tourkia The Mamluk Sultanate with its ruling elite of Turkic origin was called the State of the Turks Dawlat at Turk or Dawlat al Atr k or Dawlat at Turkiyya

oldest Neolithic sites G bekli Tepe is close to years old Parts of Anatolia include the Fertile Crescent an origin of agriculture Neolithic Anatolian farmers differed genetically from farmers in Iran and Jordan Valley and spread farming into Europe Other important Neolithic sites include atalh y k and Alaca H y k Troy s earliest layers go back to the Chalcolithic It is not known if the Trojan war is based on historical events Troy s Late Bronze Age layers matches most with Iliad s story br Anatolia s historical records start with clay tablets from approximately around BC that were found in modern day K ltepe These tablets belonged to an Assyrian trade colony The languages in Anatolia at that time included Hattian Hurrian Hittite Luwian and Palaic Hattian was a language indigenous to Anatolia with no known modern day connections Hurrian language was used in northern Syria Hittite Luwian and Palaic languages were in the Anatolian sub group of Indo European languages with Hittite being the oldest attested Indo European language The origin of Indo European languages is unknown They may be native to Anatolia or non native br Hattian rulers were gradually replaced by Hittite rulers The Hittite kingdom was a large kingdom in Central Anatolia with its capital of Hattusa It co existed in Anatolia with Palaians and Luwians approximately between and BC As the Hittite kingdom was disintegrating further waves of Indo European peoples migrated from southeastern Europe which was followed by warfare br Around BC Phrygia had been established with its two centers in Gordium and modern day Kayseri Phrygians spoke an Indo European language but it was closer to Greek rather than Anatolian languages Phrygians shared Anatolia with Neo Hittites and Urartu Urartu s capital was around Lake Van Urartu was often in conflict with Assyria but fell with the attacks of Medes and Scythians in seventh century BC When Cimmerians attacked Phrygia fell around BC They were replaced by Carians Lycians and Lydians These three cultures can be considered a reassertion of the ancient indigenous culture of the Hattian cities of Anatolia br br br Early classical antiquity br br Before BC there were four Greek speaking settlements in Anatolia including Miletus Around BC Greeks started migrating to the west coast of Anatolia These eastern Greek settlements played a vital role in shaping the Archaic Greek civilization important cities included Miletus Ephesus Halicarnassus Smyrna now zmir and Byzantium now Istanbul the latter founded by colonists from Megara in the seventh century BCE These settlements were grouped as Aeolis Ionia and Doris after the specific Greek groups that settled them Further Greek colonization in Anatolia was led by Miletus and Megara in BC The Greek cities along the Aegean prospered with trade and saw remarkable scientific and scholarly accomplishments Thales and Anaximander from Miletus founded the Ionian School of philosophy thereby laying the foundations of rationalism and Western philosophy br br Cyrus attacked eastern Anatolia in BC and Achaemenid Empire eventually expanded into western Anatolia In the east the Armenian province was part of the Achaemenid Empire Following the Greco Persian Wars the Greek city states of the Anatolian Aegean coast regained independence but most of the interior stayed part of the Achaemenid Empire In northwestern Turkey Odrysian kingdom existed in th century BC Two of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus and the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus were located in Anatolia br Following the victories of Alexander in BC and BC the Achaemenid Empire collapsed and Anatolia became part of the Macedonian Empire This led to increasing cultural homogeneity and Hellenization of the Anatolian interior which met resistance in some places Following Alexander s death the Seleucids ruled large parts of Anatolia while native Anatolian states emerged in the Marmara and Black Sea areas In eastern Anatolia the kingdom of Armenia appeared In third century BC Celts invaded central Anatolia and continued as a major ethnic group in the area for around years They were known as the Galatians br br br Rome and Byzantine Empire br br When Pergamon requested assistance in its conflict with the Seleucids Rome intervened in Anatolia in the second century BC Without an heir Pergamum s

victorious Around the st century BC Rome expanded into parts of Pontus and Bithynia while turning rest of Anatolian states into Roman satellites Several conflicts with Parthians ensued with peace and wars alternating br According to Acts of the Apostles early Christian Church had significant growth in Anatolia because of St Paul s efforts Letters from St Paul in Anatolia comprise the oldest

with John continuing with them until the times of Trajan br br The Byzantine Empire also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire was the continuation of the Roman Empire centered in Constantinople during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages The eastern half of the Empire survived the conditions that caused the fall of the West in the th century AD and continued to exist until the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in During most of its existence the empire remained the most powerful economic cultural and military force in the Mediterranean world The term Byzantine Empire was only coined following the empire s demise its citizens referred to the polity as the Roman Empire and to themselves as Romans Due to the imperial seat s move from Rome to Byzantium the adoption of Christianity as the state religion and the predominance of Greek instead of Latin modern historians continue to make a distinction between the earlier Roman Empire and the later Byzantine Empire br In

speakers were potentially both hunter gatherers and farmers they later became nomadic pastoralists Early and medieval Turkic groups exhibited a wide range of both East Asian and West Eurasian physical appearances and genetic origins in part through long term contact with neighboring peoples such as Iranic Mongolic Tocharian Uralic and Yeniseian peoples During the th and th centuries CE the Oghuz were a Turkic group that lived in the Caspian and Aral steppes Partly due to pressure from the Kipchaks the Oghuz migrated into Iran and Transoxiana They mixed with Iranic speaking groups in the area

Ghaznavids at the Battle of Dandanaqan and established the Seljuk Empire in Greater Khorasan Baghdad the Abbasid Caliphate s capital and center of the Islamic world was taken by Seljuks in Given the role Khurasani traditions played in art culture and political traditions in the empire the Seljuk period is described as a mixture of Turkish Persian and Islamic influences In the latter half of the th century the Seljuk Turks began penetrating into medieval Armenia and Anatolia At the time Anatolia was a diverse and largely Greek speaking region after previously being Hellenized br The Seljuk Turks defeated the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in and later established the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum During this period there were also Turkish principalities such as Danishmendids Seljuk

the Russian conquest of the Caucasus According to some estimates Muslim Circassians died during the Circassian genocide in the territory of present day Russia the survivors of which sought refuge in the Ottoman Empire mostly settling in the provinces of present day Turkey The decline of the Ottoman Empire led to a rise in nationalist sentiment among its various subject peoples leading to increased ethnic tensions which occasionally burst into violence such as the Hamidian massacres of Armenians which claimed up to lives br br Ottoman territories in Europe Rumelia were lost in the First Balkan War Ottomans managed to recover some territory in Europe such as Edirne in the Second Balkan War In the th and early th centuries persecution of Muslims during the Ottoman contraction and

to F do occur in northeastern Anatolia and snow may lie on the ground for at least days of the year and during the entire year on the summits of the highest mountains In central Anatolia the temperatures can drop below C F with the mountains being even colder Mountains close to the coast prevent Mediterranean influences from extending inland giving the central Anatolian Plateau a continental climate with sharply contrasting seasons br Due to socioeconomic climatic and geographic factors Turkey is highly vulnerable to climate change This applies to nine out of ten climate vulnerability dimensions such as average annual risk to wellbeing OECD median is two out of ten Inclusive and swift growth is needed for decreasing vulnerability Turkey aims to achieve net zero
