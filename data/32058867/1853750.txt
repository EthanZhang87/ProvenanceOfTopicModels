Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley is a degree granting branch campus of Carnegie Mellon University located in Mountain View California It was established in at the NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field br The campus offers full time and part time professional Masters programs in Electrical and Computer Engineering Software Engineering and Software Management It has bi coastal split time between Pittsburgh and Silicon Valley Masters programs in Information Technology and a bi coastal Ph D program in Electrical and Computer Engineering br br br History br Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley opened in September under the name Carnegie Mellon University West Campus to an original class of students James H Morris the Dean of the School of Computer Science at the Pittsburgh campus helped establish the branch and served as the branch s first dean Raj Reddy a computer science professor at the Pittsburgh campus was the school s first director In the university s name was changed to Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley to better reflect the proximity to Silicon Valley In Dean Morris ended his appointment and the College of Engineering also known as Carnegie Institute of Technology or CIT at Carnegie Mellon University partnered with the Silicon Valley campus to bring more resources and a stronger connection to the main campus br br br Location br Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley is located at NASA s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field The campus is near high tech companies such as Google Microsoft Yahoo HP and Lockheed Martin Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley currently occupies Building and since January a wing in Building which provides space for full time masters students faculty and researchers An extension for Building has been in use since the Fall of br br br Programs br br br Master of Science in Software Engineering MS SE br In Fall Carnegie Mellon initiated a full time and part time Master of Science in Software Engineering degree This program is offered under the Electrical and Computer Engineering department and is only offered at the Silicon Valley campus It focuses on software engineering principles and students are required to take courses in Software Engineering and Design Analysis and Systems br br br Master of Science in Software Management MSSM br In Fall Carnegie Mellon initiated the Software Management Masters program The program targets senior software developers and managers that wish to pursue senior management and executive careers The full time MSSM program focuses on Product Management Strategy Development Entrepreneurship Enterprise Innovation and Service Management br For several years Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley operated a long distance capability to Pittsburgh s Tepper School of Business br br br Master of Science in Information Technology Mobility and Information Security MSIT MOB and MSIT IT br In Fall Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley initiated bi coastal master s degree programs in Information Technology with specializations in Mobility and Information Security through the Information Networking Institute In the bi coastal programs students are required to divide their time between the campuses in Pittsburgh and Silicon Valley and also complete an approved internship br br br Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering br The Masters in ECE program has equivalent course requirements between the Pittsburgh and Silicon Valley campuses The Silicon Valley campus offers courses in the fields of software engineering security wireless sensors mobile computing machine learning and wireless networking br br br Master of Science in Technology Ventures MSTV br The bi coastal Technology Ventures degree is an interdisciplinary program offered by the Integrated Innovation Institute This program is aimed at entrepreneurs to gain the skills for launching a business or venture Students are required to spend time at both the Pittsburgh and Silicon Valley campuses Students gain knowledge of engineering and emerging technologies at the Pittsburgh campus and gain skills in business entrepreneurship venture management and product innovation at the Silicon Valley campus br br br Ph D in Electrical and Computer Engineering br In Fall a Ph D program in Electrical and Computer Engineering was initiated offering students opportunities for advanced studies and research in the fields of mobility security and wireless sensors and networking br br br Student population br Approximately students are enrolled in Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley s academic programs About of the part time student population reside outside of the Bay Area Due to it being located in Silicon Valley many local students are from companies such as Yahoo Google IBM Lockheed Martin Oracle Boeing and Microsoft br Over alumni have graduated from the Silicon Valley campus since adding to the over Carnegie Mellon alumni working in the Bay Area br br br Research br The campus has a growing research effort which began in as a natural growth of the CyLab Mobility Research Center The research primarily focused on software mobility networking and security CMUSV has now grown into a research community with initiatives in wireless sensors machine learning context area computing security energy technology software and systems engineering and disaster management br More recently the research efforts have grown to include Disaster Management Language Technologies UAVs Antenna Optimization and Health Technology systems Research centers include the CyLab Mobility Research Center the Carnegie Mellon Innovations Lab CMIL the Center for Open Source Investigation COSI the International Center for Advanced Communication Technologies interACT and the Intelligent Systems Lab ISL br The Disaster Management Initiative DMI was established in with the mission to provide technical solutions to disaster prediction management and recovery br br br Silicon Valley Events br Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley has also organized software related events in Silicon Valley such as Carnegie Mellon s Tour de Silicon Valley where selected Carnegie Mellon students from the Pittsburgh campus are flown to Silicon Valley for a week of networking at various software companies br Currently the school offers TOCS Talks on Computing Systems a weekly talk given by a subject expert on various topics related to software and computing These talks are open to the public in addition to the faculty and students br The school has also organized in association with UC Berkeley regular software conferences for the software industry The first of these took place on April at the Microsoft Silicon Valley Campus and focused on The New Software Industry Forces at Play Business in Motion while the second conference took place on April at the Santa Clara Convention Center and focused on The Mobile Future Technology Revolutionizing our Lives br The campus has hosted a Disaster Management Workshop focusing on its growing research division in Disaster Response The day event included a crisis camp for practitioners to come and collaborate on improving disaster relief methodologies br br br The Fence br In August the graduating class presented a gift to the university by installing their own Carnegie Mellon University fence on the Silicon Valley campus The fence is a Carnegie Mellon tradition on the main campus where different student organizations repaint a long fence in the middle of the campus to promote a cause or spread a certain message Members of the class of collected money to hire a contractor to build and install a foot fence that was then subsequently painted with images symbolizing the west coast like the Golden Gate Bridge or NASA s Hangar One The fence was dedicated to Randy Pausch who died in the top of the fence reads Dedicated to Randy Pausch The remaining money was also donated and gift matched to a total of to the Randy Pausch Memorial Fund br br br Alumni br Many of CMUSV s alumni go on to work in nearby Silicon Valley companies including Google and Facebook ECE Ph D graduate Heng Tze Cheng created the wide and deep learning system for recommendation system at Google Faculty Joy Ying Zhang and the research staff of Mobile Technologies creator of Jibbigo were acquired by Facebook br br br br br br External links
