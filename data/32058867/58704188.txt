the content of video calls made through Portal devices br br br Reception br br br Critical reception br br br First generation br Dan Seifert of The Verge found the video and audio quality of Portal s video calling feature via Facebook Messenger to be better than that of competing devices and videotelephony services but said that Outside of video calling the Portal s functionality is rather limited In light of the Facebook Cambridge Analytica data scandal he expressed concerns that the product is always watching and always listening Megan Wollerton of CNET praised the device s autotracking wide angle cameras which allow the subject to remain centered in the device s field of view Wollerton also had reservations regarding Facebook s privacy policy in relation to Portal s video calls and wrote a spokesperson told us that Facebook will in fact track information about calls made via Portal to expand on the user profiles it uses to inform ads that show up elsewhere br In a PC Magazine review Sascha Segan said From a purely technical standpoint this is by far the best video calling appliance we ve seen and believed that Portal would be a good complement for remote workers if it gains integration with Workplace by Facebook a feature that is not yet released However Segan considered Portal a horror from a policy and privacy perspective because of the massive abuses of data on Facebook s consumer platform Writing for Tom s Guide Mike Prospero and Monica Chin criticized the large and obtrusive size of the display characterizing it as dystopian and more at home in a Black Mirror episode than in my living room or kitchen The reviewers echoed Ongoing privacy concerns but presented a favorable impression of Portal s automatic panning and audio quality br br br Second generation br In Engadget Nicole Lee complimented the second generation Portal s subdued appearance and ability to be used in both portrait and landscape orientations Adrienne So of Wired highlighted Portal s video tracking and augmented reality features but denounced Facebook s inclination to default to sharing more not less br Segan s review of the Portal TV in PC Magazine contrasted the device s competitive video calling capabilities with its thin support for streaming media services and criticized Facebook s data security record In a negative CNET review Wollerton stated that the Portal TV is a solidly performing decently priced device that just isn t suited for anyone because of the privacy concerns and increasingly alarming issues affecting Facebook br br br Reviews posted on Amazon by Facebook employees br On January The New York Times columnist Kevin Roose posted on Twitter that Facebook Portal s Amazon product listing contained five star reviews that appeared to have been written by Facebook employees including one who claimed to have historically not been a big Facebook or other social media user before purchasing Portal These reviews were written in violation of Amazon s community guidelines which forbid creating modifying or posting content regarding your or your relative s close friend s business associate s or employer s products or services In response Facebook s augmented and virtual reality vice president Andrew Bosworth stated that the reviews were neither coordinated nor directed from the company and indicated that Facebook would instruct the employees to remove them br br br br br br External links br Official website
