Civilisation br br Some of the earliest ancient human civilisations in South Asia originated from areas encompassing present day Pakistan The earliest known inhabitants in the region were Soanian during the Lower Paleolithic of whom artefacts have been found in the Soan Valley of Punjab The Indus region which covers most of the present day Pakistan was the site of several successive ancient cultures including the Neolithic BCE site of Mehrgarh and the year history of urban life in South Asia to the various sites of the Indus Valley Civilisation including Mohenjo daro and Harappa br br br Vedic period br br Following the decline of the Indus valley civilization Indo Aryan tribes moved into the Punjab from Central Asia in several waves of migration in the Vedic period BCE bringing with them their distinctive religious traditions and practices which fused with local culture The Indo Aryans religious beliefs and practices from the Bactria Margiana culture and the native Harappan Indus beliefs of the former Indus Valley Civilization eventually gave rise to Vedic culture and tribes Most notable among them was Gandhara civilization which flourished at the crossroads of India Central Asia and the Middle East connecting trade routes and absorbing cultural influences from diverse civilizations The initial early Vedic culture was a tribal pastoral society centered in the Indus Valley of what is today Pakistan During this period the Vedas the oldest scriptures of Hinduism were composed br br br Classical period br br The western regions of Pakistan became part of Achaemenid Empire around BCE In BCE Alexander the Great conquered the region by defeating various local rulers most notably the King Porus at Jhelum It was followed by the Maurya Empire founded by Chandragupta Maurya and extended by Ashoka the Great until BCE The Indo Greek Kingdom founded by Demetrius of Bactria BCE included Gandhara and Punjab and reached its greatest extent under Menander BCE prospering the Greco Buddhist culture in the region Taxila had one of the earliest universities and centres of higher education in the world which was established during the late Vedic period in the th century BCE

and the surrounding territories br br br Islamic conquest br The Arab conqueror Muhammad ibn Qasim conquered Sindh and some regions of Punjab in CE The Pakistan government s official chronology claims this as the time when the foundation of Pakistan was laid The Early Medieval period CE witnessed the spread of Islam in the region Before the arrival of Islam beginning in the th century the region of Pakistan was home to a diverse plethora of faiths including Hinduism Buddhism Jainism and Zoroastrianism During this period Sufi missionaries played a pivotal role in converting a majority of the regional population to Islam Upon the defeat of the Turk and Hindu Shahi dynasties which governed the Kabul Valley Gandhara present day Khyber Pakhtunkwa and western Punjab in the th to th centuries CE several successive Muslim empires ruled over the region including the Ghaznavid Empire CE the Ghorid Kingdom and the Delhi Sultanate CE The Lodi dynasty the last of the Delhi Sultanate was replaced by the Mughal Empire CE br br The Mughals introduced Persian literature and high culture establishing the roots of Indo Persian culture in the region In the region of modern day Pakistan key cities during the Mughal period were Multan Lahore Peshawar and Thatta which were chosen as the site of impressive Mughal buildings In the early th century the region remained under the Mughal Empire In the th century the slow disintegration of the Mughal Empire was hastened by the emergence of the rival powers of the Maratha Confederacy and later the Sikh Empire as well as invasions by Nader Shah from Iran in and the Durrani Empire of Afghanistan in The growing political power of the British in Bengal had not yet reached the territories of modern Pakistan br br br Colonial rule br br None of modern Pakistan was under British rule until when Karachi a small fishing village governed by Talpurs of Sindh with a mud fort guarding the harbour was taken and used as an enclave with a port and military base for the First Afghan War that ensued The remainder of Sindh was acquired in and subsequently through a series of wars and treaties the East India Company and later after the post Sepoy Mutiny direct rule by Queen Victoria of the British Empire acquired most of the region Key conflicts included those against the Baloch Talpur dynasty resolved by the Battle of Miani in Sindh the Anglo Sikh Wars and the Anglo Afghan Wars By all modern Pakistan was part of the British Indian Empire and remained so until independence in br Under British rule modern Pakistan was primarily divided into the Sind Division Punjab Province and the Baluchistan Agency The region also included various princely states with the largest being Bahawalpur br The major armed struggle against the British in the region was the rebellion known as the Sepoy Mutiny in Divergence in the relationship between Hinduism and Islam resulted in significant tension in British India leading to religious violence The language controversy further exacerbated tensions between Hindus and Muslims A Muslim intellectual movement led by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan to counter the Hindu renaissance advocated for the two nation theory and led to the establishment of the All India Muslim League in br In March in response to the Nehru Report Muhammad Ali Jinnah the founder of Pakistan issued his fourteen points which included proposals to safeguard the interests of the Muslim minority in a united India These proposals were rejected In his December address Allama Iqbal advocated the amalgamation of Muslim majority states in North West India including Punjab North West Frontier Province Sind and Baluchistan The perception that Congress led British provincial governments neglected the Muslim League from to motivated Jinnah and other Muslim League leaders to embrace the two nation theory This led to the adoption of the Lahore Resolution of presented by Sher e Bangla A K Fazlul Haque also known as the Pakistan Resolution br By Britain faced considerable strain during World War II with India directly threatened by Japanese forces Britain had pledged voluntary independence for India in exchange for support during the war However this pledge included a clause stating that no part of British India would be compelled to join the resulting dominion which could be interpreted as support for an independent Muslim nation Congress under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi launched the Quit India Movement demanding an immediate end to British rule In contrast the Muslim League chose to support the UK s war efforts thereby nurturing the possibility of establishing a Muslim nation br br br Independence br br The elections saw the Muslim League secure percent of the Muslim seats supported by the landowners of Sindh and Punjab This forced the Indian National Congress initially skeptical of the League s representation of Indian Muslims to acknowledge its significance Jinnah s emergence as the voice of the Indian Muslims compelled the British to consider their stance despite their reluctance to partition India In a final attempt to prevent partition they proposed the Cabinet Mission Plan br As the Cabinet Mission failed the British announced their intention to end rule by June Following rigorous discussions involving Viceroy of India Lord Mountbatten of Burma Muhammad Ali Jinnah of the All India Muslim League and Jawaharlal Nehru of Congress the formal declaration to partition British India into two independent dominions namely Pakistan and India was issued by Mountbatten on the evening of June In

Zindabad Long Live Pakistan br As the United Kingdom agreed to the partitioning of India the modern state of Pakistan was established on August th of Ramadan in of the Islamic Calendar considered to be the most blessed date from an Islamic perspective This new nation amalgamated the Muslim majority eastern and northwestern regions of British India comprising the provinces of Balochistan East Bengal the North West Frontier Province West Punjab and Sindh br In the riots that accompanied the partition in Punjab Province between and people were killed in what some have described as a retributive genocide between the religions Around Muslim women were abducted and raped by Hindu and Sikh men while Hindu and Sikh women experienced the same fate at the hands of Muslims Around million Muslims moved from India to West Pakistan and million Hindus and Sikhs moved from West Pakistan to India It was the largest mass migration in human history A subsequent dispute over the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir eventually sparked the Indo Pakistani War of br br br Post Independence br br After independence in Jinnah the President of the Muslim League became Pakistan s first Governor

of the party the nation s first Prime Minister From to Pakistan was a monarchy within the Commonwealth of Nations and had two monarchs before it became a republic br The creation of Pakistan was never fully accepted by many British leaders including Lord Mountbatten Mountbatten expressed his lack of support and faith in the Muslim League s idea of Pakistan Jinnah refused Mountbatten s offer to serve as Governor General of Pakistan When Mountbatten was asked by Collins and Lapierre if he would have sabotaged Pakistan had he known that Jinnah was dying of tuberculosis he replied most probably

liberation struggle br br Independent researchers estimate that between and civilians died during this period while the Bangladesh government puts the number of dead at three million a figure that is now nearly universally regarded as excessively inflated Some academics such as Rudolph Rummel and Rounaq Jahan say both sides committed genocide others such as Richard Sisson and Leo E Rose believe there was no genocide In response to India s support for the insurgency in East Pakistan preemptive strikes on India by Pakistan s air force navy and marines sparked a conventional war in that resulted in an Indian victory and East Pakistan gaining independence as Bangladesh br With Pakistan surrendering in the war Yahya Khan was replaced by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto as president the country
