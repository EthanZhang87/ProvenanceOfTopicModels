Zambia officially the Republic of Zambia is a landlocked country at the crossroads of Central Southern and East Africa It is typically referred to being in South Central Africa or Southern Africa It is bordered to the north by the Democratic Republic of the Congo Tanzania to the north east Malawi to the east Mozambique to the southeast Zimbabwe and Botswana to the south Namibia to the southwest and Angola to the west The capital city of Zambia is Lusaka located in the south central part of Zambia The population is concentrated mainly around Lusaka in the south and the Copperbelt Province to the north the core economic hubs of the country br Originally inhabited by Khoisan peoples the region was affected by the Bantu expansion of the thirteenth century Following European explorers in the th century the British colonised the region into the British protectorates of Barotziland North Western Rhodesia and North Eastern Rhodesia towards the end of the th century These were merged in to form Northern Rhodesia For most of the colonial period Zambia was governed by an administration appointed from London with the advice of the British South Africa Company br On October Zambia became independent of the United Kingdom and prime minister Kenneth Kaunda became the inaugural president Kaunda s socialist United National Independence Party UNIP maintained power from until Kaunda played a key role in regional diplomacy cooperating closely with the United States in search of solutions to conflicts in Southern Rhodesia Zimbabwe Angola and Namibia From to Zambia was a one party state with UNIP as the sole legal political party under the motto One Zambia One Nation coined by Kaunda Kaunda was succeeded by Frederick Chiluba of the social democratic Movement for Multi Party Democracy in beginning a period of socio economic development and government decentralisation Zambia has since become a multi party state and has experienced several peaceful transitions of power br Zambia contains abundant natural resources including minerals wildlife forestry freshwater and arable land In the World Bank named Zambia among the top reformers in the World Bank s Ease of doing business index As of the latest estimate in percent of the population is affected by multidimensional poverty The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa COMESA is headquartered in Lusaka br br br Etymology br br The territory of Zambia was known as Northern Rhodesia from to It was renamed Zambia in October on its independence from British rule The name Zambia derives from the Zambezi River Zambezi may mean the grand river br br br History br br br Prehistoric era br Archaeological excavation work on the Zambezi Valley and Kalambo Falls shows a succession of human cultures Ancient camp site tools near the Kalambo Falls have been radiocarbon dated to more than years ago br The fossil skull remains of Broken Hill Man also known as Kabwe Man dated between and years BC further shows that the area was inhabited by early humans Broken Hill Man was discovered in Zambia in Kabwe District br br br Khoisan and Batwa br br Modern Zambia once was inhabited by the Khoisan and Batwa peoples until around AD when migrating Bantu began to settle the areas It is believed the Khoisan people originated in East Africa and spread southwards around years ago The Twa people were split into two groups the Kafwe Twa lived around the Kafue Flats and the Lukanga Twa who lived around the Lukanga Swamp Many examples of ancient rock art in Zambia like the Mwela Rock Paintings Mumbwa Caves and Nachikufu Cave are attributed to these early hunter gatherers The Khoisan and especially the Twa formed a patron client relationship with farming Bantu peoples across central and southern Africa but were eventually either displaced by or absorbed into the Bantu groups br br br The Bantu Abantu br The Bantu people or Abantu meaning people are an enormous and diverse ethnolinguistic group that comprise the majority of people in much of eastern southern and central Africa Due to Zambia s location at the crossroads of Central Africa Southern Africa and the African Great Lakes the history of the people that constitute modern Zambians is a history of these three regions br Many of the historical events in these three regions happened simultaneously and thus Zambia s history like that of many African nations cannot be presented perfectly chronologically The early history of the peoples of modern Zambia is deduced from oral records archaeology and written records mostly from non Africans br br br Bantu origins br br The Bantu people originally lived in West and Central Africa around what is today Cameroon and Nigeria Around years ago they began a millennia long expansion into much of the continent This event has been called the Bantu expansion it was one of the largest human migrations in history The Bantu are believed to have been the first to have brought iron working technology into large parts of Africa The Bantu Expansion happened primarily through two routes a western one via the Congo Basin and an eastern one via the African Great Lakes br br br First Bantu settlement br The first Bantu people to arrive in Zambia came through the eastern route via the African Great Lakes They arrived around the first millennium C E and among them were the Tonga people also called Ba Tonga Ba meaning men and the Ba Ila and Namwanga and other related groups who settled around Southern Zambia near Zimbabwe Ba Tonga oral records indicate that they came from the east near the big sea br They were later joined by the Ba Tumbuka who settled around Eastern Zambia and Malawi br These first Bantu people lived in large villages They lacked an organised unit under a chief or headman and worked as a community and helped each other in times of field preparation for their crops Villages moved around frequently as the soil became exhausted as a result of the slash and burn technique of planting crops The people also kept large herds of cattle which formed an important part of their societies br br The first Bantu communities in Zambia were highly self sufficient Early European missionaries who settled in Southern Zambia noted the independence of these Bantu societies One of these missionaries noted br If weapons for war hunting and domestic purposes are needed the Tonga man goes to the hills and digs until he finds the iron ore He smelts it and with the iron thus obtained makes axes hoes and other useful implements He burns wood and makes charcoal for his forge His bellows are made from the skins of animals and the pipes are clay tile and the anvil and hammers are also pieces of the iron he has obtained He moulds welds shapes and performs all the work of the ordinary blacksmith br These early Bantu settlers also participated in the trade at the site Ingombe Ilede which translates to sleeping cow in Chi Tonga because the fallen baobab tree appears to resemble a cow in Southern Zambia At this trading site they met numerous Kalanga Shona traders from Great Zimbabwe and Swahili traders from the East African Swahili coast Ingombe Ilede was one of the most important trading posts for rulers of Great Zimbabwe others being the Swahili port cities like Sofala br The goods traded at Ingombe Ilede included fabrics beads gold and bangles Some of these items came from what is today southern Democratic Republic of Congo and Kilwa Kisiwani while others came from as far away as India China and the Arab world The African traders were later joined by the Portuguese in the th century br The decline of Great Zimbabwe due to increasing trade competition from other Kalanga Shona kingdoms like Khami and Mutapa spelt the end of Ingombe Ilede br br br Second Bantu settlement br The second mass settlement of Bantu people into Zambia was of people groups that are believed to have taken the western route of the Bantu migration through the Congo Basin These Bantu people spent the majority of their existence in what is today the Democratic Republic of Congo and are ancestors of the majority of modern Zambians br While there is some evidence that the Bemba people or AbaBemba have a strong ancient connection to the Kongo Kingdom through BaKongo ruler Mwene Kongo VIII Mvemba this is not well documented br br br Luba Lunda states br br The Bemba along with other related groups like the Lamba Bisa Senga Kaonde Swaka Nkoya and Soli formed integral parts of the Luba Kingdom in Upemba part of the Democratic Republic of Congo and have a strong relation to the BaLuba people The area which the Luba Kingdom occupied has been inhabited by early farmers and iron workers since the s C E br Over time these communities learned to use nets and harpoons make dugout canoes clear canals through swamps and make dams as high as meters ft in As a result they grew a diverse economy trading fish copper and iron items and salt for goods from other parts of Africa like the Swahili coast and later on the Portuguese From these communities arose the Luba Kingdom in the th century br The Luba Kingdom was a large kingdom with a centralised government and smaller independent chiefdoms It had large trading networks that linked the forests in the Congo Basin and the mineral rich plateaus of what is today Copperbelt Province and stretched from the Atlantic coast to the Indian Ocean coast The arts were also held in high esteem in the kingdom and artisans were held in high regard br Literature was well developed in the Luba Kingdom One renowned Luba genesis story that articulated the distinction between two types of Luba emperors goes as follows br br Nkongolo Mwamba the red king and Ilunga Mbidi Kiluwe a prince of legendary black complexion Nkongolo Mwamba is the drunken and cruel despot Ilunga Mbidi Kiluwe the refined and gentle prince Nkongolo the Red is a man without manners a man who eats in public gets drunk and cannot control himself whereas Ilunga Mbidi Kiluwe is a man of reservation obsessed with good manners he does not eat in public controls his language and his behaviour and keeps a distance from the vices and modus vivendi of ordinary people Nkongolo Mwamba symbolizes the embodiment of tyranny whereas Mbidi Kiluwe remains the admired caring and compassionate kin br br In the same region of Southern Congo the Lunda people were made into a satellite of the Luba empire and adopted forms of Luba culture and governance thus becoming the Lunda Empire to the south According to Lunda genesis myths a Luba hunter named Chibinda Ilunga son of Ilunga Mbidi Kiluwe introduced the Luba model of statecraft to the Lunda sometime around when he married a local Lunda princess named Lueji and was granted control of her kingdom Most rulers who claimed descent from Luba ancestors were integrated into the Luba empire The Lunda kings however remained separate and actively expanded their political and economic dominance over the region br The Lunda like its parent state Luba also traded with both coasts the Atlantic and Indian Oceans While ruler Mwaant Yaav Naweej had established trade routes to the Atlantic coast and initiated direct contact with European traders eager for slaves and forest products and controlling the regional Copper trade and settlements around Lake Mweru regulated commerce with the East African coast br The Luba Lunda states eventually declined as a result of both Atlantic slave trade in the west and Indian Ocean slave trade in the east and wars with breakaway factions of the kingdoms The Chokwe a group that is closely related to the Luvale and formed a Lunda satellite state initially suffered from the European demand for slaves but once they broke away from the Lunda state they themselves became notorious slave traders exporting slaves to both coasts br The Chokwe eventually were defeated by the other ethnic groups and the Portuguese This instability caused the collapse of the Luba Lunda states and a dispersal of people into various parts of Zambia from the Democratic Republic of the Congo The majority of Zambians trace their ancestry to the Luba Lunda and surrounding Central African states br br br The Maravi Confederacy br In the s before the founding of the Luba Lunda states a group of Bantu people started migrating from the Congo Basin to Lake Mweru then finally settled around Lake Malawi These migrants are believed to have been one of the inhabitants around the Upemba area in the Democratic Republic of Congo By the s these groups of migrants collectively called the Maravi and most prominently among them was the Chewa people AChewa who started assimilating other Bantu groups like the Tumbuka br In the Maravi Empire was founded by the kalonga paramount chief of the Maravi from the Phiri clan one of the main clans with the others being Banda Mwale and Nkhoma The Maravi Empire stretched from the Indian Ocean through what today is Mozambique to Zambia and large parts of Malawi The political organization of the Maravi resembled that of the Luba and is believed to have originated from there The primary export of the Maravi was ivory which was transported to Swahili brokers br Iron was also manufactured and exported In the s the Portuguese endeavoured to take monopoly over Maravi export trade This attempt was met with outrage by the Maravi of Lundu who unleashed their WaZimba armed force The WaZimba sacked the Portuguese trade towns of Tete Sena and various other towns br The Maravi are also believed to have brought the traditions that would become Nyau secret society from Upemba The Nyau form the cosmology or indigenous religion of the people of Maravi The Nyau society consists of ritual dance performances and masks used for the dances this belief system spread around the region br The Maravi declined as a result of succession disputes within the confederacy attack by the Ngoni and slave raids from the Yao br br br Mutapa Empire and Mfecane br br As Great Zimbabwe was in decline one of its princes Nyatsimba Mutota broke away from the state forming a new empire called Mutapa The title of Mwene Mutapa meaning Ravager of the Lands was bestowed on him and subsequent rulers br The Mutapa Empire ruled territory between the Zambezi and Limpopo rivers in what is now Zambia Zimbabwe and Mozambique from the th to the th century By its peak Mutapa had conquered the Dande area of the Tonga and Tavara The Mutapa Empire predominately engaged in the Indian Ocean transcontinental trade with and via the WaSwahili The primary exported gold and ivory for silk and ceramics from Asia br Like their contemporaries in Maravi Mutapa had problems with the arriving Portuguese traders The peak of this uneasy relationship was reached when the Portuguese attempted to influence the kingdoms internal affairs by establishing markets in the kingdom and converting the population to Christianity This action caused outrage by the Muslim WaSwahili living in the capital this chaos gave the Portuguese the excuse they were searching for to warrant an attack on the kingdom and try to control its gold mines and ivory routes This attack failed when the Portuguese succumbed to disease along the Zambezi river br In the s internal disputes and civil war began the decline of Mutapa The weakened kingdom was finally conquered by the Portuguese and was eventually taken over by rival Shona states br br The Portuguese also had vast estates known as Prazos and they used slaves and ex slaves as security guards and hunters They trained the men in military tactics and gave them guns These men became expert elephant hunters and were known as the Chikunda After the decline of the Portuguese the Chikunda made their way to Zambia br It is hypothesised by Julian Cobbing that the presence of early Europeans slave trading and attempts to control resources in various parts of Bantu speaking Africa caused the gradual militarization of the people in the region This can be observed with the Maravi s WaZimba warrior caste who once defeating the Portuguese remained quite militaristic afterwards br The Portuguese presence in the region was also a major reason for the founding of the Rozvi Empire a breakaway state of Mutapa The ruler of the Rozvi Changamire Dombo became one of the most powerful leaders in South Central Africa s history Under his leadership the Rozvi defeated the Portuguese and expelled them from their trading posts along the Zambezi river br But perhaps the most notable instance of this increased militarization was the rise of the Zulu under the leadership of Shaka Pressures from the English colonialists in the Cape and increased militarization of the Zulu resulted in the Mfecane the crushing The Zulu expanded by assimilating the women and children of tribes they defeated if the men of these Nguni tribes escaped slaughter they used the military tactics of the Zulu to attack other groups br This caused mass displacements wars and raids throughout Southern Central and Eastern Africa as Nguni or Ngoni tribes made their way throughout the region and is referred to as the Mfecane The arriving Nguni under the leadership of Zwagendaba crossed the Zambezi river moving northwards The Ngoni were the final blow to the already weakened Maravi Empire Many Nguni eventually settled around what is today Zambia Malawi Mozambique and Tanzania and assimilated into neighbouring tribes br In the western part of Zambia another Southern African group of Sotho Tswana heritage called the Kololo manage to conquer the local inhabitants who were migrants from the fallen Luba and Lunda states called the Luyana or Aluyi The Luyana established the Barotse Kingdom on the floodplains of the Zambezi upon their arrival from Katanga Under the Kololo the Kololo language was imposed upon the Luyana until the Luyana revolted and overthrew the Kololo by this time the Luyana language was largely forgotten and a new hybrid language emerged SiLozi and the Luyana began to refer to themselves as Lozi br At the end of the th century some of the Mbunda migrated to Barotseland Mongu upon the migration of among others the Ciyengele The Aluyi and their leader the Litunga Mulambwa especially valued the Mbunda for their fighting ability br By the late th century most of the various peoples of Zambia were established in their current areas br br br Colonial Period br br br Europeans br br One of the earliest recorded Europeans to visit the area was the Portuguese explorer Francisco de Lacerda in the late th century Lacerda led an expedition from Mozambique to the Kazembe region in Zambia with the goal of exploring and to crossing Southern Africa from coast to coast for the first time and died during the expedition in The expedition was from then on led by his friend Francisco Pinto This territory located between Portuguese Mozambique and Portuguese Angola was claimed and explored by Portugal in that period br Other European visitors followed in the th century The most prominent of these was David Livingstone who had a vision of ending the slave trade through the Cs Christianity Commerce and Civilisation He was the first European to see the magnificent waterfalls on the Zambezi River in naming them the Victoria Falls after Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom He described them thus Scenes so lovely must have been gazed upon by angels in their flight br Locally the falls are known as Mosi o Tunya or thundering smoke in the Lozi or Kololo dialect The town of Livingstone near the Falls is named after him Highly publicised accounts of his journeys motivated a wave of European visitors missionaries and traders after his death in br British South Africa Company br In the British South Africa Company BSA Company led by Cecil Rhodes obtained mineral rights from the Litunga of the Lozi people the Paramount Chief of the Lozi Ba rotse for the area which later became Barotziland North Western Rhodesia br To the east in December a group of the Angoni or Ngoni originally from Zululand rebelled under Tsinco son of King Mpezeni but the rebellion was put down and Mpezeni accepted the Pax Britannica That part of the country then came to be known as North Eastern Rhodesia In Rhodes asked his American scout Frederick Russell Burnham to look for minerals and ways to improve river navigation in the region and it was during this trek that Burnham discovered major copper deposits along the Kafue River br North Eastern Rhodesia and Barotziland North Western Rhodesia were administered as separate units until when they were merged to form Northern Rhodesia a British protectorate In the BSA Company ceded control of Northern Rhodesia to the British Government after the government decided not to renew the company s charter br br br British colonisation br In Southern Rhodesia now Zimbabwe a conquered territory which was also administered by the BSA Company became a self governing British colony In after negotiations the administration of Northern Rhodesia transferred to the British Colonial Office br br Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland br In the creation of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland grouped together Northern Rhodesia Southern Rhodesia and Nyasaland now Malawi as a single semi autonomous region This was undertaken despite opposition from a sizeable minority of the population who demonstrated against it in Northern Rhodesia was the center of much of the turmoil and crisis characterizing the federation in its last years Initially Harry Nkumbula s African National Congress ANC led the campaign which Kenneth Kaunda s United National Independence Party UNIP subsequently took up br br br Independence br br A two stage election held in October and December resulted in an African majority in the legislative council and an uneasy coalition between the two African nationalist parties The council passed resolutions calling for Northern Rhodesia s secession from the federation and demanding full internal self government under a new constitution and a new National Assembly based on a broader more democratic franchise br The federation was dissolved on December and in January Kaunda won the only election for Prime Minister of Northern Rhodesia The Colonial Governor Sir Evelyn Hone was very close to Kaunda and urged him to stand for the post Soon after there was an uprising in the north of the country known as the Lumpa Uprising led by Alice Lenshina Kaunda s first internal conflict as leader of the nation br Northern Rhodesia became the Republic of Zambia on October with Kenneth Kaunda as the first president At independence despite its considerable mineral wealth Zambia faced major challenges Domestically there were few trained and educated Zambians capable of running the government and the economy was largely dependent on foreign expertise This expertise was provided in part by John Willson CMG There were over Europeans resident in Zambia in and they remained of disproportionate economic significance br br br Post Independence br Kaunda s endorsement of Patriotic Front guerrillas conducting raids into neighbouring Southern Rhodesia resulted in political tension and a militarisation of the border leading to its closure in The Kariba hydroelectric station on the Zambezi River provided sufficient capacity to satisfy the country s requirements for electricity despite Rhodesian management br br On September civilian airliner Air Rhodesia Flight was shot down near Kariba by the Zimbabwe People s Revolutionary Army ZIPRA people including children survived the crash only for most of them to be shot by militants of the Zimbabwe African People s Union ZAPU led by Joshua Nkomo Rhodesia responded with Operation Gatling an attack on Nkomo s guerilla bases in Zambia in particular his military headquarters just outside Lusaka this raid became known as the Green Leader Raid On the same day two more bases in Zambia were attacked using air power and elite paratroops and helicopter borne troops br A railway TAZARA Tanzania Zambia Railways to the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam completed in with Chinese assistance reduced Zambian dependence on railway lines south to South Africa and west through an increasingly troubled Portuguese Angola Until the completion of the railway Zambia s major artery for imports and the critical export of copper was along the TanZam Road running from Zambia to the port cities in Tanzania The Tazama oil pipeline was also built from Dar es Salaam to Ndola in Zambia br By the late s Mozambique and Angola had attained independence from Portugal Rhodesia s predominantly white government which issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence in accepted majority rule under the Lancaster House Agreement in br Civil strife in both Portuguese colonies and a mounting Namibian War of Independence resulted in an influx of refugees and compounded transportation issues The Benguela railway which extended west through Angola was essentially closed to Zambian traffic by the late s Zambia s support for anti apartheid movements such as the African National Congress ANC also created security problems as the South African Defence Force struck at dissident targets during external raids br In two of Zambia s natural sites Mosi oa Tunya National Park and Victoria Falls were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List br br br Economic troubles br In the mid s the price of copper Zambia s principal export suffered a severe decline worldwide In Zambia s situation the cost of transporting the copper great distances to the market was an additional strain Zambia turned to foreign and international lenders for relief but as copper prices remained depressed it became increasingly difficult to service its growing debt By the mid s despite limited debt relief Zambia s per capita foreign debt remained among the highest in the world br br br Democratisation br In June riots against Kaunda accelerated Many protesters were killed by the regime in breakthrough June protests In Kaunda survived an attempted coup and in he agreed to reinstate multiparty democracy having instituted one party rule under the Choma Commission of Following multiparty elections Kaunda was removed from office see below br In the s the economy stabilised attaining single digit inflation in real GDP growth decreasing interest rates and increasing levels of trade Much of its growth is due to foreign investment in mining and to higher world copper prices All this led to Zambia being courted enthusiastically by aid donors and saw a surge in investor confidence in the country br br br Politics br br Politics in Zambia takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic whereby the President of Zambia is both head of state and head of government in a pluriform multi party system The government exercises executive power while legislative power is vested in both the government and parliament br Zambia became a republic immediately upon attaining independence in October From to Zambia s president had been Michael Sata until Sata died on October After Sata s death Vice President Guy Scott a Zambian of Scottish descent became acting President of Zambia Presidential elections were held on January A total number of presidential candidates contested in the election and On January it was announced that Edgar Chagwa Lungu had won the election to become the th President in a tightly contested race He won of the vote a lead of over his closest rival Hakainde Hichilema with Nine other candidates all got less than each In August Zambian general election president Edgar Lungu won re election narrowly in the first round of the election The opposition had allegations of fraud and the governing Patriotic Front PF rejected the allegations made by opposition UPND party br In the general elections characterised by a voter turnout Hakainde Hichilema won of the vote with his closest rival incumbent president Edgar Chagwa Lungu receiving of the vote On August Edgar Lungu conceded in a TV statement sending a letter and congratulating president elect Hakainde Hichilema On August Hakainde Hichilema was sworn in as the new President of Zambia br br br Foreign relations br br After independence in the foreign relations of Zambia were mostly focused on supporting liberation movements in other countries in Southern Africa such as the African National Congress and SWAPO During the Cold War Zambia was a member of the Non Aligned Movement br br br Military br br The Zambian Defence Force ZDF consists of the Zambia Army ZA the Zambia Air Force ZAF and the Zambian National Service ZNS The ZDF is designed primarily against external threats br In Zambia signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons br br br Administrative divisions br br Zambia is administratively divided into ten provinces subdivided into districts and electorally into constituencies and wards br br Provinces br Central Province br Copperbelt br Eastern Province br Luapula br Lusaka br Muchinga br North Western Province br Northern Province br Southern Province br Western Province br br br Human rights br br The government is sensitive to any opposition and criticism and has been quick to prosecute critics using the legal pretext that they had incited public disorder Libel laws are used to suppress free speech and the press br Same sex sexual activity is illegal for both males and females in Zambia A survey revealed that only of Zambians find homosexuality to be morally acceptable br In December it was reported that United States Ambassador to Zambia Daniel Lewis Foote was horrified by Zambia s jailing of same sex couple Japhet Chataba and Steven Samba After an appeal failed and the couple was sentenced to years in prison Foote asked the Zambian government to review both the case and the country s anti homosexuality laws Foote faced a backlash and canceled public appearances after he was threatened on social media and was subsequently recalled after President Lungu declared him persona non grata br br br Geography br br Zambia is a landlocked country in southern Africa with a tropical climate and consists mostly of high plateaus with some hills and mountains dissected by river valleys At km sq mi it is the th largest country in the world slightly smaller than Chile The country lies mostly between latitudes and S and longitudes and E br Zambia is drained by two major river basins the Zambezi Kafue basin in the center west and south covering about three quarters of the country and the Congo basin in the north covering about one quarter of the country A very small area in the northeast forms part of the internal drainage basin of Lake Rukwa in Tanzania br In the Zambezi basin there are a number of major rivers flowing wholly or partially through Zambia the Kabompo Lungwebungu Kafue Luangwa and the Zambezi itself which flows through the country in the west and then forms its southern border with Namibia Botswana and Zimbabwe Its source is in Zambia but it diverts into Angola and a number of its tributaries rise in Angola s central highlands The edge of the Cuando River floodplain not its main channel forms Zambia s southwestern border and via the Chobe River that river contributes very little water to the Zambezi because most are lost by evaporation br Two of the Zambezi s longest and largest tributaries the Kafue and the Luangwa flow mainly in Zambia Their confluences with the Zambezi are on the border with Zimbabwe at Chirundu and Luangwa town respectively Before its confluence the Luangwa River forms part of Zambia s border with Mozambique From Luangwa town the Zambezi leaves Zambia and flows into Mozambique and eventually into the Mozambique Channel br The Zambezi falls about metres ft over the kilometre wide mile Victoria Falls located in the southwest corner of the country subsequently flowing into Lake Kariba The Zambezi valley running along the southern border is both deep and wide From Lake Kariba going east it is formed by grabens and like the Luangwa Mweru Luapula Mweru wa Ntipa and Lake Tanganyika valleys is a rift valley br The north of Zambia is very flat with broad plains In the west the most notable being the Barotse Floodplain on the Zambezi which floods from December to June lagging behind the annual rainy season typically November to April The flood dominates the natural environment and the lives society and culture of the inhabitants and those of other smaller floodplains throughout the country br br In Eastern Zambia the plateau which extends between the Zambezi and Lake Tanganyika valleys is tilted upwards to the north and so rises imperceptibly from about m ft in the south to m ft in the centre reaching m ft in the north near Mbala These plateau areas of northern Zambia have been categorised by the World Wildlife Fund as a large section of the Central Zambezian miombo woodlands ecoregion br Eastern Zambia shows great diversity The Luangwa Valley splits the plateau in a curve north east to south west extended west into the heart of the plateau by the deep valley of the Lunsemfwa River Hills and mountains are found by the side of some sections of the valley notably in its north east the Nyika Plateau m or ft on the Malawi border which extend into Zambia as the Mafinga Hills containing the country s highest point Mafinga Central m or ft br The Muchinga Mountains the watershed between the Zambezi and Congo drainage basins run parallel to the deep valley of the Luangwa River and form a sharp backdrop to its northern edge although they are almost everywhere below m ft Their culminating peak Mumpu is at the western end and at m ft is the highest point in Zambia away from the eastern border region The border of the Congo Pedicle was drawn around this mountain br The southernmost headstream of the Congo River rises in Zambia and flows west through its northern area firstly as the Chambeshi and then after the Bangweulu Swamps as the Luapula which forms part of the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo The Luapula flows south then west before it turns north until it enters Lake Mweru The lake s other major tributary is the Kalungwishi River which flows into it from the east The Luvua River drains Lake Mweru flowing out of the northern end to the Lualaba River Upper Congo River br Lake Tanganyika is the other major hydrographic feature that belongs to the Congo basin Its south eastern end receives water from the Kalambo River which forms part of Zambia s border with Tanzania This river has Africa s second highest uninterrupted waterfall the Kalambo Falls br br br Climate br br Zambia is located on the plateau of Central Africa between and metres and ft above sea level The average elevation of metres ft gives the land a generally moderate climate The climate of Zambia is tropical modified by elevation In the K ppen climate classification most of the country is classified as humid subtropical or tropical wet and dry with small stretches of semi arid steppe climate in the south west and along the Zambezi valley br There are two main seasons the rainy season November to April corresponding to summer and the dry season May June to October November corresponding to winter The dry season is subdivided into the cool dry season May June to August and the hot dry season September to October November The modifying influence of altitude gives the country pleasant subtropical weather rather than tropical conditions during the cool season of May to August However average monthly temperatures remain above C F over most of the country for eight or more months of the year br br br Biodiversity br br There are numerous ecosystems in Zambia such as forest thicket woodland and grassland vegetation types br In Zambia was reported to have approximately identified species animal species plant species and bacterial species and other microorganisms br There are an estimated species of wild flowering plants consisting of sedges herbaceous plants and woody plants The Northern and North Western provinces of the country especially have the highest diversity of flowering plants Approximately of flowering plants are rare and occur throughout the country br A total of mammal species are found in the country with most occupying the woodland and grassland ecosystems The Rhodesian giraffe and Kafue lechwe are some of the well known subspecies that are endemic to Zambia br An estimated bird species have been seen in the country of which are either resident or Afrotropic migrants breed in the country and are non breeding migrants The Zambian barbet is a species endemic to Zambia br Roughly known fish species belonging to fish families have been reported in Zambia with Lake Tanganyika having the highest number of endemic species br The country had a Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of ranking it th globally out of countries br br br Demographics br br As of the Zambian census Zambia s population was Zambia is racially and ethnically diverse with distinct ethnic groups During its colonial administration by the British between and the country attracted immigrants from Europe and the Indian subcontinent the latter of whom came as indentured workers While most Europeans left after the collapse of white minority rule many Asians remained Zambia is home to a growing Asian community with a majority being of Indian and Chinese descent br br In the first census conducted on May there were a total of Europeans Asiatics and an estimated black Africans Black Africans were not counted in the six censuses conducted in and prior to independence but their population was estimated By there were Europeans Asiatics coloureds and an estimated black Africans br The main ethnic groups in Zambia are Bemba million Nyanja million Tonga million North Western peoples million Lozi Barotse Mambwe Tumbuka Lamba Asians and Europeans br In the population census were black Africans and consisted of other racial groups br br Zambia is one of the most highly urbanised countries in sub Saharan Africa with of the population concentrated along the major transport corridors while rural areas are sparsely populated The fertility rate was as of in in br br br Largest towns br The onset of industrial copper mining on the Copperbelt in the late s triggered rapid urbanisation Although urbanisation was overestimated during the colonial period it was substantial Mining townships on the Copperbelt soon dwarfed existing centres of population and continued to grow rapidly following Zambian independence Economic decline in the Copperbelt from the s to the s has altered patterns of urban development but the country s population remains concentrated around the railway and roads running south from the Copperbelt through Kapiri Mposhi Lusaka Choma and Livingstone br br br Ethnic groups br br The population comprises approximately ethnic groups most of which are Bantu speaking Almost of Zambians belong to the nine main ethnolinguistic groups the Nyanja Chewa Bemba Tonga Tumbuka Lunda Luvale Kaonde Nkoya and Lozi In the rural areas ethnic groups are concentrated in particular geographic regions Many groups are small and not well known However all the ethnic groups can be found in significant numbers in Lusaka and the Copperbelt In addition to the linguistic dimension tribal identities are relevant in Zambia These tribal identities are often linked to family allegiance or to traditional authorities The tribal identities are nested within the main language groups br Immigrants mostly British or South African as well as some white Zambian citizens of British descent live mainly in Lusaka and in the Copperbelt in northern Zambia where they are either employed in mines financial and related activities or retired There were Europeans in Zambia in but many have since left the country br Zambia has a small but economically important Asian population most of whom are Indians and Chinese This minority group has a massive impact on the economy controlling the manufacturing sector An estimated Chinese reside in Zambia In recent years several hundred dispossessed white farmers have left Zimbabwe at the invitation of the Zambian government to take up farming in the Southern province br Zambia has a minority of people of colour of mixed race also known as coloureds Coloureds in Zambia no longer appear on the census During colonialism segregation separated people of colour blacks and whites in public places including schools hospitals and in housing There has been an increase in interracial relationships due to Zambia s growing economy importing labor People of colour are not recorded on the census but are considered a minority in Zambia br According to the World Refugee Survey published by the U S Committee for Refugees and Immigrants Zambia had a population of refugees and asylum seekers numbering approximately The majority of refugees in the country came from the Democratic Republic of the Congo refugees from the DRC living in Zambia in Angola see Angolans in Zambia Zimbabwe and Rwanda Zambians are generally welcoming towards foreigners br Beginning in May the number of Zimbabweans in Zambia began to increase significantly the influx consisted largely of Zimbabweans formerly living in South Africa who were fleeing xenophobic violence there Nearly refugees live in camps in Zambia while are mixed in with the local populations Refugees who wish to work in Zambia must apply for permits which can cost up to per year br br br Religion br br Zambia is officially a Christian nation under the constitution but recognizes and protects freedom of religion While fewer than three per cent of the population still observe indigenous faiths Zambian Christianity is highly syncretic and many self identified Christians blend
