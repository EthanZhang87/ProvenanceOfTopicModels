new toolkit developed by the Firefox team br br On December version was released and received more than downloads in its first three days of release and in ten days br Significant work on Thunderbird restarted with the announcement that from version onward the main Mozilla suite would be designed around separate applications using this new toolkit This contrasts with the previous all in one approach allowing users to mix and match the Mozilla applications with alternatives The original Mozilla Suite continues to be developed as SeaMonkey br On December Project Lightning was announced which tightly integrated calendar functionality scheduling tasks etc into Thunderbird Lightning supports the full range of calendar mechanisms and protocols supported by the Mozilla Calendar infrastructure just as with modern post Sunbird br On October Qualcomm and the Mozilla Foundation announced that future versions of Eudora will be based upon the same technology platform as the open source Mozilla Thunderbird email program The project was code named Penelope br In late Debian rebranded Thunderbird as Icedove due to trademark and copyright reasons This was the second product to be

skipped so as to re align Thunderbird with Firefox s version both released in June By the end of the year it had reached version br On July a confidential memo from Jb Piacentino the Thunderbird Managing Director at Mozilla was leaked and published to TechCrunch The memo indicated that Mozilla would be moving some of the team off the project and further development of new features would be left up to the community The memo was slated for release on July A subsequent article by the Executive Chair of Mozilla Mitchell Baker stated Mozilla s decision to make a transition of Thunderbird to a new release and governance model On July Mozilla announced the company was dropping the priority of Thunderbird development because the continuous effort to extend Thunderbird s feature set was mostly fruitless The new development model shifted to Mozilla offering only Extended Support Releases which deliver security and maintenance updates while allowing the community to take over the development of new features br On November Kent James of the volunteer led Thunderbird Council announced on the Thunderbird blog that active contributors to Thunderbird gathered at the Mozilla office in Toronto and discussed the future of the application They decided that more staff were required working full time on Thunderbird so that the Thunderbird Team could release a stable and reliable product and make progress on features that had been frequently requested by the community br On December Mozilla Executive Chair Mitchell Baker announced in a company wide memo that Thunderbird development needed to be uncoupled from Firefox She referred to Thunderbird developers spending large efforts responding to changes to Mozilla technologies while Firefox was paying a tax to support Thunderbird development She also said that she does not believe Thunderbird has the potential for industry wide impact that Firefox does Mozilla remained interested in having a role in Thunderbird but sought more assistance to help with development Therefore at the same time it was announced that Mozilla Foundation would provide at least a temporary legal and financial home for the Thunderbird project br br br present br br On May Philipp Kewisch announced that the Mozilla Foundation would continue to serve as the legal and fiscal home for the Thunderbird project but that Thunderbird would

Thunderbird of WebExtensions and to continue to somewhat support legacy addons according to Mozilla br With the release of Thunderbird in August it now only supports WebExtension addons Legacy Addons can still be used if a special legacy mode is enabled but even for this the legacy Addon has to be converted Alongside the transition OpenPGP support was integrated directly into Thunderbird as a standard feature seeking to supplant the Enigmail extension Mainly for licensing reasons this is no longer based on GnuPG but on the RNP library which has more liberal licensing terms br On January the Mozilla Foundation announced that the project would henceforth be operating from a new wholly owned subsidiary MZLA Technologies Corporation in order to explore offering products and services that
