community the seat of several high tech companies and a dining entertainment and recreational destination owing to its luxury hospitality wineries and nature parks br br br History br br Prior to the arrival of Spanish colonists Santa Clara Valley had been inhabited by the Tamien nation of Ohlone people for more than years In that area the Matalan tribe lived in a hunter gatherer society br Before the area was colonized as part of the Alta California province of the Viceroyalty of New Spain the Spanish expedition led by Pedro Fages and Father Juan Cresp the two explorers camped in the area around Morgan Hill alongside Llagas Creek The location of their camp subsequently became a campsite for Spanish soldiers on their way from New Spain to Alta California With the founding of Mission Santa Clara de As s in the lands of present day Morgan Hill were granted to the Roman Catholic Church br Following Mexico s independence from Spain land was redistributed to Mexican citizens across California and the land encompassing modern day Morgan Hill was granted to Juan Maria Hernandez in In Martin Murphy Sr an Irish born Mexican citizen acquired the area and named it Rancho Ojo del Agua de la Coche br br In Martin Murphy Sr s youngest son Daniel Murphy married Maria Fisher heiress of the neighboring acre ha Rancho Laguna Seca thus combining the two estates In Martin Murphy Sr s father Bernard Murphy died leaving the majority of the estate to Martin Murphy Sr but a substantial portion to a Martin Murphy Sr s mother Catherine who then married James Dunne By the Murphy family had acquired around acres ha of the Morgan Hill area In the history of Morgan Hill the Murphy Dunne and Hill families are some of the most prominent br By the late s Californio ranchero Jos Mar a Malaguerra began cultivating vineyards in Madrone then an independent township just north of Morgan Hill In he founded the Malaguerra Winery the oldest extant winery in Santa Clara Valley which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places br In Daniel and Maria Murphy s daughter Diana Murphy fell in love with Missouri businessman Hiram Morgan Hill They married in secret on account of his being a Quaker and her being from a prominent Roman Catholic family When Daniel Murphy died Diana and Hiram Morgan Hill inherited the acres ha surrounding the original Murphy estate near Murphy s Peak now known as El Toro In the Hills built their weekend estate as the family primarily lived in San Francisco dubbed Villa Mira Monte Spanish for Mountain View Estate br br By the family chose to live primarily at the Ojo del Agua rancho as they jointly inherited acres ha around the estate However the move was temporary as scandal caused by the marital complications of Hiram Morgan Hill s prominent socialite sister Sarah Althea Hill and her husband Senator William Sharon made the Hills a source of social ridicule thus causing them to start spending the majority of their time between San Francisco and Washington D C thus leaving their rancho untouched for long periods of time br In Hiram Morgan Hill contracted land developer C H Phillips to divide and liquidate the Rancho Ojo del Agua de la Coche only retaining the Villa Mira Monte estate and the surrounding acres ha which the Hill family would hold until By a significant community had built around what was then known as Morgan Hill s Ranch and a Southern Pacific Railroad station was built in the Huntington area Rather than ask to stop at Huntington station passengers would ask to stop at Morgan Hill s Ranch which eventually shortened to Morgan Hill br On November the planned community a result of the divisions of C H Phillips was incorporated as the Town of Morgan Hill Hiram Morgan and Diana Hill s only child Diana Murphy Hill married the French nobleman Baron Hadouin de Reinach Werth and thus Baron Hadouin started to help manage Hiram Morgan Hill s properties between California and Nevada However the baron was called back to France to serve in the military and never returned In Hiram Morgan Hill died at his Elko estate in Nevada thus leaving his properties to his daughter Diana Murphy Hill later remarried in to Sir George Rhodes thus causing the Murphy heiress of the Morgan Hill estate to relocate to the United Kingdom taking her and Hiram Morgan Hill s daughter Diana Murphy Hill thus finally selling off the Villa Mira Monte and ending the Hill family presence in the community named after them br In Morgan Hill annexed Madrone turning the former township into a Morgan Hill s northernmost district bordering San Jose and Coyote Valley br br br Geography br Morgan Hill is approximately mi km south of downtown San Jose mi km north of Gilroy and mi km inland from the Pacific coast Lying in a roughly mile wide km southern extension of the Santa Clara Valley it is bounded by the Santa Cruz Mountains to the west and the Diablo Range to the east At the valley floor Morgan Hill lies at an

at a magnitude br br Within Morgan Hill s area are a number of lakes and reservoirs including Anderson Lake eastern Morgan Hill Uvas Reservoir west Chesbro Reservoir west and Coyote Lake south br The Sargent Berrocal Fault a potentially active fault lies mi km away from the sites and has an estimated maximum credible Richter magnitude of The Coyote Creek Fault is located in Morgan Hill and is classified as potentially active as well In addition several unnamed faults traverse the western slopes of the upland areas Geomorphic evidence suggests that these faults were active during recent geologic time However these fault related geomorphic features are not as fresh as those of the active Calaveras Fault and are considered to be somewhat older br br Morgan Hill is one of very few sources for a type of semi precious gemstone marketed under the name Morgan Hill poppy jasper According to geologists this local variety of orbicular jasper formed through a combination of volcanic and seismic activity on the slopes of El Toro Known extant deposits of the mineral are located on private lands not accessible to the public A local business El Toro Brewing Company has a collection of poppy jasper on display at their rural Morgan Hill brewery and on a large bar top inlaid with the stone at their brewpub in downtown Morgan Hill Examples are also on display at the Morgan Hill Museum and at the Morgan Hill Community and Cultural Center The local Poppy Jasper Film Festival is also named after the mineral br The highlight of local geography is El Toro According to a local legend of the early s author Bret Harte named the hill when he climbed it and discovered two bulls fighting near the summit they subsequently chased him back down The official name shown on the U S
