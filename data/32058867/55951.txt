Instant messaging IM technology is a type of online chat allowing immediate transmission of messages over the Internet or another computer network Messages are typically transmitted between two or more parties when each user inputs text and triggers a transmission to the recipient s who are all connected on a common network It differs from email in that conversations over instant messaging happen in real time hence instant Most modern IM applications sometimes called social messengers messaging apps chat apps or chat clients use push technology and also add other features such as emojis or graphical smileys file transfer chatbots voice over IP or video chat capabilities br Instant messaging systems tend to facilitate connections between specified known users often using a contact list also known as a buddy list or friend list and can be standalone applications or integrated into e g a wider social media platform or a website where it can for instance be used for conversational commerce IM can also consist of conversations in chat rooms Depending on the IM protocol the technical architecture can be peer to peer direct point to point transmission or client server an IM service center retransmits messages from the sender to the communication device It is usually distinguished from text messaging which is typically simpler and normally uses cellular phone networks br Instant messaging applications can store messages with either local based device storage e g WhatsApp Viber Line WeChat Signal etc or cloud based server storage e g Telegram Skype Facebook Messenger Google Meet Chat Discord Slack etc br Instant messaging was pioneered in the early Internet era the IRC protocol was the earliest to achieve wide adoption Later in the s ICQ was among the first closed and commercialized instant messengers and several rival services appeared afterwards as it became a popular use of the Internet Beginning with its first introduction in BlackBerry Messenger which initially had been available only on BlackBerry smartphones soon became one of the most popular mobile instant messaging apps worldwide BBM was for instance the most used mobile messaging app in the United Kingdom and Indonesia Instant messaging remains very popular today IM apps are the most widely used smartphone apps in there were over million Signal users million monthly active users of WeChat and billion monthly users of WhatsApp Messenger br br br Overview br Instant messaging is a set of communication technologies used for text based communication between two private messaging or more chat room participants over the Internet or other types of networks see also LAN messenger IM chats happen in real time Online chat and instant messaging differ from other technologies such as email due to the perceived quasi synchrony of the communications by the users although some systems allow users to send offline messages that the other user receives when logging in br IM allows effective and efficient communication allowing immediate receipt of acknowledgment or reply However IM is basically not necessarily supported by transaction control In many cases instant messaging includes added features which can make it even more popular For example users may see each other via webcams or talk directly for free over the Internet using a microphone and headphones or loudspeakers Many applications allow file transfers although they are usually limited in the permissible file size It is usually possible to save a text conversation for later reference Instant messages are often logged in a local message history making it similar to the persistent nature of emails br Major IM services are controlled by their corresponding companies They usually follow the client server model when all clients have to first connect to the central server This requires users to trust this server because messages can generally be accessed by the company Companies may be compelled to reveal their user s communication and companies can also suspend user accounts for any reason br Non IM types of chat include multicast transmission usually referred to as chat rooms where participants might be anonymous or might be previously known to each other for example collaborators on a project that is using chat to facilitate communication br An instant message service center IMSC is a network element in the mobile telephone network which delivers instant messages When a user sends an IM message to another user the phone sends the message to the IMSC The IMSC stores the message and delivers it to the destination user when they are available The IMSC usually has a configurable time limit for how long it will store the message Few companies who make many of the IMSCs in use in the GSM world are Miyowa Followap and OZ Other players include Acision Colibria Ericsson Nokia Comverse Technology Now Wireless Jinny Software Miyowa Feelingk and few others br The term Instant Messenger is a service mark of Time Warner and may not be used in software not affiliated with AOL in the United States For this reason in April the instant messaging client formerly named Gaim or gaim announced that they would be renamed Pidgin br br br Clients br br Modern IM services generally provide their own client either a separately installed piece of software or a browser based client They are normally centralised networks run by the servers of the platform s operators unlike peer to peer protocols like XMPP These usually only work within the same IM network although some allow limited function with other services Third party client software applications exist that will connect with most of the major IM services There is the class of instant messengers that uses the serverless model which doesn t require servers and the IM network consists only of clients There are several serverless messengers RetroShare Tox Bitmessage Ricochet Ring br Some examples of popular IM services today include Signal Telegram WhatsApp Messenger WeChat QQ Messenger Viber Line and Snapchat The popularity of certain apps greatly differ between different countries Certain apps have emphasis on certain uses for example Skype focuses on video calling Slack focuses on messaging and file sharing for work teams and Snapchat focuses on image messages Some social networking services offer messaging services as a component of their overall platform such as Facebook s Facebook Messenger who also own WhatsApp Others have a direct messaging function as an additional adjunct component of their social networking platforms like Instagram Reddit Tumblr TikTok Clubhouse and Twitter either directly or through chat rooms br br br Features br br br Private and group messaging br Private chat allows private conversation with another person or a group The privacy aspect can also be enhanced in a number of ways such as end to end encryption by default like Signal Or some applications have a timer feature like Snapchat where messages conversations or files such as photos are automatically deleted from the users phone once the time limit is reached Public and group chat features allow users to communicate with multiple people at a time br br br Calling br Many major IM services and applications offer the call feature for user to user calls conference calls and voice messages The call functionality is useful for professionals who utilize the application for work purposes and as a hands free method Videotelephony using a webcam is also possible by some br br br Games and entertainment br Some IM applications include in app games for entertainment Yahoo Messenger for example introduced these where users could play a game and viewed by friends in real time The Messenger application has a built in option to play computer games with people in a chat including games like Tetris and Blackjack br Another popular messaging app that allows you to play games inside it is Discord There are multiple games built inside the activities tab in voice channels br br br Payments br Though a relatively new feature peer to peer payments are available on major messaging platforms This functionality allows individuals to use one application for both communication and financial tasks The lack of a service fee also makes messaging apps advantageous to financial applications Major platforms such as Facebook messenger and WeChat already offer a payment feature and this functionality is likely to become a standard amongst IM apps competing in the market br br br History br br Though the term dates from the s instant messaging predates the Internet first appearing on multi user operating systems like Compatible Time Sharing System CTSS and Multiplexed Information and Computing Service Multics in the mid s Initially some of these systems were used as notification systems for services like printing but quickly were used to facilitate communication with other users logged into the same machine CTSS facilitated communication via text message for up to people br Parallel to instant messaging were early online chat facilities the earliest of which was Talkomatic on the PLATO system which allowed people to chat simultaneously on a x plasma display lines of text status line per person During the bulletin board system BBS phenomenon that peaked during the s some systems incorporated chat features which were similar to instant messaging Freelancin Roundtable was one prime example The first such general availability commercial online chat service as opposed to PLATO which was educational was the CompuServe CB Simulator in created by CompuServe executive Alexander Sandy Trevor in Columbus Ohio br As networks developed the protocols spread with the networks Some of these used a peer to peer protocol e g talk ntalk and ytalk while others required peers to connect to a server see talker and IRC The Zephyr Notification Service still in use at some institutions was invented at MIT s Project Athena in the s to allow service providers to locate and send messages to users br Early instant messaging programs were primarily real time text where characters appeared as they were typed This includes the Unix talk command line program which was popular in the s and early s Some BBS chat programs i e Celerity BBS also used a similar interface Modern implementations of real time text also exist in instant messengers such as AOL s Real Time IM as an optional feature br br In the latter half of the s and into the early s the Quantum Link online service for Commodore computers offered user to user messages between concurrently connected customers which they called On Line Messages or OLM for short and later FlashMail Quantum Link later became America Online and made AOL Instant Messenger AIM discussed later While the Quantum Link client software ran on a Commodore using only the Commodore s PETSCII text graphics the screen was visually divided into sections and OLMs would appear as a yellow bar saying Message From and the name of the sender along with the message across the top of whatever the user was already doing and presented a list of options for responding As such it could be considered a type of graphical user interface GUI albeit much more primitive than the later Unix Windows and Macintosh based GUI IM software OLMs were what Q Link called Plus Services meaning they charged an extra per minute fee on top of the monthly Q Link access costs br Modern Internet wide GUI based messaging clients as they are known today began to take off in the mid s with PowWow ICQ and AOL Instant Messenger Similar functionality was offered by CU SeeMe in though primarily an audio video chat link users could also send textual messages to each other AOL later acquired Mirabilis the authors of ICQ establishing dominance in the instant messaging market A few years later ICQ then owned by AOL was awarded two patents for instant messaging by the U S patent office Meanwhile other companies developed their own software Excite MSN Ubique and Yahoo each with its own proprietary protocol and client users therefore had to run multiple client applications if they wished to use more than one of these networks In IBM released IBM Lotus Sametime a product based on technology acquired when IBM bought Haifa based Ubique and Lexington based Databeam br In an open source application and open standards based protocol called Jabber was launched The protocol was standardized under the name Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol XMPP XMPP servers could act as gateways to other IM protocols reducing the need to run multiple clients Multi protocol clients can use any of the popular IM protocols by using additional local libraries for each protocol IBM Lotus Sametime s November release added IBM Lotus Sametime Gateway support for XMPP br Video calling using a webcam also started taking off during this time Microsoft NetMeeting was one of the earliest but Skype released in was one of the first that focused on this features and brought it to a wider audience br By AIM controlled percent of the instant messaging market but rapidly declined shortly thereafter as the company struggled to compete with other services br br By instant messaging over the Web was in sharp decline in favor of messaging features on social networks Social networking providers often offer IM abilities for example Facebook Chat while Twitter can be thought of as a Web instant messaging system Similar server side chat features are part of most dating websites such as OkCupid or Plenty of Fish The former most popular IM platforms were terminated in later years such as AIM br The popularity of instant messaging was soon revived with new services in the form of mobile applications notable examples of the time being BlackBerry Messenger first released in today available as BlackBerry Messenger Enterprise and WhatsApp first released in Unlike previous IM applications these newer ones usually ran only on mobile devices and coincided with the rising popularity of Internet enabled smartphones this led to IM surpassing SMS in message volume by By IM had more users than social networks In January the service WhatsApp alone accommodated billion messages daily in comparison to about billion for SMS br In Google introduced a new intelligent messaging app that incorporated machine learning technology called Allo Google Allo was shut down on March br br br Interoperability br br Standard complementary instant messaging applications offer functions like file transfer contact list s the ability to hold several simultaneous conversations etc These may be all the functions that a small business needs but larger organizations will require more sophisticated applications that can work together The solution to finding applications capable of this is to use enterprise versions of instant messaging applications These include titles like XMPP Lotus Sametime Microsoft Office Communicator etc which are often integrated with other enterprise applications such as workflow systems These enterprise applications or enterprise application integration EAI are built to certain constraints namely storing data in a common format br There have been several attempts to create a unified standard for instant messaging IETF s Session Initiation Protocol SIP and SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions SIMPLE Application Exchange APEX Instant Messaging and Presence Protocol IMPP the open XML based Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol XMPP and Open Mobile Alliance s Instant Messaging and Presence Service developed specifically for mobile devices br Most attempts at producing a unified standard for the major IM providers AOL Yahoo and Microsoft have failed and each continues to use its own proprietary protocol br However while discussions at IETF were stalled Reuters signed the first inter service provider connectivity agreement in September This agreement enabled AIM ICQ and MSN Messenger users to talk with Reuters Messaging counterparts and vice versa Following this Microsoft Yahoo and AOL agreed to a deal in which Microsoft s Live Communications Server users would also have the possibility to talk to public instant messaging users This deal established SIP SIMPLE as a standard for protocol interoperability and established a connectivity fee for accessing public instant messaging groups or services Separately on October Microsoft and Yahoo announced that by the rd quarter of they would interoperate using SIP SIMPLE which was followed in December by the AOL and Google strategic partnership deal in which Google Talk users would be able to communicate with AIM and ICQ users provided they have an AIM account br There are two ways to combine the many disparate protocols br br Combine the many disparate protocols inside the IM client application br Combine the many disparate protocols inside the IM server application This approach moves the task of communicating with the other services to the server Clients need not know or care about other IM protocols For example LCS Public IM Connectivity This approach is popular in XMPP servers however the so called transport projects suffer the same reverse engineering difficulties as any other project involved with closed protocols or formats br Some approaches allow organizations to deploy their own private instant messaging network by enabling them to restrict access to the server often with the IM network entirely behind their firewall and administer user permissions Other corporate messaging systems allow registered users to also connect from outside the corporation LAN by using an encrypted firewall friendly HTTPS based protocol Usually a dedicated corporate IM server has several advantages such as pre populated contact lists integrated authentication and better security and privacy br Certain networks have made changes to prevent them from being used by such multi network IM clients For example Trillian had to release several revisions and patches to allow its users to access the MSN AOL and Yahoo networks after changes were made to these networks The major IM providers usually cite the need for formal agreements and security concerns as reasons for making these changes br The use of proprietary protocols has meant that many instant messaging networks have been incompatible and users have been unable to reach users on other networks This may have allowed social networking with IM like features and text messaging an opportunity to gain market share at the expense of IM br In the European Union passed the Digital Markets Act which largely came into effect in early Among other things the legislation mandates certain interoperability between the largest messaging platforms in use in Europe br br br Effects of IM on communication br Messaging applications have affected the way people communicate on their devices A survey conducted by MetrixLabs showed that of Baby Boomers of Generation X and of Generation Y said that they used messaging applications in place of texting A Facebook survey showed that of people surveyed thought that messaging applications made group messaging easier br br br Effects on workplace communication br Messaging applications have also changed how people communicate in the workplace Enterprise messaging applications like Slack TeleMessage Teamnote and Yammer allow companies to enforce policies on how employees message at work and ensure secure storage of sensitive data Message applications allow employees to separate work information from their personal emails and texts br Messaging applications may make workplace communication efficient but they can also have consequences on productivity A study at Slack showed on average people spend hours a day on Slack which is about more time than they spend using email br Instant messaging is implemented in many video conferencing tools A study of chat use during work related videoconferencing found that chat during meetings allows participants to communicate without interrupting the meeting plan action around common resources and enables greater inclusion The study also found that chat can cause distractions and information asymmetries between participants br br br IM language br br Users sometimes make use of internet slang or text speak to abbreviate common words or expressions to quicken conversations or reduce keystrokes The language has become widespread with well known expressions such as lol translated over to face to face language br Emotions are often expressed in shorthand such as the abbreviation LOL BRB and TTYL respectively laugh ing out loud be right back and talk to you later br Some however attempt to be more accurate with emotional expression over IM Real time reactions such as chortle snort guffaw or eye roll are becoming more popular Also there are certain standards that are being introduced into mainstream conversations including indicates the use of sarcasm in a statement and which indicates a spelling mistake and or grammatical error in the prior message followed by a correction br br br Business application br Instant messaging has proven to be similar to personal computers email and the World Wide Web in that its adoption for use as a business communications medium was driven primarily by individual employees using consumer software at work rather than by formal mandate or provisioning by corporate information technology departments Tens of millions of the consumer IM accounts in use are being used for business purposes by employees of companies and other organizations br In response to the demand for business grade IM and the need to ensure security and legal compliance a new type of instant messaging called Enterprise Instant Messaging EIM was created when Lotus Software launched IBM Lotus Sametime in Microsoft followed suit shortly thereafter with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging later created a new platform called Microsoft Office Live Communications Server and released Office Communications Server in October Oracle Corporation also jumped into the market with its Oracle Beehive unified collaboration software Both IBM Lotus and Microsoft have introduced federation between their EIM systems and some of the public IM networks so that employees may use one interface to both their internal EIM system and their contacts on AOL MSN and Yahoo As of leading EIM platforms include IBM Lotus Sametime Microsoft Office Communications Server Jabber XCP and Cisco Unified Presence Industry focused EIM platforms such as Reuters Messaging and Bloomberg Messaging also provide IM abilities to financial services companies br The adoption of IM across corporate networks outside of the control of IT organizations creates risks and liabilities for companies who do not effectively manage and support IM use Companies implement specialized IM archiving and security products and services to mitigate these risks and provide safe secure productive instant messaging abilities to their employees IM is increasingly becoming a feature of enterprise software rather than a stand alone application br IM products can usually be categorised into two types Enterprise Instant Messaging EIM and Consumer Instant Messaging CIM Enterprise solutions use an internal IM server however this is not always feasible particularly for smaller businesses with limited budgets The second option using a CIM provides the advantage of being inexpensive to implement and has little need for investing in new hardware or server software br For corporate use encryption and conversation archiving are usually regarded as important features due to security concerns There are also a bunch of open source encrypting messengers Sometimes the use of different operating systems in organizations requires use of software that supports more than one platform For example many software companies use Windows in administration departments but have software developers who use Linux br br br Comparison to SMS br br SMS is the acronym for short message service and allows mobile phone users to send text messages without an Internet connection while instant messaging provides similar services through an Internet connection SMS was a much more dominant form of communication before smartphones became widely used globally While SMS relied on traditional paid telephone services instant messaging apps on mobiles were available for free or a minor data charge In SMS volume peaked and in chat apps surpassed SMS in global message volume br Easier group messaging was another advantage of smartphone messaging apps and also contributed to their adoption Before the introduction of messaging apps smartphone users could only participate in single person interactions via mobile voice calls or SMS With the introduction of messaging apps the group chat functionality allows all the members to see an entire thread of everyone s responses Members can also respond directly to each other rather than having to go through the member who started the group message to relay the information br However SMS still remains popular in the United States because it is usually included free in monthly phone bundles While SMS volumes in some countries like Denmark Spain and Singapore dropped up to two thirds from to in the United States SMS use only dropped by about one quarter br br br Security and archiving br br Crackers malicious or black hat hackers have consistently used IM networks as vectors for delivering phishing attempts drive by URLs and virus laden file attachments from to the present with over discrete attacks listed by the IM Security Center in Hackers use two methods of delivering malicious code through IM delivery of viruses trojan horses or spyware within an infected file and the use of socially engineered text with a web address that entices the recipient to click on a URL connecting him or her to a website that then downloads malicious code br Viruses computer worms and trojans usually propagate by sending themselves rapidly through the infected user s contact list An effective attack using a poisoned URL may reach tens of thousands of users in a short period when each user s contact list receives messages appearing to be from a trusted friend The recipients click on the web address and the entire cycle starts again Infections may range from nuisance to criminal and are becoming more sophisticated each year br IM connections sometimes occur in plain text making them vulnerable to eavesdropping Also IM client software often requires the user to expose open UDP ports to the world raising the threat posed by potential security vulnerabilities br In the early s a new class of IT security provider emerged to provide remedies for the risks and liabilities faced by corporations who chose to use IM for business communications The IM security providers created new products to be installed in corporate networks for the purpose of archiving content scanning and security scanning IM traffic moving in and out of the corporation Similar to the e mail filtering vendors the IM security providers focus on the risks and liabilities described above br With rapid adoption of IM in the workplace demand for IM security products began to grow in the mid s By the preferred platform for the purchase of security software had become the computer appliance according to IDC who estimated that by of network security products would be delivered via an appliance br By however the level of safety offered by instant messengers was still extremely poor According to a scorecard made by the Electronic Frontier Foundation only out of instant messengers received a perfect score whereas the most popular instant messengers at the time only attained a score of out of A number of studies have shown that IM services are quite vulnerable for providing user privacy br br br Encryption br Encryption is the primary method that messaging apps use to protect user s data privacy and security SMS messages are not encrypted making them insecure as the content of each SMS message is visible to mobile carriers and governments and can be intercepted by a third party SMS messages also leak metadata or information about the message that is not the message content itself such as phone numbers of the sender and recipient which can identify the people involved in the conversation SMS messages can also be spoofed and the sender of the message can be edited to impersonate another person br Messaging applications on the market that use end to end encryption include Signal WhatsApp Wire and iMessage Applications that have been criticized for lacking or poor encryption methods include Telegram and Confide as both are prone to error or not having encryption enabled by default br br br Compliance risks br In addition to the malicious code threat the use of instant messaging at work also creates a risk of non compliance to laws and regulations governing use of electronic communications in businesses br In the United States alone there are over laws and regulations related to electronic messaging and records retention The better known of these include the Sarbanes Oxley Act HIPAA and SEC a br Clarification from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA was issued to member firms in the financial services industry in December noting that electronic communications email and electronic correspondence may be used interchangeably and can include such forms of electronic messaging as instant messaging and text messaging Changes to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure effective December created a new category for electronic records which may be requested during discovery in legal proceedings br Most nations also regulate use of electronic messaging and electronic records retention in similar fashion as the United States The most common regulations related to IM at work involve the need to produce archived business communications to satisfy government or judicial requests under law Many instant messaging communications fall into the category of business communications that must be archived and retrievable br br br User base br br As of March the most used messaging apps worldwide include Signal with million Line with million Viber with million Telegram with million WeChat with billion Facebook Messenger with billion and WhatsApp with billion users There are countries in the world where WhatsApp messenger is not the market leader in messaging apps such as the United States Canada Australia New Zealand Denmark Norway Sweden Hungary Lithuania Poland Slovakia Philippines and China br Messaging apps have varying levels of adoption in
