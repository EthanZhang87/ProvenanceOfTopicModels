Lasu n The Mission was established at the site of the Ohlone village of Oroysom The tribe lived between present day San Francisco and Monterey and more lands eastward They lived in dome shaped shelters made out of redwood bark or woven tule They were primarily hunter gatherers men hunted and trapped waterfowl rabbits deer elk and bears whilst women gathered nuts berries and root vegetables The Ohlone tribe lived beside rivers and estuaries because of the natural resources like fish and shellfish In warm weather men wore mostly nothing in the winter they wore animal hide or feather capes Other than the weather ceremonies also decided what the Ohlone men wore The women wore deerskin aprons over skirts made of tule or shredded bark br Until the tribe lived peacefully but Spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived in California to expand Spanish dominion in the Americas and convert the Native Americans to Catholicism The Ohlone people weren t intimidated by the Franciscan priests who welcomed them into their missions to live and work Before missions the Natives used tools made of stone animal bones and wood The missionaries taught them how to make metal tools and weapons and priests also showed them how to make adobe bricks The bricks were then used to build missions rather than for the tribe to utilize The Spaniards brought cattle pigs and sheep and encouraged the Ohlone to give up hunting and gathering to try farming and ranching instead Living in the missions meant Ohlone people were forced into converting to Christianity and told to forget the superstitious beliefs that connected them to nature Along with that overpopulation caused food shortages and the Spanish brought diseases to the tribe causing a lot of deaths and trouble that made an impact on a lot of lives br On their second day in the area the Mission party killed a grizzly bear in Niles Canyon The first English speaking visitor to Fremont was the renowned trapper and explorer Jedediah Smith in The Mission prospered eventually reaching a population of inhabitants in The influence of the missionaries declined after when the Mexican government enacted secularization br Jos de
