National Semiconductor was an American semiconductor manufacturer which specialized in analog devices and subsystems formerly with headquarters in Santa Clara California The company produced power management integrated circuits display drivers audio and operational amplifiers communication interface products and data conversion solutions National s key markets included wireless handsets displays and a variety of broad electronics markets including medical automotive industrial and test and measurement applications br On September the company formally became part of Texas Instruments as the Silicon Valley division br br br History br br br Founding br National Semiconductor was founded in Danbury Connecticut by Dr Bernard J Rothlein on May when he and seven colleagues Edward N Clarke Joseph J Gruber Milton Schneider Robert L Hopkins Robert L Koch Richard R Rau and Arthur V Siefert left their employment at the semiconductor division of Sperry Rand Corporation br The founding of the new company was followed by Sperry Rand filing a lawsuit against National Semiconductor for patent infringement By as it was reaching the courts the preliminaries of the lawsuit had caused the stock value of National to be depressed The depressed stock values allowed Peter J Sprague to invest heavily in the company with Sprague s family funds Sprague also relied on further financial backing from a pair of West Coast investment firms and a New York underwriter to take control as the chairman of National Semiconductor At that time Sprague was years old Jeffrey S Young characterized the era as the beginning of venture capitalism br That same year National Semiconductor acquired Molectro Molectro was founded in in Santa Clara California by J Nall and D Spittlehouse who were formerly employed at Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation The acquisition also brought to National Semiconductor two experts in linear semiconductor technologies Robert Widlar and Dave Talbert who were also formerly employed at Fairchild The acquisition of Molectro provided National with the technology to launch itself in the fabrication and manufacture of monolithic integrated circuits br In Sprague hired five top executives away from Fairchild among whom were Charles E Sporck and Pierre Lamond At the time of Sporck s hiring Robert Noyce was de facto head of semiconductor operations at Fairchild and Sporck was his operations manager br Sporck was appointed president and CEO of National To make the deal better for Sporck s hiring and appointment at half his former salary at Fairchild Sporck was allotted a substantial share of National s stock In essence Sporck took four of his personnel from Fairchild with him as well as three others from TI Perkin Elmer and Hewlett Packard to form a new eight man team at National Semiconductor Incidentally Sporck had been Widlar s superior at Fairchild before Widlar left Fairchild to join Molectro after a compensation dispute with Sporck br In National shifted its headquarters from Danbury Connecticut to Santa Clara California However like many companies National retained its registration as a Delaware corporation for legal and financial expediency br Over the years National Semiconductor acquired several companies like Fairchild Semiconductor and Cyrix However over time National Semiconductor spun off these acquisitions Fairchild Semiconductor became a separate company again in and the Cyrix microprocessors division was sold to VIA Technologies of Taiwan in br From to National enjoyed a large amount of publicity and awards with the development of the Cyrix Media Center Cyrix WebPad WebPad Metro and National Origami PDA concept devices created by National s Conceptual Products Group Based largely on the success of the WebPad National formed the Information Appliance Division highly integrated processors internet gadgets in The Information Appliance Division was sold to AMD in br Other businesses dealing in such products as digital wireless chipsets image sensors and PC I O chipsets have also been recently closed down or sold off as National has reincarnated itself as a high performance analog semiconductor company br br br The transformation of National Semiconductor br br Peter Sprague Pierre Lamond and the affectionately called Charlie Sporck worked hand in hand with support of the board of directors to transform the company into a multinational and world class semiconductor concern Immediately after becoming CEO Sporck started a historic price war among semiconductor companies which then trimmed the number of competitors in the field Among the casualties to exit the semiconductor business were General Electric and Westinghouse br Cost control overhead reduction and a focus on profits implemented by Sporck was the key element to National surviving the price war and subsequently in becoming the first semiconductor company to reach the US billion annual sales mark However the foundation that made National successful was its expertise in analog electronics TTL transistor transistor logic and MOSFET metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor integrated circuit technologies As they had while employed in Fairchild Sporck and Lamond directed National Semiconductor towards the growing industrial and commercial markets and began to rely less on military and aerospace contracts Those decisions coupled with inflationary growth in use of computers provided the market for the expansion of National Meanwhile sources of funds associated with Sprague coupled with creative structuring of cash flow buffering due to Sporck and Lamond provided the financing required for that expansion Lamond and Sporck had also managed to attract and extract substantial funds to finance the expansion br Among Sporck s cost control efforts was his offshore outsourcing of labour National Semiconductor was among the pioneers in the semiconductor industry to invest in facilities to perform final manufacturing operations of integrated circuits in developing countries especially in Southeast Asia br National Semiconductor s manufacturing improvements under Sporck in collaboration with Lamond was enabled not by emphasizing process innovation but by improving and standardizing processes already established by other companies like Fairchild and Texas Instruments as well as by frequent raiding to hire from Fairchild s pool of talents br br br Weaknesses of Sporck s leadership br National Semiconductor under Sporck was not particularly invested in marketing strategies even though it had the vision to launch itself into new and apparent opportunities in the consumer market Sporck had applied strategies that made National Semiconductor function as a low cost mass manufacturer of semiconductor commodities br A few key executives and engineers left the company in Among them was Pierre Lamond who had been the chief IC designer now partner at Sequoia Capital Robert Swanson s departure in the same year to found Linear Technology was another indication of the appropriateness of organisational strategies of National Semiconductor under Sporck For of years at National I was a gung ho guy Then the company started to get big I kept looking at all the companies whose butts we d been kicking And then National started organizing itself like them It was frustrating Swanson said in the May Business Journal San Jose br Sporck s strategy of outsourcing sales to external sources meant National Semiconductor did not have sufficient or responsive resources to respond to requests from innovators inventors and academic research which would have been helpful in the technological innovation boom of the s br National Semiconductor s lack and loss of innovation meant it was producing products that were easily copied and reproducible It may have been the cheapest manufacturer in the United States but it was not the cheapest compared to the Asian manufacturers This weakness in National Semiconductor was evident in its failure to compete during the globalisation of Japanese semiconductor companies in the s followed by globalisation of Taiwanese and South Korean companies br br br Leadership under Gilbert F Amelio br On May Charles E Sporck was replaced by Gil Amelio as CEO and president Amelio was then president of Rockwell International s semiconductor division and had a Ph D in physics from Georgia Institute of Technology Amelio had also been formerly employed at Fairchild br Amelio was faced with a company plagued with over capacity and shrinking market share Amelio found that just prior to his taking helm despite having spent US billion over the last five years on research and development National Semiconductor had a disappointing record in new products The Business section of The New York Times January reflected the over capacity generated by Sporck that had to be inherited by Amelio br Amelio disposed of the non core products and assets in which National Semiconductor had no market motivation or expertise and turned the company towards its core expertise analog semiconductors National Semiconductor under Amelio emphasized on reduction of cost of sales improving capacity utilization scrap reduction and cycle time reduction Redundant facilities were sold and consolidated br With the progress of restructuring National Semiconductor increased revenues each year In National Semiconductor under Amelio posted record net revenues of US billion It was also a time when US semiconductor companies had regained market leadership Amelio introduced benchmarking to evaluate productivity restructured marketing strategies and reorganised management by introducing modern management practices and workplace environments br Amelio divided products into two divisions Standard Products Group which comprised low margin logic and memory chips commodity products which were more susceptible to cyclical demands and through which National Semiconductor had matured and Communications Computing Group which comprised high margin value added analog and mixed signal chips Amelio s division of products seemed to prepare National Semiconductor for the eventual disposal of low margin commodity products which came to fruition later with the sale of a reconstituted Fairchild br National Semiconductor under Amelio chose to build a brand new eight inch mm wafer fabrication plant in South Portland Maine It chose to divest itself of its then somewhat new plant in Migdal HaEmek Israel which became Tower Semiconductor br In Amelio was elected as the chairman of the board of directors of National Semiconductor br In Amelio accepted an invitation from Apple Computer a customer of National Semiconductor to join its board of directors Troubles at Apple later prompted the board to invite Amelio to take on the position of CEO which he accepted in February National Semiconductor announced the resignation of Amelio as the company s president chairman and chief executive officer on February br br br Leadership under Brian L Halla br National Semiconductor announced the appointment of Brian L Halla as its chairman president and CEO on May Halla was then the head of LSI logic products division Prior to LSI he had been with Intel for years br Halla reinforced Amelio s emphasis on the expertise of National Semiconductor in analog technology He also was on occasions an evangelist for analog technology However he found that National Semiconductor under Amelio had too few product offerings Halla embarked on a diversification into personal computer and graphics business br He advocated PC on a chip aka system on a chip as a business direction for National Semiconductor During his tenure at LSI LSI had successfully applied similar concepts However LSI had steered clear of getting involved with PC technologies that would make it a competitor with Intel Halla held the vision that information appliances IAs would succeed the personal computer as a trend He predicted that IAs would overtake sales of PCs by the year br To achieve the goal National Semiconductor started acquiring companies that would provide the needed technological complements Among the acquisitions were Cirrus Logic Inc s PicoPower business for its specialised expertise in small form factor devices Mediamatics Inc which makes multimedia connectivity products Future Integrated Systems Inc a PC graphics company Gulbransen Inc a digital audio technology maker ComCore Semiconductor Inc a maker of digital signal processing for LANs Cyrix the maker of Intel x clones br On March National Semiconductor Corporation announced the US million sale of a reconstituted Fairchild to the management of Fairchild with the backing of Sterling LLC a unit of Citicorp Venture Capital Fairchild carried with it what was mostly the Standard Products group previously segregated by Amelio Incidentally the effective price of acquisition of Cyrix was also US million br On November National Semiconductor and Cyrix announced the merger of the companies Cyrix would become an autonomous wholly owned subsidiary Halla had earlier emphasized that National was after the low end CPU market as part of the system on a chip pursuit and therefore would not place emphasis on Cyrix s current development of high end x MX design However Cyrix later announced that its merger with National Semiconductor would not change its development or marketing plans br The acquisition of an independent minded Cyrix subsequently turned National Semiconductor from a collaborator into a competitor with Intel National lost its business with Intel Intel reinstated the relationship after the sale of Cyrix br The acquisition of Cyrix also carried with it a business obligation to use the IBM Microelectronics Division to fabricate the Cyrix chips as well as technical constraint to do the same while National Semiconductor had plans to transfer their fabrication to its South Portland fab National incurred huge losses in its processor business and announced the sale of Cyrix to VIA in br In National Semiconductor also put out feelers for selling if not the whole then a majority stake of its fabrication plant in South Portland Maine However that did not come to fruition br On June National Semiconductor and TSMC Taiwan signed an agreement that would allow transfer of advanced fabrication technologies from TSMC to the National Semiconductor fabrication plant in South Portland Maine br On March National announced plans to close its assembly and test plant in Suzhou China and its wafer fabrication plant in Arlington Texas br On October Brian Halla announced his retirement as National s CEO He remains executive chairman The company promoted Donald Don Macleod who had previously served as the company s president and chief operating officer to CEO br br br Leadership under Donald Macleod br Don Macleod became National Semiconductor s chief executive officer on November He was named chairman of the board on May br br br Acquisition by Texas Instruments br br On April Texas Instruments announced that it had agreed to buy National Semiconductor for billion in cash Texas Instruments paid per share of National Semiconductor stock an premium over the April closing share price of The deal made Texas Instruments one of the world s largest makers of analog technology components On September the Chinese minister approved the merger the last one needed The companies formally merged on September br br br Manufacturing locations br br National Semiconductor also had operations in Migdal tower Ha Emeq valley Israel National Semiconductor had six inch mm wafer fabrication operations there In National Semiconductor divested to retain ownership of the plant The plant in Migdal Ha Emeq Israel is now constituted as Tower Semiconductor of Israel br br br Products br analog circuits br operational amplifiers br
