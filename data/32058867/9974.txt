The European Commission EC is the primary executive arm of the European Union EU It operates as a cabinet government with members of the Commission directorial system informally known as Commissioners headed by a President It includes an administrative body of about European civil servants The commission is divided into departments known as Directorates General DGs that can be likened to departments or ministries each headed by a Director General who is responsible to a Commissioner br There is one member per member state but members are bound by their oath of office to represent the general interest of the EU as a whole rather than their home state The Commission President currently Ursula von der Leyen is proposed by the European Council the heads of state governments and elected by the European Parliament The Council of the European Union then nominates the other members of the Commission in agreement with the nominated President and the members as a team are then subject to a vote of approval by the European Parliament The current Commission is the Von der Leyen Commission which took office in December following the European Parliament elections in May of the same year br br br History br br The European Commission derives from one of the five key institutions created in the supranational European Community system following the proposal of Robert Schuman French Foreign Minister on May Originating in as the High Authority in the European Coal and Steel Community the commission has undergone numerous changes in power and composition under various presidents involving three Communities br br br Establishment br br The first Commission originated in as the nine member High Authority under President Jean Monnet see Monnet Authority The High Authority was the supranational administrative executive of the new European Coal and Steel Community ECSC It took office first on August in Luxembourg City In the Treaties of Rome had established two new communities alongside the ECSC the European Economic Community EEC and the European Atomic Energy Community Euratom However their executives were called Commissions rather than High Authorities The reason for the change in name was the new relationship between the executives and the Council Some states such as France expressed reservations over the power of the High Authority and wished to limit it by giving more power to the Council rather than the new executives br br Louis Armand led the first Commission of Euratom Walter Hallstein led the first Commission of the EEC holding the first formal meeting on January at the Ch teau of Val Duchesse It achieved agreement on a contentious cereal price accord as well as making a positive impression upon third countries when it made its international debut at the Kennedy Round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade GATT negotiations Hallstein notably began the consolidation of European law and started to have a notable impact on national legislation Little heed was taken of his administration at first but with help from the European Court of Justice his Commission stamped its authority solidly enough to allow future Commissions to be taken more seriously In however accumulating differences between the French government of Charles de Gaulle and the other member states on various subjects British entry direct elections to Parliament the Fouchet Plan and the budget triggered the empty chair crisis ostensibly over proposals for the Common Agricultural Policy Although the institutional crisis was solved the following year it cost tienne Hirsch his presidency of Euratom and later Walter Hallstein the EEC presidency despite his otherwise being viewed as the most dynamic leader until Jacques Delors br br br Early development br br The three bodies collectively named the European Executives co existed until July when under the Merger Treaty they were combined into a single administration under President Jean Rey Owing to the merger the Rey Commission saw a temporary increase to members although subsequent Commissions were reduced back to nine following the formula of one member for small states and two for larger states The Rey Commission completed the Community s customs union in and campaigned for a more powerful elected European Parliament Despite Rey being the first President of the combined communities Hallstein is seen as the first President of the modern Commission br The Malfatti and Mansholt Commissions followed with work on monetary co operation and the first enlargement to the north in With that enlargement the College of Commissioners membership increased to thirteen under the Ortoli Commission the United Kingdom as a large member was granted two Commissioners which dealt with the enlarged community during economic and international instability at that time The external representation of the Community took a step forward when President Roy Jenkins recruited to the presidency in January from his role as Home Secretary of the United Kingdom s Labour government became the first President to attend a G summit on behalf of the Community Following the Jenkins Commission Gaston Thorn s Commission oversaw the Community s enlargement to the south in addition to beginning work on the Single European Act br br br Jacques Delors br br The Commission headed by Jacques Delors was seen as giving the Community a sense of direction and dynamism Delors and his College are also considered as the founding fathers of the euro The International Herald Tribune noted the work of Delors at the end of his second term in Mr Delors rescued the European Community from the doldrums He arrived when Europessimism was at its worst Although he was a little known former French finance minister he breathed life and hope into the EC and into the dispirited Brussels Commission In his first term from to he rallied Europe to the call of the single market and when appointed to a second term he began urging Europeans toward the far more ambitious goals of economic monetary and political union br br br Jacques Santer br br The successor to Delors was Jacques Santer As a result of a fraud and corruption scandal the entire Santer Commission was forced by the Parliament to resign in a central role was played by dith Cresson These frauds were revealed by an internal auditor Paul van Buitenen br That was the first time a College of Commissioners had been forced to resign en masse and represented a shift of power towards the Parliament However the Santer Commission did carry out work on the Treaty of Amsterdam and the euro In response to the scandal the European Anti Fraud Office OLAF was created br br br Romano Prodi br br Following Santer Romano Prodi took office The Amsterdam Treaty had increased the commission s powers and Prodi was dubbed by the press as something akin to a Prime Minister Powers were strengthened again the Treaty of Nice signed in gave the Presidents more power over the composition of the College of Commissioners br br br Jos Manuel Barroso br br Jos Manuel Barroso became president in the Parliament once again asserted itself in objecting to the proposed membership of the Barroso Commission Owing to this opposition Barroso was forced to reshuffle his College before taking office The Barroso Commission was also the first full Commission since the enlargement in to members hence the number of Commissioners at the end of the Prodi Commission had reached As a result of the increase in the number of states the Amsterdam Treaty triggered a reduction in the number of Commissioners to one per state rather than two for the larger states br Allegations of fraud and corruption were again raised in by former chief auditor Jules Muis A Commission officer Guido Strack reported alleged fraud and abuses in his department in the years to OLAF and was fired as a result In Paul van Buitenen the former auditor known from the Santer Commission scandal accused the European Anti Fraud Office OLAF of a lack of independence and effectiveness br Barroso s first Commission term expired on October Under the Treaty of Nice the first Commission to be appointed after the number of member states reached would have to be reduced to less than the number of Member States The exact number of Commissioners was to be decided by a unanimous vote of the European Council and membership would rotate equally between member states Following the accession of Romania and Bulgaria in January this clause took effect for the next Commission The Treaty of Lisbon which came into force on December mandated a reduction of the number of commissioners to two thirds of member states from unless the Council decided otherwise Membership would rotate equally and no member state would have more than one Commissioner However the treaty was rejected by voters in Ireland in with one main concern being the loss of their Commissioner Hence a guarantee given for a rerun of the vote was that the council would use its power to amend the number of Commissioners upwards However according to the treaties it still has to be fewer than the total number of members thus it was proposed that the member state that does not get a Commissioner would get the post of High Representative the so called formula This guarantee which may find its way into the next treaty amendment probably in an accession treaty contributed to the Irish approving the treaty in a second referendum in br Lisbon also combined the posts of European Commissioner for External Relations with the council s High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy This post also a Vice President of the Commission would chair the Council of the European Union s foreign affairs meetings as well as the commission s external relations duties The treaty further provides that the most recent European elections should be taken into account when appointing the President of the European Commission and although they are still proposed by the European Council the European Parliament elects candidates to the office rather than approves them as under the Treaty of Nice br The Barroso Commission is in reaction to Euroscepticism said to have toned down enforcement to increase integration br br br Jean Claude Juncker br br In Jean Claude Juncker became President of the European Commission br Juncker appointed his previous campaign director and head of the transition team Martin Selmayr as his chief of cabinet During the Juncker presidency Selmayr has been described as the most powerful EU chief of staff ever br br br Ursula von der Leyen br br In Ursula von der Leyen was appointed as President of the European Commission She submitted the guidelines of her policy to the European Parliament on July following her confirmation She had not been considered a likely candidate in general the elected candidate is determined according to the results of the European election as winner of the internal election into the dominant European party known as spitzenkandidat While the European People s Party had won the European Parliament election they had performed worse than expected and therefore nominated von der Leyen instead of Manfred Weber their original candidate On September the Council of the European Union declared a list of candidate commissioners which are sent to Brussels by the governments of each member state and which had to be officially approved by the parliament br br br Powers and functions br The commission was set up from the start to act as an independent supranational authority separate from governments it has been described as the only body paid to think European The members are proposed by their member state governments one from each However they are bound to act independently free from other influences such as those governments which appointed them This is in contrast to the Council of the European Union which represents governments the European Parliament which represents citizens the Economic and Social Committee which represents organised civil society and the Committee of the Regions which represents local and regional authorities br Through Article of the Treaty on European Union the commission has several responsibilities to develop medium term strategies to draft legislation and arbitrate in the legislative process to represent the EU in trade negotiations to make rules and regulations for example in competition policy to draw up the budget of the European Union and to scrutinise the implementation of the treaties and legislation The rules of procedure of the European Commission set out the commission s operation and organisation br br br Executive power br Before the Treaty of Lisbon came into force the executive power of the EU was held by the council it conferred on the Commission such powers for it to exercise However the council was allowed to withdraw these powers exercise them directly or impose conditions on their use This aspect has been changed by the Treaty of Lisbon after which the Commission exercises its powers just by virtue of the treaties Powers are more restricted than most national executives in part due to the commission s lack of power over areas like foreign policy that power is held by the Council of the European Union and the European Council which some analysts have described as another executive br Considering that under the Treaty of Lisbon the European Council has become a formal institution with the power of appointing the commission it could be said that the two bodies hold the executive power of the EU the European Council also holds individual national executive powers However it is the Commission that currently holds most of the executive power over the European Union br br br Legislative initiative br The Commission differs from the other institutions in that it alone has legislative initiative in the EU Only the commission can make formal proposals for legislation they cannot originate in the legislative branches Under the Treaty of Lisbon no legislative act is allowed in the field of the Common Foreign and Security Policy In the other fields the Council and Parliament can request legislation in most cases the Commission initiates on the basis of these proposals This monopoly is designed to ensure coordinated and coherent drafting of EU law This monopoly has been challenged by some who claim the Parliament should also have the right with most national parliaments holding the right in some respects However the Council and Parliament may request the commission to draft legislation though the Commission does have the power to refuse to do so as it did in over transnational collective conventions Under the Lisbon Treaty EU citizens are also able to request the commission to legislate in an area via a petition carrying one million signatures but this is not binding br The commission s powers in proposing law have usually centred on economic regulation It has put forward a large number of regulations based on a precautionary principle This means that pre emptive regulation takes place if there is a credible hazard to the environment or human health for example on tackling climate change and restricting genetically modified organisms The European Commission has committed EU member states to carbon neutrality by This is opposed to weighting regulations for their effect on the economy Thus the Commission often proposes stricter legislation than other countries Owing to the size of the European market this has made EU legislation an important influence in the global market On February the European Commission published the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive which establishes a framework of due diligence for companies to identify actual or potential risks and harm to human rights and the environment as well as establishing processes and standards to diminish these risks The Directive is expected to be officially adopted in and then be incorporated into domestic laws within two years by all of the European Union member states br Recently the commission has moved into creating European criminal law In a toxic waste spill off the coast of C te d Ivoire from a European ship prompted the commission to look into legislation against toxic waste at that time did not even have a crime against shipping toxic waste this led the Commissioners Franco Frattini and Stavros Dimas to put forward the idea of ecological crimes Their right to propose criminal law was challenged in the European Court of Justice but upheld As of the only other criminal law proposals which have been brought forward are on the intellectual property rights directive and on an amendment to the counter terrorism framework decision outlawing terrorism related incitement recruitment especially via the internet and training br br br Enforcement br Once legislation is passed by the Council and Parliament it is the commission s responsibility to ensure it is implemented It does this through the member states or through its agencies In adopting the necessary technical measures the commission is assisted by committees made up of representatives of member states and of the public and private lobbies a process known in jargon as comitology Furthermore the commission is responsible for the implementation of the EU budget ensuring along with the Court of Auditors that EU funds are correctly spent br In particular the commission has a duty to ensure the treaties and law are upheld potentially by taking member states or other institutions to the Court of Justice in a dispute In this role it is known informally as the Guardian of the Treaties Finally the Commission provides some external representation for the Union alongside the member states and the Common Foreign and Security Policy representing the Union in bodies such as the World Trade Organization It is also usual for the President to attend meetings of the G br br br College of Commissioners br br The commission is composed of a College of Commissioners of members including the President and vice presidents Even though each member is nominated on the basis of the suggestions made by the national governments one per state they do not represent their state in the commission In practice however they do occasionally press for their national interest Once proposed the President delegates portfolios among each of the members The power of a Commissioner largely depends upon their portfolio and can vary over time For example the Education Commissioner has been growing in importance in line with the rise in the importance of education and culture in European policy making Another example is the Competition Commissioner who holds a highly visible position with global reach Before the commission can assume office the college as a whole must be approved by the Parliament Commissioners are supported by their personal cabinet who give them political guidance while the Civil Service the DGs see below deal with technical preparation br br br Appointment br br The President of the Commission is first proposed by the European Council following a Qualified Majority Vote QMV taking into account the latest parliamentary elections any person from the largest party can be picked that candidate then faces a formal election in the European Parliament Thus this serves as a form of indirect election If the European Parliament fails to elect the candidate the European Council shall propose another within one month br Following the selection of the President and the appointment of the High Representative by the European Council each Commissioner is nominated by their member state except for those states who provided the President and High Representative in consultation with the Commission President who is responsible for the allocation of portfolios The President s proposed College of Commissioners is then subject to hearings at the European Parliament which will question them and then vote on their suitability as a whole If the European Parliament submits a negative opinion of a candidate the President must either reshuffle them or request a new candidate from the member state to avoid the college s outright rejection by the European Parliament Once the college is approved by parliament it is formally appointed following a QMV vote by the European Council br Following the college s appointment the President appoints a number of Vice Presidents from among the commissioners Vice Presidents manage policy areas involving multiple Commissioners One of these includes the High Representative who is automatically one of the Vice Presidents ex officio rather than by appointment and confirmation Commonly referred to as the HR VP position the High Representative also coordinates commissioners activities involving the external relations and defence cooperation of the European Union The von der Leyen Commission also created the position of more senior Executive Vice Presidents appointed from the three largest political groups in the European Parliament Unlike the other vice presidents their mission is to manage the incumbent Commission s top priority policy areas for which they receive additional support from a dedicated Directorate General br br br Dismissal br The European Parliament can dissolve the College of Commissioners as a whole following a vote of no confidence which requires a two thirds vote br Only the President can request the resignation of an individual Commissioner However individual Commissioners by request of the council or Commission can be compelled to retire on account of a breach of obligation s and if so ruled by the European Court of Justice Art and Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union br br br Political styles br The Barroso Commission took office in late after being delayed by objections from the Parliament which forced a reshuffle In the Commission increased from to members with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria who each appointed their own Commissioners With the increasing size of the commission Barroso adopted a more presidential style of control over the college which earned him some criticism br However under Barroso the commission began to lose ground to the larger member states as countries such as France the UK and Germany sought to sideline its role This has increased with the creation of the President of the European Council under the Treaty of Lisbon There has also been a greater degree of politicisation within the Commission br br br Administration br br The commission is divided into departments known as Directorates General DGs that can be likened to departments or ministries Each covers a specific policy area such as agriculture or justice and citizens rights or internal services such as human resources and translation and is headed by a director general who is responsible to a commissioner A commissioner s portfolio can be supported by numerous DGs they prepare proposals for them and if approved by a majority of commissioners proposals go forward to the Parliament and Council for consideration The Commission s civil service is headed by a Secretary General The position is currently held by Ilze Juhansone The rules of procedure of the European Commission set out the commission s operation and organisation br There has been criticism from a number of people that the highly fragmented DG structure wastes a considerable amount of time in turf wars as the different departments and Commissioners compete with each other Furthermore the DGs can exercise considerable control over a Commissioner with the Commissioner having little time to learn to assert control over their staff br According to figures published by the commission persons were employed by the commission as officials and temporary agents in September In addition to these external staff e g Contractual agents detached national experts young experts trainees etc were employed The single largest DG is the Directorate General for Translation with a strong staff while the largest group by nationality is Belgian probably due to a majority of staff being based in the country br br br Press br br Communication with the press is handled by the Directorate General Communication The commission s chief spokesperson is Eric Mamer who holds the midday press briefings commonly known as the Midday Presser It takes place every weekday in the commission s press room at the Berlaymont where journalists may ask questions to the Commission officials on any topic and legitimately expect to get an on the record answer for live TV Such a situation is unique in the world br As an integral part of the Directorate General for Communication the Spokesperson s Service in coordination with the Executive Communication Adviser in the President s Cabinet supports the President and Commissioners so that they can communicate effectively On political communication matters the chief spokesperson reports directly to the President of the European Commission br It has been noted by one researcher that the press releases issued by the commission are uniquely political A release often goes through several stages of drafting which emphasises the role of the commission and is used for justifying the EU and the Commission increasing their length and complexity Where there are multiple departments involved a press release can also be a source of competition between areas of the Commission and Commissioners themselves This also leads to an unusually high number of press releases and is seen as a unique product of the EU s political set up br There is a larger press corps in Brussels than Washington D C in media outlets in every Union member state had a Brussels correspondent Although there has been a worldwide cut in journalists the considerable press releases and operations such as Europe by Satellite and EuroparlTV leads many news organisations to believe they can cover the EU from these source and news agencies The Commission shut down Presseurop on December though the decision was criticised br br br Legitimacy and criticism br br As the commission is the executive branch candidates are chosen individually by the national governments Within the EU the legitimacy of the commission is mainly drawn from the vote of approval that is required from the European Parliament along with its power to dismiss the body Eurosceptics have therefore raised the concern of the relatively low turnout often less than in elections for the European Parliament since While that figure may be higher than that of some national elections including the off year elections of the United States Congress the fact that there are no direct elections for the position of Commission President calls the position s legitimacy into question in the eyes of some Eurosceptics The fact that the commission can directly decide albeit with oversight from specially formed comitology committees on the shape and character of implementing legislation further raises concerns about democratic legitimacy br Even though democratic structures and methods are changing there is not such a mirror in creating a European civil society The Treaty of Lisbon may go some way to resolving the perceived deficit in creating greater democratic controls on the commission including enshrining the procedure of linking elections to the selection of the Commission president Historically the commission had indeed been seen as a technocratic expert body which akin with institutions such as independent central banks deals with technical areas of policy and therefore ought to be removed from party politics From this viewpoint electoral pressures would undermine the commission s role as an independent regulator Defenders of the Commission point out that legislation must be approved by the Council in all areas the ministers of member states and the European Parliament in most areas before it can be adopted thus the amount of legislation which is adopted in any one country without the approval of its government is limited br In the European ombudsman published statistics of citizens complaints against EU institutions with most of them filed against the commission and concerning lack of transparency In the commission was sued for blocking access to documents on EU biofuel policy This happened after media accused the Commission of blocking scientific evidence against biofuel subsidies Lack of transparency unclear lobbyist relations conflicts of interests and excessive spending of the commission was highlighted in a number of reports by internal and independent auditing organisations It has also been criticised on IT related issues particularly with regard to Microsoft br In September the European Commission put forward an Anti Racism Action Plan to tackle the structural racism in the European Union including measures to address the lack of racial diversity among the European decision makers in Brussels as denounced by the BrusselsSoWhite movement br br br Initiatives br br br Anti terrorism br The European Commission has an Action Plan to enhance preparedness against chemical biological radiological and nuclear CBRN security risks as part of its anti terrorism package released in October In recent times Europe has seen an increased threat level of CBRN attacks As such the European Commission s preparedness plan is important said Steven Neville Chatfield a director for the Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response in the United Kingdom s Health Protection Agency For the first time the European Commission proposed that medical preparedness for CBRN attack threats is a high priority The European Commission s EC Action Plan to enhance preparedness against CBRN security risks is part of its anti terrorism package released in October a strategy aimed at better protecting the more than million citizens across the member states of the European Union EU br br br COVID response br The European Commission organized a video conference of world leaders on May to raise funds for COVID vaccine development US billion was raised br The European Commission issued a new multi year data plan in February pushing the digitalization of all aspects of EU society for the benefit of civic and economic growth br The goal of this data strategy is to create a single market for data in which data flows across the EU and across sectors while maintaining full respect for privacy and data protection where access rules are fair and where the European economy benefits enormously as a global player as a result of the new data economy br br br Location br br The commission s political seat is in Brussels with the President s office and the commission s meeting room on the th floor of the Berlaymont building The commission also operates out of numerous other buildings in Brussels and Luxembourg City When the Parliament is meeting in Strasbourg the Commissioners also meet there in the Winston Churchill building to attend the Parliament s debates The Members of the Commission and their cabinets immediate teams are also based in the Berlaymont building in Brussels Additionally the European Commission has in house scientific facilities that support it in Ispra Italy Petten Netherlands Karlsruhe Germany Geel Belgium and Seville Spain In Grange County
