LogMeIn Hamachi is a virtual private network VPN application developed and released in by Alex Pankratov It is capable of establishing direct links between computers that are behind network address translation NAT firewalls without requiring reconfiguration when the user s PC can be accessed directly without relays from the Internet WAN side Like other VPNs it establishes a connection over the Internet that emulates the connection that would exist if the computers were connected over a local area network LAN br Hamachi became a LogMeIn product after the acquisition of Applied Networking Inc in It is currently available as a production version for Microsoft Windows and macOS as a beta version for Linux and as a system VPN based client compatible with Android and iOS br br br Operational summary br Hamachi is a proprietary centrally managed VPN system consisting of the server cluster managed by the vendor of the system and the client software which is installed on end user devices br Client software adds a virtual network interface to a computer and it is used for intercepting outbound as well as injecting inbound VPN traffic Outbound traffic sent by the operating system to this interface is delivered to the client software which encrypts and authenticates it and then sends it to the destination VPN peer over a specially initiated UDP connection Hamachi currently handles tunneling of IP traffic including broadcasts and multicast The Windows version also recognizes and tunnels IPX traffic br Each client establishes and maintains a control br connection to the server cluster When the connection is established the client goes through a login sequence followed by the discovery process and state synchronization The login step authenticates the client to the server and vice versa The discovery is used to determine the topology of the client s Internet connection specifically to detect the presence of NAT and firewall devices on its route to the Internet The synchronization step brings a client s view of its private networks in sync with other members of these networks br When a member of a network goes online or offline the server instructs other network peers to either establish or tear down tunnels to the former When establishing tunnels between the peers Hamachi uses a server assisted NAT traversal technique similar to UDP hole punching br Hamachi is frequently used for gaming and remote administration br br br Addressing br Each Hamachi client is normally assigned an IP address when it logs into the system for the first time To avoid conflicting with existing private networks on the client side the normal private IP address blocks and are not used br The IP address assigned to the Hamachi client is henceforth associated with the client s public crypto key As long as the client retains its key it can log into the system and use this IP address Hamachi creates a single broadcast domain between all clients This makes it possible to use LAN protocols that rely on IP broadcasts for discovery and announcement services over Hamachi networks br br br See also br Network address translation NAT as defined in RFC br Pertino br Private network as defined in RFC br Session Traversal Utilities for NAT STUN as defined in RFC br UDP hole punching another NAT traversal technique br Virtual Private LAN Service as defined in RFC and br XLink Kai br br br br br br External links br Official website
