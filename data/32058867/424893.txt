History br Synopsys was founded by Aart de Geus David Gregory and Bill Krieger in in Research Triangle Park North Carolina The company was initially established as Optimal Solutions with a charter to develop and market logic synthesis technology developed by the team at General Electric s Advanced Computer Aided Engineering Group The company changed its name to Synopsys and moved to Mountain View California in It became a public company through an initial public offering in February br The company built a supercomputer using commodity Linux servers and off the shelf hardware in to develop and run EDA applications with intense computational requirements With LINPACK benchmark results topping teraflops the supercomputer made it to the TOP list ranked nd most powerful at the time br In Synopsys established a million strategic investment fund for the Chinese market br In according to the Center for Security and Emerging Technology Synopsys partnered with the People s Liberation Army National Defence University to provide field programmable gate array design training Synopsys also sells EDA software to companies under the control of Chinese regional governments br The company launched a cloud based artificial intelligence AI software tool DSO ai for chip design in early The AI approach which uses reinforcement learning allows the tool to automatically decide how best to place and route blocks of circuitry on a chip In March the company rolled out AI based tools used in the other stages of chip design including VSO ai for verification and TSO ai testing br In the United States Department of Defense announced Synopsys as a partner in DARPA s Automatic Implementation of Secure Silicon AISS research program alongside ARM Boeing IBM and other entities focused on

employees bought the startup ArcSys which was previously merged with Integrated Silicon Solutions ISS gaining Avanti its design rule checking and layout versus schematic tool Hercules including D silicon structure modeling then bought Compass Design Automation which had fully integrated IC design flow and ASIC libraries especially its place and route tool which Avanti reworked to create Saturn and Apollo II and it also bought TMA Technology Modeling Associates which brought its pioneering TCAD and Proteus optical proximity correction tools This was by far Synopsys most significant and controversial acquisition At the time Avanti was the company in the EDA industry and was struggling with a major lawsuit from Cadence for software theft Avanti was merged into Synopsys on June during the litigation Synopsys paid Cadence about million more to end all litigation Soon after the settlement the California Supreme Court upheld the lower court s earlier decision Synopsys then paid an additional million to Silvaco to settle two of Silvaco s three lawsuits against Meta Software earlier purchased by Avanti and its president The lawsuits were filed in and inherited by Avanti br br br Magma Design Automation br Synopsys agreed to buy its competitor Magma Design Automation for about million in an all cash deal in November br The two companies previously faced drawn out back and forth patent disputes since which started when Synopsys accused Magma s co founder Lukas van Ginneken of conceiving the technology used in their products to be based on the work while he was still employed at Synopsys While van Ginneken later acknowledged the claim Magma and Synopsys continued disputing each other s patents The litigations were eventually settled in with Magma paying Synopsys million and the companies agreeing to cross license the disputed patents to each other br br br Ciranova br Ciranova was an EDA company which focused on analog design automation The company authored the Python based PyCell software now central to IPL Alliance iPDK parameterized cells used by many foundries such as TSMC and also developed an automatic analog layout tools called Helix Ciranova was
