Andreessen Horowitz and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board bought of Skype for billion from eBay valuing the business at billion In May Microsoft bought Skype for billion and used it to replace their Windows Live Messenger As of most of the development team and of all the division s employees were in Tallinn and Tartu Estonia br Skype originally featured a hybrid peer to peer and client server system It became entirely powered by Microsoft operated supernodes in May in it changed from a peer to peer service to a centralized Azure based service As of February it was used by million people each day br br br Etymology br The name for the software is derived from Sky peer to peer which was then abbreviated to Skyper However some of the domain names associated with Skyper were already taken Dropping the final r left the current title Skype for which domain names were available br br br History br br Skype was founded in by Niklas Zennstr m from Sweden and Janus Friis from Denmark The software was created by Estonians Ahti Heinla Priit Kasesalu Jaan Tallinn and Toivo Annus Friis and Annus are credited with the idea of reducing the cost of voice calls by using a P P protocol like that of Kazaa An early alpha version was created and tested in spring and the first public beta version was released on August br In June Skype entered an agreement with Polish web portal Onet pl for an integrated offering on the Polish market On September eBay Inc agreed to acquire Luxembourg based Skype Technologies SA for approximately US billion in up front cash and eBay

r l for US billion It was incorporated as a division of Microsoft which acquired all its technologies with the purchase The acquisition was completed on October Microsoft began integrating the Skype service with its own products Along with taking over the development of existing Skype desktop and mobile apps it developed a dedicated client app for its then newly released touch focused Windows and Windows RT operating systems which were made available from Windows Store when the then new OS launched on October The following year it became the default messaging app for Windows replacing the Windows Messaging app at the time and was pre installed on every device that came with or upgraded to br In a month long transition from to April Microsoft discontinued two of its own products in favor of Skype including its Windows Live Messenger instant messaging service although Messenger continued to be available in mainland China until October br On November Microsoft announced that in its Lync product would be replaced by Skype for Business combining the features of Lync and the consumer Skype software Organizations that used it could switch their users between the default Skype for Business interface and the Lync interface br br br Post acquisition br On August Skype released the update for Apple iPhone and iPad apps that allowed HD quality video for iPhone and fourth generation iPads br On November Microsoft Office s team announced that a new chat powered by Skype would be implemented in their software enabling users to chat with co workers in the same document br On September Skype announced the release of Mojis a brand new way to express yourself on Skype short video clips and GIFs featuring characters from films and TV shows that could be entered into conversations like emoticons Skype worked with Universal Studios Disney Muppets BBC and other studios to enhance the Mojis collection Later that year Gurdeep Singh Pall Corporate Vice President of Skype announced that Microsoft had acquired the technology from Talko br In July Skype introduced an early Alpha version of a new Skype for Linux client built with WebRTC technology after several petitions asked Microsoft to continue development for Linux In September of that year Skype updated their iOS app with new features including an option to call contacts on Skype through Siri voice commands In October of that year Microsoft launched Skype for Business for Mac br In February Microsoft announced plans to discontinue its Skype Wi Fi service globally The application was delisted and the service itself became non functional from March On June Microsoft announced its plans to revamp Skype with similar features to Snapchat allowing users to share temporary copies of their photos and video files In late June Microsoft rolled out their latest update for iOS incorporating a revamped design and new third party integrations with platforms including Gfycat YouTube and UpWorthy It was not well received with numerous negative reviews and complaints that the new client broke existing functionality Skype later removed this makeover In December Microsoft added Skype Interviews a shared code editing system for those wishing to hold job interviews for programming roles br Microsoft eventually moved the service from a peer to peer to a central server based system and with it adjusted the user interfaces of apps to make text based messaging more prominent than voice calling Skype for Windows iOS Android Mac and Linux all received significant visual overhauls at this time br br br Features br br Registered users of Skype are identified by a unique Skype ID and may be listed in the Skype directory under a Skype username Skype allows these registered users to communicate through both instant messaging and voice chat Voice chat allows telephone calls between pairs of users and conference calling and uses proprietary audio codec Skype s text chat client allows group chats emoticons storing chat history and editing of previous messages Offline messages were implemented in a beta build of version but removed after a few weeks without notification The usual features familiar to instant messaging users user profiles online status indicators and so on are also included br The Online Number a k a SkypeIn service allows Skype users to receive calls on their computers dialed by conventional phone subscribers to a local Skype phone number local numbers are available for Australia Belgium Brazil Chile Colombia Denmark the Dominican Republic Estonia Finland France

screen sharing between people at a time for free which then increased to on April br Skype does not provide the ability to call emergency numbers such as in Europe in North America in the UK or in India and Nepal However as of December there is limited support for emergency calls in the United Kingdom Australia Denmark and Finland The U S Federal Communications Commission FCC has ruled that for the purposes of section of the Telecommunications Act Skype is not an interconnected VoIP provider As a result the U S National Emergency Number Association recommends that all VoIP users have an analog line available as a backup br In Skype added an option to blur the background in a video chat interface using AI algorithms purely done using software despite a depth sensing camera not being present in most webcams br In Skype added the Bing AI chatbot to the platform for users who had access to the chatbot br br br Usage and traffic br br At the end of there were over million worldwide users with over million estimated active each month as of August At one point in February there were million users concurrently online on Skype br In January after the release of video calling on the Skype client for iPhone Skype reached a record million simultaneous online users This record was broken with million simultaneous online users on February and again on March with million online users On February Skype announced that it has over million users for the first time ever By March it had million simultaneous online users and less than a year later on January Skype had more than million concurrent users online br In June Skype had surpassed million downloads on Android br On July Microsoft announced that Skype users had logged billion minutes of calls in the quarter up to since the last quarter br On January TeleGeography estimated that Skype to Skype international traffic has gone up to in to billion minutes br As of March Skype was used by million people at least once a month and by million people each day br At end March there was a increase in the number of daily users from the previous month due to the COVID pandemic However Skype also lost a large part of its market share to Zoom br br br System and software br br br Client applications and devices br br br Windows client br br Multiple different versions of Skype have been released for Windows since its conception The original line of Skype applications continued from versions through It has offered a desktop only program since Later a mobile version was created for Windows Phones br In Skype introduced a new version for Windows similar to the Windows Phone version On July Skype modified the application to direct Windows users to download the desktop version but it was set to continue working on Windows RT until October In November Skype introduced three new applications called Messaging Skype Video and Phone intended to provide an integrated Skype experience on Windows On March Skype announced that the integrated applications did not satisfy most users needs and announced that they and the desktop client would eventually be replaced with a new UWP application which was released as a preview version for the Windows Anniversary Update and dubbed as the stable version with the release of the Windows Creators Update br The latest version of Skype for Windows is Skype which is based on the Universal Windows Platform and runs on various Windows related systems including Xbox One Xbox Series X S Windows phones and Microsoft Hololens Microsoft still offers the older Skype which is Win based and runs on all systems from Windows XP which is otherwise unsupported by Microsoft to the most recent release of Windows br In late this version was upgraded to Skype in which several features were both removed and added br br br Other desktop clients br macOS or newer br Linux Debian Debian based Ubuntu etc Fedora openSUSE br br br Mobile clients br iOS br Android br Skype was previously available on Java mobiles Nokia X Symbian BlackBerry OS and BlackBerry devices br In May a Version was available on Windows Mobile to and in September a Version was available on Windows Phone in Microsoft announced that this would stop working in early once Skype s transition from peer to peer to client server was complete br br br Other platforms br The Nokia N N and N Internet tablets which run Maemo br The Nokia N which runs MeeGo comes with Skype voice calling and text messaging integrated however it lacks video calling br Both the Sony Mylo COM and COM models br The PlayStation Portable Slim and Lite series though the user needs to purchase a specially designed microphone peripheral The PSP has a built in microphone which allows communication without the Skype peripheral The PSP Go has the ability to use Bluetooth connections with the Skype application in addition to its built in microphone Skype for PlayStation Vita may be downloaded via the PlayStation Network in the U S It includes the capability to receive incoming calls with the application running in the background br The Samsung Smart TV had a Skype app which could be downloaded for free It used the built in camera and microphone for the newer models Alternatively a separate mountable Skype camera with built in speakers and microphones is available to purchase for older models This functionality has now been disabled along with any other TV Based Skype clients br Some devices were made to work with Skype by talking to a desktop Skype client or by embedding Skype software into the device These were usually either tethered to a PC or had a built in Wi Fi client to allow calling from Wi Fi hotspots like the Netgear SPH Skype Wi Fi Phone the SMC WSKP Skype Wi Fi Phone the Belkin F PP GN SK Wi Fi Skype Phone the Panasonic KX WP Wi Fi Phone for Skype Executive Travel Set the IPEVO So Wi Fi Phone for Skype and the Linksys CIT Wi Fi Phone br G Skypephone created in collaboration between Skype and in br br br Third party licensing br Third party developers such as Truphone Nimbuzz and Fring previously allowed Skype to run in parallel with several other competing VoIP IM networks Truphone and Nimbuzz provide TruphoneOut and NimbuzzOut as a competing paid service in any Symbian or Java environment Nimbuzz made Skype available to BlackBerry users and Fring provided mobile video calling over Skype as well as support for the Android platform Skype disabled access to Skype by Fring users in July Nimbuzz discontinued support of Skype on request in October br Before and during the Microsoft acquisition Skype withdrew licensing from several third parties producing software and hardware compatible with Skype The Skype for Asterisk product from Digium was withdrawn as no longer available for sale The Senao SN long range km cordless phone was discontinued due to loss of licenses to participate in the Skype network as peers In combination these two products made it possible to create roaming cordless mesh networks with a robust handoff br br br Technology br br br Protocol br br Skype uses a proprietary Internet telephony VoIP network called the Skype protocol The protocol has not been made publicly available by Skype and official applications using the protocol are also proprietary Part of the Skype technology relies on the Global Index P P protocol belonging to the Joltid Ltd corporation The main difference between Skype and standard VoIP clients is that Skype operates on a peer to peer model originally based on the Kazaa software rather than the more usual client server model note that the very popular Session Initiation Protocol SIP model of VoIP is also peer to peer but implementation generally requires registration with a server as does Skype br On June Microsoft announced the deprecation of the old Skype protocol Within several months from this date in order to continue using Skype services Skype users will have to update to Skype applications released in The new Skype protocol Microsoft Notification Protocol was released The deprecation became effective in the second week of August Transferred files are now saved on central servers br As far as networking stack support is concerned Skype only supports the IPv protocol It lacks support for the next generation Internet protocol IPv Skype for Business however includes support for IPv addresses along with continued support of IPv br br br Protocol detection and control br Many networking and security companies have claimed to detect and control Skype s protocol for enterprise and carrier applications While the specific detection methods used by these companies are often private Pearson s chi squared test and naive Bayes classification are two approaches that were published in Combining statistical measurements of payload properties such as byte frequencies and initial byte sequences as well as flow properties like packet sizes and packet directions has also shown to be an effective method for identifying Skype s TCP and UDP based protocols br br br Audio codecs br Skype x used G Skype introduced SVOPC and Skype added a Skype created codec called SILK intended to be lightweight and embeddable Additionally Skype has released Opus as a free codec which integrates the SILK codec principles for voice transmission with the CELT codec principles for higher quality audio transmissions such as live music performances Opus was submitted to the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF in September Since then it has been standardized as RFC br br br Video codecs br VP is used for versions prior to Skype br As of version H is used for both group and one on one video chat at standard definition p and p high definition br br br Skype Qik br Skype acquired the video service Qik in After shutting down Qik in April Skype relaunched the service as Skype Qik on October Although Qik offered video conferencing and Internet streaming the new service focuses on mobile video messaging between individuals and groups br br br Hyperlink format br Skype uses URIs as skype USER call for a call br br br Security and privacy br br Skype was claimed initially to be a secure communication with one of its early web pages stating highly secure with end to end encryption Security services were invisible to the user and encryption cannot be disabled Skype claims to use publicly documented widely trusted encryption techniques for Skype to Skype communication RSA for key negotiation and the Advanced Encryption Standard to encrypt conversations However it is impossible to verify that these algorithms are used correctly completely and at all times as there is no public review possible without a protocol specification and or the program s source code Skype provides an uncontrolled registration system for users with no proof of identity Instead users may choose a screen name that does not have to relate to their real life identity in any way a name chosen could also be an impersonation attempt where the user claims to be someone else for fraudulent purposes A third party paper analyzing the security and methodology of Skype was presented at Black Hat Europe It analyzed Skype and found a number of security issues with the then current security model br br Skype incorporates some features that tend to hide its traffic but it is not specifically designed to thwart traffic analysis and therefore does not provide anonymous communication Some researchers have been able to watermark the traffic so that it is identifiable even after passing through an anonymizing network br In an interview Kurt Sauer the Chief Security Officer of Skype said We provide a safe communication option I will not tell you whether we can listen or not This does not deny the fact that the U S National Security Agency NSA monitors Skype conversations Skype s client uses an undocumented and proprietary protocol The Free Software Foundation FSF is concerned about user privacy issues arising from using proprietary software and protocols and has made a replacement for Skype one of their high priority projects Security researchers Biondi and Desclaux have speculated that Skype may have a back door since Skype sends traffic even when it is turned off and because Skype has taken extreme measures to obfuscate the program s traffic and functioning Several media sources reported that at a meeting about the Lawful interception of IP based services held on June high ranking unnamed officials at the Austrian interior ministry said that they could listen in on Skype conversations without problems The Austrian public broadcasting service ORF citing minutes from the meeting reported that the Austrian police are able to listen in on Skype connections Skype declined to comment on the reports One easily demonstrated method of monitoring is to set up two computers with the same Skype user ID and password When a message is typed or a call is received on one computer the second computer duplicates the audio and text This requires knowledge of the user ID and password br The United States Federal Communications Commission FCC has interpreted the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act CALEA as requiring digital phone networks to allow wiretapping if authorized by an FBI warrant in the same way as other phone services In February Skype said that not being a telephone company owning phone lines it is exempt from CALEA and similar laws which regulate US phone companies and it is not clear whether Skype could support wiretapping even if it wanted to According to the ACLU the Act is inconsistent with the original intent of the Fourth Amendment to the U S Constitution more recently the ACLU has expressed concern that the FCC interpretation of the Act is incorrect It has been suggested that Microsoft made changes to Skype s infrastructure to ease various wiretapping requirements however Skype denies the claims br Sometime before Skype was sold in the company had started Project Chess a program to explore legal and technical ways to easily share calls with intelligence agencies and law enforcement br On February the European Union s Eurojust agency announced that the Italian Desk at Eurojust would play a key role in the coordination and cooperation of the investigations on the use of internet telephony systems VoIP such as Skype The purpose of Eurojust s coordination role is to overcome the technical and judicial obstacles to the interception of internet telephony systems taking into account the various data protection rules and civil rights br In November a flaw was disclosed to Skype that showed how computer crackers could secretly track any user s IP address Due to Skype s peer to peer nature this was a difficult issue to address but this bug was eventually remedied in a update br In Skype introduced automatic updates to better protect users from security risks but received some challenge from users of the Mac product as the updates cannot be disabled from version on both on Mac OS and Windows versions although in the latter and only from version on automatic updating can be turned off in certain cases br According to a Washington Post article Skype has expanded its cooperation with law enforcement authorities to make online chats and other user information available to police the article additionally mentions that Skype made changes to allow authorities access to addresses and credit card numbers br In November Skype was reported to have handed over user data of a pro WikiLeaks activist to Dallas Texas based private security company iSIGHT Partners without a warrant or court order The alleged handover would be a breach of Skype s privacy policy Skype responded with a statement that it launched an internal investigation to probe the breach of user data privacy br On November a Russian user published a flaw in Skype s security that allowed any person to take over a Skype account knowing only the victim s email by following seven steps This vulnerability was claimed to exist for months and existed for more than hours after being published widely br On May it was documented that a URL sent via a Skype instant messaging session was usurped by the Skype service and subsequently used in a HTTP HEAD query originating from an IP address registered to Microsoft in Redmond the IP address used was The Microsoft query used the full URL supplied in the IM conversation and was generated by a previously undocumented security service Security experts speculate that the action was triggered by a technology similar to Microsoft s SmartScreen Filter used in its browsers br The mass surveillance disclosures revealed that agencies such as the NSA and the FBI have the ability to eavesdrop on Skype including the monitoring and storage of text and video calls and file transfers The PRISM surveillance program which requires FISA court authorization reportedly has allowed the NSA unfettered access to its data center supernodes According to the leaked documents integration work began in November but it was not until February that the company was served with a directive to comply signed by the attorney general with NSA documents showing that collection began on March br On November Skype scored out of points on the Electronic Frontier Foundation s secure messaging scorecard Skype received a point for encryption during transit but lost points because communications are not encrypted with a key the provider does not have access to i e the communications are not end to end encrypted users cannot verify contacts identities past messages are not secure if the encryption keys are stolen i e the service does not provide forward secrecy the code is not open to independent review i e not available to merely view nor under a free software license the security design is not properly documented and there has not been a recent independent security audit AIM BlackBerry Messenger Ebuddy XMS Hushmail Kik Messenger Viber and Yahoo Messenger also scored out of points br As of August Skype now supports end to end encryption across all platforms br br br Cybercrime on application br Cybersex trafficking has occurred on Skype and other videoconferencing applications According to the Australian Federal Police overseas pedophiles are directing child sex abuse using its live streaming services br br br Service in the People s Republic of China br br Since September users in China trying to download the Skype software client have been redirected to the site of TOM Online a joint venture between a Chinese wireless operator and Skype from which a modified Chinese version can be downloaded The TOM client participates in China s system of Internet censorship monitoring text messages between Skype users in China as well as messages exchanged with users outside the country Niklas Zennstr m then chief executive of Skype told reporters that TOM had implemented a text filter which is what everyone else in that market is doing Those are the regulations He also stated One thing that s certain is that those things are in no way jeopardising the privacy or the security of any of the users br In October it was reported that TOM had been saving the full message contents of some Skype text conversations on its servers apparently focusing on conversations containing political issues such as Tibet Falun Gong Taiwan independence and the Chinese Communist Party The saved messages contain personally identifiable information about the message senders and recipients including IP addresses usernames landline phone numbers and the entire content of the text messages including the time and date of each message Information about Skype users outside China who were communicating with a TOM Skype user was also saved A server misconfiguration made these log files accessible to the public for a time br Research on the TOM Skype venture has revealed information about blacklisted keyword checks allowing censorship and surveillance of its users The partnership has received much criticism for the latter Microsoft remains unavailable for comment on the issue br According to reports from the advocacy group Great Fire Microsoft has modified censorship restrictions and ensured encryption of all user information Furthermore Microsoft is now partnered with Guangming Founder GMF in China br All attempts to visit the official Skype web page from mainland China redirect the user to skype gmw cn The Linux version of Skype is unavailable br br br Localization br Skype comes bundled with the following locales and languages Arabic Bulgarian Catalan Chinese Traditional and Simplified Croatian Czech Danish Dutch English Estonian Finnish French German Greek Hebrew Hungarian Indonesian Italian Japanese Korean Latvian Lithuanian Nepali Norwegian Polish Portuguese Brazilian and European Romanian Russian Serbian Slovak Slovenian Spanish Swedish Thai Turkish Ukrainian and Vietnamese br As the Windows desktop program offers users the option of creating new language files at least other full or partial localizations are also available for many languages br br br Customer service br In January Skype rescinded its policy of seizing funds in Skype accounts that have been inactive no paid call for days This was in settlement of a class action lawsuit Skype also paid up to US to persons who opted into the action br As of February Skype provides support through their web support portal support community skypesupport on Twitter and Skype Facebook page Direct contact via email and live chat is available through their web support portal Chat Support is a premium feature available to Skype Premium and some other paid users br Skype s refund policy states that they will provide refunds in full if customers have used less than euro of their Skype Credit Upon a duly submitted request Skype will refund you on a pro rata basis for the unused period of a Product br Skype has come under some criticism from users for the inability to completely close accounts Users not wanting to continue using Skype can make their account inactive by deleting all personal information except for the username br Due to an outage on September that affected several users in New Zealand Australia and other countries Skype decided to compensate their customers with minutes of free calls to over landline and mobile phone destinations br br br Educational use br Although Skype is a commercial product its non paid version is used with increasing frequency among teachers schools and charities interested in global education projects A popular use case is to facilitate language learning through conversations that alternate between each participant s native language br The video conferencing aspect of the software has been praised for its ability to connect students who speak different languages facilitate virtual field trips and engage directly with experts br Skype in the classroom is another free of charge tool that Skype has set up on its website designed to encourage teachers to make their classrooms more interactive and collaborate with other teachers around the world There are various Skype lessons in which students can participate Teachers can also use a search tool and find experts in a particular field The educational program Skype a Scientist set up by biologist Sarah McAnulty in had in two years connected classrooms with over volunteer scientists br However Skype is not adopted universally with many educational institutions in the United States and Europe blocking the application from their
