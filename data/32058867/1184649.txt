id: 1184649
The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of ECPA was enacted by the United States Congress to extend restrictions on government wire taps of telephone calls to include transmissions of electronic data by computer U S C et seq added new provisions prohibiting access to stored electronic communications i e the Stored Communications Act SCA U S C et seq and added so called pen trap provisions that permit the tracing of telephone communications U S C et seq br ECPA was an amendment to Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of the Wiretap Statute which was primarily designed to prevent unauthorized government access to private electronic communications The ECPA has been amended by the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act CALEA of the USA PATRIOT Act the USA PATRIOT reauthorization acts and the FISA Amendments Act br br br Overview br Electronic communications means any transfer of signs signals writing images sounds data or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire radio electromagnetic photoelectronic or photooptic system that affects interstate or foreign commerce but excludes the following br br Wire or oral communication br Communication made through a tone only paging device br Communication from a tracking device as defined in section br Electronic funds transfer information stored by a financial institution in a communications system used for the electronic storage and transfer of funds br Title I of the ECPA protects wire oral and electronic communications while in transit It sets down requirements for search warrants that are more stringent than in other settings Title II of the ECPA the Stored Communications Act SCA protects communications held in electronic storage most notably messages stored on computers Its protections are weaker than those of Title I however and do not impose heightened standards for warrants Title III prohibits the use of pen register and or trap and trace devices to record dialing routing addressing and signaling information used in the process of transmitting wire or electronic communications without a court order br br br History br br The law was first brought to attention after the Captain Midnight broadcast signal intrusion where electrical engineer John R MacDougall hacked into the HBO signal on April br As a consequence this act was passed This act also made satellite hijacking a felony br br br Provisions br br The ECPA extended government restrictions on wire taps from telephone calls to include transmissions of electronic data by computer U S C et seq added new provisions prohibiting access to stored electronic communications i e the Stored Communications Act U S C et seq and added so called pen trap provisions that permit the tracing of telephone communications U S C et seq br U S C d provides for gag orders which direct the recipient of a pen register or trap and trace device order not to disclose the existence of the pen trap or the investigation br br br Employee privacy br The ECPA extended privacy protections provided by the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of of employers monitoring of employees phone calls to include also electronic and cell phone communications See also Employee monitoring and Workplace privacy br br br Case law br Several court cases have raised the question of whether e mail messages are protected under the stricter provisions of Title I while they were in transient storage en route to their final destination In United States v Councilman a U S district court and a three judge appeals panel ruled they were not but in the full United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed this opinion Privacy advocates were relieved they had argued in amicus curiae briefs that if the ECPA did not protect e mail in temporary storage its added protections were meaningless as virtually all electronic mail is stored temporarily in transit at least once and that Congress would have known this in when the law was passed see e g RFC The case was eventually dismissed on grounds unrelated to ECPA issues br The seizure of a computer used to operate an electronic bulletin board system and containing private electronic mail which had been sent to stored on the bulletin board but not read retrieved by the intended recipients does not constitute an unlawful intercept under the Federal Wiretap Act U S C s et seq as amended by Title I of ECPA br Governments can actually track cell phones in real time without a search warrant under ECPA by analyzing information as to antennae being contacted by cell phones as long as the cell phone is used in public where visual surveillance is available br In Robbins v Lower Merion School District also known as WebcamGate the plaintiffs charged that two suburban Philadelphia high schools violated ECPA by remotely activating the webcams embedded in school issued laptops and monitoring the students at home The schools admitted to secretly snapping over webshots and screenshots including webcam shots of students in their bedrooms br br br Criticism br br ECPA has been criticized for failing to protect all communications and consumer records mainly because the law is so outdated and out of touch with how people currently share store and use information br Under ECPA it is relatively easy for a government agency to demand service providers hand over personal consumer data stored on the service provider s servers Email that is stored on a third party s server for more than days is considered by the law to be abandoned All that is required to obtain the content of the emails by a law enforcement agency is a written statement certifying that the information is relevant to an investigation without judicial review When the law was initially passed emails were stored on a third party s server for only a short period of time just long enough to facilitate transfer of email to the consumer s email client which was generally located on their personal or work computer Now with online email services prevalent such as Gmail and Hotmail users are more likely to store emails online indefinitely rather than to only keep them for less than days If the same emails were stored on the user s personal computer it would require the police to obtain a warrant first for seizure of their contents regardless of their age When they are stored on an internet server however no warrant is needed starting days after receipt of the message under the law In members of the U S Congress proposed to reform this procedure br ECPA also increased the list of crimes that can justify the use of surveillance as well as the number of judicial members who can authorize such surveillance Data can be obtained on traffic and calling patterns of an individual or a group without a warrant allowing an agency to gain valuable intelligence and possibly invade privacy without any scrutiny because the actual content of the communication is left untouched While workplace communications are in theory protected all that is needed to gain access to communiqu is for an employer to simply give notice or a supervisor to report that the employee s actions are not in the company s interest This means that with minimal assumptions an employer can monitor communications within the company The ongoing debate is where to limit the government s power to see into civilian lives while balancing the need to curb national threats br In The New York Times published Privacy Law Is Outrun by the Web highlighting that br br the Justice Department argued in court that cellphone users had given up the expectation of privacy about their location by voluntarily giving that information to carriers In April it argued in a federal court in Colorado that it ought to have access to some e mails without a search warrant And federal law enforcement officials citing technology advances plan to ask for new regulations that would smooth their ability to perform legal wiretaps of various Internet communications br The analysis went on to discuss how Google Facebook Verizon Twitter and other companies are in the middle between users and governments br br br See also br Customer proprietary network information CPNI br Katz v United States br In re DoubleClick br Lane v Facebook Inc br United States
