id: 59036060
Social media use in politics refers to the use of online social media platforms in political processes and activities Political processes and activities include all activities that pertain to the governance of a country or area This includes political organization global politics political corruption political parties and political values The media s primary duty is to present us with information and alert us when events occur This information may affect what we think and the actions we take The media can also place pressure on the government to act by signaling a need for intervention or showing that citizens want change br The internet has created channels of communication that play a key role in circulating news and social media has the power to change not just the message but also the dynamics of political corruption values and the dynamics of conflict in politics Through the use of social media in election processes global conflict and extreme politics diplomacy around the world has become less private and more susceptible to public perception Overtime social media has become a larger way of how we are informed by the news of what is going on in the world These new stations can ever biased about their political opinions This also includes Twitter and Facebook of holding the potential to alter civic engagement this holds a large effect and influences individuals toward a particular way of thinking Social media also affects elections and campaigns This is due to the interactive and communal nature of social media can be especially powerful for elections and campaigns Voters often use these platforms to discuss their position and share their support An example of this is I voted image can remind others to submit their ballots or create peer pressure to encourage voting br br br Background br br br Participatory role br Social media have been championed as allowing anyone with an Internet connection to become a content creator and empowering their users The idea of new media populism encompasses how citizens can include disenfranchised citizens and allow the public to have an engaged and active role in political discourse New media including social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter can enhance people s access to political information br br Social media platforms and the internet have facilitated the dissemination of political information that counters mainstream media tactics that are often centralized and top down including high entry barriers Writer Howard Rheingold characterized the community created on social networking sites The political significance of computer mediated communication lies in its capacity to challenge the existing political hierarchy s monopoly on powerful communications media and perhaps thus revitalize citizen based democracy Scholar Derrick de Kerckhove described the new technology in media In a networked society the real powershift is from the producer to the consumer and there is a redistribution of controls and power On the Web Karl Marx s dream has been realized the tools and the means of production are in the hands of the workers The role of social media in democratizing media participation which proponents herald as ushering in a new era of participatory democracy with all users able to contribute news and comments may fall short of the ideals International survey data suggest online media audience members are largely passive consumers while content creation is dominated by a small number of social users who post comments and write new content Others argue that the effect of social media will vary from one country to another with domestic political structures playing a greater role than social media in determining how citizens express opinions about stories of current affairs involving the state br Most people see social media platforms as censoring objectionable political views br In June users of the Social Media platform TikTok organized a movement to prank a Trump Rally in Tulsa Oklahoma by buying tickets and not attending so that the rally appeared empty br br br As a news source br br Social media platforms are increasingly used for political news and information by adults in the United States especially regarding election time A study by Pew Research conducted in November found that one in five US adults get their political news primarily through social media of adults use social media to get political and election news In small research conducted by McKeever et al in they found that out of the United States participants had noted that they got most of their information about gun violence from social media sources br The Pew Research Center further found that out of these United States Adults relying on social media for this information of them are from ages br In addition Reddit Twitter and Facebook are the social media platforms that most users use to acquire news information Two thirds of Facebook users access news on the platform of Twitter users access news on the platform and of Reddit users access news on the platform br According to the Reuters Institute Digital News Report in the percentage of online news users who blog about news issues ranges from Greater percentages use social media to comment on news with participation ranging from in Germany to in Brazil But online news users are most likely to just talk about online news with friends offline or use social media to share stories without creating content br br The rapid propagation of information on social media spread by word of mouth can quickly impact the perception of political figures with information that may or may not be true When political information is propagated in this manner on purpose the spread of information on social media for political means can benefit campaigns On the other hand the word of mouth propagation of negative information concerning a political figure can be damaging For example the use of the social media platform Twitter by United States congressman Anthony Weiner to send inappropriate messages played a role in his resignation br br br Attention economy br Social media especially news spread through social media sites plays into the idea of the attention economy Content that attracts more attention will be seen shared and disseminated far more than news content that does not gather as much traction from the public Tim Wu from Columbia Law School coins the attention economy as the resale of human attention br A communication platform such as social media is persuasive and often works to change or influence opinions regarding political views because of the abundance of ideas thoughts and opinions circulating through the social media platform It is found that news use leads to political persuasion therefore the more that people use social media platforms for news sources the more their political opinions will be affected Despite that people are expressing less trust in their government and others due to media use therefore social media directly affects trust in media use It is proven that while reading newspapers there is an increase in social trust on the contrary y watching the news on television weakens trust in others and news sources Social media or more specifically news media plays an important role in democratic societies because they allow for participation among citizens Therefore when it comes to healthy democratic networks that news must remain true so it doesn t affect citizens levels of trust A certain amount of trust is necessary for a healthy functioning democratic system With regards to voters in democratic elections there is evidence that as often speculated the spread of social media has led to lower levels of trust in government and support for populism br Younger generations are becoming more involved in politics due to the increased political news posted on various types of social media Due to the heavier use of social media among younger generations they are exposed to politics more frequently and in a way that is integrated into their online social lives Social media s influence on financial markets is connected to the economy Tweets posted by viewers with little to no expertise in finance have proven to have a ripple effect on the stock value of unrelated companies While informing younger generations of political news is important there are many biases within the realms of social media In May former Facebook Trending News curator Benjamin Fearnow revealed his job was to massage the algorithm but dismissed any intentional outright bias by either human or automated efforts within the company Fearnow was fired by Facebook after being caught leaking several internal company debates about Black Lives Matter and presidential candidate Donald Trump br br br As a public utility br br A key debate centers on whether or not social media is a public good based on the premises of non rival and non excludable consumption Social media can be considered an impure public good as it can be excludable given the rights of platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to remove content deactivate accounts and filter information based on algorithms and community standards br br Arguments for platforms such as Google in being treated as a public utility and public service provider include statements from Benjamin Barber in The Nation Add Notion of Tik Tok Ban and how it was inflicted upon government relations in Also discuss the notion of false media br br For new media to be potential equalizers they must be treated as public utilities recognizing that spectrum abundance the excuse for privatization does not prevent monopoly ownership of hardware and software platforms and hence cannot guarantee equal civic educational and cultural access to citizens Similarly Zeynep Tufekci argues online services are natural monopolies that underwrite the corporatization of social commons and the privatization of our publics br One argument that displays the nature of social media as an impure public good is that the control over content remains in the hands of a few large media networks such as Google and Facebook Google and Facebook have the power to shape the environment under personal and commercial goals that promote profitability as opposed to promoting citizen voice and public deliberation br br br Government regulation br Proponents and aims for regulation of social media are growing due to economic concerns of monopolies of the platforms to issues of privacy censorship network neutrality and information storage The discussion of regulation is complicated due to the issue of how Facebook and Google are increasingly becoming a service information pipeline and content provider and thus centers on how the government would regulate both the platform as a service and information provider Thus other proponents advocate for algorithmic neutrality or the aim for search engines on social media platforms to rank data without human intervention br Opponents of regulation of social media platforms argue that platforms such as Facebook and Twitter do not resemble traditional public utilities and regulation would harm consumer welfare as public utility regulation can hinder innovation and competition Second as the First Amendment values are criticized on social media platforms the media providers should retain the power over how the platform is configured br The proliferation of social media has created a unique platform for communication between government institutions and citizens By providing a massive number of people with the ability to gather information and express their views social media has become a powerful tool for governments to engage with the public and foster dialogue This has enabled governments to understand better and address their citizens needs and provide more transparent and accountable governance Gathering public sentiment on government initiatives is an important part of the policy making process The media s primary duty is to present us with information and alert us with important events that occur This information may affect what we think and the actions we take The media can also pressure the government to act by signaling a need for intervention or showing that citizens can change br br br Social Media and international relations br In his article The Theory of the Globe Scrambled by Social Networks A New Sphere of Influence Tiziano Peccia argues that the dynamics of the Cold War persist in the digital age particularly through social networks He notes that while Western countries predominantly use American platforms like Facebook and Twitter Eastern nations often prefer local alternatives such as Sina Weibo and V Kontakte creating distinct ideological and cultural spheres online Peccia discusses how social networks facilitate both connection and division breaking down geographical and generational barriers but also reinforcing ideological divides He highlights examples like the Afghan Defence Ministry using Twitter for international communication and contrasts the Western embrace of global social media with the controlled government approved networks in countries like Iran and China Peccia concludes that while social networks are powerful tools for communication and political mobilization they also reflect and reinforce the geopolitical tensions reminiscent of the Cold War era br The research paper The Impact of Social Media in Modern Societies Highlighting New Ideological Barriers Geostrategic Divisions and Future Prospects by Tiziano Peccia and Rachele Meda explores how social media both disseminates information and creates tensions between states The study focuses on Russia China and Iran nations that have developed their own social media platforms to meet local demands while avoiding Western influences These platforms also aim to extend their reach to neighboring countries The authors argue that social media plays a dual role fostering communication and community building while simultaneously reinforcing ideological divisions and geostrategic conflicts br The paper discusses how social media can enhance transparency and accountability but also act as a society without a body offering limited physical community ties The impact of social media varies globally due to cultural political and literacy factors with significant censorship in countries like China Iran and Russia which restricts freedom of expression and information br The authors note that while social media has democratizing potential it also poses challenges to authoritarian regimes which seek to control online narratives In contrast Western countries particularly the United States use social media to spread their influence This digital Cold War exacerbates ideological and geopolitical divisions highlighting the need for international efforts to promote net neutrality and educate users on the responsible use of social media br In conclusion the paper calls for a balanced approach that respects diverse political systems while advocating for freedom of expression and the responsible use of social media to bridge ideological divides and promote global understanding br br br Effect on democracy br Social media has been criticized as being detrimental to democracy According to Ronald Deibert The world of social media is more conducive to extreme emotionally charged and divisive types of content than it is to calm principled considerations of competing or complex narratives On the contrary Ethan Zuckerman says that social media presents the opportunity to inform more people amplify voices and allow for an array of diverse voices to speak Mari K Eder points to failures of the Fourth Estate that have allowed outrage to be disguised as news contributing to citizen apathy when confronting falsehoods and further distrust in democratic institutions br However the growth of social media has allowed a growth of political participation to a whole new audience within society This can be seen as a kick starter of a deeper transformation of democratic practices and opportunities suggesting that digital media can have huge influences and changes within politics but the question still remains if young people will remain politically active within the near future The free flow of information on the internet and social media can have large contributions to open debate and an exchange of ideas two crucial tenants of democracy There are other ways social media in the use of politics can have an effect on democracy such as election influence and privacy concerns with data The use of social media platforms have had crucial effects for election campaigns where politicians are competing for peoples attention discuss what they re doing and specific advertising With data social media collects many amounts of data coming from individuals which can be used for political data where people can see specific advertisements According to a recent Pew Research Center a study conducted across advanced nations found that the public views social media s role in democracy as both beneficial and detrimental In general most people think it has improved democracy think it has hurt it and think it has helped With only of adults in the US believing social media has benefited democracy and believing it has had the opposite impact the US stands out as an anomaly This opinion is consistent with broader views that social media is dividing society br br br Politicians and social media br Social media has allowed politicians to subvert typical media outlets by engaging with the general public directly Donald Trump utilised this when he lost the presidential election by claiming the election to be fraudulent and therefore creating the need for a re election The consequences of Trump s online actions were displayed when on January the U S Capitol was attacked by supporters of the former president br Being a popular presence on social media also boosts a politician s likelihood of coming to power take Boris Johnson in the bid to replace Theresa May as Prime Minister Johnson had more than half a million liking his page substantially more than the other candidates which meant that when he released his launch video it gained more than views which could have been a prominent factor in him eventually winning power In the case of politicians it can be said that any recognition positive or negative is good recognition Using social media can be a great way for politicians to gain acknowledgment and constituents br A study conducted by Sounman Hong found that in the case of politicians utilizing social media and whether its use would increase on their individual weighing up on the consequences and if they would be largely positive or negative found that in the case of backbenchers underdogs and opposition it was likely to increase in order to gain recognition and support from the public eye where they otherwise might go unnoticed br In the Berlin state election The Pirate party used social media to effectively attract voters and won out of seats A wide range of voters including young people voting for the first time Social Democrats former quiet voters Greens and Christian Democrats supported them Notably the age group accounted for one out of every five votes cast In Finland s Parliamentary elections the True Finns also utilized social media to secure victory engaging supporters and expanding their base br br br Democratization br br br The Arab Spring br br During the peak of the Egyptian Revolution of the Internet and social media played a huge role in facilitating information At that time Hosni Mubarak was the president of Egypt and head the regime for almost years Mubarak was so threatened by the immense power that the Internet and social media gave the people that the government successfully shut down the Internet using the Ramses Exchange for a period of time in February br Egyptians used Facebook Twitter and YouTube as a means to communicate and organize demonstrations and rallies to overthrow President Hosni Mubarak Statistics show that during this time the rate of Tweets from Egypt increased from to per day and the top protest videos had approximately million views The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces the military coup that deposed President Mubarak set up a Facebook page quickly after gaining power Through this the new regime sought control over the dissemination of information with the Facebook page being the exclusive outlet for information br br br Use in autocracies br Social Media in autocracies enables both freedom for protestors and control for ruling regimes On the one hand social media represents a freedom of information that could previously be gatekept by ruling governments through their control over traditional media This makes it harder for dictators to hide atrocities from the people as anyone with a camera phone is capable of exposing acts of terror with ease Gruesome images of bodies which would have previously been kept out of newspapers can now be plastered all over social media inspiring people to act br Social media platforms can also give governments an unprecedented amount of information over the population This can be used to track certain individuals such as political opponents and censor dissent br br br Disinformation in relation to US election br Disinformation is false news spread intentionally Though fake news can generate some utility for consumers in terms of confirming far right beliefs and spreading propaganda in favor of a presidential candidate it also imposes private and social costs For example one social cost to consumer is the spread of disinformation which can make it harder for consumers to seek out the truth and in the case of the Election for consumers to choose an electoral candidate Summarized by a Congressional Research Service Study in Cyber tools were also used by Russia to create psychological effects in the American population The likely collateral effects of these activities include compromising the fidelity of information sowing discord and doubt in the American public about the validity of intelligence community reports and prompting questions about the democratic process itself The marginal social cost of fake news is exponential as the first article is shared it can affect a small number of people but as the article is circulated more throughout Facebook the negative externality multiplies As a result the quantity demanded of news can shift up around election season as consumers seek to find correct news however the quantity demanded can also shift down as people have a lower trust in mainstream media In the American public a Gallup poll in found Americans trust in the mass media to report the news fully accurately and fairly was at the lowest in the organization s polling history In addition trust in mainstream media is lower in Republican and far right political viewers at About of American adults claim that social media firms excessively control and influence the politics today as per the June survey conducted by Pew Research Center Only believe that the power held by these social media firms over today s politics is of the right amount while believe it is not enough br Algorithms can facilitate the rapid spread of disinformation through social media channels Algorithms use users past behavior and engagement activity to provide them with tailored content that aligns with their interests and beliefs Algorithms commonly create echo chambers and sow radicalism and extremist thinking in these online spaces br Algorithms promote social media posts with high engagement meaning posts that received a lot of likes or comments replies For better or for worse engagement and controversy go hand in hand Controversy attracts attention as it evokes an emotional response however Benford s Law of controversy states that passion is inversely proportional to the amount of real information available This means that the less grounded in facts a political tweet is the more engagement it is likely to receive therefore the likelihood of spreading disinformation is high Twitter has become a battleground for political debate Psychologist Jordan Peterson spoke of Twitter s radicalising effect in an interview conducted by GQ He explained that for any given tweet that appears on one s feed the tweet shall have been seen by a far greater number of people than is reflected by its likes and comments Therefore who are the people who comment on a tweet The people who comment shall be those who have the strongest views on the matter the people who want their opinion to be heard Peterson claims that this creates an environment in which the opinions that the average user sees on twitter do not reflect the views of a random sample of the population The opinions most commonly seen on twitter tend to be those of people at each extreme end of the political ideology spectrum hence the radicalising effect A recent study on TikTok showed how quickly users can be influenced by a small amount of content When users engaged with transphobic material the app started recommending more far right videos The study looked at around videos on the for you page which is based on TikTok s recommendation system During the presidential election Meta then Facebook conducted a study revealing that its algorithms drove a significant increase in extremist content interaction These algorithms were accountable for of all joins to extremist groups primarily through features like Groups You Should Join and the Discover page br br br Advertisement br br Political advertising has been around for several decades and continues to change with social media Advertising is a huge part of politics and can play a key factor in informing the audience The new form has taken a different route through the rise of digital media This tool is very different from offline advertising in the way that it takes a new form such as YouTube Videos Reels or advertisements shown on a webpage Political advertising can tailor to its audience due to the algorithms of our apps Digital technology enables algorithms to track and analyze viewer interactions with media allowing for more effective targeting br According to Statista political campaigns spent more money on online and social media ads as seen in the image In Statista predicted that billion would be spent in compared to billion in and billion in While Twitter stopped political ads Facebook and other platforms like Pinterest Twitch and TikTok currently have different rules Facebook s CEO defended the decision arguing that blocking ads for important political issues like climate change or women s empowerment could hinder public discourse br Political advertisements for example encouraging people to vote for or against a particular candidate or to take a position on a particular issue have often been placed on social media On November Twitter said it would no longer facilitate political advertising anywhere in the world Due to the nature of social media bringing different information to different people based on their interests advertising methods such as Microtargeting and Black ads have become prominent on social media and allow advertising to be much more effective for the same price relative to traditional adverts such as those on cable TV br br br Grassroots campaigns br When it comes to political referendums individuals often gather on social media at the grassroots level to campaign for change This is particularly effective where it comes to feminist political issues as studies have proven that women are more likely to tweet about policy problems and do so in a way that is more aggressive than their male counter parts Like minded individuals can collectively work together to influence social change and utilise social media as a tool for social justice An example of this is in the referendum to appeal Ireland s eighth amendment Civil society organisations such as TogetherForYes utilised Twitter as a tool to bring abortion law into the public and make the harms of the eighth amendment visible and accessible The positive outcome of the referendum in the amendments repeal can be equated to the efforts of individuals and advocates coming together at the grassroots level to make the vote visible as social media goes beyond the local level to create a widespread global political impact making the issue of strict abortion laws a global one rather than one just confined to Ireland The strength in a political grassroots campaign on social media is the increased mobilisation of participants Due to the fact that social media platforms are largely accessible a political platform can be provided to the voices of those traditionally silenced in the political sphere or in traditional media As well as bringing awareness to the campaign social media including Twitter also provides a platform of conversation Specifically when the grassroots campaign is trying to tackle a high ranking secular state such as the Catholic Church in Northern Ireland it can be difficult to promote the campaign as the church has such influence and authority And so can be argued that this campaign gained such momentum because of its social media awareness with voters for the movement being active and engaged on social media with the campaign going from social media to law in less than years br br br US election interference br The United States Presidential Election was an example in which social media was used by the state actor Russia to influence public opinion Tactics such as propaganda trolling and bots were used to leak fake news stories that included an FBI agent had been killed after leaking Clinton s emails and Pope Francis had endorsed Donald Trump Studies have found that pro Trump news was as many as four time more than pro Clinton fake news and a third of the pro Trump tweets were generated by bots br Social media has also provided the means for large amounts of data to be collected on social media users allowing analysis and predictions to be made on what information and advertising the user is most likely to be susceptible to This was highlighted in when the Cambridge Analytica Facebook scandal emerged Data and predictions from the company were used to influence voters in the Brexit Leave campaign and also the US election Trump Campaign br This scandal first appeared in the news in following both the UK s Brexit referendum results and the US presidential election result but was an ongoing operation by Cambridge Analytica with the permission of Facebook using Aleksandr Kogan s app This is your Digital Life However the methods were exposed on September during a presentation by Alexander Nix named The Power of Big Data and Psychographics Nix was the chief executive officer of market research at Cambridge Analytica After founding the company in he was then suspended on March following the release of a video in which he admitted to working directly with Donald Trump to gather data on the US electorate In his presentation Nix highlights his contribution the Ted Cruz campaign and how taking the focus away from demographics and geographics for the targeted ads and instead using psychographics in order to target personality traits and get a better understanding of voter demands is a more effective method of gaining votes In one of Nix s business associates Steve Bannon left the company to take over the campaign of Donald Trump and as a result of the video leak which lost Nix his job it is largely believed he had direct influence too As well as this Cambridge Analytica staff were also heavily involved in the Vote Leave campaign for the Brexit referendum As a result of an organisation specialised in targeted ads being involved in two populist campaigns that produced shock results many point out as a potential threat to democracy br But this is not the only example of potential election interference using social media November Rodrigo Duterte was announced as president of Philippines after being the first person to make the full use of the power of social media Facebook had made an astonishing rise since the previous election and Duterte saw this as an opportunity to get social media influencers to promote his party and create viral content further showing the power social media can have over democracy br On May Time had reported that the US Congress was investigating CA in connection with Russian interference in the United States elections The report alleges that CA may have coordinated the spread of Russian propaganda using its microtargeting capabilities In following disclosures that the company had improperly used the personal information of over million Facebook users while working on Trump s presidential campaign The Times of Israel reported that the company had used what Nix had called intelligence gathering from British and Israeli companies as part of their efforts to influence the election results in Trump s favor br This was the work of one company and regulation may be able to prevent this in the future but social media is now a medium that makes this kind of interference possible br br br Election results br In October Twitter announced its new policy that candidates will be forbidden to claim victory until their election win has been credibly projected by news outlets or officially certified br br br Impact on elections br br Social media has a profound effect on elections Oftentimes social media compounds with the mass media networks such as cable television For many individuals cable television serves as the basis and first contact for where many get their information and sources Cable television also has commentary that creates partisanship and builds on to people s predispositions to certain parties Social media takes mass media s messages and oftentimes amplifies and reinforces such messages and perpetuates partisan divides In an article by the Journal of Communication they concluded that social media does not have a strong effect on people s views or votes but social media does not also have a minimal effect on their views Instead social media creates a bandwagon effect when a candidate in an election commits an error or a great success then users on social media will amplify the effect of such failure or success greatly br However mass media plays a significant role in the electoral process allowing candidates to broadcast their political campaigns to a wide audience The primary goal of these ads is to capture voter attention and propagate their ideas During elections media can assume a different role with social media platforms such as TikTok Instagram and Facebook serving as additional way for political candidates to communicate with their audiences These apps also have the potential to function as effective electoral tools br The Pew Research Center finds that nearly one fourth of Americans learn something about the candidates through an internet source such as Facebook Nearly a fifth of America uses social media with two thirds of those Americans being youth ages of The youth s presence on social media often inspires rallies and creates movements For instance in the presidential election a Facebook group of members was created that sponsored the election of President Obama and within days universities across the countries held rallies in the thousands Rallies and movements such as these are often coined the Facebook Effect However social media can often have the opposite effect and take a toll on many users The Pew Research Center in a poll found that nearly percent of social media users in the US indicate that they are worn out by the amount of political posts on social media With the rise of technology and social media continuing that number increased by nearly percent since the presidential election Nearly percent of individuals say that talking about politics on social media with people on the opposite side is often stressful and frustrating compared to percent in Consequently the number of people who find these discussions as interesting and informative decreased from to since br In terms of social media s effect on the youth vote it is quite substantial In the elections nearly percent of the youth voted compared to just percent in Social media use among the youth continue to grow as around percent of the youth use at least one social media platform Of the percent percent received information about the elections via a social media platform The messages shared on the social media platform often include messages to register to vote and actually carrying out their vote this is in contrast to receiving the message from the candidate s campaign itself Subsequently of the first time youth voters in the election percent relied on social media to get their information about voting This is in comparison to the traditional methods of being notified to vote of just percent first time voters Furthermore just percent of youth who did not hear about an election via social media or traditional means were very likely to vote however percent of youth who found out about the election via social media or traditional ways were very likely to vote However the youth are becoming distrustful of the content they read on social media as Forbes notes that there has been a decline in public trust due to many political groups and foreign nations creating fake accounts to spread a great amount of misinformation with the aim of dividing the country When examining unregulated media it is important to consider the potential harms that can arise from the spread of misinformation such as hate speech and other harmful content br Social media often filters what information individuals see Due to the algorithms of social media apps a person will receive posts that align with the content the user interacts with Since the number of individuals who get their news via social media has increased to percent On these social media sites there are many algorithms run that filter what information individual users see The algorithms understand a users favorites and dislikes they then begin to cater their feed to their likes Consequently this creates an echo chamber For instance black social media users were more likely to see race related news and in the Trump campaign used Facebook and other platforms to target Hillary Clinton s supporters to drive them out of the election and taking advantage of such algorithms Whether or not these algorithms have an effect on people s vote and their views is mixed Iowa State University finds that for older individuals even though their access to social media is far lower than the youth their political views were far more likely to change from the time periods which indicates that there are a myriad of other factors that impact political views They further that based upon other literature Google has a liberal bias in their search results Consequently these biased search results can affect an individual s voting preferences by nearly percent In addition percent of an individual s Facebook friends are of an opposing political view and nearly percent of the news they receive on the platform is also in opposition of their political ideology which indicates that the algorithms on these new platforms do not completely create echo chambers br Washington State University political science professor Travis Ridout explains that in the United Kingdom the popular social media platforms of Twitter Facebook Instagram and YouTube are beginning to play a significant role in campaigns and elections Contrary to the United States which allows television ads in the United Kingdom television ads are banned and thus campaigns are now launching huge efforts on social media platforms Ridout furthers that the social media ads have gotten in many cases offensive and in attack formation at many politicians Social media is able to provide many individuals with a sense of anonymity that enables them to get away with such aggressive acts For example ethnic minority women politicians are often the targets of such attacks Furthermore in the United States many of the youth conservative voices are often reduced For instance PragerU a conservative organization often has their videos taken down On a different level social media can also hamper many political candidates Media and social media often publish stories about news that are controversial and popular and will ultimately drive more traffic A key example is President Donald Trump whose controversial statements in often brought the attention of many individuals and thereby increased his popularity while shunning out other candidates br In the Presidential Election social media was very prevalent and used widely by both campaigns For Twitter nearly million users follow President Donald Trump while million users follow Joe Biden Despite the significant gap between the two Biden s top tweets have outperformed Donald Trump s top tweets by nearly double In terms of mentions of each candidate on Twitter from October to October there were million mentions of Trump and Biden and Biden held of the mentions During the Presidential Debates Biden had nearly two times the mentions as Donald Trump with nearly half of the mentions being negative For Trump he also had half of his mentions being negative as well br In Europe the influence of social media is less than that of the United States In only of MEPs use twitter while use Facebook In the EPP had the highest social media following of compared to the other parties This is in relationship to the million voters in all of Europe When comparing the impact to US social media following former President Obama has over million fans while the highest in Europe was former French President Nicolas Sarkozy of over fines a stark difference The US presidential election skyrocketed the need for technologies to be used in politics and campaigns especially social media Europe is now following their lead and has been increasing their use of social media since br However just because European Politicians don t use social media as much as American Politicians doesn t mean that social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter don t play a large role in European Politics in particular Elections In the run up to the German Bundestag Elections a group of extremists used social media platforms such as Twitter and YouTube in hopes of gaining support for the far right group Alternative f r Deutschland Despite being limited in numbers the group were able to publish patriotic videos that managed to get on to the Trending tab on YouTube as well as being able to trend the hashtag AfD on Twitter Though polled to come th in the election Alternative f r Deutschland won of the vote making them the third largest party within the Bundestag making them the first far right party to enter the building since br In the UK Cambridge Analytica was allegedly hired as a consultant company for Leave EU and the UK Independence Party during as an effort to convince people to support Brexit These rumours were the result of the leaked internal emails that were sent between Cambridge Analytica firm and the British parliament These datasets composed of the data obtained from Facebook were said to be work done as an initial job deliverable for them Although Arron Banks co founder of Leave EU denied any involvement with the company he later declared When we said we d hired Cambridge Analytica maybe a better choice of words could have been deployed The official investigation by the UK Information Commissioner found that Cambridge Analytica was not involved beyond some initial enquiries and the regulator did not identify any significant breaches of data protection legislation or privacy or marketing regulations which met the threshold for formal regulatory action br In early July the United Kingdom s Information Commissioner s Office announced it intended to fine Facebook over the data breach this being the maximum fine allowed at the time of the breach saying Facebook contravened the law by failing to safeguard people s information In and the Facebook platform allowed an app that ended up harvesting million profiles of users around the world that was then used by Cambridge Analytica in the presidential campaign and in the Brexit referendum Although Cambridge Analytica were cleared questions were still raised with how they came to access these Facebook profiles and target voters that would not have necessarily voted in this matter in the first place Dominic Cummings the prime minister s ex aide had a majority in involving Cambridge Analytica in the Leave EU campaign this can be seen in the real accounts of Brexit The Uncivil War br In terms of analyzing the role of fake news in social media there tends to be about three times more fake new articles that were more likely to be pro Trump over pro Clinton articles There were pro Trump fake news articles while only pro Clinton fake news articles pro Trump articles were shared million times while pro Clinton articles were shared million times on Facebook For each share there is about page visits which means that with around million shares of fake news articles there are million page views to these articles This means that roughly each US adult visited a fake news site three times Whether the spread of fake news has an impact on elections is conflicted as more research is required and is difficult to place a quantification on the effects However fake news is more likely to influence individuals who are over and are more conservative These groups tend to believe fake news more than other groups College students have difficulty in determining if an article shared on social media is fake news The same study also concluded that conspiratorial beliefs could be predicted by a person s political party affiliation or their ideological beliefs For example those that Republican or held a more conservative belief were far more likely to believe in baseless theories such as that of former President Obama being born outside of the United States and those that voted Democrat or held a more liberal belief would be
