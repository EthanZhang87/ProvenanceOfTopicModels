br br br Marketing br br br Sales practices br In Oracle laid off about people of its work force because of accounting errors This crisis came about because of Oracle s up front marketing strategy in which sales people urged potential customers to buy the largest possible amount of software all at once The sales people then booked the value of future license sales in the current quarter thereby increasing their bonuses This became a problem when the future sales subsequently failed to materialize Oracle eventually had to restate its earnings twice and also settled out of court class action lawsuits arising from its having overstated its earnings Ellison stated in that Oracle had made an incredible business mistake br br br Competition br In Informix overtook Sybase and became Oracle s most important rival The intense war between Informix CEO Phil White and Ellison made front page news in Silicon Valley for three years Informix claimed that Oracle had hired away Informix engineers to disclose important trade secrets about an upcoming product Informix finally dropped its lawsuit against Oracle in In November a book detailing the war between Oracle and Informix was published titled The Real Story of Informix Software and Phil White It gave a detailed chronology of the battle of Informix against Oracle and how Informix Software s CEO Phil White landed in jail because of his obsession with overtaking Ellison br Once it had overcome Informix and Sybase Oracle Corporation enjoyed years of dominance in the database market until the use of Microsoft SQL Server became widespread in the late s and IBM acquired Informix Software in to complement its Db database Today Oracle competes for new database licenses on UNIX GNU and Windows operating systems primarily against IBM s Db and Microsoft SQL Server IBM s Db still dominates the mainframe database market br In Oracle s sales grew at a rate of to billion giving it and the top share of the relational database market InformationWeek March with market share estimated at up to in by some sources br Oracle Corporation s main competitors in the database arena remain IBM Db and Microsoft SQL Server and to a lesser extent Sybase and Teradata with free databases such as PostgreSQL and MySQL also having a significant share of the market EnterpriseDB based on PostgreSQL has recently made inroads by proclaiming that its product delivers Oracle compatibility features at a much lower price point br In the software applications market Oracle Corporation primarily competes against SAP On March Oracle sued SAP accusing them of fraud and unfair competition br In the market for business intelligence software many other software companies small and large have successfully competed in quality with Oracle and SAP products Business intelligence vendors can be categorized into the big four consolidated BI firms such as Oracle who has entered BI market through a recent trend of acquisitions including Hyperion Solutions and the independent pure play vendors such as MicroStrategy Actuate and SAS br Oracle Financials was ranked in the Top Most Popular Accounting Software Infographic by Capterra in beating out SAP and a number of their other competitors br br br Oracle and SAP br From Oracle Corporation and the German company SAP AG had a decade long history of cooperation beginning with the integration of SAP s R enterprise application suite with Oracle s relational database products Despite the SAP partnership with Microsoft and the increasing integration of SAP applications with Microsoft products such as Microsoft SQL Server a competitor to Oracle Database Oracle and SAP continue their cooperation According to Oracle Corporation the majority of SAP s customers use Oracle databases br In Oracle began to increase its interest in the enterprise applications market in Oracle had already released Oracle Financials A series of acquisitions by Oracle Corporation began most notably with those of PeopleSoft Siebel Systems and Hyperion br SAP recognized that Oracle had started to become a competitor in a markets where SAP had the leadership and saw an opportunity to lure in customers from those companies that Oracle Corporation had acquired SAP would offer those customers special discounts on the licenses for its enterprise applications br Oracle Corporation would resort to a similar strategy by advising SAP customers to get OFF SAP a play on the words of the acronym for its middleware platform Oracle Fusion for SAP br and also by providing special discounts on licenses and services to SAP customers who chose Oracle Corporation products br Currently Oracle and SAP the latter through its recently acquired subsidiary TomorrowNow compete in the third party enterprise software maintenance and support market On March Oracle filed a lawsuit against SAP In Oracle Corporation v SAP AG Oracle alleged that TomorrowNow which provides discount support for legacy Oracle product lines used the accounts of former Oracle customers to systematically download patches and support documents from Oracle s website and to appropriate them for SAP s use Some analysts have suggested the suit could form part of a strategy by Oracle Corporation to decrease competition with SAP in the market for third party enterprise software maintenance and support br On July SAP admitted that TomorrowNow employees had made inappropriate downloads from the Oracle support website However it claims that SAP personnel and SAP customers had no access to Oracle intellectual property via TomorrowNow SAP s CEO Henning Kagermann stated that Even a single inappropriate download is unacceptable from my perspective We regret very much that this occurred Additionally SAP announced that it had instituted changes in TomorrowNow s operational oversight br On November a U S district court jury in Oakland California found that SAP AG must pay Oracle Corp billion for copyright infringement awarding damages that could be the largest ever for copyright infringement While admitting liability SAP estimated the damages at no more than million while Oracle claimed that they are at least billion The awarded amount is one of the or largest jury verdicts in U S legal history SAP said they were disappointed by the verdict and might appeal On September a federal judge overturned the judgment and offered a reduced amount or a new trial calling Oracle s original award grossly excessive Oracle chose a new trial br On August SAP and Oracle agreed on a judgment for million in damages pending approval from the U S district court judge to save time and expense of a new trial After the accord has been approved Oracle can ask a federal appeals court to reinstate the earlier jury verdict In addition to the damages payment SAP has already paid Oracle million for its legal fees br br br Slogans br Information driven br For the Oracle Database Can t break it can t

total carbon dioxide equivalent CO e emissions direct indirect for the twelve months ending December at kilotonnes year over year and plans to reduce emissions by from a base year br br br Controversies br br br Trashgate br In Oracle attracted attention from the computer industry and the press after hiring private investigators to dig through the trash of organizations involved in an antitrust trial against Microsoft The Chairman of Oracle Corporation Larry Ellison staunchly defended his company s hiring of an East Coast detective agency to investigate groups that supported rival Microsoft Corporation during its antitrust trial calling the snooping a public service The investigation reportedly included a offer to janitors at the Association for Competitive Technology to look through Microsoft s trash When asked how he would feel if others were looking into Oracle s business activities Ellison said We will ship our garbage to Redmond and they can go through it We believe in full disclosure br br br Can t break it can t break in br In Oracle Corporation marketed many of its products using the slogan Can t break it can t break in or Unbreakable This signified a claim of information security Oracle Corporation also stressed the reliability of networked databases and network access to databases as major selling points br However two weeks after its introduction David Litchfield Alexander Kornbrust Cesar Cerrudo and others demonstrated a whole suite of successful attacks against Oracle products Oracle Corporation s chief security officer Mary Ann Davidson said that rather than representing a literal claim of Oracle s products impregnability she saw the campaign in the context of fourteen independent security evaluations that Oracle Corporation s database server had passed br br br Relationship with John Ashcroft br In then United States Attorney General John Ashcroft sued Oracle Corporation to prevent it from acquiring a multibillion dollar intelligence contract After Ashcroft s resignation from government he founded a lobbying firm The Ashcroft Group which Oracle hired in With the group s help Oracle went on to acquire the contract br br br Expeditionary Combat Support System br Computer Sciences Corporation as the prime contractor reportedly spent a billion dollars developing the Expeditionary Combat Support System for the United States Air Force It yielded no significant capability because according to an Air Force source the prime contractor was simply not up to the task of adapting the Oracle software on which the system was based to meet the specialized performance criteria br br br Cover Oregon Healthcare Exchange br Oracle Corporation was awarded a contract by the State of Oregon s Oregon Health Authority OHA to develop Cover Oregon the state s healthcare exchange website as part of the U S Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act When the site tried to go live on October it failed and registrations had to be taken using paper applications until the site could be fixed br On April the State of Oregon voted to discontinue Cover Oregon and instead use the federal exchange to enroll Oregon residents The cost of switching to the federal portal was estimated at million whereas fixing Cover Oregon would have required another million br Oracle president Safra Catz responded to Cover Oregon and the OHA in a letter claiming that the site s problems were due to OHA mismanagement specifically that a third party systems integrator was not hired to manage the complex project br In August Oracle Corporation sued Cover Oregon for breach of contract and then later that month the state of Oregon sued Oracle Corporation in a civil complaint for breach of contract fraud filing false claims and racketeering In September the two sides reached a settlement valued at over million to the state and a six year agreement for Oracle to continue modernizing state software and IT br br br Class action tracking lawsuit br On August Oracle was hit with a class action lawsuit by Lieff Cabraser representing Michael Katz Lacabe Dr Jennifer Golbeck and Dr Johnny Ryan the latter of which is a senior fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties The lawsuit which demands a jury trial alleges that Oracle has engaged in deliberate and purposeful surveillance of the general population via their digital and online existence specifically focusing on Oracle operating a surveillance machine which tracks in real time and records indefinitely the personal information of hundreds of millions of people The litigants against Oracle argue that through such surveillance the company violates the Federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act California s state constitution the California Invasion of Privacy Act competition law and California Common Law br br br Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act br br br Africa br In August The Wall Street Journal reported that Oracle was being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for paying bribes to government officials in order to win business in Africa in contravention of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA br br br India br In Oracle agreed to pay about million to the U S Securities and Exchange Commission SEC The SEC at the time alleged that the company s India subsidiary structured transactions with foreign governments in a way that enabled them to hold about million of the proceeds inside funds that could be used for unauthorized purposes and therefore was a violation of the FCPA br br br India Turkey United Arab Emirates br In September Oracle settled with the U S Securities and Exchange Commission SEC without admitting or denying its findings by agreeing to pay million to settle the charges The SEC announced that Oracle violated the FCPA between and when its subsidiaries in India Turkey and the United Arab Emirates UAE created slush funds to bribe foreign officials in order to win business br br br South African National Treasury contract and corruption probe br In a whistleblower notified the SEC and US Department of Justice alleging possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in awarding of a R billion equivalent to R billion or US million in contract by National Treasury in br In March South Africa s Special Investigating Unit found that there were conflicts of interest irregular processes and non compliance with policies and legislation and said it would petition to blacklist Oracle in South Africa cancel the contract and recover the money paid br br br Events br br br Acquisition of Sun Microsystems br br In January Oracle completed its acquisition of Sun Microsystems valued at more than billion a move that transformed Oracle from solely a software company to a manufacturer of both software and hardware The acquisition was delayed for several months by the European Commission because of concerns about MySQL but was unconditionally approved in the end In September U S State Department Embassy cables were leaked to WikiLeaks One cable revealed that the U S pressured the E U to allow Oracle to acquire Sun br The Sun acquisition was closely watched by free software users and some companies due to the fear that Oracle might end Sun s traditional support of free projects Since the acquisition Oracle has discontinued OpenSolaris and StarOffice and sued Google over the Java patents Oracle acquired from Sun br br br Fraud Accusations by the US Department of Justice br On July the United States Department of Justice DoJ filed suit against Oracle Corporation alleging fraud The lawsuit argues that the government received deals inferior to those Oracle gave to its commercial clients The DoJ added its heft to an already existing whistleblower lawsuit filed by Paul Frascella who was once senior director of contract services at Oracle It was settled in br br br Lawsuit against Google br br br Background br Oracle the plaintiff acquired ownership of the Java computer programing language when it acquired Sun Microsystems in January The Java software includes sets of pre developed software code to allow programs and apps to accomplish common tasks in a consistent manner The pre developed code is organized into separate packages which each contain a set of classes Each class contains numerous methods which instruct a program or app to do a certain task Software developers became accustomed to using Java s designations at the package class and method level br Oracle and Google the defendant tried to negotiate an agreement for Oracle to license Java to Google which would have allowed Google to use Java in developing programs for mobile devices using the Android operating system However the two companies never reached an agreement After negotiations failed Google created its own programming platform which was based on Java and contained copied Java packages as well as new packages developed by Google br br br First trial br In Oracle sued Google for copyright infringement for the use of the Java packages The case was handled in U S District Court for the Northern District of California and assigned to Judge William Alsup who taught himself how to code computers In the lawsuit Oracle sought between billion and billion In June the judge had to force Google through a judicial order to make public the details about Oracle s claim for damages br br By the end of the first jury trial the legal dispute would eventually go on to another trial the arguments made by Oracle s attorneys focused on a Java function called rangeCheck The argument centered on a function called rangeCheck Of all the lines of code that Oracle had tested million in total these were the only ones that were literally copied Every keystroke a perfect duplicate The Verge Although Google admitted to copying the packages Judge Alsup found that none of the Java packages were covered under copyright protection and therefore Google did not infringe br br br First appeal br After the case was over Oracle appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit F d On May the appeals court partially reversed Judge Alsup s decision finding that Java APIs are copyrightable API stands for application programming interface and are how different computer programs or apps communicate with each other However the appeals court also left open the possibility that Google might have a fair use defense br br br Supreme Court petition br On October Google filed a petition to appeal to the U S Supreme Court but the Supreme Court denied the petition br br br Second trial br The case was then returned to the U S District Court for another trial about Google s fair use defense Oracle sought billion in damages In May the trial jury found that Google s use of Java s APIs was considered fair use br br br Second appeal br In February Oracle filed another appeal to the U S Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit This time it was asking for a new trial because the District Court repeatedly undermined Oracle s case which Oracle argued led the jury to make the wrong decision According to ZDNet For example it Oracle says the court wrongly bought Google s claim that Android was limited to smartphones while Java was for PCs whereas Oracle contends that Java and Android both compete as platforms for smart TVs cars and wearables br br br Discontinuation of OpenSolaris br On August an internal Oracle memo leaked to the Internet cited plans for ending the OpenSolaris operating system project and community With Oracle planning to develop Solaris only in a closed source fashion OpenSolaris developers moved to the Illumos and OpenIndiana project among others br br br Discontinuation of OpenSSO br As Oracle completed their acquisition of Sun Microsystems in February they announced that OpenSSO would no longer be their strategic product Shortly after OpenSSO was forked to OpenAM and will continue to be developed and supported by ForgeRock br br br Mark Hurd as president br On September Oracle announced that former Hewlett Packard CEO Mark Hurd was to replace Charles Phillips who resigned as Oracle co president In an official statement made by Larry Ellison Phillips had previously expressed his desire to transition out of the company Ellison had asked Phillips to stay on through the integration of Sun Microsystems Inc In a separate statement regarding the transition Ellison said Mark did a brilliant job at HP and I expect he ll do even better at Oracle There is no executive in the IT world with more relevant experience than Mark br On September HP announced a civil lawsuit against Mark Hurd to protect HP s trade secrets in response to Oracle hiring Hurd On September Oracle and HP published a joint press release announcing the resolution of the lawsuit on confidential terms and reaffirming commitment to long term strategic partnership between the companies br br br OpenOffice org issue br A number of OpenOffice org developers formed The Document Foundation and received backing by Google Novell Red Hat and Canonical as well as some others but were unable to get Oracle to donate the brand OpenOffice org causing a fork in the development of OpenOffice org with the foundation now developing and promoting LibreOffice Oracle expressed no interest in sponsoring the new project and asked the OpenOffice org developers that started the project to resign from the company due to conflicts of interest On November of the OpenOffice org developers gave their letters of resignation On June Oracle donated OpenOffice org to the Apache Software Foundation br br br HP and Oracle lawsuit br On June HP filed a lawsuit in California Superior Court in Santa Clara claiming that Oracle had breached an agreement to support the Itanium microprocessor used in HP s high end enterprise servers Oracle called the lawsuit an abuse of the judicial process and said that had it known SAP s L o Apotheker was about to be hired as HP s new CEO any support for HP s Itanium servers would not have been implied br On August a California judge said in a tentative ruling that Oracle must continue porting its software at no cost until HP discontinues its sales of Itanium based servers HP was awarded billion in damages against Oracle in HP argued Oracle s canceling support damaged HP s Itanium server brand Oracle had announced that it would appeal both the decision and damages but the decision stayed br br br GSA business bidding ban br On April the US General Services Administration banned Oracle from the most popular portal for bidding on GSA contracts for undisclosed reasons Oracle has previously used this portal for around four hundred million dollars a year in revenue Oracle previously settled a lawsuit filed under the False Claims Act which accused the company of overbilling the US government between and The settlement forced Oracle to pay million to the General Services Administration br br br U S TikTok s operations br On September Bloomberg News reported that Oracle won a bidding war with other U S based companies to take over social media company TikTok s operations in the United States following the company s pressure to forcibly be shut down by the Trump administration Oracle was described as a trusted tech partner by TikTok suggesting the deal may not be as structured as an outright sale On September the Trump administration approved of the sale of TikTok s US operations to Oracle delaying by one week restrictions that were originally to take effect on September as indicated by the United States Department of Commerce br On February The Wall Street Journal reported citing a source familiar with the matter the Biden administration would be backing off from banning TikTok and shelving the sale of TikTok indefinitely as the U S Commerce Department began reviewing whether or not Trump s claims about TikTok can justify the attempts to ban it br On February Biden changed his indefinite stance on TikTok as he echoed Trump s claims of disapproval Biden said Federal agencies have thirty days to remove TikTok from all federal devices Federal contractors must meet the same standard in ninety days On March Biden said he would sign a bipartisan bill banning TikTok in the United States if the Chinese company ByteDance didn t divest br
