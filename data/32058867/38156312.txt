Qubes OS is a security focused desktop operating system that aims to provide security through isolation Isolation is provided through the use of virtualization technology This allows the segmentation of applications into secure virtual machines called qubes Virtualization services in Qubes OS are provided by the Xen hypervisor br The runtimes of individual qubes are generally based on a unique system of underlying operating system templates Templates provide a single immutable root file system which can be shared by multiple qubes This approach has two major benefits First updates to a given template are automatically inherited by all qubes based on it Second shared templates can dramatically reduce storage requirements compared to separate VMs with a full operating install per secure domain br The base installation of Qubes OS provides a number of officially supported templates based on the Fedora and Debian Linux distributions Alternative community supported templates include Whonix Ubuntu Arch Linux CentOS or Gentoo Users may also create their own templates br Operating Systems like Qubes OS are referred to in academia as Converged Multi Level Secure MLS Systems Other proposals of similar systems have surfaced and SecureView and VMware vSphere are commercial competitors br br br Security goals br br Qubes implements a Security by Isolation approach br The assumption is that there can be no perfect bug free desktop environment such an environment counts millions of lines of code and billions of software hardware interactions One critical bug in any of these interactions may be enough for malicious software to take control of a machine br To secure a desktop using Qubes OS the user takes care to isolate various environments so that if one of the components gets compromised the malicious software would get access to only the data inside that environment br In Qubes OS the isolation is provided in two dimensions hardware controllers can be isolated into functional domains e g network domains USB controller domains whereas the user s digital life is divided into security domains with different levels of trust br For instance work domain most trusted shopping domain random domain less trusted Each of these domains is run in a separate qube br The qubes have passwordless root access e g passwordless sudo by default UEFI Secure Boot is not supported out of the box but this is not considered a major security issue br Qubes is not a multiuser system br br br Installation and System Requirements br As a desktop focused operating system Qubes OS targets personal computer hardware This market is dominated by laptops running Intel and AMD processors and chipsets br The base system requirements for Qubes OS are br br bit Intel or AMD processor with virtualization extensions Since Qubes OS only supports bit processors In addition since release x Qubes OS requires either an Intel processor with support for VT x with EPT and Intel VT d or an AMD processor with support for AMD V with RVI SLAT and AMD Vi aka AMD IOMMU This is not a major issue for AMD processors since AMD IOMMU is functionally identical to Intel s VT d br GB RAM minimum br GB disk space minimum br br br User experience br Users interact with Qubes OS in much the same manner that they interact with any standard graphical desktop operating systems with some key differences br br The creation of qubes security domains offers the means to create discrete lean secure application spaces by linking them to a complete root filesystem using shared templates br Applications launched from their respective qubes are distinguished by a unique colored window border br Opening an application for the first time in a given qube may incur a modest delay depending on system hardware br Sharing files and clipboard paste buffers utilize a special mechanism as qubes do not share a common clipboard or file system br Users can create and manage as many qubes as desired to suit their specific requirements br br br System architecture overview br br br Xen hypervisor and domains br The Xen hypervisor provides strong isolation between its hosted virtual machines called domains in Xen terminology br The first domain started by Xen is the privileged administrative domain referred to as domain zero or more commonly dom br br br The Administrative domain dom br As of Qubes OS the operating system running in dom is Fedora Linux running a paravirtualized Linux kernel It is the Linux kernel in dom that controls and brokers access to all the physical system hardware via standard Linux kernel device drivers br The operating system hosts the user s graphical desktop and controls most hardware devices This includes the graphics device USB ports storage and input devices such as the keyboard and mouse The base graphical desktop is composed of the X server the XFWM window manager and the XFCE desktop br By design dom has the least possible direct interaction with the qubes in order to minimize the possibility of an attack originating from there br Updates to the dom operating system and the included Template OS images are performed via a special mechanism which does not require dom operating system to connect directly to a network br br br The User domains qubes br An app qube an instance of a qube provides secure compartmentalized execution of standard user applications such as a web browser an email client or a text editor br Operation of app qubes is controlled by the Qube Manager It launches the discrete app qubes and presents their applications on the desktop of dom as normal process windows br This mechanism follows the idea of a sandbox After running the application viewing the document etc the whole disposable will be destroyed on shutdown br Qubes OS integrates all of the app qubes into a single common desktop environment The identity of each app qube for a given process is provided by an unforgeable colored window border which is defined in the properties of the app qube br Disk usage in dom is minimized by allowing multiple app qubes to share a common template root file system image maintained in read only mode Additional disk storage is only used for user s applications data and per VM settings br br br Network domain br The network mechanism is the most exposed to security attacks To circumvent this it is isolated in a separate unprivileged qube named the net qube br Another firewall Domain is used to house the Linux kernel based firewall so that even if the network domain is compromised the firewall is still isolated and protected as it is running in a separate Linux kernel in a separate VM br br br Reception br Security and privacy experts such as Edward Snowden Daniel J Bernstein and Christopher Soghoian have publicly praised the project br Jesse Smith wrote a review of Qubes OS for DistroWatch Weekly br br I had a revelation though on the second day of my trial when I realized I had been using Qubes incorrectly I had been treating Qubes as a security enhanced Linux distribution as though it were a regular desktop operating system with some added security This quickly frustrated me as it was difficult to share files between domains take screen shots or even access the Internet from programs I had opened in Domain Zero My experience was greatly improved when I started thinking of Qubes as being multiple separate computers which all just happened to share a display screen Once I began to look at each domain as its own island cut off from all the others Qubes made a lot more sense Qubes brings domains together on one desktop in much the same way virtualization lets us run multiple operating systems on the same server br Kyle Rankin from Linux Journal reviewed Qubes OS in br br I m sure you already can see a number of areas where Qubes provides greater security than you would find in a regular Linux desktop br In Qubes was selected as a finalist of Access Innovation Prize for Endpoint Security run by the international human rights organization Access Now br br br See also br Hyperjacking br Whonix br br br Notes br br br br br br External links
