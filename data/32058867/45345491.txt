VeraCrypt is a free and open source utility for on the fly encryption OTFE The software can create a virtual encrypted disk that works just like a regular disk but within a file It can also encrypt a partition or in Windows the entire storage device with pre boot authentication br VeraCrypt is a fork of the discontinued TrueCrypt project It was initially released on June Many security improvements have been implemented and concerns within the TrueCrypt code audits have been addressed VeraCrypt includes optimizations to the original cryptographic hash functions and ciphers which boost performance on modern CPUs br br br Encryption scheme br VeraCrypt employs AES Serpent Twofish Camellia and Kuznyechik as ciphers Version stopped using the Magma cipher in response to a security audit For additional security ten different combinations of cascaded algorithms are available br br AES Twofish br AES Twofish Serpent br Camellia Kuznyechik br Camellia Serpent br Kuznyechik AES br Kuznyechik Serpent Camellia br Kuznyechik Twofish br Serpent AES br Serpent Twofish AES br Twofish Serpent br The cryptographic hash functions available for use in VeraCrypt are BLAKE s SHA SHA Streebog and Whirlpool VeraCrypt used to have support for RIPEMD but it has since been removed in version br VeraCrypt s block cipher mode of operation is XTS It generates the header key and the secondary header key XTS mode using PBKDF with a bit salt By default they go through to iterations depending on the underlying hash function used and whether it is system or non system encryption The user can customize it to start as low as and respectively br br br Security improvements br br The VeraCrypt development team considered the TrueCrypt storage format too vulnerable to a National Security Agency NSA attack so it created a new format incompatible with that of TrueCrypt VeraCrypt versions prior to are capable of opening and converting volumes in the TrueCrypt format Since ver TrueCrypt compatibility is dropped br An independent security audit of TrueCrypt released September found TrueCrypt includes two vulnerabilities in the Windows installation driver allowing an attacker arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation via DLL hijacking This was fixed in VeraCrypt in January br While TrueCrypt uses iterations of the PBKDF RIPEMD algorithm for system partitions VeraCrypt uses either iterations SHA BLAKE s Streebog or iterations SHA Whirlpool by default which is customizable by user to be as low as or respectively For standard containers and other partitions VeraCrypt uses iterations by default regardless of the hashing algorithm chosen which is customizable by user to be as low as While these default settings make VeraCrypt slower at opening encrypted partitions it also makes password guessing attacks slower br Additionally since version a new feature called Personal Iterations Multiplier PIM provides a parameter whose value is used to control the number of iterations used by the header key derivation function thereby making brute force attacks potentially even more difficult VeraCrypt out of the box uses a reasonable PIM value to improve security but users can provide a higher value to enhance security The primary downside of this feature is that it makes the process of opening encrypted archives even slower br A vulnerability in the bootloader was fixed on Windows and various optimizations were made as well The developers added support for SHA to the system boot encryption option and also fixed a ShellExecute security issue Linux and macOS users benefit from support for hard drives with sector sizes larger than Linux also received support for the NTFS formatting of volumes br Unicode passwords are supported on all operating systems since version except for system encryption on Windows br VeraCrypt added the capability to boot system partitions using UEFI in version a br Option to enable disable support for the TRIM command for both system and non system drives was added in version br Erasing the system encryption keys from RAM during shutdown reboot helps mitigate some cold boot attacks added in version br RAM encryption for keys and passwords on bit systems was added in version br br br VeraCrypt audit br QuarksLab conducted an audit of version on behalf of the Open Source Technology Improvement Fund OSTIF which took man days The auditor published the results on October On the same day IDRIX released version which resolved major vulnerabilities identified in the audit br Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology SIT conducted another audit in following a request by Germany s Federal Office for Information Security BSI and published the results in October br br br Security precautions br There are several kinds of attacks to which all software based disk encryption is vulnerable As with TrueCrypt the VeraCrypt documentation instructs users to follow various security precautions to mitigate these attacks several of which are detailed below br br br Encryption keys stored in memory br br VeraCrypt stores its keys in RAM on some personal computers DRAM will maintain its contents for several seconds after power is cut or longer if the temperature is lowered Even if there is some degradation in the memory contents various algorithms may be able to recover the keys This method known as a cold boot attack which would apply in particular to a notebook computer obtained while in power on suspended or screen locked mode was successfully used to attack a file system protected by TrueCrypt versions a and a in With version VeraCrypt added the option of encrypting the in RAM keys and passwords on x editions of Windows with a CPU overhead of less than and the option of erasing all encryption keys from memory when a new device is connected br br br Tampered hardware br br VeraCrypt documentation states that VeraCrypt is unable to secure data on a computer if an attacker physically accessed it and VeraCrypt is then used on the compromised computer by the user again This does not affect the common case of a stolen lost or confiscated computer The attacker having physical access to a computer can for example install a hardware or a software keylogger a bus mastering device capturing memory or install any other malicious hardware or software allowing the attacker to capture unencrypted data including encryption keys and passwords or to decrypt encrypted data using captured passwords or encryption keys Therefore physical security is a basic premise of a secure system br Some kinds of malware are designed to log keystrokes including typed passwords that may then be sent to the attacker over the Internet or saved to an unencrypted local drive from which the attacker might be able to read it later when they gain physical access to the computer br br br Trusted Platform Module br VeraCrypt does not take advantage of Trusted Platform Module TPM VeraCrypt FAQ repeats the negative opinion of the original TrueCrypt developers verbatim The TrueCrypt developers were of the opinion that the exclusive purpose of the TPM is to protect against attacks that require the attacker to have administrator privileges or physical access to the computer The attacker who has physical or administrative access to a computer can circumvent TPM e g by installing a hardware keystroke logger by resetting TPM or by capturing memory contents and retrieving TPM issued keys The condemning text goes so far as to claim that TPM is entirely redundant br It is true that after achieving either unrestricted physical access or administrative privileges it is only a matter of time before other security measures in place are bypassed However stopping an attacker in possession of administrative privileges has never been one of the goals of TPM See Trusted Platform Module Uses for details TPM might however reduce the success rate of the cold boot attack described above TPM is also known to be susceptible to SPI attacks br br br Plausible deniability br As with its predecessor TrueCrypt VeraCrypt supports plausible deniability by allowing a single hidden volume to be created within another volume The Windows versions of VeraCrypt can create and run a hidden encrypted operating system whose existence may be denied The VeraCrypt documentation lists ways in which the hidden volume deniability features may be compromised e g by third party software which may leak information through temporary files or via thumbnails and possible ways to avoid this br br br Performance br VeraCrypt supports parallelized encryption for multi core systems On Microsoft Windows pipelined read and write operations a form of asynchronous processing to reduce the performance hit of encryption and decryption On processors supporting the AES NI instruction set VeraCrypt supports hardware accelerated AES to further improve performance On bit CPUs VeraCrypt uses optimized assembly implementation of Twofish Serpent and Camellia br br br License and source model br VeraCrypt was forked from the since discontinued TrueCrypt project in and originally contained mostly TrueCrypt code released under the TrueCrypt License In the years since more and more of VeraCrypt s code has been rewritten and released under the permissive Apache License br The TrueCrypt license is generally considered to be source available but not free and open source The Apache license is universally considered to be free and open source The mixed VeraCrypt license is widely but not universally considered to be free and open source br On May TrueCrypt ceased development under unusual circumstances and there exists no way to contact the former developers br VeraCrypt is considered to be free and open source by br br PC World br Techspot br DuckDuckGo s Open Source Technology Improvement Fund br Sourceforge br Open Tech Fund br Fosshub br opensource com br fossmint br VeraCrypt is considered to not be free and open source by br br Debian br Some members of the Open Source Initiative including the director expressed concern about an older version of the TrueCrypt license but the OSI itself has not published a determination regarding either TrueCrypt or VeraCrypt br The Free Software Foundation has determined the TrueCrypt license to be non free The FSF has not published a determination regarding the VeraCrypt license br Most of these are due to Veracrypt and Truecrypt not having supported or endorsed licenses For example the FSF does not tolerate licenses that impose obligations on the end user for the execution of the software and therefore go against The Free Software Definition Debian considers all software that does not meet the guidelines of its DFSG to be non free br br br Legal cases br In US v Burns the defendant had three hard drives the first being a system partition which was later found to contain caches of deleted child pornography and manuals for how to use VeraCrypt with the second being encrypted and the third having miscellaneous music files Even though the defendant admitted to having child pornography on his second hard drive he refused to give the password to the authorities Despite searching for clues of previously used passwords on the first drive and inquiries to the FBI about any weaknesses to the VeraCrypt software that could be used to access the drive partition and brute forcing the partition with the alphanumeric character set as potential passwords the partition could not be accessed Due to the defendant confessing to having child pornography on the encrypted drive the prosecution applied to force the defendant to give away the password under the foregone conclusion doctrine in the All Writs Act br In a search of a Californian defendant s apartment for accessing child pornography a VeraCrypt drive that was over Gigabytes was found as an external hard drive The FBI was called to assist local law enforcement but the FBI claimed to not have found a weakness in the VeraCrypt software The FBI also denied having a backdoor within the VeraCrypt software It was later found that another suspect had educated the defendant into using encryption to hide his photos and videos of child pornography Because the defendant had admitted to having child pornography on the drive as a backup anyways and chat logs relating to the other suspect educating the defendant on how to use VeraCrypt the foregone conclusion doctrine was used again br br br See also br Disk encryption software
