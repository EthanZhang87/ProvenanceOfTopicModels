Nvidia Corporation en VID ee is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara California and incorporated in Delaware It is a software and fabless company which designs and supplies graphics processing units GPUs application programming interfaces APIs for data science and high performance computing as well as system on a chip units SoCs for the mobile computing and automotive market Nvidia is also a dominant supplier of artificial intelligence AI hardware and software br Nvidia s professional line of GPUs are used for edge to cloud computing and in supercomputers and workstations for applications in such fields as architecture engineering and construction media and entertainment automotive scientific research and manufacturing design Its GeForce line of GPUs are aimed at the consumer market and are used in applications such as video editing D rendering and PC gaming With a market share of in the second quarter of Nvidia leads the market for discrete desktop GPUs by a wide margin The company expanded its presence in the gaming industry with the introduction of the Shield Portable a handheld game console Shield Tablet a gaming tablet and Shield TV a digital media player as well as its cloud gaming service GeForce Now br In addition to GPU design and manufacturing Nvidia provides the CUDA software platform and API that allows the creation of massively parallel programs which utilize GPUs They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the world In the late s Nvidia had moved into the mobile computing market where it produces Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets as well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems Its competitors include AMD Intel Qualcomm and AI accelerator companies such as Cerebras and Graphcore It also makes AI powered software for audio and video processing e g Nvidia Maxine br Nvidia s offer to acquire Arm from SoftBank in September failed to materialize following extended regulatory scrutiny leading to the termination of the deal in February in what would have been the largest semiconductor acquisition In Nvidia became the seventh public U S company to be valued at over trillion and the company s valuation has skyrocketed since then as the company became a leader in data center chips with AI capabilities in the midst of the AI boom In June for one day Nvidia overtook Microsoft as the world s most valuable publicly traded company with a market capitalization of over trillion br br br History br br br Founding br br Nvidia was founded on April by Jensen Huang CEO as of a Taiwanese American electrical engineer who was previously the director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at AMD Chris Malachowsky an engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems and Curtis Priem who was previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at IBM and Sun Microsystems The three men agreed to start the company in a meeting at a Denny s roadside diner on Berryessa Road in East San Jose br At the time Malachowsky and Priem were frustrated with Sun s management and were looking to leave but Huang was on firmer ground in that he was already running his own division at LSI The three co founders discussed a vision of the future which was so compelling that Huang decided to leave LSI and become the chief executive officer of their new startup br In the three co founders envisioned that the ideal trajectory for the forthcoming wave of computing would be in the realm of accelerated computing specifically in graphics based processing This path was chosen due to its unique ability to tackle challenges that eluded general purpose computing methods As Huang later explained We also observed that video games were simultaneously one of the most computationally challenging problems and would have incredibly high sales volume Those two conditions don t happen very often Video games was our killer app a flywheel to reach large markets funding huge R D to solve massive computational problems With in the bank the company was born The company subsequently received million of venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital and others br During the late s Nvidia was one of startup companies chasing the idea that graphics acceleration for video games was the path to the future Only two survived Nvidia and ATI Technologies which merged into AMD br Nvidia initially had no name and the co founders named all their files NV as in next version The need to incorporate the company prompted the co founders to review all words with those two letters At one point Malachowsky and Priem wanted to call the company NVision but that name was already taken by a manufacturer of toilet paper Huang suggested the name Nvidia from invidia the Latin word for envy The company s original headquarters office was in Sunnyvale California br br br First graphics accelerator br Nvidia s first graphics accelerator product the NV was optimized for processing quadrilateral primitives forward texture mapping instead of the triangle primitives preferred by its competitors Then Microsoft introduced the DirectX platform refused to support any other graphics software and also announced that its graphics software Direct D would support only triangles br Nvidia also signed a contract with Sega to build the graphics chip for the Dreamcast video game console and worked on the project for a year Having bet on the wrong technology Nvidia was confronted with a painful dilemma keep working on its inferior chip for the Dreamcast even though it was already too far behind the competition or stop working and run out of money right away br Eventually Sega s president at the time Shoichiro Irimajiri came to visit Huang in person to deliver the news that Sega was going with another graphics chip vendor for the Dreamcast However Irimajiri still believed in Huang and wanted to make Nvidia successful Despite Nvidia s disappointing failure to deliver on its contract Irimajiri somehow managed to convince Sega management to invest million into Nvidia Years later Huang explained that this was all the money Nvidia had left at the time and that Irimajiri s understanding and generosity gave us six months to live br In Huang laid off more than half of Nvidia s employees then around and focused the company s remaining resources on developing a graphics accelerator product optimized for processing triangle primitives the RIVA By the time the RIVA was released in August Nvidia was down to about employees and only had enough money left for about one month of payroll The sense of extreme desperation around Nvidia during this difficult era of its early history gave rise to the unofficial company motto Our company is thirty days from going out of business Huang routinely began presentations to Nvidia staff with those words for many years br Nvidia sold about a million RIVA s in about four months and used the revenue to develop its next generation of products In the release of the RIVA TNT solidified Nvidia s reputation for developing capable graphics adapters br br br Public company br Nvidia went public on January Investing in Nvidia after it had already failed to deliver on its contract turned out to be Irimajiri s best decision as Sega s president After Irimajiri left Sega in Sega sold its Nvidia stock for million br In late Nvidia released the GeForce NV its first product expressly marketed as a GPU which was most notable for introducing onboard transformation and lighting T L to consumer level D hardware Running at MHz and featuring four pixel pipelines it implemented advanced video acceleration motion compensation and hardware sub picture alpha blending The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin br Due to the success of its products Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for Microsoft s Xbox game console which earned Nvidia a million advance However the project took many of its best engineers away from other projects In the short term this did not matter and the GeForce GTS shipped in the summer of In December Nvidia reached an agreement to acquire the intellectual assets of its one time rival dfx a pioneer in consumer D graphics technology leading the field from the mid s until The acquisition process was finalized in April br In Standard Poor s selected Nvidia to replace the departing Enron in the S P stock index meaning that index funds would need to hold Nvidia shares going forward br In July Nvidia acquired Exluna for an undisclosed sum Exluna made software rendering tools and the personnel were merged into the Cg project In August Nvidia acquired MediaQ for approximately US million On April Nvidia acquired

PlayStation game console On December Nvidia acquired ULI Electronics which at the time supplied third party southbridge parts for chipsets to ATI Nvidia s competitor In March Nvidia acquired Hybrid Graphics In December Nvidia along with its main rival in the graphics industry AMD which had acquired ATI received subpoenas from the U S Department of Justice regarding possible antitrust violations in the graphics card industry br br br br Forbes named Nvidia its Company of the Year for citing the accomplishments it made during the said period as well as during the previous five years On January Nvidia announced that it had completed the acquisition of PortalPlayer Inc In February Nvidia acquired Ageia developer of PhysX a physics engine and physics processing unit Nvidia announced that it planned to integrate the PhysX technology into its future GPU products br In July Nvidia took a write down of approximately million on its first quarter revenue after reporting that certain mobile chipsets and GPUs produced by the company had abnormal failure rates due to manufacturing defects Nvidia however did not reveal the affected products In September Nvidia became the subject of a class action lawsuit over the defects claiming that the faulty GPUs had been incorporated into certain laptop models manufactured by Apple Inc Dell and HP In September Nvidia reached a settlement in which it would reimburse owners of the affected laptops for repairs or in some cases replacement On January Nvidia signed a six year billion cross licensing agreement with Intel ending all litigation between the two companies br In November after initially unveiling it at Mobile World Congress Nvidia released its Tegra ARM system on a chip for mobile devices Nvidia claimed that the chip featured

plans to build a new headquarters in the form of two giant triangle shaped buildings on the other side of San Tomas Expressway to the west of its existing headquarters complex The company selected triangles as its design theme As Huang explained in a blog post the triangle is the fundamental building block of computer graphics br In Nvidia ported the Valve games Portal and Half Life to its Nvidia Shield tablet as Lightspeed Studio Since Nvidia has diversified its business focusing on three markets gaming automotive electronics and mobile devices br That same year Nvidia also prevailed in litigation brought by the trustee of dfx s bankruptcy estate to challenge its acquisition of dfx s intellectual assets On November in an unpublished memorandum order the U S Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court s judgment affirming the bankruptcy court s determination that Nvidia did not pay less than fair market value for assets purchased from dfx shortly before dfx filed for bankruptcy br br br br br On May Nvidia unveiled the first GPUs of the GeForce series the GTX and based on the company s new Pascal microarchitecture Nvidia claimed that both models outperformed its Maxwell based Titan X model the models incorporate GDDR X and GDDR memory respectively and use a nm manufacturing process The architecture also supports a new hardware feature known as simultaneous multi projection SMP which is designed to improve the quality of multi monitor and virtual reality rendering Laptops that include these GPUs and are sufficiently thin as of late under inches mm have been designated as meeting Nvidia s Max Q design standard br In July Nvidia agreed to a settlement for a false advertising lawsuit regarding its GTX model as the models were unable to use all of their advertised GB of VRAM due to limitations brought by the design of its hardware In May Nvidia announced a partnership with Toyota which will use Nvidia s Drive PX series artificial intelligence platform for its autonomous vehicles In July Nvidia and Chinese search giant Baidu announced a far reaching AI partnership that includes cloud computing autonomous driving consumer devices and Baidu s open source AI framework PaddlePaddle Baidu unveiled that Nvidia s Drive PX AI will be the foundation of its autonomous vehicle platform br Nvidia officially released the Titan V on December br Nvidia officially released the Nvidia Quadro GV on March Nvidia officially released the RTX GPUs on September In Google announced that Nvidia s Tesla P graphic cards would be integrated into Google Cloud service s artificial intelligence br In May on the Nvidia user forum a thread was started asking the company to update users when they would release web drivers for its cards installed on legacy Mac Pro machines up to mid running the macOS Mojave operating system Web drivers are required to enable graphics acceleration and multiple display monitor capabilities of the GPU On its Mojave update info website Apple stated that macOS Mojave would run on legacy machines with Metal compatible graphics cards and listed Metal compatible GPUs including some manufactured by Nvidia However this list did not include Metal compatible cards that currently work in macOS High Sierra using Nvidia developed web drivers In September Nvidia responded Apple fully controls drivers for macOS But if Apple allows our engineers are ready and eager to help Apple deliver great drivers for macOS Mojave In October Nvidia followed this up with another public announcement Apple fully controls drivers for macOS Unfortunately Nvidia currently cannot release a driver unless it is approved by Apple suggesting a possible rift between the two companies By January with still no sign of the enabling web drivers Apple Insider weighed into the controversy with a claim that Apple management doesn t want Nvidia support in macOS The following month Apple Insider followed this up with another claim that Nvidia support was abandoned because of relational issues in the past and that Apple was developing its own GPU technology Without Apple approved Nvidia web drivers Apple users are faced with replacing their Nvidia cards with a competing supported brand such as AMD Radeon from the list recommended by Apple br br br acquisition of Mellanox Technologies br br On March Nvidia announced a deal to buy Mellanox Technologies for billion to substantially expand its footprint in the high performance computing market In May Nvidia announced new RTX Studio laptops The creators say that the new laptop is going to be seven times faster than a top end MacBook Pro with a Core i and AMD s Radeon Pro Vega graphics in apps like Maya and RedCine X Pro In August Nvidia announced

computer called Cambridge launched in July with a million investment and will employ AI to support healthcare research According to Jensen Huang The Cambridge supercomputer will serve as a hub of innovation for the UK and further the groundbreaking work being done by the nation s researchers in critical healthcare and drug discovery br Also in October along with the release of the Nvidia RTX A Nvidia announced it is retiring its workstation GPU brand Quadro shifting its product name to Nvidia RTX for future products and the manufacturing to be Nvidia Ampere architecture based br In August the proposed takeover of Arm was stalled after the UK s Competition and Markets Authority raised significant competition concerns In October the European Commission opened a competition investigation into the takeover The Commission stated that Nvidia s acquisition could restrict competitors access to Arm s products and provide Nvidia with too much internal information on its competitors due to their deals with Arm SoftBank the parent company of Arm and Nvidia announced in early February that they had agreed not to move forward with the transaction because of significant regulatory challenges The investigation is set to end on March That same month Nvidia was reportedly compromised by a cyberattack br In March Nvidia s CEO Jensen Huang mentioned that they are open to having

export control list The next month the company unveiled a new advanced chip in China called the A GPU that met the export control rules br In September Getty Images announced that it was partnering with Nvidia to launch Generative AI by Getty Images a new tool that lets people create images using Getty s library of licensed photos Getty will use Nvidia s Edify model which is available on Nvidia s generative AI model library Picasso br On September Denny s CEO Kelli Valade joined Huang in East San Jose to celebrate the founding of Nvidia at Denny s on Berryessa Road where a plaque was installed to mark the relevant corner booth as the birthplace of a trillion company By then Nvidia s H GPUs were in such demand that even other tech giants were beholden to how Nvidia allocated supply Larry Ellison of Oracle Corporation said that month that during a dinner with Huang at Nobu in Palo Alto he and Elon Musk of Tesla Inc and xAI were begging for H s I guess is the best way to describe it An hour of sushi and begging br In October it was reported that Nvidia had quietly begun designing ARM based central processing units CPUs for Microsoft s Windows operating system with a target to start selling them in br br br br In January Forbes reported that Nvidia has increased its lobbying presence in Washington D C as American lawmakers consider proposals to regulate artificial intelligence From to the company reportedly hired at least four government affairs with professional backgrounds at agencies including the United States Department of State and the Department of the Treasury It was noted that the spent by the company on lobbying in was small compared to a number of major tech companies in the artificial intelligence space br As of January Raymond James Financial analysts estimated that Nvidia was selling the H GPU in the price range of to each while on eBay individual H s cost over Tech giants were purchasing tens or hundreds of thousands of GPUs for their data centers to run generative artificial intelligence projects simple arithmetic implied that they were committing to billions of dollars in capital expenditures br In February it was reported that Nvidia was the hot employer in Silicon Valley because it was offering interesting work and good pay at a time when other tech employers were downsizing Half of Nvidia employees earned over in By then Nvidia GPUs had become so valuable that they needed special security while in transit to data centers Cisco chief information officer Fletcher Previn explained at a CIO summit Those GPUs arrive by armored car br On March Nvidia became the third company in the history of the United States to close with a market capitalization in excess of trillion Nvidia needed only days to get to trillion from

applications br Maxine a platform providing developers a suite of AI based conferencing software br br br Open source software support br br Until September Nvidia had not published any documentation for its advanced hardware meaning that programmers could not write free and open source device driver for its products without resorting to clean room reverse engineering br Instead Nvidia provides its own binary GeForce graphics drivers for X Org and an open source library that interfaces with the Linux FreeBSD or Solaris kernels and the proprietary graphics software Nvidia also provided but stopped supporting an obfuscated open source driver that only supports two dimensional hardware acceleration and ships with the X Org distribution br The proprietary nature of Nvidia s drivers has generated dissatisfaction within free software communities In a talk Linus Torvalds in criticism of Nvidia s approach towards Linux raised the finger and stated Nvidia fuck you Some Linux and BSD users insist on using only open source drivers and regard Nvidia s insistence on providing nothing more than a binary only driver as inadequate given that competing manufacturers such as Intel offer support and documentation for open source developers and that others like AMD release partial documentation and provide some active development br Nvidia only provides x x and ARMv A versions of their proprietary driver as a result features like CUDA are unavailable on other platforms Some users claim that Nvidia s Linux drivers impose artificial restrictions like limiting the number of monitors that can be used at the same time but the company has not commented on these accusations br In with Maxwell GPUs Nvidia started to require firmware by them to unlock all features of its graphics cards br On May Nvidia announced that they are opensourcing their GPU kernel modules Support for Nvidia s firmware was implemented in nouveau in which allows proper power management and GPU reclocking for Turing and newer graphics cards br br br Deep learning br Nvidia GPUs are used in deep learning and accelerated analytics due to Nvidia s CUDA software platform and API which allows programmers to utilize the higher number of cores present in GPUs to parallelize BLAS operations which are extensively used in machine learning algorithms They were included in many Tesla Inc vehicles before Musk announced at Tesla Autonomy Day in that the company developed its own SoC and full self driving computer now and would stop using Nvidia hardware for their vehicles These GPUs are used by researchers laboratories tech companies and enterprise companies In Nvidia was involved in what was called the big bang of deep learning as deep learning neural networks were combined with Nvidia graphics processing units GPUs That year the Google Brain team used Nvidia GPUs to create deep neural networks capable of machine learning where Andrew Ng determined that GPUs could increase the speed of deep learning systems by about times br br br DGX br br DGX is a line of supercomputers by Nvidia br In April Nvidia produced the DGX based on an GPU cluster to improve the ability of users to use deep learning by combining GPUs with integrated deep learning software Nvidia gifted its first DGX to OpenAI in August to help it train larger and more complex AI models with the capability of reducing processing time from six days to two hours It also developed Nvidia Tesla K and P GPU based virtual machines which are available through Google Cloud which Google installed in November Microsoft added GPU servers in a preview offering of its N series based on Nvidia s Tesla K s each containing processing cores Later that year AWS s P instance was produced using up to Nvidia Tesla K GPUs That month Nvidia also partnered with IBM to create a software kit that boosts the AI capabilities of Watson called IBM PowerAI Nvidia also offers its own Nvidia Deep Learning software development kit In the GPUs were also brought online at the Riken Center for Advanced Intelligence Project for Fujitsu The company s deep learning technology led to a boost in its earnings br In May researchers at the artificial intelligence department of Nvidia realized the possibility that a robot can learn to perform a job simply by observing the person doing the same job They have created a system that after a short revision and testing can already be used to control the universal robots of the next generation In addition to GPU manufacturing Nvidia provides parallel processing capabilities to researchers and scientists that allow them to efficiently run high performance applications br br br Robotics br In Nvidia unveiled Omniverse a virtual environment designed for engineers Nvidia also open sourced Isaac Sim which makes use of this Omniverse to train robots through simulations that mimic the physics of the robots and the real world br In Huang oriented Nvidia s focus towards humanoid robots and self driving cars which he expects to gain widespread adoption br br br Inception Program br Nvidia s Inception Program was created to support startups making exceptional advances in the fields of artificial intelligence and data science Award winners are announced at Nvidia s GTC Conference In May the program had companies As of March there were startups in the Inception Program As of August the program has surpassed members in countries with cumulative funding of US billion br br br Controversies br br br Maxwell advertising dispute br br br GTX hardware specifications br Issues with the GeForce GTX s specifications were first brought up by users when they found out that the cards while featuring GB of memory rarely accessed memory over the GB boundary Further testing and investigation eventually led to Nvidia issuing a statement that the card s initially announced specifications had been altered without notice before the card was made commercially available and that the card took a performance hit once memory over the GB limit were put into use br The card s back end hardware specifications initially announced as being identical to those of the GeForce GTX differed in the amount of L cache MB versus MB in the GeForce GTX and the number of ROPs versus in the Additionally it was revealed that the card was designed to access its memory as a GB section plus a GB one access to the latter being times slower than the first one The company then went on to promise a specific driver modification in order to alleviate the performance issues produced by the cutbacks suffered by the card However Nvidia later clarified that the promise had been a miscommunication and there would be no specific driver update for the GTX Nvidia claimed that it would assist customers who wanted refunds in obtaining them On February Nvidia CEO Jen Hsun Huang went on record in Nvidia s official blog to apologize for the incident In February a class action lawsuit alleging false advertising was filed against Nvidia and Gigabyte Technology in the U S District Court for Northern California br Nvidia revealed that it is able to disable individual units each containing KB of L cache and ROPs without disabling whole memory controllers This comes at the cost of dividing the memory bus into high speed and low speed segments that cannot be accessed at the same time unless one segment is reading while the other segment is writing because the L ROP unit managing both of the GDDR controllers shares the read return channel and the write data bus between the two GDDR controllers and itself This is used in the GeForce GTX which therefore can be described as having GB in its high speed segment on a bit bus and GB in a low speed segment on a bit bus br On July Nvidia agreed to a preliminary settlement of the U S class action lawsuit offering a refund on GTX purchases The agreed upon refund represents the portion of the cost of the storage and performance capabilities the consumers assumed they were obtaining when they purchased the card br br br GeForce Partner Program br The Nvidia GeForce Partner Program was a marketing program designed to provide partnering companies with benefits such as public relations support video game bundling and marketing development funds The program proved to be controversial with complaints about it possibly being an anti competitive practice br First announced in a blog post on March it was canceled on May br br br Hardware Unboxed controversy br On December Nvidia told popular YouTube tech reviewer Steven Walton of Hardware Unboxed that it would no longer supply him with GeForce Founders Edition graphics card review units In a Twitter message Hardware Unboxed said Nvidia have officially decided to ban us from receiving GeForce Founders Edition GPU review samples Their reasoning is that we are focusing on rasterization instead of ray tracing They have said they will revisit this should your editorial direction change br br In emails that were disclosed by Walton from Nvidia Senior PR Manager Bryan Del Rizzo Nvidia had said your GPU reviews and recommendations have continued to focus singularly on rasterization performance and you have largely discounted all of the other technologies we offer gamers It is very clear from your community commentary that you do not see things the same way that we gamers and the rest of the industry do TechSpot partner site of Hardware Unboxed said this and other related incidents raise serious questions around journalistic independence and what they are expecting of reviewers when they are sent products for an unbiased opinion br A number of prominent technology reviewers came out strongly against Nvidia s move Linus Sebastian of Linus Tech Tips titled the episode of his popular weekly WAN Show NVIDIA might ACTUALLY be EVIL and was highly critical of the company s move to dictate specific outcomes of technology reviews The popular review site Gamers Nexus said it was Nvidia s latest decision to shoot both its feet They ve now made it so that any reviewers covering RT will become subject to scrutiny from untrusting viewers who will suspect subversion by the company Shortsighted self own from NVIDIA br Two days later Nvidia reversed their stance Hardware Unboxed sent out a Twitter message I just received an email from Nvidia apologizing for the previous email they ve now walked everything back On December Hardware Unboxed released a video explaining the controversy from their viewpoint Via Twitter they also shared a second apology sent by Nvidia s Del Rizzo that said to withhold samples because I didn t agree with your commentary is simply inexcusable and crossed the line br br br Improper disclosures about cryptomining br In Nvidia s chips became popular for cryptomining the process of obtaining crypto rewards in exchange for verifying transactions on distributed ledgers the U S Securities and Exchange Commission SEC said However the company failed to disclose that it was a significant element of its revenue growth from sales of chips designed for gaming the SEC further added in a statement and charging order Those omissions misled investors and analysts who were interested in understanding the impact of cryptomining on Nvidia s business the SEC emphasized Nvidia which did not admit or deny the findings has agreed to pay million to settle civil charges according to a statement made by the SEC in May br br br See also br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br br Official website
