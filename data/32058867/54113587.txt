visit their feed out of an average of updates they can potentially receive Over two billion people use Facebook every month making the network s Feed the most viewed and most influential aspect of the news industry The feature introduced in was renamed Feed in br br br History br Before Facebook simply consisted of profiles requiring the user to visit a profile to see any new posts On September Facebook announced a new home page feature called News Feed The new layout created an alternative home page in which users saw a constantly updated list of their friends Facebook activities Initially the addition of the News Feed caused discontent among Facebook users many of which complained that the feed was too intrusive detailing every moment with timestamps and violated their privacy Some called for a boycott of the company In response to this dissatisfaction CEO Mark Zuckerberg issued a statement clarifying that We didn t take away any privacy options Following this Zuckerberg later issued an open letter apologizing for a lack of information on new features and users controls writing that We really messed this one up I d like to try to correct those errors now br The News Feed has received multiple updates over the years since its original setup In Facebook added a feedback button to each story in a user s feed letting them tell the service about their personal preferences for their feed However the feedback button was removed in April and returned in July with Facebook reportedly removing the first iteration of the feedback options due to a low impact on user satisfaction compared to other aspects of the algorithm br In March Facebook rolled out the option to Like a page to see updates from it in their feed gave users customizable filters to determine what friends they wanted to see News Feed updates from and also added a publishing field at the top of the feed previously exclusive to user profiles for easy post creation The publishing field contained the text What s on your mind a similar but also notably different question from Twitter s What are you doing right now A few weeks later the company introduced controls to reduce content from app interactions and enabled the feed to show photos in which friends were tagged br In December Facebook rolled out a new drop down button offering users the ability to view News Feed by categories including only games status updates photos links Pages or specific groups of people br In February Facebook added News Feed settings to let users specify if they want content from only the people and pages they interact with the most rather than everyone In September Facebook updated the feed to show top stories and most recent stories rather than relying on a strictly chronological order Later the same year it introduced the ticker a real time extension of News Feed located on the right side of the screen At the end of the year news outlets reported that Facebook would be starting allowing advertisements through Sponsored Stories in News Feed for the first time Advertisements started rolling out on January with a Featured tag declaring its paid status Advertisements were expanded to mobile in February br In March Facebook held a press event to unveil new updates to News Feed including a more minimalistic design with consistency across both the website and mobile devices This included a new layout for posts presenting friends photos shared articles and maps with larger text and images and brands logos New sub feeds show updates in specific areas such as posts from specific friends or interest updates However the initial limited rollout of the new design saw a trend of lower user engagement prompting the company to stop the rollout A year later in March Facebook once again updated its News Feed but in response to criticism from users the company chose to scale back its efforts While bringing bigger photos that span the width of the feed font changes and design tweaks to buttons and icons the new design removed the drop down menu placing relevant entries in a navigation on the left side of the screen while removing some of the sub feeds It also simplified the comments system altered the appearance of profile photos in the feed and added a search bar at the top of the page News Feed product manager Greg Marra explained that People don t like us moving their furniture around because you break muscle memory Marra also stated that Over the last year we ve spent a lot of time seeing what people were saying what was working what wasn t working and we re rolling out the version that takes all of that feedback into account br In January following a difficult marked by accusations of relaying fake news and revelations about groups close to Russia which tried to influence the US presidential election see Russian interference in the United States elections via advertisements on his service Mark Zuckerberg announced in his traditional January post br br We re making a major change to how we build Facebook I m changing the goal I give our product teams from focusing on helping you find relevant content to helping you have more meaningful social interactions br Following surveys of Facebook users this desire for change will take the form of a reconfiguration of the News Feed algorithms in order to br br Prioritize content of family members and friends Mark Zuckerberg January Facebook The first changes you ll see will be in News Feed where you can expect to see more from your friends family and groups br Give priority to news articles from local sources considered more credible br These changes are expected to improve the amount of meaningful content viewed However a study shows that when news content is removed from the Feed many users will find almost nothing of value br In Facebook s parent company Meta Platforms announced it is renaming the News Feed to simply be named Feed br br br Influence br Approximately two billion people use the Facebook platform every month Approximately percent of adults in the United States use social media to get news meaning Facebook s influence has become a liability for the company During the U S presidential election the Russian government used the Facebook platform to disseminate fake news that more frequently favored Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton As a social media platform user generated content and media created content can be shared vastly within the digital community This has come with repercussions for Facebook as they were accused of releasing personally identifiable information of approximately million users to Cambridge Analytica The Cambridge Analytica Scandal drew much attention to the privacy settings and influence of the Feed on the Facebook platform The Feed has become a significant contributor to the spread of misinformation as former U S president Barack Obama put it misinformation looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television br After the election journalist Margaret Sullivan called on Facebook inc to hire an editor to monitor the News Feed to ensure accuracy and balance of news stories In late Facebook described plans to issue warning labels on certain News Feed posts Facebook has a partnership with fact checkers like Snopes com and PolitiFact and would display that a story is disputed if it has been debunked by one of those fact checkers br br br Operation br On the Facebook app Feed is the first screen to appear partially leading most users to think of the feed as Facebook itself br The Facebook Feed operates as a revolving door of articles pages the user has liked status updates app activity likes from other users photos and videos This operates an arena of social discussion Algorithms are employed on the Facebook platform to curate a personalized experience for users that is predominantly featured in the Feed br Adam Mosseri is Facebook s vice president in charge of Feed and Chief Product Officer while Chris Cox runs the Facebook app and Feed On October it was announced Adam Mosseri would become the head of Instagram br br br Algorithms br Facebook s proprietary recommendation algorithms compare the merits of about potential posts every time the app is opened using a complex system based on providing a meaningful experience over that of clicks reactions or reading time The Feed has been described as a filter bubble showing users personalized results about information deemed interesting to them in contrary to showing all information even information that they disagree with Subsequently the functionality of the Feed has been debated as to whether or not it is an echo chamber br Facebook has been researching this situation since and initially used an algorithm known as EdgeRank By late clickbait articles had become significantly prevalent leading Facebook s chief product officer Chris Cox s team to hire survey panels to assess how Feed was working As a result Facebook began adding ever increasing numbers of data points to its algorithm to significantly reduce clickbait br br br Effect on opinion br A study published in Science concluded that Facebook s algorithms had a minimal effect on the news feed s diversity though the study prompted academic criticism br Researchers at the MIT Media Lab Center for Civic Media produced an application called Gobo which allows users to see the results of adjusting the algorithm br br br See also br List of Facebook features br br br
