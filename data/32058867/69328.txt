The United Arab Emirates UAE or simply the Emirates is a country in West Asia in the Middle East Located at the eastern end of the Arabian Peninsula it shares land borders with Oman to the east and Saudi Arabia to the southwest as well as maritime borders in the Persian Gulf with Qatar and Iran The United Arab Emirates is an elective monarchy formed from a federation of seven emirates As of the UAE has an estimated population of about million Emirati citizens are estimated to form of the population with the remaining residents forming up to of the UAE population composed of expatriates the majority of whom are of South Asian descent Islam is the official religion and Arabic is the official language Abu Dhabi is the country s capital while Dubai the most populous city is an international hub br The United Arab Emirates oil and natural gas reserves are the world s sixth and seventh largest respectively Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan ruler of Abu Dhabi and the country s first president oversaw the development of the Emirates by investing oil revenues into healthcare education and infrastructure The country has the most diversified economy among the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council In the st century the UAE has become less reliant on oil and gas and is economically focusing on tourism and business The UAE is considered a middle power It is a member of the United Nations Arab League Organisation of Islamic Cooperation OPEC Non Aligned Movement World Trade Organization Gulf Cooperation Council GCC and BRICS The UAE is also a dialogue partner of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation br Human rights organisations consider the UAE substandard on human rights ranking only in the human freedom index citing reports of government critics being imprisoned and tortured families harassed by the state security apparatus and cases of forced disappearances Individual rights such as the freedoms of assembly association the press expression and religion are also severely repressed br br br History br br br Antiquity br br Stone tools recovered reveal a settlement of people from Africa some years ago and a stone tool used for butchering animals discovered on the Arabian coast suggests an even older habitation from years ago In time lively trading links developed with civilisations in Mesopotamia Iran and the Harappan culture of the Indus Valley This contact persisted and became wider probably motivated by the trade in copper from the Hajar Mountains which commenced around BCE Sumerian sources talk of the Magan civilisation which has been identified as encompassing the modern UAE and Oman br There are six periods of human settlement with distinctive behaviours in the region before Islam which include the Hafit period from to BCE the Umm Al Nar culture from to BCE and the Wadi Suq culture from to BCE From BCE to the advent of Islam in Eastern Arabia through three distinctive Iron Ages and the Mleiha period the area was variously occupied by the Achaemenids and other forces and saw the construction of fortified settlements and extensive husbandry thanks to the development of the falaj irrigation system br br br Islam br The spread of Islam to the northeastern tip of the Arabian Peninsula is thought to have followed directly from a letter sent by the Islamic prophet Muhammad to the rulers of Oman in CE This led to a group of rulers travelling to Medina converting to Islam and subsequently driving a successful uprising against the unpopular Sassanids who dominated the coast at the time Following the death of Muhammad the new Islamic communities south of the Persian Gulf threatened to disintegrate with insurrections against the Muslim leaders Caliph Abu Bakr sent an army from the capital Medina which completed its reconquest of the territory the Ridda Wars with the Battle of Dibba in which lives are thought to have been lost This assured the integrity of the Caliphate and the unification of the Arabian Peninsula under the newly emerging Rashidun Caliphate br In Julfar in the area of today s Ras Al Khaimah was an important port that was used as a staging post for the Islamic invasion of the Sasanian Empire The area of the Al Ain Buraimi Oasis was known as Tu am and was an important trading post for camel routes between the coast and the Arabian interior br The earliest Christian site in the UAE was first discovered in the s an extensive monastic complex on what is now known as Sir Bani Yas Island and which dates back to the seventh century Thought to be Nestorian and built in CE the church appears to have been abandoned peacefully in CE It forms a rare physical link to a legacy of Christianity which is thought to have spread across the peninsula from to CE following trade routes Certainly by the fifth century Oman had a bishop named John the last bishop of Oman being Etienne in CE br br br Portuguese era br br The harsh desert environment led to the emergence of the versatile tribesman nomadic groups who subsisted due to a variety of economic activities including animal husbandry agriculture and hunting The seasonal movements of these groups led not only to frequent clashes between groups but also to the establishment of seasonal and semi seasonal settlements and centres These formed tribal groupings whose names are still carried by modern Emiratis including the Bani Yas and Al Bu Falah of Abu Dhabi Al Ain Liwa and the west coast the Dhawahir Awamir Al Ali and Manasir of the interior the Sharqiyin of the east coast and the Qawasim to the north br With the expansion of European colonial empires Portuguese English and Dutch forces appeared in the Persian Gulf region By the th century the Bani Yas confederation was the dominant force in most of the area now known as Abu Dhabi while the Northern Al Qawasim Al Qasimi dominated maritime commerce The Portuguese maintained an influence over the coastal settlements building forts in the wake of the bloody th century conquests of coastal communities by Albuquerque and the Portuguese commanders who followed him particularly on the east coast at Muscat Sohar and Khor Fakkan br The southern coast of the Persian Gulf was known to the British as the Pirate Coast as boats of the Al Qawasim federation harassed British flagged shipping from the th century into the th The charge of piracy is disputed by modern Emirati historians including the current ruler of Sharjah Sheikh Sultan Al Qasimi in his book The Myth of Arab Piracy in the Gulf br br British expeditions to protect their Indian trade routes led to campaigns against Ras Al Khaimah and other harbours along the coast including the Persian Gulf campaign of and the more successful campaign of The following year Britain and a number of local rulers signed a maritime truce giving rise to the term Trucial States which came to define the status of the coastal emirates A further treaty was signed in and in the Perpetual Maritime Truce was agreed To this was added the Exclusive Agreements signed in which made the Trucial States a British protectorate br Under the treaty the trucial sheikhs agreed not to dispose of any territory except to the British and not to enter into relationships with any foreign government other than the British without their consent In return the British promised to protect the Trucial Coast from all aggression by sea and to help in case of land attack British maritime policing meant that pearling fleets could operate in relative security However the British prohibition of the slave trade meant an important source of income was lost to some sheikhs and merchants br In the Qubaisat tribe settled at Khor Al Adaid and tried to enlist the support of the Ottomans Khor Al Adaid was claimed by Abu Dhabi at that time a claim supported by the British In the British Political Resident Percy Cox confirmed in writing to the ruler of Abu Dhabi Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan Zayed the Great that Khor Al Adaid belonged to his sheikhdom br br br British era and discovery of oil br br During the th and early th centuries the pearling industry thrived providing both income and employment to the people of the Persian Gulf The First World War had a severe impact on the industry but it was the economic depression of the late s and early s coupled with the invention of the cultured pearl that wiped out the trade The remnants of the trade eventually faded away shortly after the Second World War when the newly independent Government of India imposed heavy taxation on imported pearls The decline of pearling resulted in extreme economic hardship in the Trucial States br In the British government secured undertakings from the rulers of the Trucial States not to sign concessions with foreign companies without their consent Aware of the potential for the development of natural resources such as oil following finds in Persia from and Mesopotamia from a British led oil company the Iraq Petroleum Company IPC showed an interest in the region The Anglo Persian Oil Company APOC later to become British Petroleum or BP had a share in IPC From onshore concessions to explore for oil were granted by local rulers with APOC signing the first one on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Ltd PCL an associate company of IPC APOC was prevented from developing the region alone because of the restrictions of the Red Line Agreement which required it to operate through IPC A number of options between PCL and the trucial rulers were signed providing useful revenue for communities experiencing poverty following the collapse of the pearl trade However the wealth of oil which the rulers could see from the revenues accruing to surrounding countries remained elusive The first bore holes in Abu Dhabi were drilled by IPC s operating company Petroleum Development Trucial Coast Ltd PDTC at Ras Sadr in with a foot deep metre bore hole taking a year to drill and turning out dry at the tremendous cost at the time of million br br The British set up a development office that helped in some small developments in the emirates The seven sheikhs of the emirates then decided to form a council to coordinate matters between them and took over the development office In they formed the Trucial States Council and appointed Adi Al Bitar Dubai s Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum s legal advisor as secretary general and legal advisor to the council The council was terminated once the United Arab Emirates was formed The tribal nature of society and the lack of definition of borders between emirates frequently led to disputes settled either through mediation or more rarely force The Trucial Oman Scouts was a small military force used by the British to keep the peace br In a subsidiary of BP D Arcy Exploration Ltd obtained an offshore concession from the ruler of Abu Dhabi BP joined with Compagnie Fran aise des P troles later Total to form operating companies Abu Dhabi Marine Areas Ltd ADMA and Dubai Marine Areas Ltd DUMA A number of undersea oil surveys were carried out including one led by the famous marine explorer Jacques Cousteau In a floating platform rig was towed from Hamburg Germany and positioned over the Umm Shaif pearl bed in Abu Dhabi waters where drilling began In March it struck oil in the Upper Thamama rock formation This was the first commercial discovery of the Trucial Coast leading to the first exports of oil in ADMA made further offshore discoveries at Zakum and elsewhere and other companies made commercial finds such as the Fateh oilfield off Dubai and the Mubarak field off Sharjah shared with Iran br Meanwhile onshore exploration was hindered by territorial disputes In the United Kingdom represented Abu Dhabi and Oman in their dispute with Saudi Arabia over the Buraimi Oasis A agreement between Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia seemed to have settled the Abu Dhabi Saudi border dispute but this has not been ratified The UAE s border with Oman was ratified in br PDTC continued its onshore exploration away from the disputed area drilling five more bore holes that were also dry However on October the company discovered oil in commercial quantities at the Murban No well on the coast near Tarif In PDTC became the Abu Dhabi Petroleum Company As oil revenues increased the ruler of Abu Dhabi Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan undertook a massive construction program building schools housing hospitals and roads When Dubai s oil exports commenced in Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum the ruler of Dubai was able to invest the revenues from the limited reserves found to spark the diversification drive that would create the modern global city of Dubai br br br Independence br br By it had become clear the British government could no longer afford to administer and protect the Trucial States what is now the United Arab Emirates British Members of Parliament MPs debated the preparedness of the Royal Navy to defend the sheikhdoms On January British Prime Minister Harold Wilson announced the government s decision reaffirmed in March by Prime Minister Edward Heath to end the treaty relationships with the seven trucial sheikhdoms Days after the announcement the ruler of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan fearing vulnerability tried to persuade the British to honour the protection treaties by offering to pay the full costs of keeping the British Armed Forces in the Emirates The British Labour government rejected the offer After Labour MP Goronwy Roberts informed Sheikh Zayed of the news of British withdrawal the nine Persian Gulf sheikhdoms attempted to form a union of Arab emirates but by mid they were still unable to agree on terms of union even though the British treaty relationship was to expire in December of that year br Fears of vulnerability were realised the day before independence An Iranian destroyer group broke formation from an exercise in the lower Gulf sailing to the Tunb islands The islands were taken by force civilians and Arab defenders alike allowed to flee A British warship stood idle during the course of the invasion A destroyer group approached the island of Abu Musa as well But there Sheikh Khalid bin Mohammed Al Qasimi had already negotiated with the Iranian shah and the island was quickly leased to Iran for million a year Meanwhile Saudi Arabia laid claim to swathes of Abu Dhabi br Originally intended to be part of the proposed Federation of Arab Emirates Bahrain became independent in August and Qatar in September When the British Trucial Sheikhdoms treaty expired on December both emirates became fully independent On December six of the emirates Abu Dhabi Ajman Dubai Fujairah Sharjah and Umm Al Quwain agreed to enter into a union named the United

League on December and the United Nations on December It was a founding member of the Gulf Cooperation Council in May with Abu Dhabi hosting the first GCC summit br br br Post Independence period br br The UAE supported military operations by the US and other coalition states engaged in the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein in Ba athist Iraq as well as operations supporting the Global War on Terror for the Horn of Africa at Al Dhafra Air Base located outside of Abu Dhabi The air base also supported Allied operations during the Persian Gulf War and Operation Northern Watch The country had already signed a military defence agreement with the U S in and one with France in In January France and the UAE signed a deal allowing France to set up a permanent military base in the emirate of Abu Dhabi The UAE joined international military operations in Libya in March br On November the UAE s first president Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan died Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan was elected as the president of the UAE Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan succeeded Sheikh Khalifa as crown prince of Abu Dhabi In January Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum the prime minister of the UAE and the ruler of Dubai died and Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum assumed both roles br The first ever national elections were held on December A number of voters chose half of the members of the Federal National Council The UAE has largely escaped the Arab Spring which other countries have experienced however Emirati activists from Al Islah were apprehended for an alleged coup attempt and the attempt of the establishment of an Islamist state in the UAE Mindful of the protests in nearby Bahrain in November the UAE outlawed online mockery of its government or attempts to organise public protests through social media br On January the COVID pandemic was confirmed to have reached the UAE Two months later in March the government announced the closure of shopping malls schools and places of worship in addition to imposing a hour curfew and suspending all Emirates passenger flights This resulted in a major economic downturn which eventually led to the merger of more than of the UAE s federal agencies br On August the UAE established normal diplomatic relations with Israel and with the help of the United States they signed the Abraham Accords with Bahrain br On February the UAE achieved a historic milestone when its probe named Hope successfully reached Mars s orbit The UAE became the first country in the Arab world to reach Mars the fifth country to successfully reach Mars and the second country after an Indian probe to orbit Mars on its maiden attempt br On May Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan was elected as the UAE s new president after the death of Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan br br br Geography br br The United Arab Emirates is situated in the Middle East bordering the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf between Oman and Saudi Arabia it is in a strategic location slightly south of the Strait of Hormuz a vital transit point for world crude oil br The UAE lies between and north latitude and between and east longitude It shares a kilometre mi border with Saudi Arabia on the west south and southeast and a kilometre mi border with Oman on the southeast and northeast The land border with Qatar in the Khor Al Adaid area is about nineteen kilometres miles in the northwest however it is a source of ongoing dispute Following Britain s military departure from the UAE in and its establishment as a new state the UAE laid claim to Iranian occupied islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and the Lesser Tunbs when Iran captured them during the british rule resulting in disputes with Iran that remain unresolved The UAE also disputes claim on other islands against the neighboring state of Qatar The largest emirate Abu Dhabi accounts for of the UAE s total area square kilometres sq mi The smallest emirate Ajman encompasses only km sq mi br The UAE coast stretches for nearly km mi along the southern shore of the Persian Gulf briefly interrupted by an isolated outcrop of the Sultanate of Oman Six of the emirates are situated along the Persian Gulf and the seventh Fujairah is on the eastern coast of the peninsula with direct access to the Gulf of Oman Most of the coast consists of salt pans that extend km mi inland The largest natural harbor is at Dubai although other ports have been dredged at Abu Dhabi Sharjah and elsewhere Numerous islands are found in the Persian Gulf and the ownership of some of them has been the subject of international disputes with both Iran and Qatar The smaller islands as well as many coral reefs and shifting sandbars are a menace to navigation Strong tides and occasional windstorms further complicate ship movements near the shore The UAE also has a stretch of the Al B inah coast of the Gulf of Oman The Musandam Peninsula the very tip of Arabia by the Strait of Hormuz and Madha are exclaves of Oman separated by the UAE br br South and west of Abu Dhabi vast rolling sand dunes merge into the Rub al Khali Empty Quarter of Saudi Arabia The desert area of Abu Dhabi includes two important oases with adequate underground water for permanent settlements and cultivation The extensive Liwa Oasis is in the south near the undefined border with Saudi Arabia About km mi to the northeast of Liwa is the Al Buraimi oasis which extends on both sides of the Abu Dhabi Oman border Lake Zakher in Al Ain is a human made lake near the border with Oman that was created from treated waste water br Prior to withdrawing from the area in Britain delineated the internal borders among the seven emirates in order to preempt territorial disputes that might hamper formation of the federation In general the rulers of the emirates accepted the British interventions but in the case of boundary disputes between Abu Dhabi and Dubai and also between Dubai and Sharjah conflicting claims were not resolved until after the UAE became independent The most complicated borders were in the Western Hajar Mountains where five of the emirates contested jurisdiction over more than a dozen enclaves br br br Biodiversity br br The UAE contains the following terrestrial ecoregions Al Hajar montane woodlands and shrublands Gulf of Oman desert and semi desert and Al Hajar foothill xeric woodlands and shrublands br The oases grow date palms acacia and eucalyptus trees In the desert the flora is very sparse and consists of grasses and thorn bushes The indigenous fauna had come close to extinction because of intensive hunting which has led to a conservation program on Sir Bani Yas Island initiated by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan in the s resulting in the survival of for example Arabian Oryx Arabian camel and leopards Coastal fish and mammals consist mainly of mackerel perch and tuna as well as sharks and whales br br br Climate br The climate of the UAE is subtropical arid with hot summers and warm winters The climate is categorized as desert climate The hottest months are July and August when average maximum temperatures reach above C F on the coastal plain In the Hajar Mountains temperatures are considerably lower a result of increased elevation Average minimum temperatures in January and February are between and C and F During the late summer months a humid southeastern wind known as Sharqi i e Easterner makes the coastal region especially unpleasant The average annual rainfall in the coastal area is less than mm in but in some mountainous areas annual rainfall often reaches mm in Rain in the coastal region falls in short torrential bursts during the winter months sometimes resulting in floods in ordinarily dry wadi beds The region is prone to occasional violent dust storms which can severely reduce visibility br On December snow was recorded in the UAE for the first time in the Jebel Jais mountain cluster in Ras al Khaimah A few years later there were more sightings of snow and hail The Jebel Jais mountain cluster has experienced snow only twice since records began br br br Government and politics br br The United Arab Emirates is an authoritarian federal monarchy According to the New York Times the UAE is an autocracy with the sheen of a progressive modern state The UAE has been described as a tribal autocracy where the seven constituent monarchies are led by tribal rulers in an autocratic fashion There are no democratically elected institutions and there is no formal commitment to free speech According to human rights organisations there are systematic human rights violations including the torture and forced disappearance of government critics The UAE ranks poorly in freedom indices measuring civil liberties and political rights The UAE is annually ranked as Not Free in Freedom House s annual Freedom in the World report which measures civil liberties and political rights The UAE also ranks poorly in the annual Reporters without Borders Press Freedom Index The Bertelsmann Transformation Index describes the UAE as a moderate monarchy The country was ranked out of states and is

government are reserved to the individual emirate A percentage of revenues from each emirate is allocated to the UAE s central budget br The UAE uses the title Sheikh instead of Emir to refer to the rulers of individual emirates The title is used due to the sheikhdom styled governing system in adherence to the culture of tribes of Arabia where Sheikh means leader elder or the tribal chief of the clan who partakes in shared decision making with his followers The president and vice president are elected by the Federal Supreme Council Usually the Head of the Al Nahyan family who are based in Abu
