title: File size
id: 2608327
File size is a measure of how much data a computer file contains or alternately how much storage it consumes Typically file size is expressed in units of measurement based on the byte By convention file size units use either a metric prefix as in megabyte and gigabyte or a binary prefix as in mebibyte and gibibyte br When a file is written to a file system which is the case in most modern devices it may consume slightly more disk space than the file requires This is because the file system rounds the size up to include any unused space left over in the last block used by the file A sector is the smallest amount of space addressable by the file system The size of a disk sector ranges from several hundred to several thousand bytes A file system block is one or more sectors in size The unused space is called slack space or internal fragmentation Although smaller sector sizes allow for denser use of disk space they decrease the operational efficiency of the file system br br br Maximum size br br The maximum file size a file system supports depends not only on the capacity of the file system but also on the number of bits reserved for the storage of file size information The maximum file size in the FAT file system for example is bytes which is one byte less than four gigabytes The table below details the maximum file size for a number of common or historical file systems br br br Units of information br br Bytes are the typical base unit of information Larger files will typically have their sizes expressed using kilobyte megabyte or gigabyte depending upon how large the file is While these larger units are not as accurate as the byte size most operating systems will expose the true byte size of a file by inspecting the file properties directly Command line tools can also expose the exact byte size as well br A file system may display all sizes with the metric system with only kB on small files indicating it while some file systems operating systems would display sizes in the traditionally used on computers binary system for all sizes e g KB while hard disk manufacturers use the metric system for e g GB bytes and TB GB br Kilobyte KB JEDEC is sometimes referred to unambiguously as kibibyte KiB IEC Sometimes kB with lower cased SI prefix k for kilo is used then always equaling bytes br File transfers e g downloads may use rates of units of bytes e g MB s in binary rather than metric system while networking hardware such as WiFi always uses the metric system Mbit s Gbit s etc of units of bits and it needs to send more than the files themselves so some overhead needs to be factored in making superficially similar terms very incompatible br br br See also br Units of information br Metric prefix br br br Notes br br br
