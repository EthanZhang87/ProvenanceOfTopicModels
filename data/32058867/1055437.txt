In cryptography and steganography plausibly deniable encryption describes encryption techniques where the existence of an encrypted file or message is deniable in the sense that an adversary cannot prove that the plaintext data exists br The users may convincingly deny that a given piece of data is encrypted or that they are able to decrypt a given piece of encrypted data or that some specific encrypted data exists Such denials may or may not be genuine For example it may be impossible to prove that the data is encrypted without the cooperation of the users If the data is encrypted the users genuinely may not be able to decrypt it Deniable encryption serves to undermine an attacker s confidence either that data is encrypted or that the person in possession of it can decrypt it and provide the associated plaintext br In their pivotal paper Ran Canetti Cynthia Dwork Moni Naor and Rafail Ostrovsky introduced the concept of deniable encryption a cryptographic breakthrough that ensures privacy even under coercion This concept allows encrypted communication participants to plausibly deny the true content of their messages Their work lays the foundational principles of deniable encryption illustrating its critical role in protecting privacy against forced disclosures This research has become a cornerstone for future advancements in cryptography emphasizing the importance of deniable encryption in maintaining communication security The notion of was used by Julian Assange and Ralf Weinmann in the Rubberhose filesystem br br br Function br Deniable encryption makes it impossible to prove the origin or existence of the plaintext message without the proper decryption key This may be done by allowing an encrypted message to be decrypted to different sensible plaintexts depending on the key used This allows the sender to have plausible deniability if compelled to give up their encryption key br br br Scenario br In some jurisdictions statutes assume that human operators have access to such things as encryption keys An example is the United Kingdom s Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act which makes it a crime not to surrender encryption keys on demand from a government official authorized by the act According to the Home Office the burden of proof that an accused person is in possession of a key rests on the prosecution moreover the act contains a defense for operators who have lost or forgotten a key and they are not liable if they are judged to have done what they can to recover a key br In cryptography rubber hose cryptanalysis is a euphemism for the extraction of cryptographic secrets e g the password to an encrypted file from a person by coercion or torture such as beating that person with a rubber hose hence the name in contrast to a mathematical or technical cryptanalytic attack br br An early use of the term was on the sci crypt newsgroup in a message posted October by Marcus J Ranum alluding to corporal punishment the rubber hose technique of cryptanalysis in which a rubber hose is applied forcefully and frequently to the soles of the feet until the key to the cryptosystem is discovered a process that can take a surprisingly short time and is quite computationally inexpensive Deniable encryption allows the sender of an encrypted message to deny sending that message This requires a trusted third party A possible scenario works like this br Bob suspects his wife Alice is engaged in adultery That being the case Alice wants to communicate with her secret lover Carl She creates two keys one intended to be kept secret the other intended to be sacrificed She passes the secret key or both to Carl br Alice constructs an innocuous message M for Carl intended to be revealed to Bob in case of discovery and an incriminating love letter M to Carl She constructs a cipher text C out of both messages M and M and emails it to Carl br Carl uses his key to decrypt M and possibly M in order to read the fake message too br Bob finds out about the email to Carl becomes suspicious and forces Alice to decrypt the message br Alice uses the sacrificial key and reveals the innocuous message M to Bob Since it is impossible for Bob to know for sure that there might be other messages contained in C he might assume that there are no other messages br Another scenario involves Alice sending the same ciphertext some secret instructions to Bob and Carl to whom she has handed different keys Bob and Carl are to receive different instructions and must not be able to read each other s instructions Bob will receive the message first and then forward it to Carl br br Alice constructs the ciphertext out of both messages M and M and emails it to Bob br Bob uses his key to decrypt M and isn t able to read M br Bob forwards the ciphertext to Carl br Carl uses his key to decrypt M and isn t able to read M br br br Forms of deniable encryption br Normally ciphertexts decrypt to a single plaintext that is intended to be kept secret However one form of deniable encryption allows its users to decrypt the ciphertext to produce a different innocuous but plausible plaintext and plausibly claim that it is what they encrypted The holder of the ciphertext will not be able to differentiate between the true plaintext and the bogus claim plaintext In general one ciphertext cannot be decrypted to all possible plaintexts unless the key is as large as the plaintext so it is not practical in most cases for a ciphertext to reveal no information whatsoever about its plaintext However some schemes allow decryption to decoy plaintexts that are close to the original in some metric such as edit distance br Modern deniable encryption techniques exploit the fact that without the key it is infeasible to distinguish between ciphertext from block ciphers and data generated by a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator the cipher s pseudorandom permutation properties br This is used in combination with some decoy data that the user would plausibly want to keep confidential that will be revealed to the attacker claiming that this is all there is This is a form of steganography br If the user does not supply the correct key for the truly secret data decrypting it will result in apparently random data indistinguishable from not having stored any particular data there br br br Examples br br br Layers br One example of deniable encryption is a cryptographic filesystem that employs a concept of abstract layers where each layer can be decrypted with a different encryption key Additionally special chaff layers are filled with random data in order to have plausible deniability of the existence of real layers and their encryption keys The user can store decoy files on one or more layers while denying the existence of others claiming that the rest of space is taken up by chaff layers Physically these types of filesystems are typically stored in a single directory consisting of equal length files with filenames that are either randomized in case they belong to chaff layers or cryptographic hashes of strings identifying the blocks The timestamps of these files are always randomized Examples of this approach include Rubberhose filesystem br Rubberhose also known by its development codename Marutukku is a deniable encryption program which encrypts data on a storage device and hides the encrypted data The existence of the encrypted data can only be verified using the appropriate cryptographic key It was created by Julian Assange as a tool for human rights workers who needed to protect sensitive data in the field and was initially released in br The name Rubberhose is a joking reference to the cypherpunks term rubber hose cryptanalysis in which encryption keys are obtained by means of violence br It was written for Linux kernel NetBSD and FreeBSD in by Julian Assange Suelette Dreyfus and Ralf Weinmann The latest version available still in alpha stage is v br br br Container volumes br Another approach used by some conventional disk encryption software suites is creating a second encrypted volume within a container volume The container volume is first formatted by filling it with encrypted random data and then initializing a filesystem on it The user then fills some of the filesystem with legitimate but plausible looking decoy files that the user would seem to have an incentive to hide Next a new encrypted volume the hidden volume is allocated within the free space of the container filesystem which will be used for data the user actually wants to hide Since an adversary cannot differentiate between encrypted data and the random data used to initialize the outer volume this inner volume is now undetectable LibreCrypt and BestCrypt can have many hidden volumes in a container TrueCrypt is limited to one hidden volume br br br Other software br OpenPuff freeware semi open source steganography for MS Windows br LibreCrypt opensource transparent disk encryption for MS Windows and PocketPC PDAs that provides both deniable encryption and plausible deniability Offers an extensive range of encryption options and doesn t need to be installed before use as long as the user has administrator rights br Off the Record Messaging a cryptographic technique providing true deniability for instant messaging br StegFS the current successor to the ideas embodied by the Rubberhose and PhoneBookFS filesystems br VeraCrypt a successor to a discontinued TrueCrypt an on the fly disk encryption software for Windows Mac and Linux providing limited deniable encryption and to some extent due to limitations on the number of hidden volumes which can be created plausible deniability without needing to be installed before use as long as the user has full administrator rights br Vanish a research prototype implementation of self destructing data storage br br br Detection br The existence of hidden encrypted data may be revealed by flaws in the implementation It may also be revealed by a so called watermarking attack if an inappropriate cipher mode is used br The existence of the data may be revealed by it leaking into non encrypted disk space where it can be detected by forensic tools br Doubts have been raised about the level of plausible deniability in hidden volumes the contents of the outer container filesystem have to be frozen in its initial state to prevent the user from corrupting the hidden volume this can be detected from the access and modification timestamps which could raise suspicion This problem can be eliminated by instructing the system not to protect the hidden volume although this could result in lost data br br br Drawbacks br Possession of deniable encryption tools could lead attackers to continue torturing a user even after the user has revealed all their keys because the attackers could not know whether the user had revealed their last key or not However knowledge of this fact can disincentivize users from revealing any keys to begin with since they will never be able to prove to the attacker that they have revealed their last key br br br Deniable authentication br br Some in transit encrypted messaging suites such as Off the Record Messaging offer deniable authentication which gives the participants plausible deniability of their conversations While deniable authentication is not technically deniable encryption in that the encryption of the messages is not denied its deniability refers to the inability of an adversary to prove that the participants had a conversation or said anything in particular br This is achieved by the fact that all information necessary to forge messages is appended to the encrypted messages if an adversary is able to create digitally authentic messages in a conversation see hash based message authentication code HMAC they are also able to forge messages in the conversation This is used in conjunction with perfect forward secrecy to assure that the compromise of encryption keys of individual messages does not compromise additional conversations or messages br br br See also br Chaffing and winnowing
