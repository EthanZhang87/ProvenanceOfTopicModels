id: 33369891
iMessage is an instant messaging service developed by Apple Inc and launched in iMessage functions exclusively on Apple platforms including macOS iOS iPadOS and watchOS as part of Apple s approach to inter device integration which has been described by media outlets as a means of achieving vendor lock in iMessage is accessed and used using the Messages app client br Core features of iMessage available on all supported platforms include sending text messages images videos and documents getting delivery and read statuses read receipts and end to end encryption so only the sender and recipient can read the messages and no one else even Apple itself can t read them The service also allows sending location data and stickers On iOS and iPadOS third party developers can extend iMessage capabilities with custom extensions an example being quick sharing of recently played songs br Launched on iOS in iMessage arrived on macOS then called OS X in In Apple announced an entirely redesigned version of the macOS Messages app which adds some of the features previously unavailable on the Mac including location sharing and message effects br br br History br iMessage was announced by Scott Forstall at the WWDC keynote on June A version of the Messages app for iOS with support for iMessage was included in the iOS update on October On February Apple announced that a new Messages app replacing iChat would be part of OS X Mountain Lion Mountain Lion was released on July br On October Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that Apple device users have sent billion messages using iMessage and that Apple delivers an average of messages per second In February Eddy Cue announced that the number of iMessages sent per second had grown to br In May a lawsuit was filed against Apple over an issue where if a user switched from an Apple device to a non Apple device messages being delivered to them through iMessage would not reach their destination In November Apple addressed this problem by providing instructions and an online tool to deregister iMessage A federal court dismissed the suit in Apple s favor br On March a group of researchers from Johns Hopkins University published a report in which they demonstrated that an attacker in possession of iMessage ciphertexts could potentially decrypt photos and videos that had been sent via the service The researchers published their findings after the vulnerability had been patched by Apple br On June Apple announced the addition of Apps to iMessage service accessible via the Messages apps Apps can create and share content add stickers make payments and more within iMessage conversations without having to switch to standalone apps One could develop standalone iMessage apps or an extension to existing iOS apps Publishers can also create standalone stickers apps without writing any code According to Sensor Tower a data company that provides App Store Optimization ASO as of March the iMessage App Store features nearly Message enabled apps br At the WWDC keynote on June Apple previewed the next version of its macOS operating system planned for release in late Big Sur shipped with a redesigned version of Messages with features previously available only on iOS devices such as message effects memoji stickers and location sharing br On February Apple announced that they were going to upgrade the iMessage protocol with a new post quantum cryptographic PQC protocol called PQ br Apple stated that although quantum computers don t exist yet they wanted to mitigate risks from future quantum computers as well as so called Harvest now decrypt later attack scenarios Apple stated that they believe their PQ implementation provides protections that surpass those in all other widely deployed messaging apps br Furthermore because according to Apple there is no standard on security properties for messaging security levels that allow for easy comparison Apple decided to create their own definitions consisting of levels between and On this scale Apple considers its PQ protocol to reach what Apple calls Level security The main differentiator of PQ compared to other PQC protocols is that PQ utilizes ongoing keying Apple rolled out PQ with the public release of iOS iPadOS macOS and watchOS stating that iMessage conversations between devices that support PQ are automatically ramping up to the post quantum encryption protocol and that PQ will fully replace the existing protocol within all supported conversations in br br br Digital Markets Act European Union br br In iMessage was included on a list of potential gatekeeper services to be regulated by new legislation in the European Union This would have required iMessage to be interoperable with other messaging services that either serve a certain number of users or generates significant revenue In September the Financial Times reported based on two sources with direct knowledge on the matter that Apple appealed the inclusion of iMessage on the grounds that the iMessage userbase in Europe was not large enough to warrant labeling iMessage as a gatekeeper service In December several media outlets reported that the appeal was successful Bloomberg speculated that this tentative decision was reached because while iMessage s userbase is large enough to qualify the service is not popular enough with businesses specifically br This rumored tentative decision was later formalized on February when the European Commission announced that they had decided that together with Bing Edge and Microsoft Advertising iMessage does not qualify as gatekeeper services The European Commission didn t go into detail on their decision other than stating that it was the result of a thorough assessment of all arguments taking into account input by relevant stakeholders and after hearing the Digital Markets Advisory Committee Despite the lack of detail provided by the European Commission on their decision multiple outlets speculated that the decision was indeed based on iMessage not meeting the threshold necessary to be classified as a gatekeeper service as was reported in the prior year br This ultimately meant that Apple didn t have to make iMessage interoperable with other messaging services nor did Apple have to conform to the other DMA regulations insofar it pertained to iMessage br br br Features br iMessage allows users to send texts documents photos videos contact information and group messages over the Internet to other iOS or macOS users iMessage is an alternative to the SMS and MMS messaging for most users with devices running iOS or later The Send as SMS setting under Messages will cause the message to be sent via SMS if the sender does not have an active Internet connection If the receiver has no Internet connection the message should be stored on a server until a connection is restored br iMessage is accessible through the Messages app on an iPhone iPad or iPod Touch running iOS or later or on a Mac running OS X Mountain Lion or later Owners of these devices can register one or more email addresses with Apple Additionally iPhone owners can register their phone numbers with Apple provided their carrier is supported When a message is sent to a mobile number Messages will check with Apple if the mobile number is set up for iMessage If it is not the message will seamlessly transition from iMessage to SMS br In Messages the user s sent communication is aligned to the right with replies from other people on the left A user can see if the other iMessage user is typing a message A pale gray ellipsis appears in the text bubble of the other user when a reply is started It is also possible to start a conversation on one iOS device and continue it on another On iPhones green buttons and text bubbles indicate SMS based communication on all iOS devices blue buttons and text bubbles indicate iMessage communication br All iMessages are encrypted and can be tracked using delivery receipts If the recipient enables Read Receipts the sender will be able to see when the recipient has read the message iMessage also allows users to set up chats with more than two people a group chat br With the launch of iOS users can send messages accompanied by a range of bubble or screen effects By holding down the send button with force the range of effects is surfaced for users to select from br With the launches of iOS and macOS Big Sur users gain a myriad of features such as the ability to pin individual conversations mention other users set an image for group conversations and send inline replies Additionally more of the features from the Messages app on iOS and iPadOS were ported over to their macOS counterpart br With the launch of iOS Apple added automated blurring of photos containing explicit images that are sent to underage users The feature relies on scanning the photos on the device and can optionally be set to alert the underage user s parents if explicit material is received The feature was originally launched only for the US with a later expansion to the UK Canada Australia and New Zealand The feature remains regionally restricted for the rest of the world br With the launch of iOS Apple added the ability for users to edit and unsend sent iMessages Users can unsend an iMessage for up to minutes after it being sent and can edit it for up to minutes Users also have the ability to recover deleted messages for up to days br br br Technology br The iMessage protocol is based on the Apple Push Notification service APNs a proprietary binary protocol It sets up a Keep Alive connection with the Apple servers Every connection has its own unique code which acts as an identifier for the route that should be used to send a message to a specific device The connection is encrypted with TLS using a client side certificate that is requested by the device on the activation of iMessage br Each message recipient s public keys are retrieved from Apple Identity Service IDS Apple s directory of iMessage public keys Apple Push Notification service APNs addresses and phone numbers and email addresses that are used to look up the keys and device addresses Each message is individually encrypted for each recipient device in a conversation Message attachments are encrypted and uploaded to iCloud to be retrieved separately by the recipient Messages are stored on Apple servers for up to days br br br Platforms br iMessage is only officially available on Apple operating systems such as iOS iPadOS macOS and watchOS Unlike some other messaging apps it does not support Android or Microsoft Windows and does not have any web access interface br On May an independent open source project named PieMessage was announced by app developer Eric Chee consisting of code for OS X that communicates with iMessage and connects to an Android client allowing the Android client to send and receive messages br On December an independent app called Beeper Mini which used reverse engineering of the iMessage protocol was released for Android It quickly reached the top five free communications apps on Google Play and became the fastest growing paid Android app in history gaining more than downloads in the first hours A few days after the launch it was briefly shut down by Apple but resumed operations again Amy Klobuchar and Mike Lee who lead the Senate s antitrust committee wrote a letter to the Department of Justice expressing concern that Apple was not allowing competition The developers of Beeper Mini restored the service again which was soon shut down again by Apple Ultimately the creators of Beeper Mini gave up on bypassing Apple s attempts to shut down the service so they stopped trying to reverse engineer iMessage br br br Reception br On November Chetan Sharma a technology and strategy consulting firm published the US Mobile Data Market Update Q noting the decline of text messaging in the United States and suggested the decline may be attributed to Americans using alternative free messaging services such as iMessage br In Google announced they would compete with iMessage with their own messaging service Messages formerly Android Messages br br br Security and privacy br On November the Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF listed iMessage on its Secure Messaging Scorecard giving it a score of out of points It received points for having communications encrypted in transit having communications encrypted with keys the provider doesn t have access to end to end encryption having past communications secure if the keys are stolen forward secrecy having their security designs well documented and having a recent independent security audit It missed points because users can not verify contacts identities and because the source code is not open to independent review In September Matthew Green noted that because iMessage does not display key fingerprints for out of band verification users are unable to verify that a man in the middle attack has not occurred The post also noted that iMessage uses RSA key exchange This means that as opposed to what EFF s scorecard claims iMessage does not feature forward secrecy br On August researchers from Project Zero presented interaction less exploits in iMessage that could be used to take over control of a user s device These six exploits have been fixed in iOS released on July however there are still some undisclosed exploits which will be patched in a future update Project Pegasus revelations in July found the software used iMessage exploits br In an FBI document obtained by Property of the People Inc a c nonprofit organization through an FOIA request reveals that WhatsApp and iMessage are vulnerable to law enforcement real time searches Reuters also reported that Apple had plans to encrypt iCloud backups of iMessage data but dropped those plans after the FBI complained br Eric Migicovsky founder of third party iMessage client Beeper Mini has criticized Apple for preventing iMessage access on Android phones Migicovsky argues that it is hypocritical of Apple to claim iMessage is private and secure while simultaneously allowing only SMS messages when communicating with users on non Apple devices such as Android even when alternatives exist Apple has implied that third party applications like Beeper Mini are less secure because techniques posed significant risks to user security and privacy including the potential for metadata exposure and enabling unwanted messages spam and phishing attacks All four of the security and privacy risks suggested by Apple s statement also apply to SMS which iMessage uses for fallback when communicating with non iMessage users Apple has long resisted bringing iMessage to non Apple devices with CEO Tim Cook previously offering the solution of buy your mom an iPhone when questioned at Code Conference about a better way to message with family that uses Android Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren commented on the conflict between Beeper Mini and Apple tweeting Green bubble texts are less secure So why would Apple block a new app allowing Android users to chat with iPhone users on iMessage Big Tech executives are protecting profits by squashing competitors Chatting between different platforms should be easy and secure br br br Anti SMS MMS user sentiment br According to a survey from Piper Sandler from Fall of teenagers in America have iPhones Claims have been made that the app s use of different colors for messages using iMessage s protocol vs SMS fallback has contributed to social exclusion among some teens br On November Apple announced Rich Communication Services RCS support coming to iOS the following year to work as a fallback when iMessage is not available and the other user is also using RCS although they followed up by confirming that the RCS messages will remain green After the news broke Google revealed that they will be working alongside Apple to implement RCS onto iOS and iMessage br br br See also br FaceTime Apple s videotelephony service which also uses APNs br Messages the required client to use iMessage on Apple s devices br br br br br br Further
