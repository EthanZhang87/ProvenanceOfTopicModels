Autocrypt is a cryptographic protocol for email clients aiming to simplify key exchange and enabling encryption Version of the Autocrypt specification was released in December and makes no attempt to protect against MITM attacks It is implemented on top of OpenPGP replacing its complex key management by fully automated exchange of cryptographic keys between peers br br br Method br Autocrypt capable email clients transparently negotiate encryption capabilities and preferences and exchange keys between users alongside sending regular emails This is done by including the key material and encryption preferences in the header of each email which allows encrypting any message to a contact who has previously sent the user email This information is not signed or verified in any way even if the actual message is encrypted and verified br No support is required from email providers other than preserving and not manipulating the Autocrypt specific header fields br When a message is encrypted to a group of receivers keys are also automatically sent to all receivers in this group This ensures that a reply to a message can be encrypted without any further complications or work by the user br br br Security model br Autocrypt is guided by the idea of opportunistic security from RFC but implementing something much less secure than a trust on first use TOFU model Encryption of messages between Autocrypt capable clients can be enabled without further need of user interaction Traditional OpenPGP applications should display a noticeable warning if keys are not verified either manually or by a web of trust method before use In contrast Autocrypt completely resigns on any kind of key verification Key exchange is during the initial handshake and valid or invalid keys of peers may be replaced anytime later without any user interaction or verification This makes it very easy to exchange new key s if a user loses access to the key but also makes the protocol much more susceptible to man in the middle attacks than clean TOFU The underlying OpenPGP implementation makes it often possible for the user to perform manual out of band key verification however by design users are never alerted if Autocrypt changed the keys of peers br Autocrypt tries to maximize the possible opportunities for encryption but is not aggressive about encrypting messages at all possible opportunities Instead encryption is only enabled by default if all communicating parties consent allowing users to make themselves available for encrypted communication without getting in the way of their established workflows br Man in the middle attacks are not preventable in this security model which is controversial br Any attacker who can send emails with forged sender address can cause encryption keys to be replaced by keys of his choice and or deliberately turn off encryption br br br Technical details br Autocrypt uses the established OpenPGP specification as its underlying data format Messages are encrypted using AES and RSA keys with a recommended RSA key length of bits These mechanisms are chosen for maximum compatibility with existing OpenPGP implementations There are plans for moving to smaller Elliptic curve keys when support is more widely available br The Autocrypt header field features a tag value format common to several mechanisms for example dkim where the keydata tag contains the public key It is similar to an armored key export except that it misses the BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK and END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK lines br For example br br br Support br Kontact since version br Delta Chat messenger from Version br K Mail Android mail app has support since Version reportedly broken until version br SnappyMail webmail from Version br Thunderbird partially supports AutoCrypt since version Thunderbird generates sends and receives AutoCrypt headers but does not automatically install received public keys User action is still required to approve and install a sender s public key br The German email provider Posteo supports AutoCrypt and improves its security by also cryptographically signing outbound Autocrypt header data via DKIM br No
