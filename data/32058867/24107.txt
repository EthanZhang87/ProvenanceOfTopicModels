Peer to peer P P computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers Peers are equally privileged equipotent participants in the network forming a peer to peer network of nodes In addition a personal area network PAN is also in nature a type of decentralized peer to peer network typically between two devices br br Peers make a portion of their resources such as processing power disk storage or network bandwidth directly available to other network participants without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts Peers are both suppliers and consumers of resources in contrast to the traditional client server model in which the consumption and supply of resources are divided br While P P systems had previously been used in many application domains the architecture was popularized by the Internet file sharing system Napster originally released in P P is used in many protocols such as BitTorrent file sharing over the Internet and in personal networks like Miracast displaying and Bluetooth radio The concept has inspired new structures and philosophies in many areas of human interaction In such social contexts peer to peer as a meme refers to the egalitarian social networking that has emerged throughout society enabled by Internet technologies in general br br br Development br br While P P systems had previously been used in many application domains the concept was popularized by file sharing systems such as the music sharing application Napster The peer to peer movement allowed millions of Internet users to connect directly forming groups and collaborating to become user created search engines virtual supercomputers and filesystems The basic concept of peer to peer computing was envisioned in earlier software systems and networking discussions reaching back to principles stated in the first Request for Comments RFC br Tim Berners Lee s vision for the World Wide Web was close to a P P network in that it assumed each user of the web would be an active editor and contributor creating and linking content to form an interlinked web of links The early Internet was more open than the present day where two machines connected to the Internet could send packets to each other without firewalls and other security measures This contrasts with the broadcasting like structure of the web as it has developed over the years As a precursor to the Internet ARPANET was a successful peer to peer network where every participating node could request and serve content However ARPANET was not self organized and it could not provide any means for context or content based routing beyond simple address based routing br Therefore Usenet a distributed messaging system that is often described as an early peer to peer architecture was established It was developed in as a system that enforces a decentralized model of control The basic model is a client server model from the user or client perspective that offers a self organizing approach to newsgroup servers However news servers communicate with one another as peers to propagate Usenet news articles over the entire group of network servers The same consideration applies to SMTP email in the sense that the core email relaying network of mail transfer agents has a peer to peer character while the periphery of Email clients and their direct connections is strictly a client server relationship br In May with millions more people on the Internet Shawn Fanning introduced the music and file sharing application called Napster Napster was the beginning of peer to peer networks as we know them today where participating users establish a virtual network entirely independent from the physical network without having to obey any administrative authorities or restrictions br br br Architecture br A peer to peer network is designed around the notion of equal peer nodes simultaneously functioning as both clients and servers to the other nodes on the network This model of network arrangement differs from the client server model where communication is usually to and from a central server A typical example of a file transfer that uses the client server model is the File Transfer Protocol FTP service in which the client and server programs are distinct the clients initiate the transfer and the servers satisfy these requests br br br Routing and resource discovery br Peer to peer networks generally implement some form of virtual overlay network on top of the physical network topology where the nodes in the overlay form a subset of the nodes in the physical network Data is still exchanged directly over the underlying TCP IP network but at the application layer peers can communicate with each other directly via the logical overlay links each of which corresponds to a path through the underlying physical network Overlays are used for indexing and peer discovery and make the P P system independent from the physical network topology Based on how the nodes are linked to each other within the overlay network and how resources are indexed and located we can classify networks as unstructured or structured or as a hybrid between the two br br br Unstructured networks br br Unstructured peer to peer networks do not impose a particular structure on the overlay network by design but rather are formed by nodes that randomly form connections to each other Gnutella Gossip and Kazaa are examples of unstructured P P protocols br Because there is no structure globally imposed upon them unstructured networks are easy to build and allow for localized optimizations to different regions of the overlay Also because the role of all peers in the network is the same unstructured networks are highly robust in the face of high rates of churn that is when large numbers of peers are frequently joining and leaving the network br However the primary limitations of unstructured networks also arise from this lack of structure In particular when a peer wants to find a desired piece of data in the network the search query must be flooded through the network to find as many peers as possible that share the data Flooding causes a very high amount of signaling traffic in the network uses more CPU memory by requiring every peer to process all search queries and does not ensure that search queries will always be resolved Furthermore since there is no correlation between a peer and the content managed by it there is no guarantee that flooding will find a peer that has the desired data Popular content is likely to be available at several peers and any peer searching for it is likely to find the same thing But if a peer is looking for rare data shared by only a few other peers then it is highly unlikely that the search will be successful br br br Structured networks br br In structured peer to peer networks the overlay is organized into a specific topology and the protocol ensures that any node can efficiently search the network for a file resource even if the resource is extremely rare br The most common type of structured P P networks implement a distributed hash table DHT in which a variant of consistent hashing is used to assign ownership of each file to a particular peer This enables peers to search for resources on the network using a hash table that is key value pairs are stored in the DHT and any participating node can efficiently retrieve the value associated with a given key br br However in order to route traffic efficiently through the network nodes in a structured overlay must maintain lists of neighbors that satisfy specific criteria This makes them less robust in networks with a high rate of churn i e with large numbers of nodes frequently joining and leaving the network More recent evaluation of P P resource discovery solutions under real workloads have pointed out several issues in DHT based solutions such as high cost of advertising discovering resources and static and dynamic load imbalance br Notable distributed networks that use DHTs include Tixati an alternative to BitTorrent s distributed tracker the Kad network the Storm botnet and the YaCy Some prominent research projects include the Chord project Kademlia PAST storage utility P Grid a self organized and emerging overlay network and CoopNet content distribution system DHT based networks have also been widely utilized for accomplishing efficient resource discovery for grid computing systems as it aids in resource management and scheduling of applications br br br Hybrid models br Hybrid models are a combination of peer to peer and client server models A common hybrid model is to have a central server that helps peers find each other Spotify was an example of a hybrid model until There are a variety of hybrid models all of which make trade offs between the centralized functionality provided by a structured server client network and the node equality afforded by the pure peer to peer unstructured networks Currently hybrid models have better performance than either pure unstructured networks or pure structured networks because certain functions such as searching do require a centralized functionality but benefit from the decentralized aggregation of nodes provided by unstructured networks br br br CoopNet content distribution system br CoopNet Cooperative Networking was a proposed system for off loading serving to peers who have recently downloaded content proposed by computer scientists Venkata N Padmanabhan and Kunwadee Sripanidkulchai working at Microsoft Research and Carnegie Mellon University When a server experiences an increase in load it redirects incoming peers to other peers who have agreed to mirror the content thus off loading balance from the server All of the information is retained at the server This system makes use of the fact that the bottleneck is most likely in the outgoing bandwidth than the CPU hence its server centric design It assigns peers to other peers who are close in IP to its neighbors same prefix range in an attempt to use locality If multiple peers are found with the same file it designates that the node choose the fastest of its neighbors Streaming media is transmitted by having clients cache the previous stream and then transmit it piece wise to new nodes br br br Security and trust br Peer to peer systems pose unique challenges from a computer security perspective Like any other form of software P P applications can contain vulnerabilities What makes this particularly dangerous for P P software however is that peer to peer applications act as servers as well as clients meaning that they can be more vulnerable to remote exploits br br br Routing attacks br Since each node plays a role in routing traffic through the network malicious users can perform a variety of routing attacks or denial of service attacks Examples of common routing attacks include incorrect lookup routing whereby malicious nodes deliberately forward requests incorrectly or return false results incorrect routing updates where malicious nodes corrupt the routing tables of neighboring nodes by sending them false information and incorrect routing network partition where when new nodes are joining they bootstrap via a malicious node which places the new node in a partition of the network that is populated by other malicious nodes br br br Corrupted data and malware br br The prevalence of malware varies between different peer to peer protocols Studies analyzing the spread of malware on P P networks found for example that of the answered download requests on the gnutella network contained some form of malware whereas only of the content on OpenFT contained malware In both cases the top three most common types of malware accounted for the large majority of cases in gnutella and in OpenFT Another study analyzing traffic on the Kazaa network found that of the file sample taken were infected by one or more of the different computer viruses that were tested for br Corrupted data can also be distributed on P P networks by modifying files that are already being shared on the network For example on the FastTrack network the RIAA managed to introduce faked chunks into downloads and downloaded files mostly MP files Files infected with the RIAA virus were unusable afterwards and contained malicious code The RIAA is also known to have uploaded fake music and movies to P P networks in order to deter illegal file sharing Consequently the P P networks of today have seen an enormous increase of their security and file verification mechanisms Modern hashing chunk verification and different encryption methods have made most networks resistant to almost any type of attack even when major parts of the respective network have been replaced by faked or nonfunctional hosts br br br Resilient and scalable computer networks br br The decentralized nature of P P networks increases robustness because it removes the single point of failure that can be inherent in a client server based system As nodes arrive and demand on the system increases the total capacity of the system also increases and the likelihood of failure decreases If one peer on the network fails to function properly the whole network is not compromised or damaged In contrast in a typical client server architecture clients share only their demands with the system but not their resources In this case as more clients join the system fewer resources are available to serve each client and if the central server fails the entire network is taken down br br br Distributed storage and search br br There are both advantages and disadvantages in P P networks related to the topic of data backup recovery and availability In a centralized network the system administrators are the only forces controlling the availability of files being shared If the administrators decide to no longer distribute a file they simply have to remove it from their servers and it will no longer be available to users Along with leaving the users powerless in deciding what is distributed throughout the community this makes the entire system vulnerable to threats and requests from the government and other large forces br For example YouTube has been pressured by the RIAA MPAA and entertainment industry to filter out copyrighted content Although server client networks are able to monitor and manage content availability they can have more stability in the availability of the content they choose to host A client should not have trouble accessing obscure content that is being shared on a stable centralized network P P networks however are more unreliable in sharing unpopular files because sharing files in a P P network requires that at least one node in the network has the requested data and that node must be able to connect to the node requesting the data This requirement is occasionally hard to meet because users may delete or stop sharing data at any point br In a P P network the community of users is entirely responsible for deciding which content is available Unpopular files eventually disappear and become unavailable as fewer people share them Popular files however are highly and easily distributed Popular files on a P P network are more stable and available than files on central networks In a centralized network a simple loss of connection between the server and clients can cause a failure but in P P networks the connections between every node must be lost to cause a data sharing failure In a centralized system the administrators are responsible for all data recovery and backups while in P P systems each node requires its backup system Because of the lack of central authority in P P networks forces such as the recording industry RIAA MPAA and the government are unable to delete or stop the sharing of content on P P systems br br br Applications br br br Content delivery br In P P networks clients both provide and use resources This means that unlike client server systems the content serving capacity of peer to peer networks can actually increase as more users begin to access the content especially with protocols such as Bittorrent that require users to share refer a performance measurement study This property is one of the major advantages of using P P networks because it makes the setup and running costs very small for the original content distributor br br br File sharing networks br Many peer to peer file sharing networks such as Gnutella G and the eDonkey network popularized peer to peer technologies br br Peer to peer content delivery networks br Peer to peer content services e g caches for improved performance such as Correli Caches br Software publication and distribution Linux distribution several games via file sharing networks br br br Copyright infringements br Peer to peer networking involves data transfer from one user to another without using an intermediate server Companies developing P P applications have been involved in numerous legal cases primarily in the United States over conflicts with copyright law Two major cases are Grokster vs RIAA and MGM Studios Inc v Grokster Ltd In the last case the Court unanimously held that defendant peer to peer file sharing companies Grokster and Streamcast could be sued for inducing copyright infringement br br br Multimedia br The P PTV and PDTP protocols br Some proprietary multimedia applications use a peer to peer network along with streaming servers to stream audio and video to their clients br Peercasting for multicasting streams br Pennsylvania State University MIT and Simon Fraser University are carrying on a project called LionShare designed for facilitating file sharing among educational institutions globally br Osiris is a program that allows its users to create anonymous and autonomous web portals distributed via P P network br br br Other P P applications br br Dat a distributed version controlled publishing platform br I P an overlay network used to browse the Internet anonymously br Unlike the related I P the Tor network is not itself peer to peer however it can enable peer to peer applications to be built on top of it via onion services br The InterPlanetary File System IPFS is a protocol and network designed to create a content addressable peer to peer method of storing and sharing hypermedia distribution protocol Nodes in the IPFS network form a distributed file system br

Garden connection sharing application that shares Internet access with other devices using Wi Fi or Bluetooth br Resilio Sync a directory syncing app br Research like the Chord project the PAST storage utility the P Grid and the CoopNet content distribution system br Secure Scuttlebutt a peer to peer gossip protocol capable of supporting many different types of applications primarily social networking br Syncthing a directory syncing app br Tradepal and M commerce applications that power real time marketplaces br The U S Department of Defense is conducting research on P P networks as part of its modern network warfare strategy In May Anthony Tether then director of DARPA testified that the United States military uses P P networks br WebTorrent is a P P streaming torrent client in JavaScript for use in web browsers as well as in the WebTorrent Desktop stand alone version that bridges WebTorrent and BitTorrent serverless networks br Microsoft in Windows uses a proprietary peer to peer technology called Delivery Optimization to deploy operating system updates using end users PCs either on the local network or other PCs According to Microsoft s Channel it led to a reduction in Internet bandwidth usage br Artisoft s LANtastic was built as a peer to peer operating system Machines can be both servers and workstations at the same time br Hotline Communications Hotline Client was built as decentralized servers with tracker software dedicated to any type of files and still operates today br Cryptocurrencies are peer to peer based digital currencies which use blockchains br List of cryptocurrencies br List of blockchains br br br Social implications br br br Incentivizing resource sharing and cooperation br br Cooperation among a community of participants is key to the continued success of P P systems aimed at casual human users these reach their full potential only when large numbers of nodes contribute resources But in current practice P P networks often contain large numbers of users who utilize resources shared by other nodes but who do not share anything themselves often referred to as the freeloader problem br Freeloading can have a profound impact on the network and in some cases can cause the community to collapse In these types of networks users have natural disincentives to cooperate because cooperation consumes their own resources and may degrade their own performance Studying the social attributes of P P networks is challenging due to large populations of turnover asymmetry of interest and zero cost identity A variety of incentive mechanisms have been implemented to encourage or even force nodes to contribute resources br Some researchers have explored the benefits of enabling virtual communities to self organize and introduce incentives for resource sharing and cooperation arguing that the social aspect missing from today s P P systems should be seen both as a goal and a means for self organized virtual communities to be built and fostered Ongoing research efforts for designing effective incentive mechanisms in P P systems based on principles from game theory are beginning to take on a more psychological and information processing direction br br br Privacy and anonymity br Some peer to peer networks e g Freenet place a heavy emphasis on privacy and anonymity that is ensuring that the contents of communications are hidden from eavesdroppers and that the identities locations of the participants are concealed Public key cryptography can be used to provide encryption data validation authorization and authentication for data messages Onion routing and other mix network protocols e g Tarzan can be used to provide anonymity br Perpetrators of live streaming sexual abuse and other cybercrimes have used peer to peer platforms to carry out activities with anonymity br br br Political implications br br br Intellectual property law and illegal sharing br Although peer to peer networks can be used for legitimate purposes rights holders have targeted peer to peer over the involvement with sharing copyrighted material Peer to peer networking involves data transfer from one user to another without using an intermediate server Companies developing P P applications have been involved in numerous legal cases primarily in the United States primarily over issues surrounding copyright law Two major cases are Grokster vs RIAA and MGM Studios Inc v Grokster Ltd In both of the cases the file sharing technology was ruled to be legal as long as the developers had no ability to prevent the sharing of the copyrighted material br To establish criminal liability for the copyright infringement on peer to peer systems the government must prove that the defendant infringed a copyright willingly for the purpose of personal financial gain or commercial advantage Fair use exceptions allow limited use of copyrighted material to be downloaded without acquiring permission from the rights holders These documents are usually news reporting or under the lines of research and scholarly work Controversies have developed over the concern of illegitimate use of peer to peer networks regarding public safety and national security When a file is downloaded through a peer to peer network it is impossible to know who created the file or what users are connected to the network at a given time Trustworthiness of sources is a potential security threat that can be seen with peer to peer systems br A study ordered by the European Union found that illegal downloading may lead to an increase in overall video game sales because newer games charge for extra features or levels The paper concluded that piracy had a negative financial impact on movies music and literature The study relied on self reported data about game purchases and use of illegal download sites Pains were taken to remove effects of false and misremembered responses br br br Network neutrality br Peer to peer applications present one of the core issues in the network neutrality controversy Internet service providers ISPs have been known to throttle P P file sharing traffic due to its high bandwidth usage Compared to Web browsing e mail or many other uses of the internet where data is only transferred in short intervals and relative small quantities P P file sharing often consists of relatively heavy bandwidth usage due to ongoing file transfers and swarm network coordination packets In October Comcast one of the largest broadband Internet providers in the United States started blocking P P applications such as BitTorrent Their rationale was that P P is mostly used to share illegal content and their infrastructure is not designed for continuous high bandwidth traffic br Critics point out that P P networking has legitimate legal uses and that this is another way that large providers are trying to control use and content on the Internet and direct people towards a client server based application architecture The client server model provides financial barriers to entry to small publishers and individuals and can be less efficient for sharing large files As a reaction to this bandwidth throttling several P P applications started implementing protocol obfuscation such as the BitTorrent protocol encryption Techniques for achieving protocol obfuscation involves removing otherwise easily identifiable properties of protocols such as deterministic byte sequences and packet sizes by making the data look as if it were random The ISP s solution to the high bandwidth is P P caching where an ISP stores the part of files most accessed by P P clients in order to save access to the Internet br br br Current research br Researchers have used computer simulations to aid in understanding and evaluating the complex behaviors of individuals within the network Networking research often relies on simulation in order to test and evaluate new ideas An important requirement of this process is that results must be reproducible so that other researchers can replicate validate and extend existing work If the research cannot be reproduced then the opportunity for further research is hindered Even though new simulators continue to be released the research community tends towards only a handful of open source simulators The demand for features in simulators as shown by our criteria and survey is high Therefore the community should work together to get these features in open source software This would reduce the need for custom simulators and hence increase repeatability and reputability of experiments br Popular simulators that were widely used in the past are NS OMNeT SimPy NetLogo PlanetLab ProtoPeer QTM PeerSim ONE P PStrmSim PlanetSim GNUSim and Bharambe br Besides all the above stated facts there has also been work done on ns open source network simulators One research issue related to free rider detection and punishment has been explored
