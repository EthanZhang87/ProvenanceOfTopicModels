The company says that it deals with government clients only Pegasus spyware is classified as a weapon by Israel and any export of the technology must be approved by the government br According to

subsidiary of the Q Cyber Technologies group of companies Q Cyber Technologies is the name the NSO Group uses in Israel but the company goes by OSY Technologies in Luxembourg and in North America a subsidiary formerly known as Westbridge It has operated through various other companies around the world br br br Founding br NSO Group was founded in by Niv Karmi Omri Lavie and Shalev Hulio Hulio and Lavie were school friends who went into the technology start up sector during the mid s The pair founded a company CommuniTake which offered a tool that let cellphone tech support workers access the customers devices but necessitating that the customer grant permission to enable access After a European intelligence agency expressed interest in the product the pair realised they could instead develop a tool that could gain access to phones without user authorisation and market it to security and intelligence agencies Karmi who served in military intelligence and the Mossad was brought on board to help market the tool with the help of his contacts The first iteration of NSO s Pegasus spyware was finalised in br br br Operations br NSO Group has come to employ over personnel globally Almost all of NSO s research team is made up of former Israeli military intelligence personnel most of them having served in Israel s Military Intelligence Directorate and many of these in its Unit The company s most valuable staff are graduates of the military intelligence s highly selective advanced cyberweapons training programs NSO seeks to uncover a surfeit of zero day exploits in target devices to ensure smooth continuous access even as some of the security vulnerabilities exploited by NSO are inevitably discovered and patched with labs in the company s Herzliya headquarters featuring racks stacked with phones being tested against new exploits br br br Relationship with the Israeli state br Pegasus spyware is classified as a military export by Israel and its sale is controlled by the government According to The New York Times Israel s government has long seen Pegasus as a critical tool for its foreign policy and that it has treated NSO as a de facto arm of the state granting licenses for Pegasus to numerous countries with which the Israeli government hoped to nurture stronger security and diplomatic ties Israel has used the sale of NSO products as a diplomatic bargaining chip to advance its foreign policy interests as well as limiting its sale to or its use against certain states to maintain good relations with certain states Israel has faced criticism for approving the sale of NSO technologies to countries with poor human rights records U S intelligence officials have also said the Israeli state presumably has backdoor access to data obtained by Pegasus NSO denies being a tool of Israeli diplomacy and denies the presence of a backdoor in its spyware tools br Israel wary of angering the U S in the wake of the Snowden revelations required NSO to prevent Pegasus from targeting American phone numbers Israel has used Pegasus to advance its interests in the region with Pegasus playing a role in negotiating the Abraham Accords A New York Times investigation highlighted several instances in which the sale of Pegasus to a particular government coincided with that government s increased support of Israel Israel has used Pegasus sales in its diplomatic efforts to forge a united front against Iran thus clearing the sale of the spyware to Azerbaijan Morocco the UAE and Saudi Arabia br The Israeli government blocked the sale of Pegasus to Estonia and Ukraine for fear that Israel s relations with Russia would be damaged if the spyware was used against Russia Israel initially authorised the export of Pegasus to Estonia which made a million down payment to obtain the system but after a senior Russian official approached Israeli security agencies and informed them that Russia had learned of Estonia s attempts to obtain Pegasus the Israeli Ministry of Defense decided to disallow Estonia from using Pegasus against any Russian phone numbers following a heated debate on the issue among Israeli officials and subsequently blocked the sale br br br Corporate history br The company s start up funding came from a group of investors headed by Eddy Shalev a partner in venture capital fund Genesis Partners which invested a total of million for a stake br In NSO s annual revenues were around US million br In the U S based private equity firm Francisco Partners bought the company for million br In the surveillance firm Circles which produces is a phone geolocation tool was acquired by Francisco Partners for million and thus became a corporate affiliate of NSO s br In Francisco was seeking to sell the company for up to billion br Annual revenues were around million in br In June the company was put up for sale for more than billion by Francisco Partners roughly ten times what Francisco originally paid to acquire it in At the time it was put up for sale NSO had almost employees up from around in br On February Francisco Partners sold a majority stake of NSO back to co founders Shalev Hulio and Omri Lavie who were supported in the purchase by European private equity fund Novalpina Capital which specialises in investments in controversial companies Hulio and Lavie invested million with Novalpina acquiring the remaining portion of the majority stake thus valuing the company at approximately billion The day after the acquisition Novalpina attempted to address the concerns raised by Citizen Lab with a letter stating their belief that NSO operates with sufficient integrity and caution br In July investors in Novalpina Capital stripped Novalpina Capital of control over its assets including NSO after an unresolved personal dispute amongst the co founders of Novalpina Capital Berkeley Research Group BRG a California based consultancy firm was subsequently handed control over the assets including NSO br By the time of BRG s takeover NSO Group was in perilous financial straits having gone months without a new sale and in risk of missing its debt payments and its November payroll payments NSO CEO Shalev Hulio suggested to BRG that the company should improve its financial standing by starting to sell its products to high risk customers previously deemed unacceptable responding to objections by joking that missing debt payments was risky too BRG was categorically opposed to the suggestion despite acknowledging that selling to high risk customers was the only realistic way of maintaining NSO s business operations Hulio proposed increasing sales to Israel s western allies including U S law enforcement the most lucrative prospective market but the November U S blacklisting of NSO subsequently ended the company s prospects of breaking into the U S market Hulio then devised a plan to split up the company in order to circumvent the U S sanctions According to the Financial Times NSO also seemed to have been abandoned by the previously doting Israeli government due to a proliferation of Israeli companies offering comparable technologies including some established by former NSO employees In a court filing BRG described NSO as valueless to its private equity backers in December a group of NSO creditors described NSO as insolvent in a letter to NSO s majority shareholders br Two of the ousted co founders attempted to reclaim control over Novalpina Capital s assets by filing a lawsuit in Luxemburg with a U K court allowing the case to proceed to trial in April In an April letter BRG told an EU committee investigating abuse of NSO s products that NSO s management has not been forthcoming in providing information about its business operations including on the issue of the company s blacklisting in the U S br In the months after the November blacklisting of NSO by the U S Department of Commerce that resulted in an U S export ban for the company and amid a campaign by the Israeli government to find a way to prevent the floundering NSO from going under the U S Commerce Department sent a list of questions to NSO about how its spyware products operate In L Harris Technologies a U S military contractor with experience in the spyware technology sector was conducting talks on the possibility of acquiring NSO L Harris sought to acquire NSO s technology and code with the acquisition of the company s employees discussed as well L Harris executives travelled to Israel to conduct the talks which were not disclosed to the public L Harris reportedly told their NSO counterparts that they had the blessing and backing of the U S government and U S intelligence in pursuing the acquisition as long as the Pegasus source code and the cache of zero day vulnerabilities uncovered by NSO could be passed on to the other intelligence agencies of the Five Eyes The Israeli authorities were reportedly willing to fulfill the latter and reluctant to comply with the former and also insisted that Israel ultimately retain control over issuing export licences for NSO s products The Israeli authorities were also opposed to allowing L Harris employees to join NSO s development team in NSO s Israeli headquarters The talks were revealed to the public by the press in June resulting in a scramble by the parties involved with White House officials publicly condemning the negotiation in harsh terms and L Harris which is heavily reliant on government contracts reportedly notifying the U S government that they had abandoned the acquisition attempt There were reportedly attempts to revive the negotiations in the weeks after the preceding negotiations were revealed by the press An acquisition by a U S based corporation could have lifted the blacklisting of NSO by the U S which had barred NSO from receiving exports from U S companies hindering NSO s operations Experts consulted by The Guardian said that due to the blacklisting of NSO Group a new corporate entity would likely have had to be created before the U S government would allow the acquisition A senior White House official commented anonymously for the article that made the secret acquisition negotiations public stating that the White House had not been in any way involved in the deal further stating that the U S government opposes efforts by foreign companies to circumvent US export control measures or sanctions br In August Hulio stepped down from his post as CEO with the company s COO Yaron Shohat temporarily assuming the role until a full time replacement was to be named Hulio s resignation from his post as CEO came amid a restructuring of the company as it attempted to focus on pursuing clients among NATO member countries The reorganisation also entailed a downsizing NSO s workforce with employees out of a total of employees being let go br In March it was reported that Omrie Lavie had emerged in control of the company after multiple legal fights between NSO and a US financial firm called Treo which previously controlled the equity fund that held a majority stake in the Israeli firm br br br Foreign offices and export controls br In late Vice Media published an article in which it reported that NSO Group had closed the Cyprus based offices of Circles the company it had acquired in The article based on interviews with two former employees described the integration between the two companies as awful and stated that NSO would rely on Circles Bulgarian office instead According to Vice this came just over a year after an activist group known as Access Now wrote to authorities in both Cyprus and Bulgaria asking them to further scrutinise NSO exports Access now had stated that they had received denials from both the Bulgarian and Cypriot authorities with both countries stating that they had not provided export licenses to the NSO group Despite this an article written by The Guardian during the Pegasus scandal quoted NSO Group as saying that it had been regulated by the export control regimes of Israel Cyprus and Bulgaria NSO s own Transparency and Responsibility Report published about a month before the scandal makes the same statement adding that those were the three countries through which NSO exported its products Circles Bulgarian office in particular was stated to have been founded as a bogus phone company in by Citizen Lab citing IntelligenceOnline a part of Indigo Publications This report was reprinted by the Bulgarian investigation publication Bivol in December which appended it with public registry documents which indicated that the company s Bulgarian office had grown to employ up to people and had received two loans worth about million American dollars in from two offshore companies and a
