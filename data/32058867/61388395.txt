Oculus Rift CV also known simply as Oculus Rift is a virtual reality headset developed by Oculus VR a subsidiary of Meta Platforms known at the time as Facebook Inc It was announced in January and released in March the same year The device constituted the first commercial release in the Oculus Rift lineup br Production of the CV concluded in March being succeeded by the Oculus Rift S Facebook stated that it will continue to provide software support to the CV for the foreseeable future br br br History br After the DK and DK prototypes Oculus VR finally announced on May that the consumer version of the Rift would ship in the first quarter of with pre orders starting on January at am PST br On January the day before pre orders went live in an update posted to the original Kickstarter page it was announced that all Kickstarter backers who pledged for a Rift development kit would get a free Kickstarter Edition Oculus Rift br On January pre orders started at US At the same time the shipment date was announced for March On January shipping dates for new orders of the Rift were delayed until July due to the number of pre orders on day br On March the first batch of Oculus Rift headsets began shipping to consumers br In March at Game Developers Conference GDC Oculus lowered the price of the headset to US and lowered the price of the Oculus Touch motion controller accessory from to In July Oculus introduced a Rift Touch SKU at a price point to succeed the original headset only SKU br In March shortly before the Rift S was announced the original Rift started disappearing from physical third party stores making it available only via the official Facebook listing Then during the announcement it was said that the Rift S would replace the original Rift Shortly afterwards most sellers stopped replenishing their Rift stock br In March Oculus VR stated that they planned to support the original Rift with software updates for the foreseeable future br br br Hardware br br The CV is an improved version of the Crescent Bay Prototype featuring per eye displays running at Hz with a higher combined resolution than DK degree positional tracking integrated audio a vastly increased positional tracking volume and a heavy focus on consumer ergonomics and aesthetics br br br Displays br The device features two Pentile OLED displays resolution per eye a Hz refresh rate and a field of view The separation of the lenses is adjustable by a slider on the bottom of the device in order to accommodate a wide range of interpupillary distances The Fresnel lenses are not interchangeable however there are multiple facial interfaces so that the device can be positioned at different distances from the user s eyes This also allows for users wearing glasses to use the Rift as well as users with widely varying facial shapes br br br Audio br The Rift CV features integrated headphones that provide real time D audio effects This was developed from technology licensed from RealSpace D Audio by Visisonics The headphones are user replaceable with Oculus and other manufactures such as JBL providing aftermarket audio accessories The CV was struck by a design flaw by which the headphones lost sound on either side after a cable running through the headband at the back of the headset was severed from regular use In light of this issue Palmer Luckey announced a campaign by which he was meant to ship a free custom made solution for this flaw to affected users but the announcement never materialized br br br Constellation br br Constellation is the headset s rotational and positional tracking system used to track the position of the user s head as well as other VR devices with low latency and sub millimeter accuracy The system consists of external infrared tracking sensors that optically track specially designed VR devices This provides the Rift with full degree of freedom rotational and positional tracking br The Rift or any other device being tracked by the system is fitted with a series of precisely positioned infrared LEDs under or above the surface set to blink in a specific pattern By knowing the configuration of the LEDs on the objects and their pattern the system can determine the precise position of the device with sub millimeter accuracy and near zero latency The system then includes one or more USB stationary infrared sensors that originally come with a stand in a desk lamp form factor but standard screw holes allow for the stand to be removed and the sensor to be mounted anywhere the user sees fit The sensors normally sit on the user s desk creating a D space that allows the user to use the device while sitting standing walking or even jumping around the room br In its initial presentation before the Touch controllers were released the system was only used to track the head mounted display and a single sensor was included with the device which was sufficient there being no chance of the user s hands blocking the headset from it When the Touch controllers were released two sensor setups became the baseline in order to guarantee proper tracking of the headset and controllers For room scale virtual reality three or more sensors are required When the controllers were sold separately a second sensor was included Later the standard Rift bundle was updated to include the controllers and additional sensor Additional sensors placed behind the user allow for rotation without the sensors being occluded by the user them self Three and four sensor configurations become the standard for this scenario br br br Controllers br br As a result of a partnership with Microsoft early Oculus Rift units were bundled with an Xbox Wireless Controller and USB wireless adapter being what the majority of virtual reality games used at that point when motion controllers weren t available yet They also included the Oculus Remote a wireless remote that provides basic navigation functionality It has four directional inputs Enter and Back buttons volume up down and an Oculus button br On December Oculus released Oculus Touch a motion controller system which uses the Constellation sensors for positional tracking Touch was originally distributed as a standalone accessory in July Oculus replaced the original headset only SKU with a Rift Touch SKU that replaces the Xbox controller and Oculus Remote with Oculus Touch br br br Rift for Business br During Oculus Connect in June Oculus VR announced and released their Oculus Rift for Business bundle for US which included the Rift CV HMD Oculus Touch controllers three Constellation sensors an Oculus remote and three Rift Fits the name given to the piece that cushions the device onto the user s face The bundle also includes an expanded warranty
