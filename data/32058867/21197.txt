market br br br History br br br Early history br br br Origin as a playing card business br br Nintendo was founded as Nintendo Koppai on September by craftsman Fusajiro Yamauchi in Shimogy ku Kyoto Japan as an unincorporated establishment to produce and distribute Japanese playing cards or karuta from Portuguese carta card most notably hanafuda flower cards The name Nintendo is commonly assumed to mean leave luck to heaven but the assumption lacks historical validation it has also been suggested to mean the temple of free hanafuda but even descendants of Yamauchi do not know the true intended meaning of the name Hanafuda cards had become popular after Japan banned most forms of gambling in though tolerated hanafuda Sales of hanafuda cards were popular with the yakuza run gaming parlors in Kyoto Other card manufacturers had opted to leave the market not wanting to be associated with criminal ties but Yamauchi persisted without such fears to become the primary producer of hanafuda within a few years With the increase of the cards popularity Yamauchi hired assistants to mass produce to satisfy the demand Even with a favorable start the business faced financial struggle due to operating in a niche market the slow and expensive manufacturing process high product price alongside long durability of the cards which impacted sales due to the low replacement rate As a solution Nintendo produced a cheaper and lower quality line of playing cards Tengu while also conducting product offerings in other cities such as Osaka where card game profits were high In addition local merchants were interested in the prospect of a continuous renewal of decks thus avoiding the suspicions that reusing cards would generate br According to Nintendo the business first western style card deck was put on the market in although other documents postpone the date to shortly after the Russo Japanese War Although the cards were initially meant for export they quickly gained popularity not only abroad but also in Japan During this time the business styled itself as Marufuku Nintendo Card Co The war created considerable difficulties for companies in the leisure sector which were subject to new levies such as the Karuta Zei playing cards tax Nintendo subsisted and in entered into an agreement with Nihon Senbai later known as the Japan Tobacco to market its cards to various cigarette stores throughout the country A Nintendo promotional calendar from the Taish era dated to indicates that the business was named Yamauchi Nintendo but still used the Marufuku Nintendo Co brand for its playing cards br Japanese culture stipulated that for Nintendo to continue as a family business after Yamauchi s retirement Yamauchi had to adopt his son in law so that he could take over the business As a result Sekiryo Kaneda adopted the Yamauchi surname in and headed the business in By that time Nintendo was the largest playing card business in Japan br br br Incorporation expansion and diversification br br In Sekiryo Kaneda established the company as a general partnership named Yamauchi Nintendo Co Ltd investing in the construction of a new corporate headquarters located next to the original building near the Toba kaid train station Because Sekiryo s marriage to Yamauchi s daughter produced no male heirs he planned to adopt his son in law Shikanojo Inaba an artist in the company s employ and the father of his grandson Hiroshi born in However Inaba abandoned his family and the company so Hiroshi was made Sekiryo s eventual successor br World War II negatively impacted the company as Japanese authorities prohibited the diffusion of foreign card games and as the priorities of Japanese society shifted its interest in recreational activities waned During this time Nintendo was partly supported by a financial injection from Hiroshi s wife Michiko Inaba who came from a wealthy family In Sekiryo founded the distribution company Marufuku Co Ltd responsible for Nintendo s sales and marketing operations which would eventually go on to become the present day Nintendo Co Ltd in Higashikawara cho Imagumano Higashiyama ku Kyoto br br In due to Sekiryo s deteriorating health Hiroshi Yamauchi assumed the presidency and headed manufacturing operations His first actions involved several important changes in the operation of the company in he changed the company name to Nintendo Playing Card Co Ltd and in the following year he centralized the manufacturing facilities dispersed in Kyoto which led to the expansion of the offices in Kamitakamatsu cho Fukuine Higashiyama ku Kyoto In Nintendo became the first company to succeed in mass producing plastic playing cards in Japan Some of the company s employees accustomed to a more cautious and conservative leadership viewed the new measures with concern and the rising tension led to a call for a strike However the measure had no major impact as Hiroshi resorted to the dismissal of several dissatisfied workers br In Nintendo moved its headquarters to Kamitakamatsu cho Fukuine Higashiyama ku Kyoto The company entered into a partnership with The Walt Disney Company to incorporate its characters into playing cards which opened it up to the children s market and resulted in a boost to Nintendo s playing card business Nintendo automated the production of Japanese playing cards using backing paper and also developed a distribution system that allowed it to offer its products in toy stores By the company had established a Tokyo branch in Chiyoda Tokyo and sold more than million card packs holding a high market share for which it relied on televised advertising campaigns In Nintendo became a public company by listing stock on the second section of the Osaka Securities Exchange and on the Kyoto Stock Exchange In the following year the company adopted its current name Nintendo Co Ltd and started manufacturing games in addition to playing cards br In Nintendo earned million Although the company was experiencing a period of economic prosperity the Disney cards and derived products made it dependent on the children s market The situation was exacerbated by the falling sales of its adult oriented playing cards caused by Japanese society gravitating toward other hobbies such as pachinko bowling and nightly outings When Disney card sales began to decline Nintendo realized that it had no real alternative to alleviate the situation After the Tokyo Olympics Nintendo s stock price plummeted to its lowest recorded level of br In Nintendo hired Gunpei Yokoi to maintain the assembly line machines used to manufacture its playing cards br br br Classic and electronic toys br Yamauchi s experience with the previous initiatives led him to increase Nintendo s investment in a research and development department in directed by Hiroshi Imanishi a long time employee of the company Yokoi was moved to the newly created department and was responsible for coordinating various projects Yokoi s experience in manufacturing electronic devices led Yamauchi to put him in charge of the company s games department and his products would be mass produced During this period Nintendo built a new production plant in Uji just outside of Kyoto and distributed classic tabletop games such as chess shogi go and mahjong and other foreign games under the Nippon Game brand The company s restructuring preserved a couple of areas dedicated to playing card manufacturing br In the company s stock listing was promoted to the first section of the Osaka Stock Exchange and the reconstruction and enlargement of its corporate headquarters was completed The year represented a watershed moment in Nintendo s history as it released Japan s first electronic toy the Beam Gun an optoelectronic pistol designed by Masayuki Uemura In total more than a million units were sold Nintendo partnered with Magnavox to provide a light gun controller based on the Beam Gun design for the company s new home video game console the Magnavox Odyssey in Other popular toys released at the time included the Ultra Hand the Ultra Machine the Ultra Scope and the Love Tester all designed by Yokoi More than million units of Ultra Hand were sold in Japan br br br present History in electronics br br br Early video games and Color TV Game br br The growing demand for Nintendo s products led Yamauchi to further expand the offices for which he acquired the surrounding land and assigned the production of cards to the original Nintendo building Meanwhile Yokoi Uemura and new employees such as Genyo Takeda continued to develop innovative products for the company The Laser Clay Shooting System was released in and managed to surpass bowling in popularity Though Nintendo s toys continued to gain popularity the oil crisis caused both a spike in the cost of plastics and a change in consumer priorities that put essential products over pastimes and Nintendo lost several billion yen br In Nintendo released Wild Gunman a skeet shooting arcade simulation consisting of a mm image projector with a sensor that detects a beam from the player s light gun Both the Laser Clay Shooting System and Wild Gunman were successfully exported to Europe and North America However Nintendo s production speeds were still slow compared to rival companies such as Bandai and Tomy and their prices were high which led to the discontinuation of some of their light gun products The subsidiary Nintendo Leisure System Co Ltd which developed these products was closed as a result of the economic impact dealt by the oil crisis br br Yamauchi motivated by the successes of Atari and Magnavox with their video game consoles acquired the Japanese distribution rights for the Magnavox Odyssey in and reached an agreement with Mitsubishi Electric to develop similar products between and including the first microprocessor for video games systems the Color TV Game series and an arcade game inspired by Othello During this period Takeda developed the video game EVR Race and Shigeru Miyamoto joined Yokoi s team with the responsibility of designing the casing for the Color TV Game consoles In Nintendo s research and development department was split into two facilities Nintendo Research Development and Nintendo Research Development respectively managed by Yokoi and Uemura br Shigeru Miyamoto brought distinctive sources of inspiration including the natural environment and regional culture of Sonobe popular culture influences like Westerns and detective fiction along with folk Shinto practices and family media These would each be seen in most of Nintendo s major franchises which developed following Miyamoto s creative leadership br br br Game and Watch arcade games and Nintendo Entertainment System br br Two key events in Nintendo s history occurred in its American subsidiary was opened in New York City and a new department focused on arcade game development was created In one of the first handheld video game systems the Game Watch was created by Yokoi from the technology used in portable calculators It became one of Nintendo s most successful products with over million units sold worldwide during its production period and for which games were made in total br br Nintendo entered the arcade video game market with Sheriff and Radar Scope released in Japan in and respectively Sheriff also known as Bandido in some regions marked the first original video game made by Nintendo was published by Sega and developed by Genyo Takeda and Shigeru Miyamoto Radar Scope rivaled Galaxian in Japanese arcades but failed to find an audience overseas and created a financial crisis for the company To try to find a more successful game they put Miyamoto in charge of their next arcade game design leading to the release of Donkey Kong in one of the first platform video games that allowed the player character to jump The character Jumpman would later become Mario and Nintendo s official mascot Mario was named after Mario Segale the landlord of Nintendo s offices in Tukwila Washington Donkey Kong was a financial success for Nintendo both in Japan and overseas and led Coleco to fight Atari for licensing rights for porting to home consoles and personal computers br In Nintendo opened a new production facility in Uji and was listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange Uemura taking inspiration from the ColecoVision began creating a new video game console that would incorporate a ROM cartridge format for video games as well as both a central processing unit and a picture processing unit The Family Computer or Famicom was released in Japan in July along with three games adapted from their original arcade versions Donkey Kong Donkey Kong Jr and Popeye Its success was such that in it surpassed the market share held by Sega s SG That success also led to Nintendo leaving the Japanese arcade market in late At this time Nintendo adopted a series of guidelines that involved the validation of each game produced for the Famicom before its distribution on the market agreements with developers to ensure that no Famicom game would be adapted to other consoles within two years of its release and restricting developers from producing more than five games per year for the Famicom br In the early s several video game consoles proliferated in the United States as well as low quality games produced by third party developers which oversaturated the market and led to the video game crash of Consequently a recession hit the American video game industry whose revenues went from over billion to million between and Nintendo s initiative to launch the Famicom in America was also impacted To differentiate the Famicom from its competitors in America Nintendo rebranded it as an entertainment system and its cartridges as Game Paks and with a design reminiscent of a VCR Nintendo implemented a lockout chip in the Game Paks for control on its third party library to avoid the market saturation that had occurred in the United States The result is the Nintendo Entertainment System or NES which was released in North America in The landmark games Super Mario Bros and The Legend of Zelda were produced by Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka Composer Koji Kondo reinforced the idea that musical themes could act as a complement to game mechanics rather than simply a miscellaneous element Production of the NES lasted until and production of the Famicom lasted until In total around million Famicom and NES consoles were sold worldwide During this period Nintendo created a copyright infringement protection in the form of the Official Nintendo Seal of Quality added to their products so that customers may recognize their authenticity in the market By this time Nintendo s network of electronic suppliers had extended to around thirty companies including Ricoh Nintendo s main source for semiconductors and the Sharp Corporation br br br Game

agreement with Sony to develop the Super Famicom CD ROM Adapter a peripheral for the upcoming Super Famicom capable of playing CD ROMs However the collaboration did not last as Yamauchi preferred to continue developing the technology with Philips which would result in the CD i and Sony s independent efforts resulted in the creation of the PlayStation console br The first issue of Nintendo Power

purpose of announcing and demonstrating upcoming Nintendo products That year the first World of Nintendo stores within a store which carried official Nintendo merchandise were opened in the United

Nintendo during this time include the Nintendo Gateway System an in flight entertainment service available for airlines cruise ships and hotels and the Play It Loud advertising campaign for Game Boys

Kyoto br br br Nintendo of America br br Nintendo founded its North American subsidiary in as Nintendo of America NoA Hiroshi Yamauchi appointed his son in law Minoru Arakawa as president who in turn hired his own wife and Yamauchi s daughter Yoko Yamauchi as the first employee The Arakawa family moved from Vancouver British Columbia to select an office in Manhattan New York due to its central status in American commerce Both from extremely affluent families their goals were set more by prestige than money The seed capital and product inventory were supplied by the parent corporation in Japan with a launch goal of entering the existing billion per year coin op arcade video game market and the largest entertainment industry in the US which had already outclassed movies and television combined During the couple s arcade research excursions NoA hired gamer youths to work in the filthy hot ratty warehouse in New Jersey in order to receive and service game hardware from Japan br In late NoA contracted the Seattle based arcade sales and distribution company Far East Video consisting solely of experienced arcade salespeople Ron Judy and Al Stone The two had already built a decent reputation and a distribution network founded specifically for the independent import and sales of games from Nintendo because the Japanese company had for years been the under represented maverick in

unit commission on the exclusive American distributorship of Nintendo games to be settled by their Seattle based lawyer Howard Lincoln br Based on favorable test arcade sites in Seattle Arakawa

Seattle harbor being the US s closest to Japan at only nine days by boat and having a lumber production market for arcade cabinets Arakawa s real estate scouts found a square foot m warehouse for rent containing three offices one for Arakawa and one for Judy and Stone This warehouse in the Tukwila suburb was owned by Mario Segale after whom the Mario character would be named and was initially managed by former Far East Video employee Don James After one month James recruited his college friend Howard Phillips as assistant who soon took over as warehouse manager The company remained at fewer than employees for some time handling sales marketing advertising distribution and limited manufacturing of arcade cabinets and Game Watch handheld units all sourced and shipped from Nintendo br Arakawa was still panicked over NoA s ongoing financial crisis With the parent company having no new game ideas he had been repeatedly pleading for Yamauchi to reassign some top talent away from existing Japanese products to develop something for America especially to redeem the massive dead stock of Radar Scope cabinets Since all of Nintendo s key engineers and programmers were busy and with NoA representing only a tiny fraction of the parent s overall business Yamauchi allowed only the assignment of Gunpei Yokoi s young assistant who had no background in engineering Shigeru Miyamoto br br NoA s staff except the sole young gamer Howard Phillips were uniformly revolted at the sight of the freshman developer Miyamoto s debut game which they had imported in the form of emergency conversion kits for the overstock of Radar Scope cabinets The kits transformed the cabinets into NoA s massive windfall gain of million from Miyamoto s smash hit Donkey Kong in alone They sold new

a corporate restructuring after analyzing shifts in the current market laying off of its employees leaving only ten people including CEO Hiroyuki Fukuda This did not affect any games scheduled for release in South Korea and Nintendo continued operations there as usual br br br Subsidiaries br Although most of the research and development is being done in Japan there are some R D facilities in the United States Europe and China that are focused on developing software and hardware technologies used in Nintendo products Although they all are subsidiaries of Nintendo and therefore first party they are often referred to as external resources when being involved in joint development processes with Nintendo s internal developers by the Japanese personnel involved This can be seen in the Iwata Asks interview series Nintendo Software Technology NST and Nintendo Technology Development NTD are located in Redmond Washington United States while Nintendo European Research Development NERD is located in Paris France and Nintendo Network Service Database NSD is located in Kyoto Japan br Most external first party software development is done in Japan because the only overseas subsidiaries are Retro Studios and Shiver Entertainment in the United States acquired in and respectively and Next Level Games in Canada acquired in Although these studios are all subsidiaries of Nintendo they are often referred to as external resources when being involved in joint development processes with Nintendo s internal developers by the Nintendo Entertainment Planning Development EPD division Up Studio and NDcube are located in Tokyo Japan and Monolith Soft has one studio located in Tokyo and another in Kyoto br Nintendo also established The Pok mon Company alongside Creatures and Game Freak to

operations in the Nordic region Bergsala s relationship with Nintendo was established in when the company sought to distribute Game Watch units to Sweden which later expanded to the NES console by Bergsala were the only non Nintendo owned distributor of Nintendo s products until when Tor Gaming gained distribution rights in Israel br br br Tencent br Nintendo has partnered with Tencent to release Nintendo products in China following the lifting of the country s console ban in In addition to distributing hardware Tencent helps with the governmental approval process for video game software br br br Tor Gaming br In January Ynet and IGN Israel reported that negotiations about official distribution of Nintendo products in the country were ongoing After two months IGN Israel announced that Tor Gaming Ltd a company established in earlier gained a distribution agreement with Nintendo of Europe handling official retailing beginning at the start of March followed by opening an official online store the next month In June Tor Gaming launched an official Nintendo Store at Dizengoff Center in Tel Aviv making it the second official Nintendo Store worldwide years after NYC br br br Marketing br br Nintendo of America has engaged in several high profile marketing campaigns to define and position its brand One of its earliest and most enduring slogans was Now you re playing with power used first to promote its Nintendo Entertainment System It modified the slogan to include SUPER power for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and PORTABLE power for the Game Boy br Its Play It Loud campaign played upon teenage rebellion and fostered an edgy reputation During the Nintendo era the slogan was Get N or get out During the GameCube era the Who Are You suggested a link between the games and the players identities The company promoted its Nintendo DS handheld with the tagline Touching is Good For the Wii they used the Wii would like to play slogan to promote the console with the people who tried the games including Super Mario Galaxy and Super Paper Mario The Nintendo DS used the slogan Take a look inside The Wii U used the slogan How U will play next The Nintendo Switch uses the slogan Switch and Play in North America and Play anywhere anytime with anyone elsewhere br br br Trademark br During the peak of Nintendo s success in the video game industry in the s its name was ubiquitously used to refer to any video game console regardless of the manufacturer To prevent its trademark from becoming generic Nintendo pushed the term game console and succeeded in preserving its trademark br br br Logos br Used since the s Nintendo s most recognizable logo is the racetrack shape especially the red colored wordmark typically displayed on a white background primarily used in the Western markets from to In Japan a monochromatic version that lacks a colored background is on Nintendo s own Famicom Super Famicom Nintendo GameCube and handheld console packaging and marketing Since in conjunction with the launch of the Wii Nintendo changed its logo to a gray variant that lacks a colored background inside the wordmark making it transparent Nintendo s official corporate logo remains this variation For consumer products and marketing a white variant on a red background has been used since and has been in full effect since the launch of the Nintendo Switch in br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Policy br br br Content guidelines br For many years Nintendo had a policy of strict content guidelines for video games published on its consoles Although Nintendo allowed graphic violence in its video games released in Japan nudity and sexuality were strictly prohibited Former Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi believed that if the company allowed the licensing of simply games the company s image would be forever tarnished Nintendo of America went further in that games released for Nintendo consoles could not feature nudity sexuality profanity including racism sexism or slurs blood graphic or domestic violence drugs political messages or religious symbols with the exception of widely unpracticed religions such as the Greek Pantheon The Japanese parent company was concerned that it may be viewed as a Japanese Invasion by forcing Japanese community standards on North American and European children Past the strict guidelines some exceptions have occurred Bionic Commando though swastikas were eliminated in the US version Smash TV and Golgo Top Secret Episode contain human violence the latter also containing implied sexuality and tobacco use River City Ransom and Taboo The Sixth Sense contain nudity and the latter also contains religious images as do Castlevania II and III br A known side effect of this policy is the Genesis version of Mortal Kombat having more than double the unit sales of the Super NES version mainly because Nintendo had forced publisher Acclaim to recolor the red blood to look like white sweat and replace some of the more gory graphics in its release of the game making it less violent By contrast Sega allowed blood and gore to remain in the Genesis version though a code is required to unlock the gore Nintendo allowed the Super NES version of Mortal Kombat II to ship uncensored the following year with a content warning on the packaging br Video game ratings systems were introduced with the Entertainment Software Rating Board ESRB of and the Pan European Game Information of and Nintendo discontinued most of its censorship policies in favor of consumers making their own choices Today changes to the content of games are done primarily by the game s developer or occasionally at the request of Nintendo The only clear set rule is that ESRB AO rated games will not be licensed on Nintendo consoles in North America a practice which is also enforced by Sony and Microsoft its two greatest competitors in the present market Nintendo has since allowed several mature content games to be published on its consoles including Perfect Dark Conker s Bad Fur Day Doom Doom BMX XXX the Resident Evil series Killer the Mortal Kombat series Eternal Darkness Sanity s Requiem BloodRayne Geist Dementium The Ward Bayonetta Devil s Third and Fatal Frame Maiden of Black Water br Certain games have continued to be modified however For example Konami was forced to remove all references to cigarettes in the Game Boy Color game Metal Gear Solid although the previous NES version of Metal Gear the GameCube game Metal Gear Solid The Twin Snakes and the DS game Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater D included such references and maiming and blood were removed from the Nintendo port of Cruis n USA Another example is in the Game Boy Advance game Mega Man Zero in which one of the bosses called Hellbat Schilt in the Japanese and European releases was renamed Devilbat Schilt in the North American localization In North America releases of the Mega Man Zero games enemies and bosses killed with a saber attack do not gush blood as they do in the Japanese versions However the release of the Wii was accompanied by several even more controversial games such as Manhunt No More Heroes The House of the Dead Overkill and MadWorld the latter three of which were initially published exclusively for the console br br br License guidelines br Nintendo of America also had guidelines before that had to be followed by its licensees to make games for the Nintendo Entertainment System in addition to the above content guidelines Guidelines were enforced through the NES lockout chip br br Licensees were not permitted to release the same game for a competing console until two years had passed br Nintendo would decide how many cartridges would be supplied to the licensee br Nintendo would decide how much space would be dedicated such as for articles and advertising in the Nintendo Power magazine br There was a minimum number of cartridges that had to be ordered by the licensee from Nintendo br There was a yearly limit of five games that a licensee may produce for a Nintendo console This rule was created to prevent market over saturation which had contributed to the video game crash of br The last rule was circumvented in several ways for example Konami wanting to produce more games for Nintendo s consoles formed Ultra Games and later Palcom to produce more games as a technically different publisher This disadvantaged smaller or emerging companies as they could not afford to start additional companies In another side effect Square Co now Square Enix executives have suggested that the price of publishing games on the Nintendo along with the degree of censorship and control that Nintendo enforced over its games most notably Final Fantasy VI were factors in switching its focus towards Sony s PlayStation console br In a class action suit was taken against Nintendo under allegations that their lockout chip enabled unfair business practices The case was settled with the condition that California consumers were entitled to a discount coupon for a game of Nintendo s choice br br br Intellectual property protection br br Nintendo has generally been proactive to assure its intellectual property in both hardware and software is protected Nintendo s protection of its properties began as early as the arcade release of Donkey Kong which was widely cloned on other platforms a practice common to the most popular arcade games of the era Nintendo did seek legal action to try to stop release of these unauthorized clones but estimated they still lost million in potential sales to these clones Since then Nintendo has been proactive in preventing copyright infringement of its games by video game emulators and fan games and other works using the company s intellectual property The company has also suffered from various data breaches and have sought action against those that have released these leaks br br br Seal of Quality br br The gold sunburst seal was first used by Nintendo of America and later Nintendo of Europe It is displayed on any game system or accessory licensed for use on one of its video game consoles denoting the game has been properly approved by Nintendo The seal is also displayed on any Nintendo licensed merchandise such as trading cards game guides or apparel albeit with the words Official Nintendo Licensed Product br In game designer Sid Meier cited the Seal of Quality as one of the three most important innovations in video game history as it helped set a standard for game quality that protected consumers from shovelware br br br NTSC regions br In NTSC regions this seal is an elliptical starburst named the Official Nintendo Seal Originally for NTSC countries the seal was a large black and gold circular starburst The seal read as follows This seal is your assurance that NINTENDO has approved and guaranteed the quality of this product This seal was later altered in approved and guaranteed was changed to evaluated and approved In the seal became gold and white as it currently appears with a shortened phrase Official Nintendo Seal of Quality It was changed in to read Official Nintendo Seal br The seal currently reads thus br br The official seal is your assurance that this product is licensed or manufactured by Nintendo Always look for this seal when buying video game systems accessories games and related products br br br PAL regions br In PAL regions the seal is a circular starburst named the Original Nintendo Seal of Quality Text near the seal in the Australian Wii manual states br br This seal is your assurance that Nintendo has reviewed this product and that it has met our standards for excellence in workmanship reliability and entertainment value Always look for this seal when buying games and accessories to ensure complete compatibility with your Nintendo product br br br Charitable projects br In Nintendo teamed with the Starlight Children s Foundation to build Starlight Fun Center mobile entertainment units and install them in hospitals Starlight Nintendo Fun Center units were installed by the end of These units combine several forms of multimedia entertainment including gaming and serve as a distraction to brighten moods and boost kids morale during hospital stays br br br Environmental record br Nintendo has consistently been ranked last in Greenpeace s Guide to Greener Electronics due to Nintendo s failure to publish information Similarly they are ranked last in the Enough Project s Conflict Minerals Company Rankings due to Nintendo s refusal to respond to multiple requests for information br Like many other electronics companies Nintendo offers a recycling program for customers to mail in unused products Nintendo of America claimed tons of returned products in of which became reused or recycled br br br Legacy br br It is considered that Hiroshi Yamauchi s strategic decisions mainly to take Nintendo into the world of electronic games ensured not only the success of his company but the survival of the industry as a whole as it restored public confidence in electronic games after the gloomy collapse of the U S market in the early s The company was already the most successful in Japan by with its products having redefined the way we play games and its business model having prioritized title sales strategies over consoles unlike what most distributors at the time were doing br Its social responsibility policy and philosophy focused on quality and innovation have already led to Nintendo being classified as a consumer centric manufacturer something that has allowed it to differentiate itself from its direct competitors Sony and Microsoft Forbes magazine has since included Nintendo in its list of the World s Best Employers which takes into consideration work environment and staff diversity Time magazine in turn chose Nintendo in as one of the Genius Companies of the year stating that resurrection has become a habit of the company and highlighting the success of the Nintendo Switch over the Wii U Its capital in exceeded ten billion yen and net sales were over nine billion dollars mostly in the North American market making it one of Japan s richest and most valuable companies br Nintendo characters have already had a huge impact on contemporary popular culture Mario has gone from being just a corporate mascot to a cultural icon as well as one of the most famous characters in the industry According to John Taylor of Arcadia Investment Corp the character is by far the biggest single property in electronic gaming Other prominent company characters include
