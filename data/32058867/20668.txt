title: MAC address
id: 20668
A MAC address short for medium access control address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller NIC for use as a network address in communications within a network segment This use is common in most IEEE networking technologies including Ethernet Wi Fi and Bluetooth Within the Open Systems Interconnection OSI network model MAC addresses are used in the medium access control protocol sublayer of the data link layer As typically represented MAC addresses are recognizable as six groups of two hexadecimal digits separated by hyphens colons or without a separator br MAC addresses are primarily assigned by device manufacturers and are therefore often referred to as the burned in address or as an Ethernet hardware address hardware address or physical address Each address can be stored in the interface hardware such as its read only memory or by a firmware mechanism Many network interfaces however support changing their MAC addresses The address typically includes a manufacturer s organizationally unique identifier OUI MAC addresses are formed according to the principles of two numbering spaces based on extended unique identifiers EUIs managed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE EUI which replaces the obsolete term MAC and EUI br Network nodes with multiple network interfaces such as routers and multilayer switches must have a unique MAC address for each network interface in the same network However two network interfaces connected to two different networks can share the same MAC address br br The IEEE MAC address originally comes from the Xerox Network Systems Ethernet addressing scheme This bit address space contains potentially over trillion possible MAC addresses The IEEE manages allocation of MAC addresses originally known as MAC and which it now refers to as EUI identifiers The IEEE has a target lifetime of years until for applications using EUI space and restricts applications accordingly The IEEE encourages adoption of the more plentiful EUI for non Ethernet applications br The distinctions between EUI and MAC identifiers are in name and application only MAC was used to address hardware interfaces within existing based networking applications EUI is now used for based networking and is also used to identify other devices and software for example Bluetooth The IEEE now considers MAC to be an obsolete term EUI is now used in all cases In addition the EUI numbering system originally encompassed both MAC and EUI identifiers by a simple translation mechanism These translations have since been deprecated br The Individual Address Block IAB is an inactive registry which has been replaced by the MA S MAC address block small previously named OUI and has no overlaps in addresses with the IAB registry product as of January The IAB uses an OUI from the MA L MAC address block large registry previously called the OUI registry The term OUI is still in use but the IEEE Registration Authority does not administer them An OUI is concatenated with additional IEEE provided bits for a total of bits leaving only bits for the organisation owning the IAB to assign to its up to individual devices An IAB is ideal for organizations requiring not more than unique bit numbers EUI Unlike an OUI which allows the assignee to assign values in various different number spaces for example EUI EUI and the various context dependent identifier number spaces like for SNAP or EDID the Individual Address Block could only be used to assign EUI identifiers All other potential uses based on the OUI from which the IABs are allocated are reserved and remain the property of the IEEE Registration Authority Between and September the OUI value C was used for IAB assignments After September the value D was used The owners of an already assigned IAB may continue to use the assignment br The MA S registry includes for each registrant both a bit unique number used in some standards and a block of EUI and EUI identifiers while the registrant of an IAB cannot assign an EUI MA S does not include assignment of an OUI br Additionally the MA M MAC address block medium provides both EUI identifiers and EUI identifiers the first bits being assigned by IEEE The first bits of the assigned MA M block are an OUI assigned to IEEE that will not be reassigned so the MA M does not include assignment of an OUI br br Addresses can either be universally administered addresses UAA or locally administered addresses LAA A universally administered address is uniquely assigned to a device by its manufacturer The first three octets in transmission order identify the organization that issued the identifier and are known as the organizationally unique identifier OUI The remainder of the address three octets for EUI or five for EUI are assigned by that organization in nearly any manner they please subject to the constraint of uniqueness A locally administered address is assigned to a device by software or a network administrator overriding the burned in address for physical devices br Locally administered addresses are distinguished from universally administered addresses by setting assigning the value of to the second least significant bit of the first octet of the address This bit is also referred to as the U L bit short for Universal Local which identifies how the address is administered If the bit is the address is universally administered which is why this bit is in all UAAs If it is the address is locally administered In the example address the first octet is hexadecimal the binary form of which is where the second least significant bit is Therefore it is a locally administered address Even though many hypervisors manage dynamic MAC addresses within their own OUI often it is useful to create an entire unique MAC within the LAA range br br In virtualisation hypervisors such as QEMU and Xen have their own OUIs Each new virtual machine is started with a MAC address set by assigning the last three bytes to be unique on the local network While this is local administration of MAC addresses it is not an LAA in the IEEE sense br A historical example of this hybrid situation is the DECnet protocol where the universal MAC address OUI AA Digital Equipment Corporation is administered locally The DECnet software assigns the last three bytes for the complete MAC address to be AA XX YY where XX YY reflects the DECnet network address xx yy of the host This eliminates the need for DECnet to have an address resolution protocol since the MAC address for any DECnet host can be determined from its DECnet address br br The least significant bit of an address s first octet is referred to as the I G or Individual Group bit When this bit is zero the frame is meant to reach only one receiving network interface This type of transmission is called unicast A unicast frame is transmitted to all nodes within the collision domain In a modern wired setting i e with switches not simple hubs the collision domain usually is the length of the Ethernet cabling between two network interfaces In a wireless setting the collision domain is all receivers that can detect a given wireless signal If a switch does not know which port leads to a given MAC address the switch will forward a unicast frame to all of its ports except the originating port an action known as unicast flood Only the node with the matching hardware MAC address will normally accept the frame network interfaces with non matching MAC addresses ignore the frame unless they are in promiscuous mode br If the least significant bit of the first octet is set to i e the second hexadecimal digit is odd the frame will still be sent only once however network interface controllers will choose to accept or ignore it based on criteria other than the matching of their individual MAC addresses for example based on a configurable list of accepted multicast MAC addresses This is called multicast addressing br The IEEE has built in several special address types to allow more than one network interface card to be addressed at one time br br Packets sent to the broadcast address all one bits are received by all stations on a local area network In hexadecimal the broadcast address would be FF FF FF FF FF FF A broadcast frame is flooded and is forwarded to and accepted by all other nodes br Packets sent to a multicast address are received by all stations on a LAN that have been configured to receive packets sent to that address br Functional addresses identify one or more Token Ring NICs that provide a particular service defined in IEEE br These are all examples of group addresses as opposed to individual addresses the least significant bit of the first octet of a MAC address distinguishes individual addresses from group addresses That bit is set to in individual addresses and set to in group addresses Group addresses like individual addresses can be universally administered or locally administered br br The U L and I G bits are handled independently and there are instances of all four possibilities IPv multicast uses locally administered multicast MAC addresses in the range XX XX XX XX with both bits set br Given the locations of the U L and I G bits they can be discerned in a single digit in common MAC address notation as shown in the following table br br IEEE standard c further divides the locally administered MAC address block into four quadrants This additional partitioning is called Structured Local Address Plan SLAP and its usage is optional br br The following network technologies use the EUI identifier format br br IEEE networks br Ethernet br wireless networks Wi Fi br Bluetooth br IEEE Token Ring br Fiber Distributed Data Interface FDDI br Asynchronous Transfer Mode ATM switched virtual connections only as part of an NSAP address br Fibre Channel and Serial Attached SCSI as part of a World Wide Name br The ITU T G hn standard which provides a way to create a high speed up to gigabit s local area network using existing home wiring power lines phone lines and coaxial cables The G hn Application Protocol Convergence APC layer accepts Ethernet frames that use the EUI format and encapsulates them into G hn Medium Access Control Service Data Units MSDUs br Every device that connects to an IEEE network such as Ethernet and Wi Fi has an EUI address Common networked consumer devices such as PCs smartphones and tablet computers use EUI addresses br EUI identifiers are used in br br IEEE FireWire br InfiniBand br IPv Modified EUI as the least significant bits of a unicast network address or link local address when stateless address autoconfiguration is used IPv uses a modified EUI treats MAC as EUI instead as it is chosen from the same address pool and inverts the local bit This results in extending MAC addresses such as IEEE MAC address to modified EUI using only FF FE and never FF FF and with the local bit inverted sec br Zigbee LoWPAN wireless personal area networks br IEEE IEEE compliant medical devices br br On broadcast networks such as Ethernet the MAC address is expected to uniquely identify each node on that segment and allows frames to be marked for specific hosts It thus forms the basis of most of the link layer OSI layer networking upon which upper layer protocols rely to produce complex functioning networks br Many network interfaces support changing their MAC address On most Unix like systems the command utility ifconfig may be used to remove and add link address aliases For instance the active ifconfig directive may be used on NetBSD to specify which of the attached addresses to activate Hence various configuration scripts and utilities permit the randomization of the MAC address at the time of booting or before establishing a network connection br Changing MAC addresses is necessary in network virtualization In MAC spoofing this is practiced in exploiting security vulnerabilities of a computer system Some modern operating systems such as Apple iOS and Android especially in mobile devices are designed to randomize the assignment of a MAC address to network interface when scanning for wireless access points to avert tracking systems br In Internet Protocol IP networks the MAC address of an interface corresponding to an IP address may be queried with the Address Resolution Protocol ARP for IPv and the Neighbor Discovery Protocol NDP for IPv relating OSI layer addresses with layer addresses br br According to Edward Snowden the US National Security Agency has a system that tracks the movements of mobile devices in a city by monitoring MAC addresses To avert this practice Apple has started using random MAC addresses in iOS devices while scanning for networks Other vendors followed quickly MAC address randomization during scanning was added in Android starting from version Windows and Linux kernel The actual implementations of the MAC address randomization technique vary largely in different devices Moreover various flaws and shortcomings in these implementations may allow an attacker to track a device even if its MAC address is changed for instance its probe requests other elements or their timing If random MAC addresses are not used researchers have confirmed that it is possible to link a real identity to a particular wireless MAC address br Randomized MAC addresses can be identified by the locally administered bit described above br br Using wireless access points in SSID hidden mode network cloaking a mobile wireless device may not only disclose its own MAC address when traveling but even the MAC addresses associated to SSIDs the device has already connected to if they are configured to send these as part of probe request packets Alternative modes to prevent this include configuring access points to be either in beacon broadcasting mode or probe response with SSID mode In these modes probe requests may be unnecessary or sent in broadcast mode without disclosing the identity of previously known networks br br The standard IEEE format for printing EUI addresses in human friendly form is six groups of two hexadecimal digits separated by hyphens in transmission order e g AB This form is also commonly used for EUI e g AB CD EF Other conventions include six groups of two hexadecimal digits separated by colons e g AB and three groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by dots e g AB again in transmission order br br The standard notation also called canonical format for MAC addresses is written in transmission order with the least significant bit of each byte transmitted first and is used in the output of the ifconfig ip address and ipconfig commands for example br However since IEEE Ethernet and IEEE Token Bus send the bytes octets over the wire left to right with the least significant bit in each byte first while IEEE Token Ring and IEEE FDDI send the bytes over the wire with the most significant bit first confusion may arise when an address in the latter scenario is represented with bits reversed from the canonical representation For example an address in canonical form A BC would be transmitted over the wire as bits in the standard transmission order least significant bit first But for Token Ring networks it would be transmitted as bits in most significant bit first order The latter might be incorrectly displayed as C A E D This is referred to as bit reversed order non canonical form MSB format IBM format or Token Ring format br br Hot Standby Router Protocol br MAC filtering br Network
