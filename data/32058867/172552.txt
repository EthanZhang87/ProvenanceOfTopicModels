Stunnel is an open source multi platform application used to provide a universal TLS SSL tunneling service br Stunnel is used to provide secure encrypted connections for clients or servers that do not speak TLS or SSL natively It runs on a variety of operating systems including most Unix like operating systems and Windows Stunnel relies on the OpenSSL library to implement the underlying TLS or SSL protocol br Stunnel uses public key cryptography with X digital certificates to secure the SSL connection and clients can optionally be authenticated via a certificate br If linked against libwrap it can be configured to act as a proxy firewall service as well br Stunnel is maintained by Polish programmer Micha Trojnara and released under the terms of the GNU General Public License GPL with OpenSSL exception br br br Example br A stunnel can be used to provide a secure SSL connection to an existing non SSL aware SMTP mail server Assuming the SMTP server expects TCP connections on port the stunnel would be configured to map the SSL port to non SSL port A mail client connects via SSL to port Network traffic from the client initially passes over SSL to the stunnel application which transparently encrypts and decrypts traffic and forwards unsecured traffic to port locally The mail server sees a non SSL mail client br The stunnel process could be running on the same or a different server from the unsecured mail application however both machines would typically be behind a firewall on a secure internal network so that an intruder could not make its own unsecured connection directly to port br br br See also br Tunneling protocol br br br br br br External links br Official website
