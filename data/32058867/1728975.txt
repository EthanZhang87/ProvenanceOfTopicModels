the decision from SKAT the taxation department surfaced in the Danish tabloid B T The case had been leaked to the newspaper several months previously It turned out that from to Thorning Schmidt had made use of tax deductions applicable to her husband even though he was not subject to Danish taxes and had no income in Denmark The mistake was corrected by SKAT for the three years from to and Thorning Schmidt paid the amount she had saved due to the error She was however not required to pay the amounts saved for the six years from to because of the statutory time limit for liability in such cases br In November the daily Politiken disclosed that the Tax Ministry deputy chief Peter Loft had attended several meetings attending to the Thorning Schmidt case and had tried to insert comments into the final resolution text This would be unlawful under Danish law as the Tax Ministry may not interfere with the decisions taken in individual tax cases This set off a flurry of speculation in the press as to whether there had been any political pressure from the then government to pursue a stricter course in the tax case The Tax Minister in the new government Thor M ger Pedersen subsequently asked Peter Loft and the director of the revenue service s Copenhagen branch Erling Andersen to give a report on the happenings On December Pedersen disclosed that he had found such big discrepancies in the two reports that he would set up a commission of inquiry to determine the actual course of events br Further controversy erupted when two days later the tabloid daily Ekstra Bladet reported that they had also been offered the confidential information that was made public during the election campaign The source of the leak was determined to be Peter Arnfeldt spin doctor for then Minister for Taxation Troels Lund Poulsen This led to intense media speculation that the former government and specifically Troels Lund Poulsen were engaged in leaking confidential tax information and trying to pressure the revenue service into changing its decision in the case in an active attempt to discredit the opposition leader in the then imminent election This would constitute a hitherto unseen level of abuse of power in Danish political life The commission of inquiry that had already been announced two days previously was broadly supported by the Danish Parliament to also look into whether the former government was involved in or knew of the leak On the same day Troels Lund Poulsen announced he would be taking an indefinite leave of absence from the Danish Parliament Peter Arnfeldt has been reported to the police by the Ministry for Taxation In March Peter Loft was suspended from his post as deputy chief for the duration of the two year investigation period br br br Selfie controversy br In December Thorning Schmidt British prime minister David Cameron and US president Barack Obama faced criticism on social media that they had

fun Cameron said he was being polite when Thorning Schmidt asked him to take part in the picture On a previous occasion Thorning Schmidt had stopped her car to ask for a picture with the actress Sarah Jessica Parker after spotting her signing autographs in Oslo br br br br br br External links br br Prime Minister s website in English br Helle Thorning Schmidt at Curlie in Danish br Appearances on
