title: Stablecoin
id: 57437562
A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency where the value of the digital asset is supposed to be pegged to a reference asset which is either fiat money exchange traded commodities such as precious metals or industrial metals or another cryptocurrency br In theory backing by a reference asset could make a stablecoin value track the value of the peg and not be subject to the radical changes in value common in the market for many digital assets In practice however stablecoin issuers have yet to be proven to maintain adequate reserves to support a stable value and there have been a number of failures with investors losing the entirety of the fiat currency value of their holdings br br br Background br Stablecoins have several purported purposes They can be used for payments and are more likely to retain value than highly volatile cryptocurrencies In practice many stablecoins have failed to retain their stable value br Stablecoins are typically non interest bearing and therefore do not provide interest returns to the holder br br br Reserve backed stablecoins br Reserve backed stablecoins are digital assets that are stabilized by other assets Furthermore such coins assuming they are managed in good faith and have a mechanism for redeeming the asset s backing them are unlikely to drop below the value of the underlying physical asset due to arbitrage However in practice few if any stablecoins meet these assumptions br Backed stablecoins are subject to the same volatility and risk associated with the backing asset If the backed stablecoin is backed in a decentralized manner they are relatively safe from predation but if there is a central vault it may be robbed or suffer loss of confidence br br br Fiat backed br The value of stablecoins of this type is based on the value of the backing currency which is held by a third party regulated financial entity Fiat backed stablecoins can be traded on exchanges and are redeemable from the issuer The stability of the stablecoin is equivalent to the cost of maintaining the backing reserve and the cost of legal compliance licenses auditors and the business infrastructure required by the regulator br In this setting the trust in the custodian of the backing asset is crucial for the stability of the stablecoin s price If the issuer of the stablecoin lacks the fiat necessary to make exchanges the stablecoin can quickly lose value and become worthless br The most popular stablecoin Tether initially claimed to be fully backed by fiat currency this was proven to be untrue and Tether was fined million by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for deceiving consumers Instead Tether only had enough fiat reserve to guarantee of their stablecoin Nevertheless Tether still remains widely used br Cryptocurrencies backed by fiat currency are the most common and were the first type of stablecoins on the market Their characteristics are br br Their value is pegged to one or more currencies most commonly the US dollar the euro and the Swiss franc in a fixed ratio br The value connection is realized off chain through banks or other types of regulated financial institutions which serve as depositaries of the currency used to back the stablecoin br The amount of the currency used to back the stablecoin should reflect the circulating supply of the stablecoin br Examples TrueUSD TUSD USD Tether USDT USD Coin Monerium EURe br In January National Australia Bank not Australia s central bank announced that it would create by mid an Australian Dollar fiat backed stablecoin called the AUDN for streamlining cross border banking transactions and trading carbon credits br br br Commodity backed br The main characteristics of commodity backed stablecoins are br br Their value is fixed to one or more commodities and redeemable for such more or less on demand br There is an implied or explicit promise to redeem by unregulated individuals agorist firms or even regulated financial institutions br The amount of commodity used to back the stablecoin should reflect the circulating supply of the stablecoin br Holders of commodity backed stablecoins can redeem their stablecoins at the conversion rate to take possession of the backing assets under whatever rules as to timing and amount are in place at the time of redemption Maintaining the stability of the stablecoin is the cost of storing and protecting the commodity backing br br br Cryptocurrency backed br Cryptocurrency backed stablecoins are issued with cryptocurrencies as collateral conceptually similar to fiat backed stablecoins However the significant difference between the two designs is that while fiat collateralization typically happens off the blockchain the cryptocurrency or crypto asset used to back this type of stablecoins is done on the blockchain using smart contracts in a more decentralized fashion In many cases these allow users to take out a loan against a smart contract via locking up collateral making it more worthwhile to pay off their debt should the stablecoin ever decrease in value In addition to prevent sudden crashes a user who takes out a loan may be liquidated by the smart contract should their collateral decrease too close to the value of their withdrawal br Significant features of crypto backed stablecoins are br br The value of the stablecoin is collateralized by another cryptocurrency or a cryptocurrency portfolio br The peg is executed on chain via smart contracts br The supply of the stablecoins is regulated on chain using smart contracts br price stability is achieved by introducing supplementary instruments and incentives not just the collateral br The technical implementation of this type of stablecoins is more complex and varied than that of the fiat collateralized kind which introduces a greater risk of exploits due to bugs in the smart contract code With the tethering done on chain it is not subject to third party regulation creating a decentralized solution The potentially problematic aspect of this type of stablecoins is the change in the value of the collateral and the reliance on supplementary instruments The complexity and non direct backing of the stablecoin may deter usage as it may take time to comprehend how the price is ensured Due to the highly volatile and convergent cryptocurrency market substantial collateral must also be maintained to ensure stability br Live stablecoins projects of this type are Havven the pair nUSD stablecoin and HAV the collateral backed nUSD DAI pair CDP Collateralized Debt Position and MKR governance token used to control the supply and others There is also Wrapped Bitcoin WBTC see BitGo br br br Seigniorage style algorithmic stablecoins not backed br Seigniorage style coins also known as algorithmic stablecoins utilize algorithms to control the stablecoin s money supply similar to a central bank s approach to printing and destroying currency Seigniorage based stablecoins are a less popular form of stablecoin br Algorithmic stablecoins are a type of stablecoin intended to hold a stable value over the long term because of particular computer algorithms and game theory rather than a peg to a reserve asset In practice some algorithmic stablecoins have yet to maintain price stability For example the UST asset on the Terra blockchain was theoretically supported by a reserve asset called Luna and plummeted in value in May Wired magazine said The Ponzinomics were just too obvious When you pay money for nothing and stash your nothing in a protocol with the expectation that it will give you a percent yield all you end up with is percent of nothing br Significant features of seigniorage style stablecoins are br br Adjustments are made on chain br No collateral is needed to mint coins br Value is controlled by supply and demand through algorithms stabilizing the price br Basis was one example of a seigniorage style coin br TerraUSD UST created by Do Kwon was meant to maintain a peg with the United States dollar Instead of being backed by dollars UST was designed to keep its peg through a complex system connected with another Terra network token Terra LUNA In May UST broke its peg with its price plunging to cents while LUNA fell to virtually zero down from an all time high of The collapse wiped out almost billion of market capitalization over the course of a week br On June Tron s algorithmic stablecoin USDD lost its peg to the US Dollar br br br Possible advantages br The Bank of International Settlements lists the possible merits of the subject as enhancement of anti money laundering efforts operational resilience customer data protection financial inclusion tax compliance and cybersecurity br br br Risks and criticisms br br br Limitations on regulation br Nellie Liang Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance reported to the Senate banking committee that the rapid growth of the stablecoin market capitalization and its potential for financial services innovation require urgent Congressional regulation br Although US legislation is progressing in May to provide increased regulatory clarity for many digital assets the Financial Innovation and Technology for the st Century Act in its current form excludes certain stablecoins from regulation by the SEC except for fraud and certain activities by registered firms and is specifically excluded from regulation by the CFTC br br br Lack of transparency br Tether is currently the world s largest market capitalization stablecoin It has been accused of failing to produce audits for reserves used to collateralize the quantity of minted USDT stablecoin Tether has since issued assurance reports on USDT backing although some speculation persists br br br De pegging br Many projects can advance a product and call it a stablecoin Thus despite the name many stablecoins have historically needed more stability because digital assets can be built to many different standards Stablecoins such as TerraUSD USDD DEI and others crashed to zero in alone br br br Other concerns br Griffin and Shams research attributed the creation of unbacked USDT to the rise in Bitcoin s price in Following that research indicated little to no evidence that Tether USD minting events influenced Bitcoin values unless they were publicized to the public by Whale Alert br br br Failed and abandoned stablecoin projects br A number of stablecoins have crashed or lost their peg For example br br The stablecoin project Basis which had received over million in venture capital funding shut down in December citing concerns about US regulation br On May Terra s stablecoin UST fell from to cents The subsequent failure of Terraform Labs resulted in the loss of nearly B invested in the Terra and Luna coins Both the United States and Korea are seeking extradition of its founder Do Kwon following his arrest in Montenegro on an Interpol notice br Diem
