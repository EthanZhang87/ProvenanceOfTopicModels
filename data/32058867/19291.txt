Morocco officially the Kingdom of Morocco is a country in the Maghreb region of North Africa It overlooks the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the west and has land borders with Algeria to the east and the disputed territory of Western Sahara to the south Morocco also claims the Spanish exclaves of Ceuta Melilla and Pe n de V lez de la Gomera and several small Spanish controlled islands off its coast It has a population of roughly million the official and predominant religion is Islam and the official languages are Arabic and Berber French and the Moroccan dialect of Arabic are also widely spoken Moroccan identity and culture is a mix of Arab Berber African and European cultures Its capital is Rabat while its largest city is Casablanca br The region constituting Morocco has been inhabited since the Paleolithic era over years ago The Idrisid dynasty was established by Idris I in and was subsequently ruled by a series of other independent dynasties reaching its zenith as a regional power in the th and th centuries under the Almoravid and Almohad dynasties when it controlled most of the Iberian Peninsula and the Maghreb Centuries of Arab migration to the Maghreb since the th century shifted the demographic scope of the region In the th and th centuries Morocco faced external threats to its sovereignty with Portugal seizing some territory and the Ottoman Empire encroaching from the east The Marinid and Saadi dynasties otherwise resisted foreign domination and Morocco was the only North African nation to escape Ottoman dominion The Alawi dynasty which rules the country to this day seized power in and over the next two centuries expanded diplomatic and commercial relations with the Western world Morocco s strategic location near the mouth of the Mediterranean drew renewed European interest in France and Spain divided the country into respective protectorates reserving an international zone in Tangier Following intermittent riots and revolts against colonial rule in Morocco regained its independence and reunified br Since independence Morocco has remained relatively stable It has the fifth largest economy in Africa and wields significant influence in both Africa and the Arab world it is considered a middle power in global affairs and holds membership in the Arab League the Arab Maghreb Union the Union for the Mediterranean and the African Union Morocco is a unitary semi constitutional monarchy with an elected parliament The executive branch is led by the King of Morocco and the prime minister while legislative power is vested in the two chambers of parliament the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors Judicial power rests with the Constitutional Court which may review the validity of laws elections and referendums The king holds vast executive and legislative powers especially over the military foreign policy and religious affairs he can issue decrees called dahirs which have the force of law and can also dissolve the parliament after consulting the prime minister and the president of the constitutional court br Morocco claims ownership of the non self governing territory of Western Sahara which it has designated its Southern Provinces In after Spain agreed to decolonise the territory and cede its control to Morocco and Mauritania a guerrilla war broke out between those powers and some of the local inhabitants In Mauritania relinquished its claim to the area but the war continued to rage In a ceasefire agreement was reached but the issue of sovereignty remained unresolved Today Morocco occupies two thirds of the territory and efforts to resolve the dispute have thus far failed to break the political deadlock br br br Etymology and name br The English Morocco is an anglicisation of the Spanish name for the country Marruecos derived from the name of the city of Marrakesh which was the capital of the Almoravid dynasty the Almohad Caliphate and the Saadian dynasty During the Almoravid dynasty the city of Marrakesh was established under the name of T mur ku t derived from the city s ancient Berber name of am r n Yaku lit land country of God In English the first vowel has been changed likely influenced by the word Moor br Historically the territory has been part of what Muslim geographers referred to as al Maghrib al Aq the Farthest West of the Islamic world designating roughly the area from Tiaret to the Atlantic in contrast with neighbouring regions of al Maghrib al Awsa the Middle West Tripoli to B ja a and al Maghrib al Adn the Nearest West Alexandria to Tripoli br Morocco s modern Arabic name is al Maghrib transl the land of the sunset the west with the Kingdom s official Arabic name being al Mamlakah al Maghrib yah transl the kingdom of sunset the west In Turkish Morocco is known as Fas a name derived from its medieval capital of Fes which is derived from the Arabic word Fa s transl pickaxe as the city s founder Idris I ibn Abd Allah reputedly used a silver and gold pickaxe to trace the outlines of the city In other parts of the Islamic world for example in Egyptian and Middle Eastern Arabic literature before the mid th century Morocco was commonly referred to as Murrakush The term is still used to refer to Morocco today in several Indo Iranian languages including Persian Urdu and Punjabi br Morocco has also been referred to politically by a variety of terms denoting the Sharifi heritage of the Alawi dynasty such as al Mamlakah ash Shar fah al Iy lah ash Shar fah and al Imbar riyyah ash Shar fah rendered in French as l Empire ch rifien and in English as the Sharifian Empire br br br History br br br Prehistory and antiquity br The area of present day Morocco has been inhabited since at least Paleolithic times beginning sometime between and BC A recent publication has suggested that there is evidence for even earlier human habitation of the area Homo sapiens fossils that had been discovered in the late s near the Atlantic coast in Jebel Irhoud were recently dated to roughly years ago During the Upper Paleolithic the Maghreb was more fertile than it is today resembling a savanna in contrast to its modern arid landscape Twenty two thousand years ago the Aterian culture was succeeded by the Iberomaurusian culture which shared similarities with Iberian cultures Skeletal similarities have been suggested between the human remains found at Iberomaurusian Mechta Afalou burial sites and European Cro Magnon remains The Iberomaurusian culture was succeeded by the Beaker culture in Morocco Mitochondrial DNA studies have discovered a close ancestral link between Berbers and the Saami of Scandinavia This evidence supports the theory that some of the peoples who had been living in the Franco Cantabrian refuge area of southwestern Europe during the late glacial period migrated to northern Europe contributing to its repopulation after the last ice age br In the early part of Classical Antiquity Northwest Africa and Morocco were slowly drawn into the wider emerging Mediterranean world by the Phoenicians who established trading colonies and settlements there the most substantial of which were Chellah Lixus and Mogador Mogador was established as a Phoenician colony as early as the th century BC br br Morocco later became a realm of the Northwest African civilisation of ancient Carthage and part of the Carthaginian empire The earliest known independent Moroccan state was the Berber kingdom of Mauretania under King Baga This ancient kingdom not to be confused with the modern state of Mauritania flourished around BC or earlier Mauretania became a client kingdom of the Roman Empire in BC Emperor Claudius annexed Mauretania directly in AD making it a Roman province ruled by an imperial governor either a procurator Augusti or a legatus Augusti pro praetore br During the Crisis of the Third Century parts of Mauretania were reconquered by Berbers By the late rd century direct Roman rule had become confined to a few coastal cities such as Septum Ceuta in Mauretania Tingitana and Cherchell in Mauretania Caesariensis When in AD the area was devastated by the Vandals the Roman Empire lost its remaining possessions in Mauretania and local Mauro Roman kings assumed control of them In the s the Eastern Roman Empire under Byzantine control re established direct imperial rule of Septum and Tingi fortified Tingis and erected a church br br br Foundation and dynastic period br br The Muslim conquest of the Maghreb that had begun during the mid th century was completed under the Umayyad Caliphate by The caliphate introduced both Islam and the Arabic language to the area this period also saw the beginning of a trend of Arab migration to the Maghreb which would last for centuries and effect a demographic shift in the region While constituting part of the larger empire Morocco was initially organised as a subsidiary province of Ifriqiya with the local governors appointed by the Muslim governor in Kairouan br The indigenous Berber tribes adopted Islam but retained their customary laws They also paid taxes and tribute to the new Muslim administration The first independent Muslim state in the area of modern Morocco was the Kingdom of Nekor an emirate in the Rif Mountains It was founded by Salih I ibn Mansur in as a client state to the Umayyad Caliphate After the outbreak of the Berber Revolt in the Berbers formed other independent states such as the Miknasa of Sijilmasa and the Barghawata br br The founder of the Idrisid dynasty and the great grandson of Hasan ibn Ali Idris ibn Abdallah had fled to Morocco after the massacre of his family by the Abbasids in the Hejaz He convinced the Awraba Berber tribes to break their allegiance to the distant Abbasid caliphs and he founded the Idrisid dynasty in The Idrisids established Fes as their capital and Morocco became a centre of Muslim learning and a major regional power The Idrisids were ousted in by the Fatimid Caliphate and their Miknasa allies After Miknasa broke off relations with the Fatimids in they were removed from power by the Maghrawa of Sijilmasa in br br From the th century onward a series of Berber dynasties arose Under the Sanhaja Almoravid dynasty and the Masmuda Almohad dynasty Morocco dominated the Maghreb al Andalus in Iberia and the western Mediterranean region From the th century onward the country saw a massive migration of the Banu Hilal Arab tribes In the th and th centuries the Zenata Berber Marinids held power in Morocco and strove to replicate the successes of the Almohads through military campaigns in Algeria and Spain They were followed by the Wattasids In the th century the Reconquista ended Muslim rule in Iberia and many Muslims and Jews fled to Morocco br Portuguese efforts to control the Atlantic sea trade in the th century did not greatly affect the interior of Morocco even though they managed to control some possessions on the Moroccan coast but not venturing further afield inland br br In the region fell to successive Arab dynasties claiming descent from the Islamic prophet Muhammad first the Saadi dynasty who ruled from to and then the Alawi dynasty who have remained in power since the th century Morocco faced aggression from Spain in the north and the Ottoman Empire s allies pressing westward br br Under the Saadis the sultanate ended the Portuguese Aviz dynasty in at the Battle of Alc cer Quibir The reign of Ahmad al Mansur brought new wealth and prestige to the Sultanate and a large expedition to West Africa inflicted a crushing defeat on the Songhay Empire in However managing the territories across the Sahara proved too difficult Upon the death of al Mansur the country was divided among his sons br After a period of political fragmentation and conflict during the decline of the Saadi dynasty Morocco was finally reunited by the Alawi sultan al Rashid in the late s who took Fez in and Marrakesh in The Alawis succeeded in stabilising their position and while the kingdom was smaller than previous ones in the region it remained quite wealthy Against the opposition of local tribes Ismail Ibn Sharif began to create a unified state With his Riffian army he re occupied Tangier from the English who had abandoned it in and drove the Spanish from Larache in The Portuguese abandoned Mazag o their last territory in Morocco in However the siege of Melilla against the Spanish ended in defeat in br Morocco was the first nation to recognise the fledgling United States as an independent nation in In the beginning of the American Revolution American merchant ships in the Atlantic Ocean were subject to attacks by other fleets On December Morocco s Sultan Mohammed III declared that American merchant ships would be under the protection of the sultanate and could thus enjoy safe passage The Moroccan American Treaty of Friendship stands as the United States oldest unbroken friendship treaty br br br French and Spanish protectorates br br As Europe industrialised Northwest Africa was increasingly prized for its potential for colonisation France showed a strong interest in Morocco as early as not only to protect the border of its Algerian territory but also because of the strategic position of Morocco with coasts on the Mediterranean and the open Atlantic In a dispute over Spain s Ceuta enclave led Spain to declare war Victorious Spain won a further enclave and an enlarged Ceuta in the settlement In Spain created a protectorate in the coastal areas of Morocco br br In France and Spain carved out zones of influence in Morocco Recognition by the United Kingdom of France s sphere of influence provoked a strong reaction from the German Empire and a crisis loomed in The matter was resolved at the Algeciras Conference in The Agadir Crisis of increased tensions between European powers The Treaty of Fez made Morocco a protectorate of France and triggered the Fez riots Spain continued to operate its coastal protectorate By the same treaty Spain assumed the role of protecting power over the northern coastal and southern Saharan zones br Tens of thousands of colonists entered Morocco Some bought up large amounts of rich agricultural land while others organised the exploitation and modernisation of mines and harbours Interest groups that formed among these elements continually pressured France to increase its control over Morocco with some Moroccan tribes allying with the French against other competing tribes from early on in its conquest The French colonial administrator Governor general Marshal Hubert Lyautey sincerely admired Moroccan culture and succeeded in imposing a joint Moroccan French administration while creating a modern school system Several divisions of Moroccan soldiers Goumiers or regular troops and officers served in the French army in both World War I and World War II and in the Spanish Nationalist Army in the Spanish Civil War and after Regulares The institution of slavery was abolished in br Between and an uprising in the Rif Mountains led by Abd el Krim led to the establishment of the Republic of the Rif The Spanish used anti civilian bombing raids and mustard gas to prevent the Rif republic from gaining independence They lost more than soldiers at Annual in July August alone The Riffi were eventually suppressed by by the Franco Spanish military The casualties on the Spanish French side were and from the Riffi died br br In the Istiqlal Party Independence Party was founded to press for independence with discreet US support Moroccan nationalists drew heavily on transnational activist networks for lobbying to end colonial rule primarily at the United Nations The Istiqlal Party subsequently provided most of the leadership for the nationalist movement br br France s exile of Sultan Mohammed V in to Madagascar and his replacement by the unpopular Mohammed Ben Aarafa sparked active opposition to the French and Spanish protectorates The most notable violence occurred in Oujda where Moroccans attacked French and other European residents in the streets France allowed Mohammed V to return in and the negotiations that led to Moroccan independence began the following year In March Morocco regained its independence from France as the Kingdom of Morocco A month later Spain forsook its protectorate in Northern Morocco to the new state but kept its two coastal enclaves Ceuta and Melilla on the Mediterranean coast which dated from earlier conquests but over which Morocco still claims sovereignty to this day br br br Post independence br br Sultan Mohammed became King in Upon the death of Mohammed V Hassan II became King of Morocco on March Morocco held its first general elections in However Hassan declared a state of emergency and suspended parliament in In and there were two failed attempts to depose the king and establish a republic A truth commission set up in to investigate human rights abuses during his reign confirmed nearly cases ranging from death in detention to forced exile Some people were recorded killed during Hassan s rule according to the truth commission br In the Sand War was fought between Algerian and Moroccan troops over Moroccan claims to parts of Algerian territory A formal peace agreement was signed in February however relations remained strained between the two countries following the conflict The Spanish enclave of Ifni in the south was returned to Morocco in br The Polisario movement was formed in with the aim of establishing an independent state in the Spanish Sahara On November King Hassan asked for volunteers to cross into the Spanish Sahara Some civilians were reported as being involved in the Green March A month later Spain agreed to leave the Spanish Sahara soon to become Western Sahara and to transfer it to joint Moroccan Mauritanian control despite the objections and threats of military intervention by Algeria Moroccan forces occupied the territory br Moroccan and Algerian troops soon clashed in Western Sahara Morocco and Mauritania divided up Western Sahara Fighting between the Moroccan military and Polisario forces continued for many years The prolonged war was a considerable financial drain on Morocco In Hassan cancelled planned elections amid political unrest and economic crisis In Morocco left the Organisation of African Unity in protest at the SADR s admission to the body Polisario claimed to have killed more than Moroccan soldiers between and Algerian authorities have estimated the number of Sahrawi refugees in Algeria to be Diplomatic relations with Algeria were restored in In a UN monitored ceasefire began in Western Sahara but the territory s status remains undecided and ceasefire violations are reported The following decade saw much wrangling over a proposed referendum on the future of the territory but the deadlock was not broken br br Political reforms in the s resulted in the establishment of a bicameral legislature with Morocco s first opposition led government coming to power King Hassan II died in and was succeeded by his son Mohammed VI He is a cautious moderniser who has introduced some economic and social liberalisation Mohammed VI paid a controversial visit to the Western Sahara in Morocco unveiled an autonomy blueprint for Western Sahara to the United Nations in The Polisario rejected the plan and put forward its own proposal Morocco and the Polisario Front held UN sponsored talks in New York City but failed to come to any agreement In security forces stormed a protest camp in the Western Sahara triggering violent demonstrations in the regional capital El Aai n br br In Morocco and Spain agreed to a US brokered resolution over the disputed island of Perejil Spanish troops had taken the normally uninhabited island after Moroccan soldiers landed on it and set up tents and a flag There were renewed tensions in as dozens of African migrants stormed the borders of the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta In response Spain deported dozens of the illegal migrants to Morocco from Melilla In the Spanish Premier Zapatero visited Spanish enclaves He was the first Spanish leader in years to make an official visit to the territories The following year Spanish King Juan Carlos I visited Ceuta and Melilla further angering Morocco which demanded control of the enclaves br During the Moroccan protests thousands of people rallied in Rabat and other cities calling for political reform and a new constitution curbing the powers of the king In July the King won a landslide victory in a referendum on a reformed constitution he had proposed to placate the Arab Spring protests In the first general elections that followed the moderate Islamist Justice and Development Party won a plurality of seats with Abdelilah Benkirane being designated as head of government per the new constitution Despite the reforms made by Mohammed VI demonstrators continued to call for deeper reforms Hundreds took part in a trade union rally in Casablanca in May Participants accused the government of failing to deliver on reforms br On December Israel Morocco normalisation agreement was announced and Morocco announced its intention to resume diplomatic relations with Israel Joint Declaration of the Kingdom of Morocco the United States of America and the State of Israel was signed on December br On August neighbouring Algeria cut diplomatic relations with Morocco accusing Morocco of supporting a separatist group and hostile actions against Algeria Morocco called the decision unjustified br On September a magnitude earthquake hit Morocco killing more than people and injuring thousands The epicentre of the quake was around km southwest of city of Marrakech br br br Geography br br Morocco has a coast by the Atlantic Ocean that reaches past the Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean Sea It is bordered by Spain to the north a water border through the Strait and land borders with three small Spanish controlled exclaves Ceuta Melilla and Pe n de V lez de la Gomera Algeria to the east and Western Sahara to the south Since Morocco controls most of Western Sahara its de facto southern boundary is with Mauritania br The internationally recognised borders of the country lie between latitudes and N and longitudes and W br The geography of Morocco spans from the Atlantic Ocean to mountainous areas to the Sahara desert Morocco is a Northern African country bordering the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea between Algeria and the annexed Western Sahara It is one of only three nations along with Spain and France to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines br A large part of Morocco is mountainous The Atlas Mountains are located mainly in the centre and the south of the country The Rif Mountains are located in the north of the country Both ranges are mainly inhabited by the Berber people Its total area is about km sq mi Algeria borders Morocco to the east and southeast though the border between the two countries has been closed since br Spanish territory in Northwest Africa neighbouring Morocco comprises five enclaves on the Mediterranean coast Ceuta Melilla Pe n de V lez de la Gomera Pe n de Alhucemas the Chafarinas islands and the disputed islet Perejil Off the Atlantic coast the Canary Islands belong to Spain whereas Madeira to the north is Portuguese To the north Morocco is bordered by the Strait of Gibraltar where international shipping has unimpeded transit passage between the Atlantic and Mediterranean br The Rif mountains stretch over the region bordering the Mediterranean from the north west to the north east The Atlas Mountains run down the backbone of the country from the northeast to the southwest Most of the southeast portion of the country is in the Sahara Desert and as such is generally sparsely populated and unproductive economically Most of the population lives to the north of these mountains while to the south lies the Western Sahara a former Spanish colony that was annexed by Morocco in see Green March Morocco claims that the Western Sahara is part of its territory and refers to that as its Southern Provinces br Morocco s capital city is Rabat its largest city is its main port Casablanca Other cities recording a population over in the Moroccan census are Fes Marrakesh Meknes Sal and Tangier br Morocco is represented in the ISO alpha geographical encoding standard by the symbol MA This code was used as the basis for Morocco s internet domain ma br br br Climate br br In area Morocco s climate is mainly hot summer Mediterranean Csa and hot desert BWh zones br Central mountain ranges and the effects of the cold Canary Current off the Atlantic coast are significant factors in Morocco s relatively large variety of vegetation zones ranging from lush forests in the northern and central mountains giving way to steppe semi arid and desert areas in the eastern and southern regions The Moroccan coastal plains experience moderate temperatures even in summer br In the Rif Middle and High Atlas Mountains there exist several different types of climates Mediterranean along the coastal lowlands giving way to a humid temperate climate at higher elevations with sufficient moisture to allow for the growth of different species of oaks moss carpets junipers and Atlantic fir which is a royal conifer tree endemic to Morocco In the valleys fertile soils and high precipitation allow for the growth of thick and lush forests Cloud forests can be found in the west of the Rif Mountains and Middle Atlas Mountains At higher elevations the climate becomes alpine in character and can sustain ski resorts br Southeast of the Atlas mountains near the Algerian borders the climate becomes very dry with long and hot summers Extreme heat and low moisture levels are especially pronounced in the lowland regions east of the Atlas range due to the rain shadow effect of the mountain system The southeasternmost portions of Morocco are very hot and include portions of the Sahara desert where vast swathes of sand dunes and rocky plains are dotted with lush oases br In contrast to the Sahara region in the south coastal plains are fertile in the central and northern regions of the country and comprise the backbone of the country s agriculture in which of the population live The direct exposure to the North Atlantic Ocean the proximity to mainland Europe and the long stretched Rif and Atlas mountains are the factors of the rather European like climate in the northern half of the country That makes Morocco a country of contrasts Forested areas cover about of the country while arable land accounts for Approximately of Moroccan land is irrigated for agricultural use br br In general apart from the southeast regions pre Saharan and desert areas Morocco s climate and geography are very similar to the Iberian peninsula Thus Morocco has the following climate zones br br Mediterranean Dominates the coastal Mediterranean regions of the country along the km strip and some parts of the Atlantic coast Summers are hot to moderately hot and dry average highs are between C F and C F Winters are generally mild and wet daily average temperatures hover around C F to C F and average low are around C F to C F typical to the coastal areas of the west Mediterranean Annual Precipitation in this area vary from to mm in the west to mm in the east Notable cities that fall into this zone are Tangier Tetouan Al Hoceima Nador and Safi br Sub Mediterranean It influences cities that show Mediterranean characteristics but remain fairly influenced by other climates owing to their either relative elevation or direct exposure to the North Atlantic Ocean We thus have two main influencing climates br Oceanic Determined by the cooler summers where highs are around C F and in terms of the Essaouira region are almost always around C F The medium daily temperatures can get as low as C F while winters are chilly to mild and wet Annual precipitation varies from to mm Notable cities that fall into this zone are Rabat Casablanca K nitra Sal and Essaouira br Continental Determined by the bigger gap between highs and lows that results in hotter summers and colder winters than found in typical Mediterranean zones In summer daily highs can get as high as C F during heat waves but usually are between C F and C F However temperatures drop as the sun sets Night temperatures usually fall below C F and sometimes as low as C F in mid summer Winters are cooler and can get below the freezing point multiple times between December and February Also snow can fall occasionally F s for example registered C F in winter Annual precipitation varies between and mm Notable cities are F s Mekn s Chefchaouen Beni Mellal and Taza br Continental Dominates the mountainous regions of the north and central parts of the country where summers are hot to very hot with highs between C F and C F Winters on the other hand are cold and lows usually go beyond the freezing point And when cold damp air comes to Morocco from the northwest for a few days temperatures sometimes get below C F It often snows abundantly in this part of the country Precipitation varies between and mm Notable cities are Khenifra Imilchil Midelt and Azilal br Alpine Found in some parts of the Middle Atlas Mountain range and the eastern part of the High Atlas Mountain range Summers are very warm to moderately hot and winters are longer cold and snowy Precipitation varies between and mm In summer highs barely go above C F and lows are cool and average below C F In winters highs average around C F and lows go well below the freezing point In this part of country there are many ski resorts such as Oukaimeden and Mischliefen Notable cities are Ifrane Azrou and Boulmane br Semi arid This type of climate is found in the south of the country and some parts of the east of the country where rainfall is lower and annual precipitations are between and mm However one usually finds Mediterranean characteristics in those regions such as the precipitation pattern and thermal attributes Notable cities are Agadir Marrakesh and Oujda br South of Agadir and east of Jerada near the Algerian borders arid and desert climate starts to prevail br Due to Morocco s proximity to the Sahara desert and the North Sea of the Atlantic Ocean two phenomena occur to influence the regional seasonal temperatures either by raising temperatures by degrees Celsius when sirocco blows from the east creating heatwaves or by lowering temperatures by degrees Celsius when cold damp air blows from the northwest creating a coldwave or cold spell However these phenomena do not last for more than two to five days on average br Climate change is expected to significantly impact Morocco on multiple dimensions As a coastal country with hot and arid climates environmental impacts are likely to be wide and varied As of the Climate Change Performance Index Morocco was ranked second in preparedness behind Sweden br br br Biodiversity br br Morocco has a wide range of biodiversity It is part of the Mediterranean basin an area with exceptional concentrations of endemic species undergoing rapid rates of habitat loss and is therefore considered to be a hotspot for conservation priority Avifauna are notably variant The avifauna of Morocco includes a total of species five of which have been introduced by humans and are rarely or accidentally seen br The Barbary lion hunted to extinction in the wild was a subspecies native to Morocco and is a national emblem The last Barbary lion in the wild was shot in the Atlas Mountains in The other two primary predators of northern Africa the Atlas bear and Barbary leopard are now extinct and critically endangered respectively Relic populations of the West African crocodile persisted in the Draa river until the th century br The Barbary macaque a primate endemic to Morocco and Algeria is also facing extinction due to offtake for trade human interruption urbanisation wood and real estate expansion that diminish forested area the macaque s habitat br Trade of animals and plants for food pets medicinal purposes souvenirs and photo props is common across Morocco despite laws making much of it illegal This trade is unregulated and causing unknown reductions of wild populations of native Moroccan wildlife Because of the proximity of northern Morocco to Europe species such as cacti tortoises mammal skins and high value birds falcons and bustards are harvested in various parts of the country and exported in appreciable quantities with especially large volumes of eel harvested tons exported to the Far East in the period br Morocco is home to six terrestrial ecoregions Mediterranean conifer and mixed forests Mediterranean High Atlas juniper steppe

opposition socialist leader Abderrahmane Youssoufi and composed largely of ministers drawn from opposition parties was formed Prime Minister Youssoufi s government was the first ever government drawn primarily from opposition parties and also represents the first opportunity for a coalition of socialists left of centre and nationalist parties to be included in the government until October It was also the first time in the modern political history of the Arab world that the opposition assumed power following an election The current government is headed by Aziz Akhannouch br The Constitution of Morocco provides for a monarchy with a Parliament and an independent judiciary With the constitutional reforms the King of Morocco retains less executive powers whereas those of the prime minister have been enlarged br The constitution grants the king honorific powers among other powers he is both the secular political leader and the Commander of the Faithful as a direct descendant of the Prophet Mohammed He presides over the Council of Ministers appoints the Prime Minister from the political party that has won the most seats in the parliamentary elections and on recommendations from the latter appoints the members of the government br The constitution of theoretically allowed the king to terminate the tenure of any minister and after consultation with the heads of the higher and

that Morocco was the first country in the world to recognise US sovereignty in br After gaining independence Morocco established strong ties with the United States receiving significant economic and military aid This partnership flourished during the Cold War with Morocco becoming a key ally against communist expansion in North Africa In return the US supported Morocco s territorial ambitions and
