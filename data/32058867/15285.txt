title: Internet Engineering Task Force
id: 15285
The Internet Engineering Task Force IETF is a standards organization for the Internet and is responsible for the technical standards that make up the Internet protocol suite TCP IP It has no formal membership roster or requirements and all its participants are volunteers Their work is usually funded by employers or other sponsors br The IETF was initially supported by the federal government of the United States but since has operated under the auspices of the Internet Society a non profit organization with local chapters around the world br br br Organization br There is no membership in the IETF Anyone can participate by signing up to a working group mailing list or registering for an IETF meeting br The IETF operates in a bottom up task creation mode largely driven by Working Groups Each working group has an appointed chairperson or sometimes several co chairs a charter that describes its focus and what it is expected to produce and when It is open to all who want to participate and holds discussions on an open mailing list or at IETF meetings where the entry fee in was between US Early Registration and per person for the week Significant discounts are available for students and remote participants Because the majority of the IETF s work is done via mailing lists meeting attendance is not required for contributors br Rough consensus is the primary basis for decision making There are no formal voting procedures Each working group is intended to complete work on its topic and then disband In some cases the working group will instead have its charter updated to take on new tasks as appropriate br The working groups are grouped into areas by subject matter Current areas are Applications General Internet Operations and Management Real time Applications and Infrastructure Routing Security and Transport Each area is overseen by an area director AD with most areas having two co ADs The ADs are responsible for appointing working group chairs The area directors together with the IETF Chair form the Internet Engineering Steering Group IESG which is responsible for the overall operation of the IETF br br The Internet Architecture Board IAB oversees the IETF s external relationships and relations with the RFC Editor The IAB provides long range technical direction for Internet development The IAB is also jointly responsible for the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee IAOC which oversees the IETF Administrative Support Activity IASA which provides logistical etc support for the IETF The IAB also manages the Internet Research Task Force IRTF with which the IETF has a number of cross group relations br A Nominating Committee NomCom of ten randomly chosen volunteers who participate regularly at meetings is vested with the power to appoint reappoint and remove members of the IESG IAB IASA and the IAOC To date no one has been removed by a NomCom although several people have resigned their positions requiring replacements br In the IETF changed from an activity supported by the US Federal Government to an independent international activity associated with the Internet Society a US based c organization Because the IETF itself does not have members nor is it an organization per se the Internet Society provides the financial and legal framework for the activities of the IETF and its sister bodies IAB IRTF IETF activities are funded by meeting fees meeting sponsors and by the Internet Society via its organizational membership and the proceeds of the Public Interest Registry br In December the IETF Trust was established to manage the copyrighted materials produced by the IETF br br br Steering group br The Internet Engineering Steering Group IESG is a body composed of the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF chair and area directors It provides the final technical review of Internet standards and is responsible for day to day management of the IETF It receives appeals of the decisions of the working groups and the IESG makes the decision to progress documents in the standards track br The chair of the IESG is the director of the General Area who also serves as the overall IETF Chair Members of the IESG include the two directors of each of the following areas br br Applications Area app br Internet Area int br Operations Network Management Area ops br Routing Area rtg br Real time Applications and Infrastructure Area rai br Security Area sec br Transport and Services Area tsv frequently also referred to as the Transport Area br Liaison and ex officio members include br br IETF Executive Director br IAB Chair br Appointed Liaison from the IAB br Liaison from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority IANA br Liaison from the Request for Comments RFC Editor br br br Early leadership and administrative history br br The Gateway Algorithms and Data Structures GADS Task Force was the precursor to the IETF Its chairman was David L Mills of the University of Delaware br In January the Internet Activities Board IAB now called the Internet Architecture Board decided to divide GADS into two entities an Internet Architecture INARC Task Force chaired by Mills to pursue research goals and the IETF to handle nearer term engineering and technology transfer issues The first IETF chair was Mike Corrigan who was then the technical program manager for the Defense Data Network DDN Also in after leaving DARPA Robert E Kahn founded the Corporation for National Research Initiatives CNRI which began providing administrative support to the IETF br In Corrigan was succeeded as IETF chair by Phill Gross br Effective March but providing support dating back to late CNRI and NSF entered into a Cooperative Agreement No NCR wherein CNRI agreed to create and provide a secretariat for the overall coordination management and support of the work of the IAB its various task forces and particularly the IETF br In CNRI supported the formation and early funding of the Internet Society which took on the IETF as a fiscally sponsored project along with the IAB the IRTF and the organization of annual INET meetings Phill Gross continued to serve as IETF chair throughout this transition Cerf Kahn and Lyman Chapin announced the formation of ISOC as a professional society to facilitate support and promote the evolution and growth of the Internet as a global research communications infrastructure At the first board meeting of the Internet Society Vint Cerf representing CNRI offered In the event a deficit occurs CNRI has agreed to contribute up to USD to offset it In Cerf continued to support the formation of ISOC while working for CNRI and the role of ISOC in the official procedures for creating and documenting Internet Standards was codified in the IETF s RFC br In IETF s RFC describes ISOC s role in the IETF as being purely administrative and ISOC as having no influence whatsoever on the Internet Standards process the Internet Standards or their technical content br In CNRI established Foretec Seminars Inc Foretec a for profit subsidiary to take over providing Secretariat services to the IETF Foretec provided these services until at least By Foretec was dissolved br In IETF s RFC described IETFs role in appointing board members to the ISOC s board of directors br In ISOC established The IETF Administration LLC a separate LLC to handle the administration of the IETF In the LLC issued a call for proposals to provide secretariat services to the IETF br br br Meetings br The first IETF meeting was attended by US Federal Government funded researchers on January It was a continuation of the work of the earlier GADS Task Force Representatives from non governmental entities such as gateway vendors were invited to attend starting with the fourth IETF meeting in October Since that time all IETF meetings have been open to the public br Initially the IETF met quarterly but from it has been meeting three times a year The initial meetings were very small with fewer than people in attendance at each of the first five meetings The maximum attendance during the first meetings was only attendees This occurred at the th meeting held during January These meetings have grown in both participation and scope a great deal since the early s it had a maximum attendance of at the December IETF held in San Diego California Attendance declined with industry restructuring during the early s and is currently around br The location for IETF meetings vary greatly A list of past and future meeting locations can be found on the IETF meetings page The IETF strives to hold its meetings near where most of the IETF volunteers are located For many years the goal was three meetings a year with two in North America and one in either Europe or Asia alternating between them every other year The current goal is to hold three meetings in North America two in Europe and one in Asia during a two year period However corporate sponsorship of the meetings is also an important factor and the schedule has been modified from time to time in order to decrease operational costs br The IETF also organizes hackathons during the IETF meetings The focus is on implementing code that will improve standards in terms of quality and interoperability br br br Operations br The details of IETF operations have changed considerably as the organization has grown but the basic mechanism remains publication of proposed specifications development based on the proposals review and independent testing by participants and republication as a revised proposal a draft proposal or eventually as an Internet Standard IETF standards are developed in an open all inclusive process in which any interested individual can participate All IETF documents are freely available over the Internet and can be reproduced at will Multiple working useful interoperable implementations are the chief requirement before an IETF proposed specification can become a standard Most specifications are focused on single protocols rather than tightly interlocked systems This has allowed the protocols to be used in many different systems and its standards are routinely re used by bodies which create full fledged architectures e g GPP IMS br Because it relies on volunteers and uses rough consensus and running code as its touchstone results can be slow whenever the number of volunteers is either too small to make progress or so large as to make consensus difficult or when volunteers lack the necessary expertise For protocols like SMTP which is used to transport e mail for a user community in the many hundreds of millions there is also considerable resistance to any change that is not fully backward compatible except for IPv Work within the IETF on ways to improve the speed of the standards making process is ongoing but because the number of volunteers with opinions on it is very great consensus on improvements has been slow to develop br The IETF cooperates with the W C ISO IEC ITU and other standards bodies br Statistics are available that show who the top contributors by RFC publication are While the IETF only allows for participation by individuals and not by corporations or governments sponsorship information is available from these statistics br br br Chairs br The IETF Chairperson is selected by the Nominating Committee NomCom process for a year renewable term Before the IETF Chair was selected by the IAB br A list of the past and current Chairs of the IETF follows br br br Topics of interest br The IETF works on a broad range of networking technologies which provide foundation for the Internet s growth and evolution br br br Automated network management br It aims to improve the efficiency in management of networks as they grow in size and complexity The IETF is also standardizing protocols for autonomic networking that enables networks to be self managing br br br Internet of things br It is a network of physical objects or things that are embedded with electronics sensors software and also enables objects to exchange data with operator manufacturer and other connected devices Several IETF working groups are developing protocols that are directly relevant to IoT br br br New transport technology br Its development provides the ability of internet applications to send data over the Internet There are some well established transport protocols such as TCP Transmission Control Protocol and UDP User Datagram Protocol which are continuously getting extended and refined to meet the needs of the global Internet br br br IETF areas br It divides its work into a number of areas that have Working groups that have a relation to an area s focus Area Directors handle the primary task of area management Area Directors may be advised by one or more Directorates The area structure is defined by the Internet Engineering Steering Group The Nominations Committee can be used to add new members
