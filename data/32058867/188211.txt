title: Pidgin (software)
id: 188211
Pidgin formerly named Gaim is a free and open source multi platform instant messaging client based on a library named libpurple that has support for many instant messaging protocols allowing the user to simultaneously log in to various services from a single application with a single interface for both popular and obsolete protocols from AIM to Discord thus avoiding the hassle of having to deal with new software for each device and protocol br As of the number of Pidgin users was estimated to be over three million br Pidgin is widely used for its Off the Record Messaging OTR plugin which offers end to end encryption For this reason it is included in the privacy and anonymity focused operating system Tails br br br History br br The program was originally written by Mark Spencer an Auburn University sophomore as an emulation of AOL s IM program AOL Instant Messenger on Linux using the GTK toolkit The earliest archived release was on December It was named GAIM GTK AOL Instant Messenger accordingly The emulation was not based on reverse engineering but instead relied on information about the protocol that AOL had published on the web Development was assisted by some of AOL s technical staff Support for other IM protocols was added soon thereafter br On July Pidgin scored seven out of seven points on the Electronic Frontier Foundation s secure messaging scorecard They have received points for having communications encrypted in transit having communications encrypted with keys the providers don t have access to end to end encryption making it possible for users to independently verify their correspondent s identities having past communications secure if the keys are stolen forward secrecy having their code open to independent review open source having their security designs well documented and having recent independent security audits br br br Naming dispute br In response to pressure from AOL the program was renamed to the acronymous but lowercase gaim As AOL Instant Messenger gained popularity AOL trademarked its acronym AIM leading to a lengthy legal struggle with the creators of GAIM who kept the matter largely secret br On April the project development team announced the results of their settlement with AOL which included a series of name changes Gaim became Pidgin libgaim became libpurple and gaim text the command line interface version became Finch The name Pidgin was chosen in reference to the term pidgin which describes communication between people who do not share a common language The name purple refers to prpl the internal libgaim name for an IM protocol plugin br Due to the legal issues version of the software was frozen in beta stages Following the settlement it was announced that the first official release of Pidgin was hoped to occur during the two weeks from April However Pidgin was not released as scheduled Pidgin developers announced on April that the delay was due to the preferences directory gaim br Pidgin was released on May Other visual changes were made to the interface in this version including updated icons br br br Features br br Pidgin provides a graphical front end for libpurple using GTK Libpurple supports many instant messaging protocols br Pidgin supports multiple operating systems including Windows and many Unix like systems such as Linux the BSDs and AmigaOS It is included by default in the operating systems Tails Trisquel and Xubuntu br br br Pluggability br The program is designed to be extended with plugins Plugins are often written by third party developers They can be used to add support for protocols which is useful for those such as Skype or Discord which have licensing issues however the users data and interactions are still subject to their policies and eavesdropping They can also add other significant features For example the Off the Record Messaging OTR plugin provides end to end encryption br The TLS encryption system is pluggable allowing different TLS libraries to be easily substituted GnuTLS is the default and NSS is also supported Some operating systems ports such as OpenBSD s choose to use OpenSSL or LibreSSL by default instead br br br Contacts br Contacts with multiple protocols can be grouped into one single contact instead of managing multiple protocols and contacts can be given aliases or placed into groups br To reach users as they log on or a status change occurs such as moving from Away to Available Pidgin supports on action automated scripts called Buddy Pounces to automatically reach the user in customizable ways br br br File transfer br Pidgin supports file transfers for many protocols Direct peer to peer file transfers are supported over protocols such as XMPP br br br Voice and video chat br As of version released on August Pidgin supports voice video calls using Farstream As of July calls can only be initiated through the XMPP protocol br br br Miscellaneous br Further features include support for themes emoticons spell checking and notification area integration br br br Supported protocols br The following protocols are officially supported by Pidgin without any extensions or plugins br br Some XMPP servers provide transports which allow users to access networks using non XMPP protocols without having to install plugins or additional software Pidgin s support for XMPP means that these transports can be used to communicate via otherwise unsupported protocols including not only instant messaging protocols but also protocols such as SMS or E mail br Additional protocols supported by third party plugins include Discord Telegram Microsoft OCS LCS extended SIP SIMPLE Facebook Messenger QQ Skype via skype pidgin plugin WhatsApp and Signal br br br Plugins br Various other features are supported using third party plugins Such features include br br Discord text chat via the purple discord plugin br Facebook chat via purple facebook br Google Chat via purple googlechat br ICQ via icyque br microblogs GNU social Twitter br Slack software via slack libpurple br Skype text chat via skype pidgin renamed SkypeWeb plugin br Telegram software via tdlib purple br End to end encryption through Off the Record Messaging OTR br Adding mathematical formulas written in LaTeX to conversations br Notifications such as showing toaster popups or Snarl notifications or lighting LEDs on laptops br Showing contacts what the user is listening to in various media players br Watching videos directly into a conversation when receiving a video sharing website link YouTube Vimeo br br br Criticisms br As observed by Wired in the libpurple codebase is known for its bountiful security bugs In security vulnerabilities were already discovered in popular OTR plugins using libpurple br As of version and later the ability to manually resize the text input box of conversations was removed This led to a fork Carrier originally named Funpidgin br Passwords are stored in a plaintext file readable by any person or program that can access the user s files Version of Pidgin no announced release date will support password storage in system keyrings such as KWallet and the GNOME Keyring for Linux Keychain for macOS and winCred API for Windows br Pidgin does not currently support pausing or reattempting file transfers br Pidgin does not allow disabling the group sorting on the contact list br br br Other notable software based on libpurple br Adium and the discontinued Proteus both for macOS br Meebo web based no longer available br Telepathy Haze a Tube for some of the protocols supported by the Telepathy framework br QuteCom cross platform focused on VoIP and video Discontinued br Instantbird discontinued cross platform based on Mozilla s Gecko engine br BitlBee and Minbif are IRCd like gateways to multiple IM networks and can be compiled with libpurple to increase functionality br br br See also br br br br br br External links br br Official website
