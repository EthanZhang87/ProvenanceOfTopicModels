Organization of Ibero American States br br br Etymology br br M xihco is the Nahuatl term for the heartland of the Aztec Empire namely the Valley of Mexico and surrounding territories with its people being known as the Mexica It is generally believed that the toponym for the valley was the origin of the primary ethnonym for the Aztec Triple Alliance but it may have been the other way around In the colonial era Mexico was known as New Spain In the eighteenth century this central region became the Intendency of Mexico during the reorganization of the empire the Bourbon Reforms After New Spain achieved independence from the Spanish Empire in and became a sovereign state the territory came to be known as the State of Mexico with the new country being named after its capital Mexico City The country s official name has changed as the form of government has changed The declaration of independence signed on November by the deputies of the Congress of An huac called the territory Am rica Septentrional Northern America the Plan of Iguala also used Am rica Septentrional On two occasions and the country was known as Imperio Mexicano Mexican Empire All three federal constitutions and the current constitution used the name Estados Unidos Mexicanos or the variant Estados Unidos Mexicanos all of which have been translated as United Mexican States The phrase Rep blica Mexicana Mexican Republic was used in the Constitutional Laws br br br History br br br Indigenous civilizations before European contact pre br br The earliest human artifacts in Mexico are chips of stone tools found near campfire remains in the Valley of Mexico and radiocarbon dated to circa years ago Mexico is the site of the domestication of maize tomato and beans which produced an agricultural surplus This enabled the transition from paleo Indian hunter gatherers to sedentary agricultural villages beginning around BC br In the subsequent formative eras maize cultivation and cultural traits such as a mythological and religious complex and a vigesimal base numeric system were diffused from the Mexican cultures to the rest of the Mesoamerican culture area In this period villages became more dense in terms of population becoming socially stratified with an artisan class and developing into chiefdoms The most powerful rulers had religious and political power organizing the construction of large ceremonial centers br The earliest complex civilization in Mexico was the Olmec culture which flourished on the Gulf Coast from around BC Olmec cultural traits diffused through Mexico into other formative era cultures in Chiapas Oaxaca and the Valley of Mexico The formative period saw the spread of distinct religious and symbolic traditions as well as artistic and architectural complexes The formative era of Mesoamerica is considered one of the six independent cradles of civilization In the subsequent pre classical period the Maya and Zapotec civilizations developed complex centers at Calakmul and Monte Alb n respectively During this period the first true Mesoamerican writing systems were developed in the Epi Olmec and Zapotec cultures The Mesoamerican writing tradition reached its height in the Classic Maya Hieroglyphic script The earliest written histories date from this era The tradition of writing was important after the Spanish conquest in with indigenous scribes learning to write their languages in alphabetic letters while also continuing to create pictorial texts br In Central Mexico the height of the classic period saw the ascendancy of Teotihuac n which formed a military and commercial empire Teotihuacan with a population of more than people had some of the largest pyramidal structures in the pre Columbian Americas After the collapse of Teotihuac n around AD competition ensued between several important political centers in central Mexico such as Xochicalco and Cholula At this time during the Epi Classic Nahua peoples began moving south into Mesoamerica from the North and became politically and culturally dominant in central Mexico as they displaced speakers of Oto Manguean languages During the early post classic era ca AD Central Mexico was dominated by the Toltec culture Oaxaca by the Mixtec and the lowland Maya area had important centers at Chich n Itz and Mayap n Toward the end of the post Classic period the Mexica established dominance establishing a political and economic empire based in the city of Tenochtitlan modern Mexico City extending from central Mexico to the border with Guatemala Alexander von Humboldt popularized the modern usage of Aztec as a collective term applied to all the people linked by trade custom religion and language to the Mexica state and xc n Tlaht l y n the Triple Alliance In with the publication of the work of William H Prescott it was adopted by most of the world This usage has been the subject of debate since the late th century br br br Spanish conquest and colonial era br br Although the Spanish Empire had established colonies in the Caribbean starting in only in the second decade of the sixteenth century did they begin exploring the east coast of Mexico The Spanish first learned of Mexico during the Juan de Grijalva expedition of The Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire began in February when Hern n Cort s founded the Spanish city of Veracruz The capture of Tenochtitlan and immediate founding of the Spanish capital Mexico City on its ruins was the beginning of a year long colonial era during which Mexico was known as Nueva Espa a New Spain Two factors made Mexico a jewel in the Spanish Empire the existence of large hierarchically organized Mesoamerican populations that rendered tribute and performed obligatory labor and the discovery of vast silver deposits in northern Mexico br br The Kingdom of New Spain was created from the remnants of the Aztec empire The two pillars of Spanish rule were the State and the Roman Catholic Church both under the authority of the Spanish crown In the pope had granted sweeping powers to the Spanish monarchy for its overseas empire with the proviso that the crown spread Christianity in its new realms In King Charles I created the Council of the Indies based in Spain to oversee State power in its overseas territories in New Spain the crown established a high court in Mexico City the Real Audiencia royal audience or royal tribunal and then in created the Viceroyalty of New Spain The viceroy was the highest official of the State In the religious sphere the Diocese of Mexico was created in and elevated to the Archdiocese of Mexico in with the archbishop as the head of the ecclesiastical hierarchy Castilian Spanish was the language of rulers The Catholic faith was the only one permitted with non Catholics and Catholics excluding Indians holding unorthodox views being subject to the Mexican Inquisition established in br br Spanish military forces sometimes accompanied by native allies led expeditions to conquer territory or quell rebellions through the colonial era Notable Amerindian revolts in sporadically populated northern New Spain include the Chichimeca War Tepehu n Revolt and the Pueblo Revolt the Tzeltal Rebellion of was a regional Maya revolt Most rebellions were small scale and local posing no major threat to the ruling elites To protect Mexico from the attacks of English French and Dutch pirates and protect the Crown s monopoly of revenue only two ports were open to foreign trade Veracruz on the Atlantic connecting to Spain and Acapulco on the Pacific connecting to the Philippines Among the best known pirate attacks are the Sack of Campeche and Attack on Veracruz Of greater concern to the crown was the issue of foreign invasion especially after Britain seized in the Spanish ports of Havana and Manila in the Seven Years War It created a standing military increased coastal fortifications and expanded the northern presidios and missions into Alta California The volatility of the urban poor in Mexico City was evident in the riot in the Z calo The riot over the price of maize escalated to a full scale attack on the seats of power with the viceregal palace and the archbishop s residence attacked by the mob br br br Independence era br br The upheaval in the Spanish Empire that resulted in the independence of most of its New World territories was due to Napoleon Bonaparte s invasion of Spain in In Mexico elites argued that sovereignty now reverted to the people and that town councils cabildos were the most representative bodies On September secular priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla declared against bad government in the small town of Dolores Guanajuato This event known as the Cry of Dolores Spanish Grito de Dolores is commemorated each year on September as Mexico s independence day Hidalgo and some of his soldiers were eventually captured Hidalgo was defrocked and they were executed by firing squad on July br br The first years after Mexico s independence were marked by political instability and the changing of the Mexican state from a transient monarchy to a fragile federated republic There were military coups d tat foreign invasions ideological conflict between Conservatives and Liberals and economic stagnation Catholicism remained the only permitted religious faith and the Catholic Church as an institution retained its special privileges prestige and property a bulwark of Conservatism The army another Conservative dominated institution also retained its privileges Former Royal Army General Agust n de Iturbide became regent as newly independent Mexico sought a constitutional monarch from Europe When no member of a European royal house desired the position Iturbide himself was declared Emperor Agust n I The United States was the first country to recognize Mexico s independence sending an ambassador to the court and sending a message to Europe via the Monroe Doctrine not to intervene in Mexico The emperor s rule was short and he was overthrown by army officers in the Plan of Casa Mata br After the forced abdication of the monarch Central America and Chiapas left the union to form the Federal Republic of Central America In a constitution of a federated republic was promulgated and the First Mexican Republic was established Former insurgent General Guadalupe Victoria became the first president of the republic the first of many army generals to hold the presidency br In former insurgent general and fierce Liberal Vicente Guerrero a signatory of the Plan of Iguala that achieved independence became president in a disputed election During his short term in office from April to December he abolished slavery As a visibly mixed race man of modest origins Guerrero was seen by white political elites as an interloper His Conservative vice president former Royalist General Anastasio Bustamante led a coup against him and Guerrero was judicially murdered There was constant strife between the Liberals also known as Federalists who were supporters of a federal form of decentralized government and their political rivals the Conservatives also known as Centralists who proposed a hierarchical form of government br Mexico s ability to maintain its independence and establish a viable government was in question Spain attempted to reconquer its former colony during the s but eventually recognized its independence France attempted to recoup losses it claimed for its citizens during Mexico s unrest and blockaded the Gulf Coast during the so called Pastry War of General Antonio L pez de Santa Anna emerged as a national hero because of his role in both these conflicts Santa Anna came to dominate the politics for the next years often known as the Age of Santa Anna until his overthrow in br br Mexico also contended with indigenous groups that controlled the territory that Mexico claimed in the north For example the Comanche controlled a huge territory in sparsely populated central and northern Texas Wanting to stabilize and develop that area and as few people from central Mexico had chosen to resettle to this remote and hostile territory the Mexican government encouraged Anglo American immigration into present day Texas a region that bordered that United States Mexico by law was a Catholic country the Anglo Americans were primarily Protestant English speakers from the southern United States Some brought their black slaves which after was contrary to Mexican law In Santa Anna sought to centralize government rule in Mexico suspending the constitution and promulgating the Seven Laws which placed power in his hands As a result civil war spread across the country Three new governments declared independence the Republic of Texas the Republic of the Rio Grande and the Republic of Yucat n The largest blow to Mexico was the U S invasion of Mexico in in the Mexican American War Mexico lost much of its sparsely populated northern territory sealed in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo Despite that disastrous loss Santa Anna returned to the presidency yet again before being ousted and exiled in the Liberal Revolution of Ayutla br br br Liberal era br br The overthrow of Santa Anna and the establishment of a civilian government by Liberals allowed them to enact laws that they considered vital for Mexico s economic development The Liberal Reform attempted to modernize Mexico s economy and institutions along liberal principles They promulgated a new Constitution of separating Church and State stripping the Church and the military of their special privileges fueros mandating the sale of Church owned property and sale of indigenous community lands and secularizing education Conservatives revolted touching off civil war between rival Liberal and Conservative governments br The Liberals defeated the Conservative army on the battlefield but Conservatives sought another solution to gain power via foreign intervention by the French Mexican conservatives asked Emperor Napoleon III to place a European monarch as head of state in Mexico The French Army defeated the Mexican Army and placed Maximilian Habsburg on the newly established throne of Mexico supported by Mexican Conservatives and propped up by the French Army The Liberal Republic under Benito Ju rez was a government in internal exile but with the end of the Civil War in the U S in April that government began aiding the Mexican Republic Two years later the French Army withdrew its support but Maximilian remained in Mexico Republican forces captured him and he was executed The Restored Republic saw the return of Ju rez the personification of the embattled republic as president br The Conservatives had been not only defeated militarily but also discredited politically for their collaboration with the French invaders Liberalism became synonymous with patriotism The Mexican Army that had its roots in the colonial royal army and then the army of the early republic was destroyed New military leaders had emerged from the War of the Reform and the conflict with the French most notably Porfirio D az a hero of the Cinco de Mayo who now sought civilian power Ju rez won re election in but was challenged by D az D az then rebelled crushed by Ju rez Having won re election Ju rez died in office in July and Liberal Sebasti n Lerdo de Tejada became president declaring a religion of the state for the rule of law peace and order When Lerdo ran for re election D az rebelled against the civilian president issuing the Plan of Tuxtepec D az had more support and waged guerrilla warfare against Lerdo On the verge of D az s victory on the battlefield Lerdo fled from office into exile br br After the turmoil in Mexico from to the year rule of Liberal General Porfirio D az r allowed Mexico to rapidly modernize in a period characterized as one of order and progress The Porfiriato was characterized by economic stability and growth significant foreign investment and influence an expansion of the railroad network and telecommunications and investments in the arts and sciences br D az ruled with a group of advisors that became known as the cient ficos scientists The most influential cient fico was Secretary of Finance Jos Yves Limantour The Porfirian regime was influenced by positivism They rejected theology and idealism in favor of scientific methods being applied towards national development An integral aspect of the liberal project was secular education The D az government led a protracted conflict against the Yaqui that culminated with the forced relocation of thousands of Yaqui to Yucat n and Oaxaca As the centennial of independence approached D az gave an interview where he said he was not going to run in the elections when he would be Political opposition had been suppressed and there were few avenues for a new generation of leaders But his announcement set off a frenzy of political activity including the unlikely candidacy of the scion of a rich landowning family Francisco I Madero Madero won a surprising amount of political support when D az changed his mind and ran in the election jailing Madero The September centennial celebration of independence was the last celebration of the Porfiriato The Mexican Revolution starting in saw a decade of civil war the wind that swept Mexico br br br Mexican Revolution br br The Mexican Revolution was a decade long transformational conflict It began with scattered uprisings against President D az after the fraudulent election his resignation in May demobilization of rebel forces and an interim presidency of a member of the old guard and the democratic election of a rich civilian landowner Francisco I Madero in fall In February a military coup d tat overthrew Madero s government with the support of the U S resulting in Madero s murder by agents of Federal Army General Victoriano Huerta A coalition of anti Huerta forces in the North the Constitutional Army led by Governor of Coahuila Venustiano Carranza and a peasant army in the South under Emiliano Zapata defeated the Federal Army br In that army was dissolved as an institution leaving only revolutionary forces Following the revolutionaries victory against Huerta they sought to broker a peaceful political solution but the coalition splintered plunging Mexico again into a civil war Constitutionalist general Pancho Villa commander of the Division of the North broke with Carranza and allied with Zapata Carranza s best general Alvaro Obreg n defeated Villa his former comrade in arms in the Battle of Celaya in and Villa s northern forces melted away Zapata s forces in the south reverted to guerrilla warfare Carranza became the de facto head of Mexico and the U S recognized his government br In the winners met at a constitutional convention to draft the Constitution of which was ratified in February The Constitution empowered the government to expropriate resources including land gave rights to labor and strengthened anticlerical provisions of the Constitution With amendments it remains the governing document of Mexico It is estimated that the war killed of the population of million Although often viewed as an internal conflict the revolution had significant international elements During the Revolution the U S Republican administration of Taft supported the Huerta coup against Madero but when Democrat Woodrow Wilson was inaugurated as president in March Wilson refused to recognize Huerta s regime and allowed arms sales to the Constitutionalists Wilson ordered troops to occupy the strategic port of Veracruz in which was lifted br br After Pancho Villa was defeated by revolutionary forces in he led an incursion raid into Columbus New Mexico prompting the U S to send troops led by General John J Pershing in an unsuccessful attempt to capture Villa Carranza pushed back against U S troops being in northern Mexico The expeditionary forces withdrew as the U S entered World War I Germany attempted to get Mexico to side with it sending a coded telegram in to incite war between the U S and Mexico with Mexico to regain the territory it lost in the Mexican American War Mexico remained neutral in the conflict br Consolidating power President Carranza had peasant leader Emiliano Zapata assassinated in Carranza had gained the support of the peasantry during the Revolution but once in power he did little to institute land reform which had motivated many to fight in the Revolution Carranza returned some confiscated land to their original owners President Carranza s best general Obreg n served briefly in his administration but returned to his home state of Sonora to position himself to run in the presidential election Since Carranza could not run for re election he chose a civilian to succeed him intending to remain the power behind the presidency Obreg n and two other Sonoran revolutionary generals drew up the Plan of Agua Prieta overthrowing Carranza who died fleeing Mexico City in General Adolfo de la Huerta became interim president followed by the election of General lvaro Obreg n br br br Political consolidation and one party rule br br The first quarter century of the post revolutionary period was characterized by revolutionary generals serving as Presidents of Mexico including lvaro Obreg n Plutarco El as Calles L zaro C rdenas and Manuel Avila Camacho The post revolutionary project of the Mexican government sought to bring order to the country end military intervention in politics and create organizations of interest groups Workers peasants urban office workers and even the army for a short period were incorporated as sectors of the single party that dominated Mexican politics from its founding in Obreg n instigated land reform and strengthened the power of organized labor He gained recognition from the United States and took steps to settle claims with companies and individuals that lost property during the Revolution He imposed his fellow former Sonoran revolutionary general Calles as his successor prompting an unsuccessful military revolt As president Calles provoked a major conflict with the Catholic Church and Catholic guerrilla armies when he strictly enforced anticlerical articles of the Constitution The Church State conflict was mediated and ended with the aid of the U S Ambassador to Mexico and ended with an agreement between the parties in conflict Although the constitution prohibited the reelection of the president Obreg n wished to run again and the constitution was amended to allow non consecutive re election Obreg n won the elections but was assassinated by a Catholic activist causing a political crisis of succession Calles could not become president again since he had just ended his term He sought to set up a structure to manage presidential succession founding the party that was to dominate Mexico until the late twentieth century Calles declared that the Revolution had moved from caudillismo rule by strongmen to the era institucional institutional era br Despite not holding the presidency Calles remained the key political figure during the period known as the Maximato The Maximato ended during the presidency of L zaro C rdenas who expelled Calles from the country and implemented many economic and social reforms This included the Mexican oil expropriation in March which nationalized the U S and Anglo Dutch oil company known as the Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company This movement would result in the creation of the state owned Mexican oil company Pemex This sparked a diplomatic crisis with the countries whose citizens had lost businesses by C rdenas s radical measure but since then the company has played an important role in the economic development of Mexico C rdenas s successor Manuel vila Camacho was more moderate and relations between the U S and Mexico vastly improved during World War II when Mexico was a significant ally providing manpower and materiel to aid the war effort From the election of Miguel Alem n the first civilian president in the post revolutionary period Mexico embarked on an aggressive program of economic development known as the Mexican miracle which was characterized by industrialization urbanization and the increase of inequality in Mexico between urban and rural areas The Green Revolution a technological movement that led to a significant worldwide increase in crop production began in the Yaqui Valley of Sonora in the middle of the th century br br With robust economic growth Mexico sought to showcase it to the world by hosting the Summer Olympics The government poured huge resources into building new facilities prompting political unrest among university students and others Demonstrations in central Mexico City went on for weeks before the planned opening of the games with the government of Gustavo D az Ordaz cracking down The culmination was the Tlatelolco Massacre which killed around protesters based on conservative estimates and perhaps as many as Although the economy continued to flourish for some social inequality remained a factor of discontent PRI rule became increasingly authoritarian and at times oppressive in what is now referred to as the Mexican Dirty War br Luis Echeverr a was elected president in His government had to contend with mistrust of Mexicans and increasing economic problems He instituted electoral reforms br br In the s the first cracks emerged in the PRI s complete political dominance In Baja California the PAN candidate was elected as governor When De la Madrid chose Carlos Salinas de Gortari as the candidate for the PRI and therefore a foregone presidential victor Cuauht moc C rdenas son of former President L zaro C rdenas broke with the PRI and challenged Salinas in the elections In there was massive electoral fraud with results showing that Salinas had won the election by the narrowest percentage ever There were massive protests in Mexico City over the stolen election Salinas took the oath of office on December In the PRI was famously described by Mario Vargas Llosa as the perfect dictatorship but by then there had been major challenges to the PRI s hegemony br Salinas embarked on a program of neoliberal reforms that fixed the exchange rate of the peso controlled inflation opened Mexico to foreign investment and began talks with the U S and Canada to join their free trade agreement To do that the Constitution of was amended in several important ways Article which had allowed the government to expropriate natural resources and distribute land was amended to end agrarian reform and to guarantee private owners property rights The anti clerical articles that muzzled religious institutions especially the Catholic Church were amended and Mexico reestablished diplomatic relations with the Holy See Signing on to the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA removed Mexico s autonomy over trade policy The agreement came into effect on January the same day the Zapatista Army of National Liberation EZLN in Chiapas began armed peasant rebellion against the federal government which captured a few towns but brought world attention to the situation in Mexico The armed conflict was short lived and has continued as a non violent opposition movement against neoliberalism and globalization In following the assassination of the PRI s presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio Salinas was succeeded by victorious PRI candidate Ernesto Zedillo Salinas left Zedillo s government to deal with the Mexican peso crisis requiring a billion IMF bailout Major macroeconomic reforms were started by Zedillo and the economy rapidly recovered and growth peaked at almost by the end of br br br Contemporary Mexico br br In after years the PRI lost a presidential election to Vicente Fox of the opposition conservative National Action Party PAN In the presidential election Felipe Calder n from the PAN was declared the winner with a very narrow margin over leftist politician Andr s Manuel L pez Obrador of the Party of the Democratic Revolution PRD L pez Obrador however contested the election and pledged to create an alternative government br After twelve years in the PRI won the presidency again with the election of Enrique Pe a Nieto However he won with a plurality of about and did not have a legislative majority br After founding the new political party MORENA Andr s Manuel L pez Obrador won the presidential election with over of the vote His political coalition led by his left wing party founded after the elections included parties and politicians from all over the political spectrum The coalition also won a majority in both the upper and lower Congress chambers His success is attributed to the country s other strong political alternatives exhausting their chances as well as the politician adopting a moderate discourse with a focus on conciliation br Mexico has contended with high crime rates official corruption narcotrafficking and a stagnant economy Many state owned industrial enterprises were privatized starting in the s with neoliberal reforms but Pemex the state owned petroleum company is only slowly being privatized with exploration licenses being issued In a push against government corruption the ex CEO of Pemex has been arrested br Although there were fears of electoral fraud in Mexico s presidential elections the results gave a mandate to AMLO Andr s Manuel L pez Obrador won a landslide victory in the July presidential elections and became the first leftwing president for decades Claudia Sheinbaum a Mexican politician scientist was elected president elect of Mexico the first woman to be elected to the position in br br br Geography br br Mexico is located between latitudes and N and longitudes and W in the southern portion of North America Almost all of Mexico lies in the North American Plate with small parts of the Baja California peninsula on the Pacific and Cocos Plates Geophysically some geographers include the territory east of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec around of the total within Central America Geopolitically however Mexico is entirely considered part of North America along with Canada and the United States br Mexico s total area is km sq mi making it the world s th largest country by total area It has coastlines on the Pacific Ocean and Gulf of California as well as the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea the latter two forming part of the Atlantic Ocean Within these seas are about km sq mi of islands including the remote Pacific Guadalupe Island and the Revillagigedo Islands From its farthest land points Mexico is a little over mi km in length Mexico has nine distinct regions Baja California the Pacific Coastal Lowlands the Mexican Plateau the Sierra Madre Oriental the Sierra Madre Occidental the Cordillera Neo Volc nica the Gulf Coastal Plain the Southern Highlands and the Yucat n Peninsula Although Mexico is large much of its land mass is incompatible with agriculture due to aridity soil or terrain In an estimated of land is agricultural is arable is in permanent crops is permanent pasture and is forest br Mexico is crossed from north to south by two mountain ranges known as Sierra Madre Oriental and Sierra Madre Occidental which are the extension of the Rocky Mountains from northern North America From east to west at the center the country is crossed by the Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt also known as the Sierra Nevada A fourth mountain range the Sierra Madre del Sur runs from Michoac n to Oaxaca The majority of the Mexican central and northern territories are located at high altitudes and as such the highest elevations are found at the Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt Pico de Orizaba m or ft Popocat petl m or ft and Iztaccihuatl m or ft and the Nevado de Toluca m or ft An important geologic feature of the Yucat n peninsula is the Chicxulub crater The scientific consensus is that the Chicxulub impactor was responsible for the Cretaceous Paleogene extinction event Mexico is subject to several natural hazards including hurricanes on both coasts tsunamis on the Pacific coast and volcanism br br br Climate br br The climate of Mexico is quite varied due to the country s size and topography Tropic of Cancer effectively divides the country into temperate and tropical zones Land north of the Tropic of Cancer experiences cooler temperatures during the winter months South of the Tropic of Cancer temperatures are fairly constant year round and vary solely as a function of elevation This gives Mexico one of the world s most diverse weather systems Maritime air masses bring seasonal precipitation from May until August Many parts of Mexico particularly the north have a dry climate with only sporadic rainfall while parts of the tropical lowlands in the south average more than mm in of annual precipitation For example many cities in the north like Monterrey Hermosillo and Mexicali experience temperatures of C F or more in summer In the Sonoran Desert temperatures reach C F or more br Descriptors of regions are by temperature with the tierra caliente hot land being coastal up to meters tierra templada temperate land being from meters tierra fr a cold land extending to meters Beyond the cold lands are the p ramos alpine pastures and the tierra helada frozen land meters in central Mexico Areas south of the Tropic of Cancer with elevations up to m ft the southern parts of both coastal plains as well as the Yucat n Peninsula have a yearly median temperature between and C and F Temperatures here remain high throughout the year with only a C F difference between winter and summer median temperatures Both Mexican coasts except for the south coast of the Bay of Campeche and northern Baja California are also vulnerable to serious hurricanes during the summer and fall Although low lying areas north of the Tropic of Cancer are hot and humid during the summer they generally have lower yearly temperature averages from to C or to F because of more moderate conditions during the winter br br br Biodiversity br br Mexico ranks fourth in the world in biodiversity and is one of the megadiverse countries With over different species Mexico is home of of the world s biodiversity Mexico ranks first in biodiversity in reptiles with known species second in mammals with species fourth in amphibians with species and fourth in flora with different species Mexico is also considered the second country in the world in ecosystems and fourth in overall species About species are protected by Mexican legislation In Mexico had the second fastest rate of deforestation in the world second only to Brazil It had a Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of ranking it rd globally out of countries According to SGI there is Deforestation and soil erosion especially in rural areas of Mexico In the report it was noted environmental protection laws have improved in major cities but remain unenforced or unregulated in rural regions br br In Mexico square kilometers sq mi are considered Protected Natural Areas These include biosphere reserves unaltered ecosystems national parks natural monuments protected in perpetuity for their aesthetic scientific or historical value areas of protected flora and fauna areas for natural resource protection conservation of soil hydrological basins and forests and sanctuaries zones rich in diverse species Plants indigenous to Mexico are grown in many parts of the world and integrated into their national cuisines Some of Mexico s native culinary ingredients include maize tomato beans squash chocolate vanilla avocado guava chayote epazote camote j cama nopal zucchini tejocote huitlacoche sapote mamey sapote and a great variety of chiles such as the habanero and the jalape o Most of these names come from the indigenous language of Nahuatl Tequila the distilled alcoholic drink made from cultivated agave cacti is a major industry Because of its high biodiversity Mexico has also been a frequent site of bioprospecting by international research bodies The first highly successful instance was the discovery in of the tuber Barbasco Dioscorea composita which has a high content of diosgenin revolutionizing the production of synthetic hormones in the s and s and eventually leading to the invention of combined oral contraceptive pills br br br Government and politics br br The United Mexican States are a federation whose government is representative democratic and republican based on a

Military Police and Naval Police As of the National Guard is an estimated at L pez Obrador has increasingly used military forces for domestic law enforcement particularly against drug cartels There have been serious abuses of power reported in security operations in the southern part of the country and in indigenous communities and poor urban neighborhoods The National Human Rights Commission has had little impact in reversing this trend engaging mostly in documentation but failing to use its powers to issue public condemnations to the officials who ignore its recommendations Most Mexicans have low confidence in the police or the judicial system and therefore few crimes are actually reported by the citizens There have been public demonstrations of outrage against what is considered a culture of impunity br Mexico has fully recognised same sex marriage since and anti discrimination laws regarding sexual orientation have existed in the nation since However hate crimes towards the

independent republic Texas separated in the Texas Revolution and when it was annexed to the U S in it set the stage for the Mexican American War and major territorial loss to the U S The sale of northern territory known in the U S as the Gadsden Purchase was the last loss of Mexican territory The United Mexican States are a federation of free and sovereign states which form a union that exercises a degree of jurisdiction over Mexico City Each state has its constitution congress and a judiciary and its citizens elect by direct voting a governor for a six year term and representatives to their respective unicameral state congresses for three year terms br Mexico City is a special political division that belongs to the federation as a whole and not to a particular state Formerly known as the Federal District its autonomy was previously limited relative to that of the states It dropped this designation in and is in the process of achieving greater political autonomy by

million in to million in br Life expectancy increased from years in to years in br br br Ethnicity and race br br Mexico s population is highly diverse but research on Mexican ethnicity has felt the impact of nationalist discourses on identity Since the s the Mexican government has promoted the view that all Mexicans are part of the Mestizo community within which they are distinguished only by residence in or outside of an indigenous community degree of fluency in an indigenous language and degree of adherence to indigenous customs br It is not until very recently that the Mexican government began conducting surveys that consider other ethnic groups that live in the country such as Afro Mexicans who comprised of Mexico s population in or White Mexicans Less numerous groups in Mexico such as Asians and Middle Easterners are also accounted for with numbers of around each While Mestizos are a prominent ethnic group in contemporary Mexico the subjective and ever changing definition of this category has led to its estimations being imprecise having been observed that many Mexicans do not identify as Mestizos favoring instead ethnoracial labels such as White or Indigenous due to having more consistent and static definitions br br br Languages br br Spanish is the de facto national language spoken by the vast majority of the population making Mexico the world s most populous Hispanophone country Mexican Spanish refers to the varieties of the language spoken in the country which differs from one region to another in sound structure and vocabulary br br The federal government officially recognizes sixty eight linguistic groups and varieties of indigenous languages It is estimated that around million citizens speak these languages with Nahuatl being the most widely spoken by more than million followed by Yucatec Maya used daily by nearly people Tzeltal and Tzotzil two other Mayan languages are spoken by around half a million people each primarily in the southern state of Chiapas Mixtec and Zapotec with an estimated native speakers each are two other prominent language groups Since its creation in March the National Indigenous Languages Institute has been in charge of promoting and protecting the use of the country s indigenous languages through the General Law of Indigenous Peoples Linguistic Rights which recognizes them de jure as national languages with status equal to that of Spanish That notwithstanding in practice indigenous peoples often face discrimination and do not have full access to public services such as education and healthcare or to the justice system as Spanish is the prevailing language br Aside from indigenous languages there are several minority languages spoken in Mexico due to international migration such as Low German by the strong Mennonite population primarily settled in the northern states fueled by the tolerance of the federal government towards this community by allowing them to set their educational system compatible with their customs and traditions The Chipilo dialect a variance of the Venetian language is spoken in the town of Chipilo located in the central state of Puebla by around people mainly descendants of Venetians that migrated to the area in the late th century Furthermore English is the most commonly taught foreign language in Mexico It is estimated that nearly million or around a fifth of the population study the language through public schools private institutions or self access channels However a high level of English proficiency is limited to only of the population Moreover French is the second most widely taught foreign language as every year between and Mexican students enroll in language courses br br br Emigration and immigration br br In the early s around Mexicans lived abroad which increased sevenfold by the s to million At the turn of the st century this figure more than doubled to million Between and more than million Mexicans migrated to the United States alone by far the top destination for both temporary and permanent migration representing one of the largest mass migrations in modern history br As of it is estimated that million Mexicans live outside Mexico in addition to million born abroad and another million descendants the vast majority of this combined population are in the U S The number of overseas Mexicans peaked at roughly million sometime between and owing to a variety of factors including increased return migration from the U S coupled with reduced migration abroad br The majority of Mexicans abroad have settled in U S states at or near the Mexican border such as California and Texas and in urban areas of Illinois North Carolina and Georgia the largest Mexican communities outside Mexico are in the metropolitan areas of Los Angeles Chicago Houston and Dallas Fort Worth As a result of these major migration flows in recent decades an estimated million U S residents or of the country s population identified as being of full or partial Mexican ancestry br Among the remaining of Mexican expatriates not residing in the U S the most popular destinations are Canada primarily the provinces of Ontario and Quebec followed by Spain and Germany the latter two countries account for two thirds of all Mexicans living in Europe It is estimated that Mexicans live in Latin America led by Guatemala followed by Bolivia Chile and Panama br As of an estimated million foreigners settled in Mexico up from nearly million in In Mexico officially received new immigrants a increase from the prior year the overall number of migrants including those unauthorized to enter or stay in the country may be higher than official figures The vast majority of migrants in Mexico come from the United States making Mexico the top destination for U S citizens abroad The second largest group comes from neighboring Guatemala followed by Spain Other major sources of migration are fellow Latin American countries which include Colombia Argentina and Cuba br Historically and relative to other countries in the Western Hemisphere Mexico has not been a destination of mass migration However communities descended from the Lebanese diaspora and German born Mennonites have had an outsized impact in the country s culture particularly in its cuisine and traditional music At the turn of the st century several trends have increased the number of foreigners residing in Mexico such as the Spanish financial crisis increasing gang related violence in the Northern Triangle of Central America the ongoing political and economic crisis in Venezuela and the automotive industry boom led by Japanese and South Korean investment br br br Urban areas br br br Religion br br Although the Constitutions of and put limits on the role of the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico Roman Catholicism remains the country s dominant religious affiliation The census by the Instituto Nacional de Estad stica y Geograf a National Institute of Statistics and Geography gives Roman Catholicism as the main religion with of the population while belong to Protestant Evangelical Christian denominations including Other Christians Evangelicals Pentecostals Jehovah s Witnesses Seventh day Adventists and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints declared having no religion were unspecified br The Catholics of Mexico constitute in absolute terms the second largest Catholic community in the world after Brazil s percent of them attend church services weekly The feast day of Our Lady of Guadalupe the patron saint of Mexico is celebrated on December and is regarded by many Mexicans as the most important religious holiday of their country The denominations Pentecostal also have an important presence especially in the cities of the border and in the indigenous communities As of Pentecostal churches together have more than million adherents which in net numbers place them as the second Christian creed in Mexico The situation changes when the different Pentecostal denominations are considered as separate entities Migratory phenomena have led to the spread of different aspects of Christianity including branches Protestants Eastern Catholic Churches and Eastern Orthodox Church br The presence of Jews in Mexico dates back to when Hern n Cort s conquered the Aztecs accompanied by several Conversos According to the census there are Jews in Mexico Islam in Mexico with members is practiced mostly by Arab Mexicans In the census Mexicans reported belonging to a spiritualist religion a category which includes a tiny Buddhist population br According to Jacobo Grinberg the survival of magic religious rituals of the old indigenous groups is remarkable There is often a syncretism between shamanism and Catholic traditions Another religion of popular syncretism in Mexico especially in recent years is the Santer a This is mainly due to the large number of Cubans who settled in the territory after the Cuban Revolution Even though Mexico was also a recipient of black slaves from Africa in the th century the apogee of these cults is relatively new In general popular religiosity is viewed with bad eyes by institutionally structured religions One of the most exemplary cases of popular religiosity is the cult of Holy Dead Santa Muerte The Catholic hierarchy insists on describing it as a satanic cult However most of the people who profess this cult declare themselves to be Catholic believers Other examples are the representations of the Passion of Christ and the celebration of Day of the Dead which take place within the framework of the Catholic Christian imaginary but under a very particular reinterpretation br br br Health br br In the s Mexico made a commitment to rural health care mandating that mostly urban medical students receive training in it and to make them agents of the state to assess marginal areas Since the early s Mexico entered a transitional stage in the health of its population and some indicators such as mortality patterns are identical to those found in highly developed countries like Germany or Japan Mexico s medical infrastructure is highly rated for the most part and is usually excellent in major cities but rural communities still lack equipment for advanced medical procedures forcing patients in those locations to travel to the closest urban areas to get specialized medical care Social determinants of health can be used to evaluate the state of health in Mexico br State funded institutions such as Mexican Social Security Institute IMSS and the Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers ISSSTE play a major role in health and social security Private health services are also very important and account for of all medical units in the country Medical training is done mostly at public universities with many specializations done in vocational or internship settings Some public universities in Mexico such as the University of Guadalajara have signed agreements with the U S to receive and train American students in medicine Health care costs in private institutions and prescription drugs in Mexico are on average lower than that of its North American economic partners br br br Education br br As of the literacy rate in Mexico is a slight increase from in and significantly higher than in Literacy between males and females is relatively equal br According to most rankings the publicly funded National Autonomous University of Mexico UNAM is the best university in the country Other prominent public universities include the National Polythechnic Institute the Metropolitan Autonomous University the University of Guadalajara and the Autonomous University of Nuevo Le n and El Colegio de M xico br In terms of private academic institutions among the most highly ranked is the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education other prominent private universities include Universidad Iberoamericana Universidad Panamericana ITAM and Universidad An huac br br br Culture br br Mexican culture reflects a long and complex history of interactions between various peoples through migration conquest and trade Three centuries of Spanish rule resulted in the blending of Spanish culture with those of different indigenous groups Efforts to assimilate the native population into Christian European culture during the colonial era were only partially successful with many pre Columbian customs traditions and norms persisting regionally particularly in rural areas or becoming syncretized conversely many Spanish settlers integrated into local communities through acculturation or intermarriage However a high degree of stratification along the lines of class ethnicity and race perpetuated distinct subcultures br The Porfirian era el Porfiriato which brough relative peace after four decades of civil unrest and war saw the development of philosophy and art often with government support Since that time as accentuated during the Mexican Revolution cultural identity has had its foundation in mestizaje the blending of different races and cultures of which the indigenous i e Amerindian element is the core In light of the various ethnicities that formed the Mexican people Jos Vasconcelos in La Raza C smica The Cosmic Race defined Mexico and Latin America to be the melting pot of all races thus extending the definition of the mestizo not only biologically but culturally as well Other Mexican intellectuals grappled with the idea of Lo Mexicano which seeks to discover the national ethos of Mexican culture Nobel laureate Octavio Paz explores the notion of a Mexican national character in The Labyrinth of Solitude br br br Art br br Painting is one of the oldest arts in Mexico Cave painting in Mexican territory is about years old and has been found in the caves of the Baja California Peninsula Pre Columbian Mexico is present in buildings and caves in Aztec codices in ceramics in garments etc examples of this are the Maya mural paintings of Bonampak or those of Teotihuac n those of Cacaxtla and those of Monte Alb n Mural painting with Christian religious themes had an important flowering during the th century early colonial era in newly constructed churches and monasteries Examples can be found in Acolman Actopan Huejotzingo Tecamachalco and Zinacantepec br As with most art during the early modern era in the West colonial era Mexican art was religious during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Starting in the late seventeenth century and most prominently in the eighteenth century secular portraits and images of racial types so called casta painting appeared Important painters of the late colonial period were Juan Correa Crist bal de Villalpando and Miguel Cabrera In early post independence Mexico nineteenth century painting had a marked romantic influence landscapes and portraits were the greatest expressions of this era Hermenegildo Bustos is one of the most appreciated painters of the historiography of Mexican art Other painters include Santiago Rebull F lix Parra Eugenio Landesio and his noted pupil the landscape artist Jos Mar a Velasco br br In the th century artists such as Diego Rivera David Alfaro Siqueiros and Jos Clemente Orozco the so called Big Three of Mexican muralism achieved worldwide recognition They were commissioned by the Mexican government to paint large scale historical murals on the walls of public buildings which helped shape popular perceptions of the Mexican Revolution and Mexican cultural identity Frida Kahlo s largely personal portraiture is considered by many as the most important historical work by a female artist br In the st century Mexico City became home to the highest concentration of art museums in the world Institutions like the Museo Jumex the largest collection of its kind founded by collector Eugenio L pez Alonso and bolstered by art advisor Esthella Provas changed the notion of contemporary art in Latin America The Museo Tamayo Arte Contemporaneous founded by Rufino Tamayo is also considered a preeminent institution and introduced foreign artists to a wider population The country is also an epicenter for International art galleries including Kurimanzutto and FF Projects and leading artists including Gabriel Orozco Bosco Sodi Stefan Br ggemann and Mario Garc a Torres br br br Architecture br The architecture of Mesoamerican civilizations evolved in style from simple to complex Teotihuacan designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in is one of the foremost examples of ancient pyramid construction The cities of the Maya stand out to modern architects as examples of integration between large urban centers with elaborate stone construction and a thick jungle generally with a complex network of roads Pre Columbian Mesoamerica also saw distinctive architectural influences from the Puuc and oasiamerican peoples br br With the arrival of the Spanish architectural theories of the Greco Latin order with Arab influences were introduced In the first few decades of Spanish presence in the continent the high level of Christian missionary activity especially by mendicant orders like the Dominicans or Franciscans meant the construction of many monasteries often with Romanesque Gothic and or Mud jar elements In addition the interaction between Spaniards and Indigenous people gave rise to artistic styles such as the tequitqui from the Nahuatl worker or builder Years later Baroque and Mannerist styles prevailed in large cathedrals and civil buildings while in rural areas haciendas or stately estates with Mozarabic tendencies were built br In the th century the neoclassical movement arose as the country gained independence and sought to establish itself as a republic A famous example is the Hospicio Caba as an orphanage and hospital complex completed in The art nouveau and the art deco were styles introduced into the design of the Palacio de Bellas Artes to mark the identity of the Mexican nation with Greek Roman and pre Columbian symbols br br As a new sense of nationalism developed in the th century a strengthening central government issued formal policies that sought to use architecture to show Mexico s modernity and differentiation from other nations The development of a Mexican modernist architecture was especially manifested in the mid s construction of the Ciudad Universitaria Mexico City the main campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico Designed by the most prestigious architects of the era including Mario Pani Eugenio Peschard and Enrique del Moral the buildings feature murals by artists Diego Rivera David Alfaro Siqueiros and Jos Ch vez Morado It has since been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site br Juan O Gorman was one of the first environmental architects in Mexico developing the organic theory trying to integrate the building with the landscape within the same approaches of Frank Lloyd Wright In the search for a new architecture that does not resemble the styles of the past it achieves a joint manifestation with the mural painting and the landscaping Luis Barrag n combined the shape of the space with forms of rural vernacular architecture of Mexico and Mediterranean countries Spain Morocco integrating color that handles light and shade in different tones and opens a look at the international minimalism He won the Pritzker Prize the highest award in architecture br br br Cuisine br br The origin of the current Mexican cuisine was established during the Spanish colonial era a mixture of the foods of Spain with native indigenous ingredients Foods indigenous to Mexico include corn pepper vegetables calabazas avocados sweet potato turkey many beans and other fruits and spices Similarly some cooking techniques used today are inherited from pre Columbian peoples such as the nixtamalization of corn the cooking of food in ovens at ground level grinding in molcajete and metate With the Spaniards came the pork beef and chicken meats peppercorn sugar milk and all its derivatives wheat and rice citrus fruits and another constellation of ingredients that are part of the daily diet of Mexicans br From this meeting of millennia old two culinary traditions were born pozole mole sauce barbacoa and tamale in its current forms chocolate a large range of breads tacos and the broad repertoire of Mexican street foods Beverages such as atole champurrado milk chocolate and aguas frescas were born desserts such as acitr n and the full range of crystallized sweets rompope cajeta jericaya and the wide repertoire of delights created in the convents of nuns in all parts of the country br In Mexico presented the candidature of its gastronomy for World Heritage Site of UNESCO the first time a country had presented its gastronomic tradition for this purpose The result was negative because the committee did not place the proper emphasis on the importance of corn in Mexican cuisine On November Mexican gastronomy was recognized as Intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO In addition Daniela Soto Innes was named the best female chef in the world by The World s Best Restaurants in April and Elena Reygadas in br br br Literature br br Mexican literature has its antecedents in the literature of the indigenous settlements of Mesoamerica Poetry had a rich cultural tradition in pre Columbian Mexico being divided into two broad categories
