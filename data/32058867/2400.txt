Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD is an American multinational corporation and fabless semiconductor company based in Santa Clara California that designs develops and sells computer processors and related technologies for business and consumer markets br AMD s main products include microprocessors motherboard chipsets embedded processors and graphics processors for servers workstations personal computers and embedded system applications The company has also expanded into new markets such as the data center gaming and high performance computing markets AMD s processors are used in a wide range of computing devices including personal computers servers laptops and gaming consoles While it initially manufactured its own processors the company later outsourced its manufacturing after GlobalFoundries was spun off in Through its Xilinx acquisition in AMD offers field programmable gate array products br AMD was founded in by Jerry Sanders and a group of other technology professionals The company s early products were primarily memory chips and other components for computers In AMD entered the microprocessor market competing with Intel its main rival in the industry In the early s it experienced significant growth and success thanks in part to its strong position in the PC market and the success of its Athlon and Opteron processors However the company faced challenges in the late s and early s as it struggled to keep up with Intel in the race to produce faster and more powerful processors br In the late s AMD regained market share due to the success of its Ryzen processors which were considerably more competitive with Intel microprocessors in terms of their performance in business applications including cloud applications br br br History br br br Foundational years br Advanced Micro Devices was formally incorporated by Jerry Sanders along with seven of his colleagues from Fairchild Semiconductor on May Sanders an electrical engineer who was the director of marketing at Fairchild had like many Fairchild executives grown frustrated with the increasing lack of support opportunity and flexibility within the company He later decided to leave to start his own semiconductor company following the footsteps of Robert Noyce developer of the first silicon integrated circuit at Fairchild in and Gordon Moore who together founded the semiconductor company Intel in July br In September AMD moved from its temporary location in Santa Clara to Sunnyvale California To immediately secure a customer base AMD initially became a second source supplier of microchips designed by Fairchild and National Semiconductor AMD first focused on producing logic chips The company guaranteed quality control to United States Military Standard an advantage in the early computer industry since unreliability in microchips was a distinct problem that customers including computer manufacturers the telecommunications industry and instrument manufacturers wanted to avoid br In November the company manufactured its first product the Am a bit MSI shift register which began selling in Also in AMD produced its first proprietary product the Am logic counter which was highly successful Its bestselling product in was the Am the fastest multiplier available br In AMD entered the RAM chip market beginning with the Am a bit bipolar RAM That year AMD also greatly increased the sales volume of its linear integrated circuits and by year end the company s total annual sales reached US million br AMD went public in September The company was a second source for Intel MOS LSI circuits by with products such as Am and Am dual bit dynamic shift registers By AMD was producing products of which were proprietary including the Am a static N channel bit RAM and three low power Schottky MSI circuits Am LS Am LS and Am LS br Intel had created the first microprocessor its bit in By AMD entered the microprocessor market with the Am a reverse engineered clone of the Intel and the Am bit slice microprocessor family When Intel began installing microcode in its microprocessors in it entered into a cross licensing agreement with AMD which was granted a copyright license to the microcode in its microprocessors and peripherals effective October br In AMD entered into a joint venture with Siemens a German engineering conglomerate wishing to enhance its technology expertise and enter the American market Siemens purchased of AMD s stock giving the company an infusion of cash to increase its product lines The two companies also jointly established Advanced Micro Computers AMC located in Silicon Valley and in Germany allowing AMD to enter the microcomputer development and manufacturing field in particular based on AMD s second source Zilog Z microprocessors When the two companies vision for Advanced Micro Computers diverged AMD bought out Siemens stake in the American division in AMD closed Advanced Micro Computers in late after switching focus to manufacturing second source Intel x microprocessors br Total sales in fiscal year topped million and in AMD debuted on the New York Stock Exchange In production also began on AMD s new semiconductor fabrication plant in Austin Texas the company already had overseas assembly facilities in Penang and Manila and began construction on a fabrication plant in San Antonio in In AMD began supplying semiconductor products for telecommunications an industry undergoing rapid expansion and innovation br br br Intel partnership br Intel had introduced the first x microprocessors in In IBM created its PC and wanted Intel s x processors but only under the condition that Intel also provide a second source manufacturer for its patented x microprocessors Intel and AMD entered into a year technology exchange agreement first signed in October and formally executed in February The terms of the agreement were that each company could acquire the right to become a second source manufacturer of semiconductor products developed by the other that is each party could earn the right to manufacture and sell a product developed by the other if agreed to by exchanging the manufacturing rights to a product of equivalent technical complexity The technical information and licenses needed to make and sell a part would be exchanged for a royalty to the developing company The agreement also extended the AMD Intel cross licensing agreement through The agreement included the right to invoke arbitration of disagreements and after five years the right of either party to end the agreement with one year s notice The main result of the agreement was that AMD became a second source manufacturer of Intel s x microprocessors and related chips and Intel provided AMD with database tapes for its and chips However in the event of a bankruptcy or takeover of AMD the cross licensing agreement would be effectively canceled br Beginning in AMD began volume producing second source Intel licensed and processors and by its own Am clone of Intel s processor for the rapidly growing market of IBM PCs and IBM clones It also continued its successful concentration on proprietary bipolar chips br The company continued to spend greatly on research and development and created the world s first K EPROM in That year AMD was listed in the book The Best Companies to Work for in America and later made the Fortune list for the first time in br By mid the microchip market experienced a severe downturn mainly due to long term aggressive trade practices dumping from Japan but also due to a crowded and non innovative chip market in the United States AMD rode out the mid s crisis by aggressively innovating and modernizing devising the Liberty Chip program of designing and manufacturing one new chip or chipset per week for weeks in fiscal year and by heavily lobbying the U S government until sanctions and restrictions were put in place to prevent predatory Japanese pricing During this time AMD withdrew from the DRAM market and made some headway into the CMOS market which it had lagged in entering having focused instead on bipolar chips br AMD had some success in the mid s with the AMD and AMD World Chip FSK modem one of the first multi standard devices that covered both Bell and CCITT tones at up to baud half duplex or full duplex Beginning in AMD embraced the perceived shift toward RISC with their own AMD Am k processor the k survived as an embedded processor The company also increased its EPROM memory market share in the late s Throughout the s AMD was a second source supplier of Intel x processors In it introduced its own compatible Am an AMD designed chip Creating its own chips AMD began to compete directly with Intel br AMD had a large successful flash memory business even during the dotcom bust In to divest some manufacturing and aid its overall cash flow which was under duress from aggressive microprocessor competition from Intel AMD spun off its flash memory business and manufacturing into Spansion a joint venture with Fujitsu which had been co manufacturing flash memory with AMD since In December AMD divested itself of Spansion to focus on the microprocessor market and Spansion went public in an IPO br br br present br On July AMD announced its acquisition of the Canadian D graphics card company ATI Technologies AMD paid billion and million shares of its capital stock for a total of approximately billion The transaction was completed on October On August AMD announced that it would retire the ATI brand name for its graphics chipsets in favor of the AMD brand name br In October AMD announced plans to spin off manufacturing operations in the form of GlobalFoundries Inc a multibillion dollar joint venture with Advanced Technology Investment Co an investment company formed by the government of Abu Dhabi The partnership and spin off gave AMD an infusion of cash and allowed it to focus solely on chip design To assure the Abu Dhabi investors of the new venture s success AMD s CEO Hector Ruiz stepped down in July while remaining executive chairman in preparation for becoming chairman of GlobalFoundries in March President and COO Dirk Meyer became AMD s CEO Recessionary losses necessitated AMD cutting jobs in br In August AMD announced that former Lenovo executive Rory Read would be joining the company as CEO replacing Meyer In November AMD announced plans to lay off more than of its employees from across all divisions worldwide In October it announced plans to lay off an additional of its workforce to reduce costs in the face of declining sales revenue br AMD acquired the low power server manufacturer SeaMicro in early with an eye to bringing out an Arm server chip br On October AMD announced that Rory Read had stepped down after three years as president and chief executive officer He was succeeded by Lisa Su a key lieutenant who had been chief operating officer since June br On October AMD announced a new restructuring plan along with its Q results Effective July AMD reorganized into two business groups Computing and Graphics which primarily includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets discrete GPUs and professional graphics and Enterprise Embedded and Semi Custom which primarily includes server and embedded processors dense servers semi custom SoC products including solutions for gaming consoles engineering services and royalties As part of this restructuring AMD announced that of its global workforce would be laid off by the end of br After the GlobalFoundries spin off and subsequent layoffs AMD was left with significant vacant space at AMD Place its aging Sunnyvale headquarters office complex In August AMD s years in Sunnyvale came to a close when it signed a lease with the Irvine Company for a new sq ft headquarters building in Santa Clara AMD s new location at Santa Clara Square faces the headquarters of archrival Intel across the Bayshore Freeway and San Tomas Aquino Creek Around the same time AMD also agreed to sell AMD Place to the Irvine Company In April the Irvine Company secured approval from the Sunnyvale City Council of its plans to demolish AMD Place and redevelop the entire acre site into townhomes and apartments br In October AMD announced that it was acquiring Xilinx in an all stock transaction The acquisition was completed in February with an estimated acquisition price of billion br In October AMD acquired an open source AI software provider Nod ai to bolster its AI software ecosystem br In March rally in semiconductor stocks pushed AMD valuation above B for the first time in history br In July AMD announced that it would acquire the Finnish based artificial intelligence startup company Silo AI in a million all cash deal in an attempt to better compete with AI chip market leader Nvidia br br br List of CEOs br br br Products br br br CPUs and APUs br br br IBM PC and the x architecture br br In February AMD signed a contract with Intel becoming a licensed second source manufacturer of and processors IBM wanted to use the Intel in its IBM PC but its policy at the time was to require at least two sources for its chips AMD later produced the Am under the same arrangement In Intel internally decided to no longer cooperate with AMD in supplying product information to shore up its advantage in the marketplace and delayed and eventually refused to convey the technical details of the Intel In AMD invoked arbitration over the issue and Intel reacted by canceling the technological exchange agreement altogether After three years of testimony AMD eventually won in arbitration in but Intel disputed this decision Another long legal dispute followed ending in when the Supreme Court of California sided with the arbitrator and AMD br In Intel countersued AMD renegotiating AMD s right to use derivatives of Intel s microcode for its cloned processors In the face of uncertainty during the legal dispute AMD was forced to develop clean room designed versions of Intel code for its x and x processors the former long after Intel had released its own x in In March AMD released the Am its clone of the Intel processor By October of the same year it had sold one million units br In AMD introduced the first of the Am family of processors which proved popular with a large number of original equipment manufacturers including Compaq which signed an exclusive agreement using the Am The Am x another Am based processor was released in November and continued AMD s success as a fast cost effective processor br Finally in an agreement effective AMD received the rights to the microcode in Intel s x and x processor families but not the rights to the microcode in the following generations of processors br br br K K Athlon Duron and Sempron br br AMD s first in house x processor was the K launched in The K in its name was a reference to Kryptonite the only substance known to harm comic book character Superman This itself was a reference to Intel s hegemony over the market i e an anthropomorphization of them as Superman The number was a reference to the fifth generation of x processors rival Intel had previously introduced its line of fifth generation x processors as Pentium because the U S Trademark and Patent Office had ruled that mere numbers could not be trademarked br In AMD purchased NexGen specifically for the rights to their Nx series of x compatible processors AMD gave the NexGen design team their own building left them alone and gave them time and money to rework the Nx The result was the K processor introduced in Although it was based on Socket variants such as K III were faster than Intel s Pentium II sixth generation processor br The K was AMD s seventh generation x processor making its debut under the brand name Athlon on June Unlike previous AMD processors it could not be used on the same motherboards as Intel s due to licensing issues surrounding Intel s Slot connector and instead used a Slot A connector referenced to the Alpha processor bus The Duron was a lower cost and limited version of the Athlon KB instead of KB L cache in a pin socketed PGA socket A or soldered directly onto the motherboard Sempron was released as a lower cost Athlon XP replacing Duron in the socket A PGA era It has since been migrated upward to all new sockets up to AM br On October the Athlon XP was released On February the Athlon XP with KB L Cache was released br br br Athlon Opteron and Phenom br br The K was a major revision of the K architecture with the most notable features being the addition of a bit extension to the x instruction set called x AMD or x the incorporation of an on chip memory controller and the implementation of an extremely high performance point to point interconnect called HyperTransport as part of the Direct Connect Architecture The technology was initially launched as the Opteron server oriented processor on April Shortly thereafter it was incorporated into a product for desktop PCs branded Athlon br On April AMD released the first dual core Opteron an x based server CPU A month later it released the Athlon X the first desktop based dual core processor family In May AMD abandoned the string in its dual core desktop product branding becoming Athlon X downplaying the significance of bit computing in its processors Further updates involved improvements to the microarchitecture and a shift of the target market from mainstream desktop systems to value dual core desktop systems In AMD started to release dual core Sempron processors exclusively in China branded as the Sempron series with lower HyperTransport speed and smaller L cache AMD completed its dual core product portfolio for each market segment br In September AMD released the first server Opteron K processors followed in November by the Phenom processor for desktop K processors came in dual core triple core and quad core versions with all cores on a single die AMD released a new platform codenamed Spider which used the new Phenom processor as well as an R GPU and a GX FX chipset from the AMD chipset series However AMD built the Spider at nm which was uncompetitive with Intel s smaller and more power efficient nm br In January AMD released a new processor line dubbed Phenom II a refresh of the original Phenom built using the nm process AMD s new platform codenamed Dragon used the new Phenom II processor and an ATI R GPU from the R GPU family as well as a GX FX chipset from the AMD chipset series The Phenom II came in dual core triple core and quad core variants all using the same die with cores disabled for the triple core and dual core versions The Phenom II resolved issues that the original Phenom had including a low clock speed a small L cache and a Cool n Quiet bug that decreased performance The Phenom II cost less but was not performance competitive with Intel s mid to high range Core Quads The Phenom II also enhanced its predecessor s memory controller allowing it to use DDR in a new native socket AM while maintaining backward compatibility with AM the socket used for the Phenom and allowing the use of the DDR memory that was used with the platform br In April AMD released a new Phenom II Hexa core core processor codenamed Thuban This was a totally new die based on the hexa core Istanbul Opteron processor It included AMD s turbo core technology which allows the processor to automatically switch from cores to faster cores when more pure speed is needed br The Magny Cours and Lisbon server parts were released in The Magny Cours part came in to cores and the Lisbon part in and core parts Magny Cours is focused on performance while the Lisbon part is focused on high performance per watt Magny Cours is an MCM multi chip module with two hexa core Istanbul Opteron parts This will use a new socket G for dual and quad socket processors and thus will be marketed as Opteron xx series processors Lisbon uses socket C certified for dual socket use or single socket use only and thus will be marketed as Opteron xx processors Both will be built on a nm SOI process br br br Fusion becomes the AMD APU br br Following AMD s acquisition of Canadian graphics company ATI Technologies an initiative codenamed Fusion was announced to integrate a CPU and GPU together on some of AMD s microprocessors including a built in PCI Express link to accommodate separate PCI Express peripherals eliminating the northbridge chip from the motherboard The initiative intended to move some of the processing originally done on the CPU e g floating point unit operations to the GPU which is better optimized for some calculations The Fusion was later renamed the AMD APU Accelerated Processing Unit br Llano was AMD s first APU built for laptops Llano was the second APU released targeted at the mainstream market It incorporated a CPU and GPU on the same die as well as northbridge functions and used Socket FM with DDR memory The CPU part of the processor was based on the Phenom II Deneb processor AMD suffered an unexpected decrease in revenue based on production problems for the Llano More AMD APUs for laptops running Windows and Windows OS are being used commonly These include AMD s price point APUs the E and E and their mainstream competitors with Intel s Core i series The Vision A series the A standing for accelerated These range from the lower performance A chipset to the A A and A These all incorporate next generation Radeon graphics cards with the A utilizing the base Radeon HD chip and the rest using a Radeon R graphics card with the exception of the highest model A A which uses an R graphics card br br br New microarchitectures br br br High power high performance Bulldozer cores br br Bulldozer was AMD s microarchitecture codename for server and desktop AMD FX processors first released on October This family h microarchitecture is the successor to the family h K microarchitecture design Bulldozer was a clean sheet design not a development of earlier processors The core was specifically aimed at W TDP computing products AMD claimed dramatic performance per watt efficiency improvements in high performance computing HPC applications with Bulldozer cores While hopes were high that Bulldozer would bring AMD to be performance competitive with Intel once more most benchmarks were disappointing In some cases the new Bulldozer products were slower than the K models they were built to replace br The Piledriver microarchitecture was the successor to Bulldozer increasing clock speeds and performance relative to its predecessor Piledriver would be released in AMD FX APU and Opteron product lines Piledriver was subsequently followed by the Steamroller microarchitecture in Used exclusively in AMD s APUs Steamroller focused on greater parallelism br In the Excavator microarchitecture replaced Piledriver Expected to be the last microarchitecture of the Bulldozer series Excavator focused on improved power efficiency br br br Low power Cat cores br br The Bobcat microarchitecture was revealed during a speech from AMD executive vice president Henri Richard in Computex and was put into production during the first quarter of Based on the difficulty competing in the x market with a single core optimized for the W range AMD had developed a simpler core with a target range of watts In addition it was believed that the core could migrate into the hand held space if the power consumption can be reduced to less than W br Jaguar is a microarchitecture codename for Bobcat s successor released in that is used in various APUs from AMD aimed at the low power low cost market Jaguar and its derivates would go on to be used in the custom APUs of the PlayStation Xbox One PlayStation Pro Xbox One S and Xbox One X Jaguar would be later followed by the Puma microarchitecture in br br br ARM architecture based designs br In AMD announced it was working on ARM products both as a semi custom product and server product The initial server product was announced as the Opteron A in an core Cortex A based ARMv A SoC and was expected to be followed by an APU incorporating a Graphics Core Next GPU However the Opteron A was not released until with the delay attributed to adding software support The A was also criticized for not having support from major vendors upon its release br In AMD also announced the K custom core for release in While being ARMv A instruction set architecture compliant the K was expected to be entirely custom designed targeting the server embedded and semi custom markets While ARM architecture development continued products based on K were subsequently delayed with no release planned Development of AMD s x based Zen microarchitecture was preferred br br br Zen based CPUs and APUs br br Zen is an architecture for x based Ryzen series of CPUs and APUs introduced in by AMD and built from the ground up by a team led by Jim Keller beginning with his arrival in and taping out before his departure in September br One of AMD s primary goals with Zen was an IPC increase of at least however in February AMD announced that they had actually achieved a increase Processors made on the Zen architecture are built on the nm FinFET node and have a renewed focus on single core performance and HSA compatibility Previous processors from AMD were either built in the nm process Bulldozer and Piledriver CPUs or the nm process Steamroller and Excavator APUs Because of this Zen is much more energy efficient br The Zen architecture is the first to encompass CPUs and APUs from AMD built for a single socket Socket AM Also new for this architecture is the implementation of simultaneous multithreading SMT technology something Intel has had for years on some of their processors with their proprietary hyper threading implementation of SMT This is a departure from the Clustered MultiThreading design introduced with the Bulldozer architecture Zen also has support for DDR memory br AMD released the Zen based high end Ryzen Summit Ridge series CPUs on March mid range Ryzen series CPUs on April and entry level Ryzen series CPUs on July AMD later released the Epyc line of Zen derived server processors for P and P systems In October AMD released Zen based APUs as Ryzen Mobile incorporating Vega graphics cores In January AMD has announced their new lineup plans with Ryzen AMD launched CPUs with the nm Zen microarchitecture in April following up with the nm Zen microarchitecture in June including an update to the Epyc line with new processors using the Zen microarchitecture in August and Zen slated for release in Q br As of AMD s Ryzen processors were reported to outsell Intel s consumer desktop processors At CES AMD announced their Ryzen Mobile as the first nm x mobile processor the first nm core also thread high performance mobile processor and the first core also thread processor for ultrathin laptops This generation is still based on the Zen architecture In October AMD announced new processors based on the Zen architecture On PassMark s Single thread performance test the Ryzen x bested all other CPUs besides the Ryzen X br In April AMD launched three new SKUs which target commercial HPC workloads hyperconverged infrastructure applications The launch was based on Epyc s nm second generation Rome platform and supported by Dell EMC Hewlett Packard Enterprise Lenovo Supermicro and Nutanix IBM Cloud was its first public cloud partner In August AMD announced their initial lineup of CPUs based on the new Zen architecture br The Steam Deck PlayStation Xbox Series X and Series S all use chips based on the Zen microarchitecture with proprietary tweaks and different configurations in each system s implementation than AMD sells in its own commercially available APUs br br br Graphics products and GPUs br br br ATI prior to AMD acquisition br br Lee Ka Lau Francis Lau Benny Lau and Kwok Yuen Ho founded ATI in as Array Technology Inc br Working primarily in the OEM field ATI produced integrated graphics cards for PC manufacturers such as IBM and Commodore By ATI had grown into an independent graphics card retailer introducing EGA Wonder and VGA Wonder card product lines that year In the early nineties they released products able to process graphics without the CPU in May the Mach in the Mach which offered improved memory bandwidth and GUI acceleration ATI Technologies Inc went public in with shares listed on NASDAQ and on the Toronto Stock Exchange br br In the Mach accelerator debuted powering the Graphics Xpression and Graphics Pro Turbo offering hardware support for YUV to RGB colour space conversion in addition to hardware zoom early techniques of hardware based video acceleration br ATI introduced its first combination of D and D accelerator under the name D Rage This chip was based on the Mach but it featured elemental D acceleration The ATI Rage line powered almost the entire range of ATI graphics products In particular the Rage Pro was one of the first viable D plus D alternatives to dfx s D only Voodoo chipset D acceleration in the Rage line advanced from the basic functionality within the initial D Rage to a more advanced DirectX accelerator in Rage br The All in Wonder product line introduced in was the first combination of integrated graphics chip with TV tuner card and the first chip that enabled display of computer graphics on a TV set The cards featured D acceleration powered by ATI s D Rage II bit D performance TV quality video acceleration analogue video capture TV tuner functionality flicker free TV out and stereo TV audio reception br ATI entered the mobile computing sector by introducing D graphics acceleration to laptops in The Mobility product line had to meet requirements different from those of desktop PCs such as minimized power usage reduced heat output TMDS output capabilities for laptop screens and maximized integration In ATI acquired Tseng Labs s graphics assets which included engineers br The Radeon line of graphics products was unveiled in The initial Radeon graphics processing unit offered an all new design with DirectX D acceleration video acceleration and D acceleration Technology developed for a specific Radeon generation could be built in varying levels of features and performance in order to provide products suited for the entire market range from high end to budget to mobile versions br In ATI acquired ArtX which engineered the Flipper graphics chip used in the GameCube video game console They also created a modified version of the chip codenamed Hollywood for the successor of the GameCube the Wii Microsoft contracted ATI to design the graphics core codenamed Xenos for the Xbox Later in ATI acquired Terayon s cable modem silicon intellectual property strengthening their lead in the consumer digital television market K Y Ho remained as Chairman of the Board until he retired in November Dave Orton replaced him as the President and CEO of the organization br On July a joint announcement revealed that AMD would acquire ATI in a deal valued at billion The acquisition consideration closed on October and included over billion financed from a loan and million shares of AMD stock ATI s operations became part of the AMD Graphics Product Group GPG and ATI s CEO Dave Orton became the Executive Vice President of Visual and Media Businesses at AMD until his resignation in The top level management was reorganized with the Senior Vice President and General Manager and the Senior Vice President and General Manager of Consumer Electronics Group both of whom would report to the CEO of AMD On August John Trikola announced that AMD would retire the ATI brand for its graphics chipsets in favour of the AMD name br br br Radeon within AMD br br In the ATI division of AMD released the TeraScale microarchitecture implementing a unified shader model This design replaced the previous fixed function hardware of previous graphics cards with multipurpose programmable shaders Initially released as part of the GPU for the Xbox this technology would go on to be used in Radeon branded HD parts Three generations of TeraScale would be designed and used in parts from to br br br Combined GPU and CPU divisions br In a restructuring AMD merged the CPU and GPU divisions to support the company s APUs which fused both graphics and general purpose processing In AMD released the successor to TeraScale Graphics Core Next GCN This new microarchitecture emphasized GPGPU compute capability in addition to graphics processing with a particular aim of supporting heterogeneous computing on AMD s APUs GCN s reduced instruction set ISA allowed for significantly increased compute capability over TeraScale s very long instruction word ISA Since GCN s introduction with the HD five generations of the GCN architecture have been produced from through at least br br br Radeon Technologies Group br In September AMD separated the graphics technology division of the company into an independent internal unit called the Radeon Technologies Group RTG headed by Raja Koduri This gave the graphics division of AMD autonomy in product design and marketing The RTG then went on to create and release the Polaris and Vega microarchitectures released in and respectively In particular the Vega or fifth generation GCN microarchitecture includes a number of major revisions to improve performance and compute capabilities br In November Raja Koduri left RTG and CEO and President Lisa Su took his position In January it was reported that two industry veterans joined RTG namely Mike Rayfield as senior vice president and general manager of RTG and David Wang as senior vice president of engineering for RTG In January AMD announced that its second generation RDNA graphics architecture was in development with the aim of competing with the Nvidia RTX graphics products for performance leadership In October AMD announced their new RX series series GPUs their first high end product based on RDNA and capable of handling ray tracing natively aiming to challenge Nvidia s RTX GPUs br br br Semi custom and game console products br In AMD s then CEO Rory Read began a program to offer semi custom designs Rather than AMD simply designing and offering a single product potential customers could work with AMD to design a custom chip based on AMD s intellectual property Customers pay a non recurring engineering fee for design and development and a purchase price for the resulting semi custom products In particular AMD noted their unique position of offering both x and graphics intellectual property These semi custom designs would have design wins as the APUs in the PlayStation and Xbox One and the subsequent PlayStation Pro Xbox One S Xbox One X Xbox Series X S and PlayStation Financially these semi custom products would represent a majority of the company s revenue in In November AMD and Intel announced that Intel would market a product combining in a single package an Intel Core CPU a semi custom AMD Radeon GPU and HBM memory br br br Other hardware br br br AMD motherboard chipsets br br Before the launch of Athlon processors in AMD designed chipsets for their processors spanning the K and K processor generations The chipsets include the AMD AMD and the AMD chipsets The situation changed in with the release of Athlon processors and AMD chose not to further design its own chipsets for its desktop processors while opening the desktop platform to allow other firms to design chipsets This was the Open Platform Management Architecture with ATI VIA and SiS developing their own chipset for Athlon processors and later Athlon X and Athlon FX processors including the Quad FX platform chipset from Nvidia br The initiative went further with the release of Opteron server processors as AMD stopped the design of server chipsets in after releasing the AMD chipset and again opened the server platform for firms to develop chipsets for Opteron processors As of today Nvidia and Broadcom are the sole designing firms of server chipsets for Opteron processors br As the company completed the acquisition of ATI Technologies in the firm gained the ATI design team for chipsets which previously designed the Radeon Xpress and the Radeon Xpress chipsets AMD then renamed the chipsets for AMD processors under AMD branding for instance the CrossFire Xpress chipset was renamed as AMD X CrossFire chipset In February AMD announced the first AMD branded chipset since with the release of the AMD G chipset previously under the development codename RS targeted at mainstream IGP computing It was the industry s first to implement a HDMI port on motherboards shipping for more than a million units While ATI had aimed at releasing an Intel IGP chipset the plan was scrapped and the inventories of Radeon Xpress codenamed RS sold under ATI brand was sold to two OEMs Abit and ASRock Although AMD stated the firm would still produce Intel chipsets Intel had not granted the license of MHz FSB to ATI br On November AMD announced a new chipset series portfolio the AMD Series chipsets covering from the enthusiast multi graphics segment to the value IGP segment to replace the AMD chipsets and AMD series chipsets marking AMD s first enthusiast multi graphics chipset Discrete graphics chipsets were launched on November as part of the codenamed Spider desktop platform and IGP chipsets were launched at a later time in spring as part of the codenamed Cartwheel platform br AMD returned to the server chipsets market with the AMD S series server chipsets It includes support for up to six SATA Gbit s ports the C power state which is featured in Fusion processors and AHCI with SATA FIS based switching support This is a chipset family supporting Phenom processors and Quad FX enthusiast platform FX IGP GX br With the advent of AMD s APUs in traditional northbridge features such as the connection to graphics and the PCI Express controller were incorporated into the APU die Accordingly APUs were connected to a single chip chipset renamed the Fusion Controller Hub FCH which primarily provided southbridge functionality br AMD released new chipsets in to support the release of their new Ryzen products As the Zen microarchitecture already includes much of the northbridge connectivity the AM based chipsets primarily varied in the number of additional PCI Express lanes USB connections and SATA connections available These AM chipsets were designed in conjunction with ASMedia br br br Embedded products br br br Embedded CPUs br br In the early s AMD began marketing a series of embedded system on a chips SoCs called AMD lan starting with the SC and SC Both combines a Bit Am SX low voltage MHz or MHz CPU with memory controller PC AT peripheral controllers real time clock PLL clock generators and ISA bus interface The SC integrates in addition two PC card slots and a CGA compatible LCD controller They were followed in by the SC xx types Now supporting VESA Local Bus and using the Am with up to MHz clock speed A SC with MHze g was used in the Nokia Communicator In the SC was announced Using an Am with MHz or MHz and supporting SDRAM and PCI it was the latest member of the series br In February AMD acquired Alchemy Semiconductor for its Alchemy line of MIPS processors for the hand held and portable media player markets On June AMD officially announced that the line was to be transferred to Raza Microelectronics Inc a designer of MIPS processors for embedded applications br In August AMD also purchased the Geode business which was originally the Cyrix MediaGX from National Semiconductor to augment its existing line of embedded x processor products During the second quarter of it launched new low power Geode NX processors based on the K Thoroughbred architecture with speeds of fanless processors MHz and GHz and GHz processor with fan of TDP W This technology is used in a variety of embedded systems Casino slot machines and customer kiosks for instance several UMPC designs in Asia markets as well as the OLPC XO computer an inexpensive laptop computer intended to be distributed to children in developing countries around the world The Geode LX processor was announced in and is said will continue to be available through br AMD has also introduced bit processors into its embedded product line starting with the AMD Opteron processor Leveraging the high throughput enabled through HyperTransport and the Direct Connect Architecture these server class processors have been targeted at high end telecom and storage applications In AMD added the AMD Athlon AMD Turion and Mobile AMD Sempron processors to its embedded product line Leveraging the same bit instruction set and Direct Connect Architecture as the AMD Opteron but at lower power levels these processors were well suited to a variety of traditional embedded applications Throughout and into AMD has continued to add both single core Mobile AMD Sempron and AMD Athlon processors and dual core AMD Athlon X and AMD Turion processors to its embedded product line and now offers embedded bit solutions starting with W TDP Mobile AMD Sempron and AMD Athlon processors for fan less designs up to multi processor systems leveraging multi core AMD Opteron processors all supporting longer than standard availability br The ATI acquisition in included the Imageon and Xilleon product lines In late the entire handheld division was sold off to Qualcomm who have since produced the Adreno series Also in the Xilleon division was sold to Broadcom br In April AMD announced the release of the M T integrated graphics chipset for embedded designs This enabled AMD to offer complete processor and chipset solutions targeted at embedded applications requiring high performance D and video such as emerging digital signage kiosk and Point of Sale applications The M T was followed by the M E specifically for embedded applications which removed the TV output which required Macrovision licensing for OEMs and enabled native support for dual TMDS outputs enabling dual independent DVI interfaces br In January AMD announced the AMD Embedded G Series Accelerated Processing Unit This was the first APU for embedded applications These were followed by updates in and br In May AMD Announced the AMD Embedded R Series Accelerated Processing Unit This family of products incorporates the Bulldozer CPU architecture and Discrete class Radeon HD G Series graphics This was followed by a system on a chip SoC version in which offered a faster CPU and faster graphics with support for DDR SDRAM memory br br br Embedded graphics br AMD builds graphic processors for use in embedded systems They can be found in anything from casinos to healthcare with a large portion of products being used in industrial machines These products include a complete graphics processing device in a compact multi chip module including RAM
