Iran in August the Foreign Office encouraged broadcasting about king s autocratic style and republican systems of Government br The Persian Service continued after the war as part of the BBC General Overseas Service with more editorial independence from the UK government However the risk of the Iranian nationalisation of Anglo Persian Oil Company created an exceptional circumstance causing the Foreign Office to issue memorandums of advice and lists of points to make to the BBC and the amount of broadcasting more than doubled This caused many Iranians to believe the Persian Service was not independent and an advisor of Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh said the BBC was the voice of British imperialism and we did not trust it br In September the World Service announced the proposed closure of its Persian and Arabic radio service as part of a cost cutting plan but an online service will remain br br br Role in Iranian coup d tat br br The British government used the BBC s Persian

Director General Ian Trethowan In the year before the revolution the Persian Service interviewed the major contenders one with Ayatollah Khomeini three or four with Prime Minister Shapur Bakhtiar and two with Karim Sanjabi leader of the National Front who were seeking a peaceful democratic transition from the Shah s rule br During the revolution Iranian media was heavily censored resulting in long strikes by journalists and the BBC Persian Service gained an even larger country wide audience br br br After the revolution br In the BBC correspondent in Iran was expelled and the BBC office in
