Oculus Rift S is a discontinued virtual reality headset co developed by Lenovo Technologies and Oculus VR Announced in March and released that May it is a successor to the original Oculus Rift CV model with noted changes including a new inside out positional tracking system with cameras embedded inside the headset unit similarly to its sister device the Oculus Quest a higher resolution display and a new halo head strap br The Rift S received mixed reviews with critics praising improvements in comfort and ease of setup due to the halo strap and new tracking system but characterizing the Rift S as being only an incremental upgrade over the CV and noting regressions such as a lower refresh rate and the lack of hardware adjustment for inter pupillary distance IPD br The Rift S was discontinued in April br br br Development br In June Oculus VR co founder Palmer Luckey revealed that Oculus was already working on a successor to the original Rift and planned to release it in around years from the original Rift release The headset would feature higher resolution screens and inside out tracking and would enable room scale experiences br In October Oculus VR co founder and former CEO until Brendan Iribe left Oculus VR allegedly due to both parts having fundamentally different views on the future of Oculus that grew deeper over time Iribe wanted to deliver comfortable VR experience competitive on the high end market while Oculus leadership aimed to lower the VR gaming entry barrier Mark Zuckerberg CEO of Oculus parent company Facebook Inc repeatedly stated that Oculus goal is to bring a billion users into VR Iribe was said to be overseeing the development of the second generation Oculus Rift which was canceled the week prior to his departure br br br Hardware br br br Display br Rift S used a single fast switch LCD panel with a resolution of and an Hz refresh rate down from the CV s Hz br Also compared to the original Rift the Rift S uses next generation lens technology introduced in the Oculus Go which almost entirely eliminated god rays The field of view was compared to on the Rift CV The headset features software only inter pupillary distance IPD adjustment because it uses a single screen instead of dual displays br br br Audio br As opposed to earphones attached to the strap as on the CV built in audio on the Rift S uses speakers embedded in the headset itself positioned slightly above the user s ears br br br Oculus Insight br The Rift S uses the same Oculus Insight inside out tracking system used by the Oculus Quest whereby five cameras built into the headset two on the front one on either side and one looking directly upwards track infrared diodes in the controllers as well as input from the accelerometers in the headset and controllers and a prediction engine are used to spatially track the headset and controller removing the need for external sensors mounted in the play area The Rift S contains an additional fifth camera over the Quest s four to improve compatibility with existing Oculus Rift software br Passthrough is provided as a safety feature which displays output from the cameras in monoscopic black and white when the player exits their designated boundaries Passthrough also makes use of Asynchronous SpaceWarp to produce a comfortable experience with minimal depth disparity or performance impact br br br Halo headband br Rift S features a halo headband which according to Oculus had a better weight distribution better light blocking and was supposed to be more comfortable in comparison to that of the Rift CV The headset was co developed with Lenovo incorporating their experience in the VR and AR space and feedback from the Lenovo Legion gaming community The device has a knob at the rear of the band which brought the device forward and backward The top strap was there to make it snug on the wearer s head while a button underneath the right side of the headset is used to release the headset from its support allowing it to be adjusted to be closer or farther from the user s eyes The device lacks physical adjustment for inter pupillary distance IPD but this setting was supported in software br br br Controllers br br Oculus Rift S uses the same second generation Oculus Touch controllers used in the Oculus Quest The controllers are similar to the ones used by the original Oculus Rift except with the tracking ring on the top to be seen by the headset s built in cameras instead of being on the bottom to be seen by the external Constellation cameras br On April Nate Mitchell co founder of Oculus VR and head of VR product at Facebook explained via Twitter that some easter egg labels meant for prototypes accidentally made it onto the internal hardware for tens of thousands of Oculus Quest and Rift S Touch controllers The messages on final production hardware say This Space For Rent and The Masons Were Here while a few development kits contained Big Brother is Watching and Hi iFixit We See You br br br Software br br All existing and future Oculus Rift compatible software are supported by the Rift S The Oculus storefront also supports cross buys between Oculus Quest and PC for games released on both platforms br br br Release br Oculus Rift S was announced during GDC on March with shipments starting on May the same year At launch it shared the same US price point as the CV br On September Facebook announced the upcoming discontinuation of the Rift S in favor of the Oculus Quest with sales ending in spring In December Facebook discounted the Rift S to US br In April production of the Rift S was discontinued In an email sent to UploadVR a Facebook representative stated that stock of the headset would no longer be replenished moving forward That June the Rift S section in the Oculus website was updated and was no longer being sold br br br Reception br The Rift S received mixed reviews The Verge felt that the Insight system was easily a match for the old Rift tracking cameras and helped make setup less complicated and that its halo strap was more comfortable than that of the Oculus Quest but felt that some of its other changes were downgrades over the previous model and Quest including replacing its headphones with directional speakers the lack of hardware IPD adjustment and a screen whose resolution only slightly higher than the Rift CV but lower than the Oculus Quest br TechRadar characterized the Rift S as being an incremental upgrade over the CV similarly praising its elegantly simple tracking system but noting only marginal hardware updates and regressions such as its directional speakers a tighter fit and no hardware IPD and its lower refresh rate Coming from a CV the reviewer also noted that the Rift S was also the first headset to make them feel nauseous although citing possible factors such as the lower refresh rate or Fallout VR being a SteamVR game that was not fully optimized for the Oculus platform It was argued that the Rift S does very little to appeal to those that have already invested in the Oculus ecosystem and that the future of Oculus VR if it is ever to have mainstream appeal from a consumer perspective looks to sit then with the Oculus Quest whose freedom of movement does stand the chance of being truly transformational given the right software br Oculus co founder Palmer Luckey criticized the lack of hardware IPD stating that the software only adjustment was not comparable in any way to an actual physical IPD adjustment mechanism He estimated that about of the population including himself would not be able to use the Rift S comfortably In comparison the original Rift CV was designed to support any IPD between the th and th percentile mm and mm respectively making the device comfortable for of the population br br br br br br External links br Official website
