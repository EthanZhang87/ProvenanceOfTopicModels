Establishment br The Mozilla Corporation was established on August to handle the revenue related operations of the Mozilla Foundation As a non profit the Mozilla Foundation is limited in terms of the types and amounts of revenue it can have The Mozilla Corporation as a taxable organization essentially a commercial operation does not have to comply with such strict rules Upon its creation the Mozilla Corporation took over several areas from the Mozilla Foundation including coordination and integration of the development of Firefox and Thunderbird by the global free software community and the management of relationships with businesses br With the creation of the Mozilla Corporation the rest of the Mozilla Foundation narrowed its focus to concentrate on the Mozilla project s governance and policy issues In November with the release of Mozilla Firefox the Mozilla Corporation s website at mozilla com was unveiled as the new home of the Firefox and Thunderbird products online br In the Mozilla Corporation generated million in revenue and million in expenses with of that revenue coming from Google for assigning Google as the browser s default search engine and for click throughs on

magnitude Two years later TechCrunch wrote In return for setting Google as the default search engine on Firefox Google pays Mozilla a substantial sum in the total amounted to around million or of the company s total revenue The deal was originally going to expire in but was later extended to and then ran through The deal was extended again another years until November Under the deal Mozilla was to have received from Google another million million annually nearly times the previous amount The partnership to use Google as the default search engine was resumed after a three year hiatus in br In

open source facility at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond Wash Mozilla accepted the offer br In March Mozilla came under some criticism after it appointed Brendan Eich as its new chief executive officer CEO In Eich had made a contribution in support of California Proposition a ballot initiative that barred legal recognition of same sex marriages in California Three of six Mozilla board members reportedly resigned over the choice of CEO though Mozilla said the resigning board members had a variety of reasons and reasserted its continued commitment to LGBT equality including same sex marriage On April the online dating site OkCupid started displaying visitors using Mozilla Firefox a message urging them to switch to a different web browser pointing out that of the matches made on OkCupid are between same sex couples On April Mozilla announced that Eich had decided to step down as CEO and also leave the board of Mozilla Foundation This in turn prompted criticism from some commentators who criticized the pressure that led Eich to resign For example Conor Friedersdorf argued in The Atlantic that the general practice of punishing people in business for bygone political donations is most likely to entrench powerful interests and weaken the ability of the powerless to challenge the status quo br In April Chris Beard the former chief marketing officer of Mozilla was appointed interim CEO Beard was named CEO on July of the same year br On February Mozilla acquired the bookmark manager and suggestion service Pocket In accordance with Mozilla s history of operating as open by default and based on comments by Mozilla chief business officer Denelle Dixon Thayer that Pocket would become part of the Mozilla open source project it was reported that Pocket would

Mozilla board member Laura Chambers was announced as interim CEO br br br Affiliations br br br Google br The Mozilla Corporation s relationship with Google has been noted in the popular press especially with regard to their paid referral agreement Mozilla s original deal with Google to have Google Search as the default web search engine in the browser expired in but a new deal was struck where Google agreed to pay Mozilla just under a billion dollars over three years until in exchange for keeping Google as its default search engine The price was driven up due to aggressive bidding from Microsoft s Bing and Yahoo s presence in the auction as well Despite the deal Mozilla Firefox maintains relationships with Bing Yahoo Yandex Baidu Amazon com and eBay The partnership with Google was renewed in and remains active as of br In of Mozilla s revenues were derived from Google br The release of the anti phishing protection in Firefox in particular raised considerable controversy Anti phishing protection enabled by default is based on a list updated twice hourly from Google s servers The browser also sends a cookie with each update request Internet privacy advocacy groups have expressed concerns surrounding Google s possible uses for this data especially since Firefox s privacy policy states that Google may share non personally identifying information gathered through safe browsing with third parties including business partners br Following Google CEO Eric Schmidt s comments in December regarding privacy during a CNBC show Asa Dotzler Mozilla s director of community development suggested that users use the Bing search engine instead of Google search Google also promoted Firefox through YouTube until the release of Google Chrome br br br Yahoo br In November

see Firefox as a threat and that there was not significant demand for the feature set of Firefox among Microsoft s users Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates has used Firefox but has commented that it s just another browser and IE Microsoft s Internet Explorer is better br A Microsoft SEC filing on June acknowledged that competitors such as Mozilla offer software that competes with the Internet Explorer Web browsing capabilities of our Windows operating system products The release of Internet Explorer was fast tracked and included functionality that was previously available in Firefox and other browsers such as tabbed browsing and RSS feeds br Despite the cold reception from Microsoft s top management the Internet Explorer development team maintains a relationship with Mozilla They meet regularly to discuss web standards such as extended validation certificates In Mozilla agreed to allow Microsoft to use its Web feed logo in the interest of common graphical representation of the Web feeds feature br In August Microsoft offered to help Mozilla integrate Firefox with the then forthcoming Windows Vista an offer Mozilla accepted br In October as congratulations for a successful ship of Firefox the Internet Explorer development team sent a cake to Mozilla As a nod to the browser wars some jokingly suggested that Mozilla should send a cake back along with the recipe in reference to the open source software movement The IE development team sent another cake on June upon the successful release of Firefox again on March for Firefox and yet again for the Firefox release br In November Jeff Jones a security strategy director in Microsoft s Trustworthy Computing Group criticized Firefox claiming that Internet Explorer experienced fewer vulnerabilities and fewer higher severity vulnerabilities than Firefox in typical enterprise scenarios br Mozilla developer Mike Shaver discounted the study citing Microsoft s bundling of security fixes and the study s focus on fixes rather than vulnerabilities as crucial flaws br In February Microsoft released Service Pack for version of the NET Framework This update also installed Microsoft NET Framework Assistant add on

remove it However the only way to get rid of this extension was to modify manually the Windows Registry which could cause Windows systems to fail to boot up if not done correctly br On October Mozilla blocked all versions of Microsoft NET Framework Assistant from being used with Firefox and from the Mozilla Add ons service Two days later the add on was removed from the blocklist after confirmation from Microsoft that it is not a vector for vulnerabilities Version released on June to the Mozilla Add ons service and later of the Microsoft NET Framework Assistant allows the user to disable and

Revenue Service opened an audit of the Mozilla Foundation s revenues in due to its search royalties and in the investigation was expanded to the and tax years though that part of the audit was closed
