Munich Germany Whiteley United Kingdom Cairo Egypt Atmel makes much of its product line at vendor fabrication facilities It owns a facility in Colorado Springs Colorado that manufactures its XSense line of flexible touch sensors br In Microchip agreed to buy Atmel for US equivalent to in billion in a deal brokered by JPMorgan Chase and Qatalyst br br br History br br br Founding and s growth br Atmel Corporation was founded in by George Perlegos Atmel was an acronym for advanced technology for memory and logic Perlegos had worked in the memory group of Intel in the s and had co founded Seeq Technology to manufacture EPROM memory Using only US in capital Atmel was initially operated as a fabless company using Sanyo and General Instrument to make the chip wafers br The first Atmel memory products used less power than competitors Customers included Motorola Nokia and Ericsson In Intel sued Atmel for patent infringement Rather than fight the patent claim Atmel redesigned its products to use different intellectual property These had better performance and even lower power consumption In addition Atmel then entered the flash memory business that Intel had focused on Atmel used US million in venture capital for the purchase of a fabrication facility from Honeywell in Colorado Springs Atmel then invested another US million in manufacturing technology br br br s expansion br br In Atmel expanded the Colorado facility after acquiring Concurrent Logic a field programmable gate array FPGA manufacturer The company made its initial public offering IPO in which yielded more than US million saw Atmel enter the microprocessor market The first Atmel flash memory microcontroller was based on the Intel br The controller executed an instruction for every clock cycle as opposed to the cycles that legacy parts required br In Atmel purchased the EEPROM assets of Seeq Technology LSI Corporation acquired the rest of Seeq in In Atmel was among the first companies to license the ARM architecture creating its AT family of devices followed by the SAM family and more recently a full selection of Cortex based solutions including ones based on the ultra low power ARM Cortex M Atmel now has dozens of families of ARM based devices In Atmel acquired the pan European chipmaker European Silicon Structures ES and thus gained a fabrication facility in Rousset France Atmel built a new fab alongside the existing ES fab This business unit was named Atmel ES Atmel acquired Digital Research in Electronic Acoustics and Music DREAM in Atmel formed a design team in Trondheim Norway to develop the Atmel AVR line of RISC microcontrollers This team combined technology of former students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology with Atmel s expertise in flash memory These bit Harvard architecture chips were first developed in The AVR chip is the basis of most Arduino open source development boards In Atmel purchased part of TEMIC from Vishay Intertechnology which provided them with a fab in Germany as well as part of MHS from Vishay that gave them a fab in Nantes France br In September Atmel acquired a fabrication plant in North Tyneside England from Siemens via a million grant from the UK government and paying Siemens around US million br br br Streamlining br Atmel streamlined operations with a strategy called fab lite This started in when Atmel sold the MHS fab in Nantes France to Xbybus In February Steven Laub became a director and in August president and chief executive officer Under Laub Atmel divested more manufacturing plants and business lines Atmel announced the sale of its North Tyneside facility Fab on October The manufacturing equipment was sold to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd TSMC and the property and associated land to Highbridge Business Park Limited In Atmel sold their fab in Germany to Tejas semiconductor In Atmel received approval from the French government to sell its fab to Germany based LFoundry GmbH while retaining their design center there Atmel completed the sale of their Secure Microcontroller Solutions smart card business to INSIDE Secure In February Atmel sold its Digital Research in Electronics Acoustics and Music DREAM business which sold products for karaoke and other entertainment machines for US million Atmel s DataFlash serial interface flash memory products were sold to Adesto Technologies in October br br br Acquisitions br br As Atmel divested several fabs and ancillary business lines Laub also oversaw acquisitions One strategy was to participate in the touch screen market both in the semiconductor chips and the sensors themselves In Atmel bought Queens Award winning Quantum Research Group Ltd now known as Atmel Technologies Ireland Limited a wholly owned subsidiary a supplier of capacitive sensing technology Work done at Quantum led to the release of Atmel s XSense product line a flexible touch screen based on copper mesh electrodes br Atmel moved into Internet of things technology They completed the acquisition of Advanced Digital Design S A a Spanish company that develops power line communication Ozmo Devices which developed products for Wi Fi Direct was acquired by Atmel in December Ozmo was founded in as H Stream Wireless by Kateljin Vleugels and Roel Peeters and was based in Palo Alto California br In Atmel had approximately US billion in annual revenue with over of their revenue from microcontrollers and net income of US million br Atmel purchased the smart metering product lines of IDT Corporation in March br Atmel purchased Newport Media in July This will provide Atmel further capability in wireless Bluetooth and Wi Fi br br br Acquisition by Microchip Technology br In October Atmel received an unsolicited offer from Microchip Technology and ON Semiconductor estimated at US billion The offer was eventually rejected and the companies gave up on their hostile takeover attempt br However in Microchip agreed to buy Atmel for billion JPMorgan Chase and Qatalyst Partners served as financial advisers to Microchip and Atmel respectively The company had previously heard offers from Cypress Semiconductor and Dialog Semiconductor in and the deal with Microchip was expected to be finalized at the end of Q br Atmel finally merged with Microchip Technology in July after prolonged negotiations for US billion br br br The end of Atmel Way br Apple Computer purchased the old cul de sac where Atmel s HQ office sat Paperwork was filed with the city of San Jose to change the name from Atmel Way to Orchard Place br br br Products br br br Microcontrollers br br A large part of Atmel s revenue is from microcontrollers These include the AVR and bit microcontrollers ARM architecture microprocessors
