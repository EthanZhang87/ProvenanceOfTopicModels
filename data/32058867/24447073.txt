Tahoe LAFS Tahoe Least Authority File Store is a free and open secure decentralized fault tolerant distributed data store and distributed file system It can be used as an online backup system or to serve as a file or Web host similar to Freenet depending on the front end used to insert and access files in the Tahoe system Tahoe can also be used in a RAID like fashion using multiple disks to make a single large Redundant Array of Inexpensive Nodes RAIN pool of reliable data storage br The system is designed and implemented around the principle of least authority POLA described by Brian Warner one of the project s original founders as the idea that any component of the system should have as little power of authority as it needs to get its job done Strict adherence to this convention is enabled by the use of cryptographic capabilities that provide the minimum set of privileges necessary to perform a given task by asking agents A RAIN array acts as a storage volume these servers do not need to be trusted by confidentiality or integrity of the stored data br br br History br Tahoe LAFS was started in at online backup services company All My Data and has been actively developed since In Brian Warner and Zooko Wilcox O Hearn published a paper on Tahoe at the th ACM international workshop on Storage security and survivability br When All My Data closed in Tahoe LAFS became a free software project under the GNU General Public License or The Transitive Grace License which allows owners of the code twelve months to profit from their work before releasing it In Tahoe LAFS was mentioned as a tool against censorship by the Electronic Frontier Foundation In it was one of the hackathon projects at the GNU th anniversary br br br Functionality br br The Tahoe LAFS Client sends an unencrypted file via a web API to the HTTPS Server The HTTPS Server passes the file off to the Tahoe LAFS Storage client which encrypts the file and then uses erasure coding to store fragments of the file on multiple storage drives br Tahoe LAFS features provider independent security in that the integrity and confidentiality of the files are guaranteed by the algorithms used on the client independent of the storage servers which may fail or may be operated by untrusted entities Files are encrypted using AES then split up using erasure coding such that only a subset K of the original N servers storing the file chunks need to be available in order to recreate the original file The default parameters are K N so each file is shared across different servers accessing it requires the correct function of any of those servers br Tahoe provides very little control over on which nodes data is stored br br br Fork br A patched version of Tahoe LAFS exists from and was made to run on anonymous networks such as I P with support for multiple introducers There is also a version for Microsoft Windows It is distributed from a site within the I P network In contrast to normal Tahoe LAFS operation when I P and Tahoe LAFS are used together the location of the nodes are disguised This allows for anonymous distributed grids to be formed br br br See also br br CephFS file system br Coda file system br Comparison of distributed file systems br Freenet br GlusterFS br Moose File System br LizardFS br iFolder br List of distributed file systems br Lustre file system br Parallel Virtual File System br XtreemFS br IPFS br br br br br br External links br Official website
