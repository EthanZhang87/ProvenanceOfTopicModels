GREE in for US million which he used to found Hammer Chisel a game development studio in Their first product was Fates Forever released in which Citron anticipated to be the first MOBA game on mobile platforms but it did not become commercially successful br According to Citron during the development process he noticed how difficult it was for his team to work out tactics in games like Final Fantasy XIV and League of Legends using available voice over IP VoIP software This led to the development of a chat service with a focus on user friendliness with minimal impact on performance The name Discord was chosen because it sounds cool and has to do with talking was easy to say spell remember and was available for trademark and website In addition Discord in the gaming community was the problem they wished to solve br To develop Discord Hammer Chisel gained additional funding from YouWeb s incubator which had also funded the startup of Hammer Chisel and from Benchmark capital and Tencent br Discord was publicly released in May under the domain name discordapp com According to Citron they made no specific moves to target any specific audience but some gaming related subreddits

investments to help with these changes br In March Discord announced it had hired its first finance chief former head of finance for Pinterest Tomasz Marcinkowski An inside source called this one of the first steps for the company towards a potential initial public offering though co founder and chief executive officer Jason Citron had stated earlier in the month he was not thinking about taking the company public Discord doubled its monthly user base to about million in The same month Bloomberg News and The Wall Street Journal reported that several companies were looking to purchase Discord with Microsoft named as the likely lead buyer at a value estimated at billion However they ended talks with Microsoft opting to stay independent Instead Discord launched another round of investment in April Among those investing into the company was Sony Interactive Entertainment the company stated that it intended to integrate a portion of Discord s services into the PlayStation Network by br br In May Discord rebranded its game controller shaped logo Clyde in celebration of its sixth anniversary The company also changed the color palette of its branding and user interfaces making it much more saturated to be more bold and playful They also changed its slogan from your place to talk to imagine a place believing that it would be easier to attach to additional taglines these changes were met with backlash and criticism from Discord users br In July Discord acquired Sentropy an internet moderation company br Ahead of a funding round in August Discord had reported million in revenues triple from the prior year and had an estimated valuation of billion According to Citron the increased valuation was due to the shift away from broadcast wide open social media communication services to more small intimate places as well as increased usage from the COVID pandemic They captured users that were leaving Facebook and other platforms due to privacy concerns Citron states that they are still in talks with several potential buyers including all major gaming console manufacturers From this the company secured an additional million in further investments in September br In September

voice chat as well as allowing users to create passwords that only consist of six characters br In early Discord was used to publish classified United States documents in one of the most significant

br br Features br Discord is centered around managing communities Communication tools such as voice and video calls persistent chat rooms and integrations with other gamer focused services along with the general ability to send direct messages and create personal groups are present br br br Servers br Discord communities are organized into discrete collections of channels called servers Although they are referred to as servers on the front end they are called guilds in the developer documentation to distinguish themselves from actual servers Users can create servers for free manage their public visibility and create voice channels text channels and categories to sort the channels into Most servers have a limit of members but this limit can be raised if the server owner contacts Discord br Users can also create roles and assign them to server members Roles can among other things determine which channels users have access to change users colors and designate a server s moderation team The previously largest known Discord server was Snowsgiving an official Discord controlled server made for the winter holiday season This server reached million members In the server for Midjourney reached over million members making it the largest server on Discord br Starting October Discord allows game developers and publishers to verify their servers Verified servers like

digit number called a discriminator colloquially a Discord tag prefixed with which was added to the end of their username Users who subscribed to Discord Nitro had the ability to change this tag to any four digit number This system was ultimately changed to a handle based system in May removing the discriminator from usernames This new system mandated a change of username Users selected their new usernames in priority based on how early they registered for Discord Nitro status and ownership of partner and verified servers Users criticized the possible impersonation risk that may arise if their previous username was claimed by another user br In June Discord added a feature that allows the user to add an about me section to their profile as well as a custom colored banner at the top of their profile Subscribers to Discord Nitro have the added ability to upload static or animated images as their banners instead of solid colors br br br Video calls and streaming br Video calling and

distribution br In August Discord launched a games storefront beta allowing users to purchase a curated set of games through the service This will include a First on Discord featured set of games that their developers attest to Discord s help in getting launched giving these games days of exclusivity on the Discord marketplace Discord Nitro subscribers will also gain access to a rotating set of games as part of their subscription with the price of Nitro being bumped from to a month A cheaper service called Nitro Classic was also released that has the same perks as Nitro but does not include free games br Following the launch of the Epic Games Store which challenged Valve s Steam storefront by only taking a cut of game revenue Discord announced in December that it would reduce its own revenue cut to br To further support developers starting in March Discord gave the ability for developers and publishers that ran their own servers to offer their games through a dedicated store channel on their server with Discord managing the payment processing and distribution This can be used for example to give select users access to alpha and beta builds of a game in progress as an early access alternative br Also in March Discord removed the digital storefront instead choosing to focus on the Nitro subscription and having direct sales be done through developer s own servers In September Discord announced that it was ending its free game service in October as they found too few people were playing the games offered br br br Developer tools and bots br In December the company

official app directory where server owners can add bots to their servers in Discord The Verge described bots as an important part of Discord br br br Unofficial extensions br Although Discord disallows modifications many unofficial extensions have been created BetterDiscord for example is an open source desktop modification that allows various plugins to be installed These plugins augment existing functionality or add features that are not offered by Discord One plugin for example allows its users to apply custom skins for free another plugin allows increasing the volume of a voice call participant beyond the default BetterDiscord has generally been well received though PC Gamer has said it is prone to crashes and bugs According to BetterDiscord s developers users of the modification are not at risk of being sanctioned by Discord so long as they do not use additional modifications that violate Discord s terms of service br br br Infrastructure br Discord is a
