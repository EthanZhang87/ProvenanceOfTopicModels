launch br Lean In is intended for professional women to help them achieve their career goals and for men who want to contribute to a more equitable society The book argues that barriers are still preventing women from taking leadership roles in the workplace barriers such as discrimination blatant and subtle sexism and sexual harassment Sandberg claims there are also barriers that women create for themselves through internalizing systematic discrimination and societal gender roles Sandberg argues that in order for change to happen women need to break down these societal and personal barriers by striving for and achieving leadership roles The ultimate goal is to encourage women to lean in to positions of leadership because she believes that by having more female voices in

to mimic men and that society needs to change to adapt to women s issues instead is made by former Facebook employee Marissa Orr in Lean Out For example the book has been criticized for overlooking the struggles of mothers who may not be able to lean in Sandberg mentions both of these issues in the introduction of her book stating that she is acutely aware that the vast majority of women are struggling to make ends meet and take care of their families and that her intention was to offer advice that would have been useful long before I had heard of Google or Facebook Furthermore following
