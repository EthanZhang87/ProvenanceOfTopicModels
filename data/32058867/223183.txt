title: Zephyr (protocol)
id: 223183
Created at MIT as part of Project Athena Zephyr was designed as an instant messaging protocol and application suite with a heavy Unix background Using the do one thing do it well philosophy of Unix it was made up of several separate programs working together to make a complete messaging system Zephyr and IRC were the first widely used IP based instant messaging systems br br br Creation br Zephyr is the invention of Ciar n Anthony DellaFera who was at that time an employee of Digital Equipment Corporation and a Visiting Research Scientist at Project Athena The design originated as a solution to the reverse Remote Procedure Call RPC problem how can service providers servers in a client server system locate and communicate with service users The initial concept emerged from conversations between Ciar n and Michael R Gretzinger another systems engineer at Project Athena in early By mid to late Ciar n had distilled the problem to two specific issues the ability to locate users in a distributed computing environment known today as presence detection and the ability to deliver scalable light weight and authentic messages in a distributed computing environment The Zephyr Development Team Mark W Eichin Robert S French David C Jedlinsky John T Kohl William E Sommerfeld was responsible for the creation of the initial code base and the subsequent releases that were issued throughout the late s br br br Application br Zephyr is still in use today at a few university environments such as Carnegie Mellon Iowa State University of Maryland College Park Brown University and MIT It has been largely replaced by modern and more popular instant messenger systems such as XMPP MIT currently operates both Zephyr and XMPP br br br Points of interest br Zephyr uses UDP datagrams sent between ports and It is incompatible with most routers doing NAT because it reports the internal IP address and so returning datagrams are incorrectly routed Most sites have deployed Zephyr using Kerberos authentication exclusively though in late some sites including Iowa State deployed Zephyr using Kerberos br br br Client support br BarnOwl has always had Zephyr protocol support br Pidgin supports the Zephyr protocol since version pre April br Adium added support for Zephyr in Version October but dropped in version b June br br br See also br Comparison of instant messaging clients br br br br br br External links br Zephyr br The Usenix paper on Zephyr br Zephyr on Athena br MIT Q A about Zephyr br Zephyr s Source Code
