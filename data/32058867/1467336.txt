title: Secure communication
id: 1467336
Secure communication is when two entities are communicating and do not want a third party to listen in For this to be the case the entities need to communicate in a way that is unsusceptible to eavesdropping or interception Secure communication includes means by which people can share information with varying degrees of certainty that third parties cannot intercept what is said Other than spoken face to face communication with no possible eavesdropper it is probable that no communication is guaranteed to be secure in this sense although practical obstacles such as legislation resources technical issues interception and encryption and the sheer volume of communication serve to limit surveillance br With many communications taking place over long distance and mediated by technology and increasing awareness of the importance of interception issues technology and its compromise are at the heart of this debate For this reason this article focuses on communications mediated or intercepted by technology br Also see Trusted Computing an approach under present development that achieves security in general at the potential cost of compelling obligatory trust in corporate and government bodies br br br History br In Nikola Tesla demonstrated a radio controlled boat in Madison Square Garden that allowed secure communication between transmitter and receiver br One of the most famous systems of secure communication was the Green Hornet During WWII Winston Churchill had to discuss vital matters with Franklin D Roosevelt In the beginning the calls were made using a voice scrambler as this was thought to be secure When this was found to be untrue engineers started to work on a whole new system which resulted in the Green Hornet or SIGSALY With the Green Hornet any unauthorized party listening in would just hear white noise but the conversation would remain clear to authorized parties As secrecy was paramount the location of the Green Hornet was only known by the people who built it and Winston Churchill To maintain secrecy the Green Hornet was kept in a closet labeled Broom Cupboard The Green Hornet used a one time pad SIGSALY was also never broken br br br Nature and limits of security br br br Types of security br Security can be broadly categorized under the following headings with examples br br Hiding the content or nature of a communication br Code a rule to convert a piece of information for example a letter word phrase or gesture into another form or representation one sign into another sign not necessarily of the same type In communications and information processing encoding is the process by which information from a source is converted into symbols to be communicated Decoding is the reverse process converting these code symbols back into information understandable by a receiver One reason for coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary spoken or written language is difficult or impossible For example semaphore where the configuration of flags held by a signaler or the arms of a semaphore tower encodes parts of the message typically individual letters and numbers Another person standing a great distance away can interpret the flags and reproduce the words sent br Obfuscation br Encryption br Steganography br Identity Based br Hiding the parties to a communication preventing identification promoting anonymity br Crowds and similar anonymous group structures it is difficult to identify who said what when it comes from a crowd br Anonymous communication devices unregistered cellphones Internet cafes br Anonymous proxies br Hard to trace routing methods through unauthorized third party systems or relays br Hiding the fact that a communication takes place br Security by obscurity similar to needle in a haystack br Random traffic creating random data flow to make the presence of genuine communication harder to detect and traffic analysis less reliable br Each of the three types of security is important and depending on the circumstances any of these may be critical For example if a communication is not readily identifiable then it is unlikely to attract attention for identification of parties and the mere fact a communication has taken place regardless of content is often enough by itself to establish an evidential link in legal prosecutions It is also important with computers to be sure where the security is applied and what is covered br br br Borderline cases br A further category which touches upon secure communication is software intended to take advantage of security openings at the end points This software category includes trojan horses keyloggers and other spyware br These types of activity are usually addressed with everyday mainstream security methods such as antivirus software firewalls programs that identify or neutralize adware and spyware and web filtering programs such as Proxomitron and Privoxy which check all web pages being read and identify and remove common nuisances contained As a rule they fall under computer security rather than secure communications br br br Tools used to obtain security br br br Encryption br br Encryption is a method in which data is rendered hard to read by an unauthorized party Since encryption methods are created to be extremely hard to break many communication methods either use deliberately weaker encryption than possible or have backdoors inserted to permit rapid decryption In some cases government authorities have required backdoors be installed in secret Many methods of encryption are also subject to man in the middle attack whereby a third party who can see the establishment of the secure communication is made privy to the encryption method this would apply for example to the interception of computer use at an ISP Provided it is correctly programmed sufficiently powerful and the keys not intercepted encryption would usually be considered secure The article on key size examines the key requirements for certain degrees of encryption security br Encryption can be implemented in a way that requires the use of encryption i e if encrypted communication is impossible then no traffic is sent or opportunistically Opportunistic encryption is a lower security method to generally increase the percentage of generic traffic which is encrypted This is analogous to beginning every conversation with Do you speak Navajo If the response is affirmative then the conversation proceeds in Navajo otherwise it uses the common language of the two speakers This method does not generally provide authentication or anonymity but it does protect the content of the conversation from eavesdropping br An Information theoretic security technique known as physical layer encryption ensures that a wireless communication link is provably secure with communications and coding techniques br br br Steganography br br Steganography hidden writing is the means by which data can be hidden within other more innocuous data Thus a watermark proving ownership embedded in the data of a picture in such a way it is hard to find or remove unless you know how to find it Or for communication the hiding of important data such as a telephone number in apparently innocuous data an MP music file An advantage of steganography is plausible deniability that is unless one can prove the data is there which is usually not easy it is deniable that the file contains any br br br Identity based networks br Unwanted or malicious activities are possible on the web since the internet is effectively anonymous True identity based networks replace the ability to remain anonymous and are inherently more trustworthy since the identity of the sender and recipient are known The telephone system is an example of an identity based network br br br Anonymized networks br Recently anonymous networking has been used to secure communications In principle a large number of users running the same system can have communications routed between them in such a way that it is very difficult to detect what the complete message is which user sent it and where it is ultimately coming from or going to Examples are Crowds Tor I P Mixminion various anonymous P P networks and others br br br Anonymous communication devices br Typically an unknown device would not be noticed since so many other devices are in use This is not assured in reality due to the presence of systems such as Carnivore and unzak which can monitor communications over entire networks and the fact that the far end may be monitored as before Examples include payphones Internet cafe etc br br br Methods used to break security br br br Bugging br br The placing covertly of monitoring and or transmission devices either within the communication device or in the premises concerned br br br Computers general br br Any security obtained from a computer is limited by the many ways it can be compromised by hacking keystroke logging backdoors or even in extreme cases by monitoring the tiny electrical signals given off by keyboard or monitors to reconstruct what is typed or seen TEMPEST which is complex br br br Laser audio surveillance br br Sounds including speech inside rooms can be sensed by bouncing a laser beam off a window of the room where a conversation is held and detecting and decoding the vibrations in the glass caused by the sound waves br br br Systems offering partial security br br br Cellphones br Cellphones can easily be obtained but are also easily traced and tapped There is no or only limited encryption the phones are traceable often even when switched off since the phone and SIM card broadcast their International Mobile Subscriber Identity IMSI It is possible for a cellphone company to turn on some cellphones when the user is unaware and use the microphone to listen in on you and according to James Atkinson a counter surveillance specialist cited in the same source Security conscious corporate executives routinely remove the batteries from their cell phones since many phones software can be used as is or modified to enable transmission without user awareness and the user can be located within a small distance using signal triangulation and now using built in GPS features for newer models Transceivers may also be defeated by jamming or Faraday cage br Some cellphones Apple s iPhone Google s Android track and store users position information so that movements for months or years can be determined by examining the phone br The U S Government also has access to cellphone surveillance technologies mostly applied for law enforcement br br br Landlines br Analogue landlines are not encrypted it lends itself to being easily tapped Such tapping requires physical access to the line which can be easily obtained from a number of places e g the phone location distribution points cabinets and the exchange itself Tapping a landline in this way can enable an attacker to make calls which appear to originate from the tapped line br br br Anonymous Internet br br Using a third party system of any kind payphone Internet cafe is often secure however if that system is used to access known locations a known email account or rd party then it may be tapped at the far end or noted and this will remove any security benefit obtained Some countries also impose mandatory registration of Internet cafe users br Anonymous proxies are another common type of protection which allow one to access the net via a third party often in a different country and make tracing difficult Note that there is seldom any guarantee that the plaintext is not tappable nor that the proxy does not keep its own records of users or entire dialogs As a result anonymous proxies are a generally useful tool but may not be as secure as other systems whose security can be better assured Their most common use is to prevent a record of the originating IP or address being left on the target site s own records Typical anonymous proxies are found at both regular websites such as Anonymizer com and spynot com and on proxy sites which maintain up to date lists of large numbers of temporary proxies in operation br A recent development on this theme arises when wireless Internet connections Wi Fi are left in their unsecured state The effect of this is that any person in range of the base unit can piggyback the connection that is use it without the owner being aware Since many connections are left open in this manner situations where piggybacking might arise willful or unaware have successfully led to a defense in some cases since it makes it difficult to prove the owner of the connection was the downloader or had knowledge of the use to which unknown others might be putting their connection An example of this was the Tammie Marson case where neighbours and anyone else might have been the culprit in the sharing of copyright files Conversely in other cases people deliberately seek out businesses and households with unsecured connections for illicit and anonymous Internet usage or simply to obtain free bandwidth br br br Programs offering more security br br Secure instant messaging Some instant messaging clients use end to end encryption with forward secrecy to secure all instant messages to other users of the same software Some instant messaging clients also offer end to end encrypted file transfer support and group messaging br VoIP Some VoIP clients implement ZRTP and SRTP encryption for calls br Secure email some email networks are designed to provide encrypted and or anonymous communication They authenticate and encrypt on the users own computer to prevent transmission of plain text and mask the sender and recipient Mixminion and I P Bote provide a higher level of anonymity by using a network of anonymizing intermediaries similar to how Tor works but at a higher latency br IRC and web chat Some IRC clients and systems use client to server encryption such as SSL TLS This is not standardized br br br Criminal use br Several secure communications networks which were predominantly used by criminals have been shut down by law enforcement agencies including EncroChat Sky Global Sky ECC and Phantom Secure br br br See also br br br General background br Computer security br Opportunistic encryption
