Amimour age As the band was playing their song Kiss the Devil the three men got out of the car and opened fire on people outside the venue killing three Then they burst into the concert hall and opened fire on the crowd Witnesses heard shouts of Allahu Akbar as the terrorists opened fire Initially the audience mistook the gunfire for pyrotechnics The band ran offstage and escaped with many of the crew br Rows of people were mowed down by gunfire or were forced to drop to the ground to avoid being shot Survivors described hundreds of people lying beside and on top of each other in pools of blood screaming in terror and pain The gunmen also fired up into the balconies and dead bodies fell down onto the stalls below For a few minutes the hall was plunged into darkness with only the flashes from the assault rifles as the gunmen kept shooting The terrorists shouted that they were there because of the French airstrikes against Islamic State Another witness who was inside the Bataclan heard a gunman say This is because of all the harm done by Hollande to Muslims all over the world br A radio reporter attending the concert described the terrorists as calm and determined and said they reloaded three or four times Two gunmen attacked the concert hall one gunman covered fire while another reloaded to ensure maximum efficiency Whenever the gunmen stopped to reload some of the crowd ran for the emergency exits scrambling over each other to escape Some were shot from behind as they fled and the terrorists laughed as they shot them Those who reached the emergency exit were shot by the third gunman who positioned himself there Other groups of people barricaded themselves in backstage rooms Some smashed open the ceiling in an upstairs toilet and hid among the rafters under the roof Those who could not run lay still on the floor pretending to be dead According to survivors the terrorists walked among those who were lying down kicked them and shot them in the head if there was any sign of life br An eyewitness reported hearing the gunmen ask amongst themselves where the members of the Eagles of Death Metal were once the gunfire stopped Mohamed Aggad and Mostefa

about twenty hostages and herded them into a room at the end of an L shaped corridor located further in the building They also seized the hostages mobile phones and attempted to use them to access the Internet but they were unable to find a signal Some of the hostages were forced to look down into the hall and out the windows and tell the terrorists what they saw During this time Mohamed Aggad and

killed and hundreds of others were wounded Almost all of the deceased victims were killed within the first minutes of the attack All of the hostages were rescued without injury Police dog teams from the Brigade Cynophile assisted with body removal because of concerns that there could still be live explosives in the theatre Identification and removal of the bodies took hours a process made

disposed of his explosive vest br On November ISIL claimed responsibility for the attacks Fran ois Hollande said ISIL organised the attacks with help from inside France Claimed motives were an ideological objection to Paris as a capital of abomination and perversion retaliation for airstrikes on ISIL in Syria and Iraq and the foreign policy of Hollande in relation to Muslims worldwide Shortly after the attacks ISIL s media organ the Al Hayat Media Group launched a website on the dark web extolling the organisation and recommending the encrypted instant messaging service Telegram br

belonging to ISIL and of French nationality br Syrian and Egyptian passports were found near the bodies of two of the perpetrators at two attack sites but Egyptian authorities said the passport belonged to a victim Aleed Abdel Razzak and not one of the perpetrators By November the focus of the French and Belgian investigation turned to Abdelhamid Abaaoud the radical jihadist they believed was the leader of the plot Abaaoud had escaped to Syria after having been suspected in other plots in Belgium and France including the thwarted Thalys train attack Abaaoud had recruited an extensive network of accomplices including two brothers Brahim Abdeslam and Salah Abdeslam to execute terrorist attacks Abaaoud was killed in the Saint Denis raid on November br Most of the Paris attackers were French and Belgian born citizens of Moroccan and Algerian backgrounds who crossed borders without difficulty albeit registered as terrorism suspects Two other attackers were Iraqi According to the French prime minister Manuel Valls several of the perpetrators had exploited Europe s immigration crisis to enter the continent undetected At least some including the alleged leader Abdelhamid Abaaoud had visited Syria and returned radicalised Jean Charles Brisard a French expert on terrorism called this a change of paradigm in that returning European citizens were themselves the attackers The Los Angeles Times reported that more than Europeans have travelled to Syria and joined ISIL and other radical groups br On August jihadist Abu Mohammad al Adnani was killed by an American missile and DGSI declared that his death ended the terrorist who had supervised the attacks on Brussels and Paris br br br Search for accomplices br Three cars were recovered in Paris after the attacks br br A grey

Leiter former director of the United States National Counterterrorism Center said the attacks demonstrated a sophistication not seen in a city attack since the Mumbai attacks and that it would change how the West regarded the threat Further comparisons were made between the Paris and Mumbai attacks Mumbai Police Joint Commissioner Law and Order Deven Bharti pointed out the similarities as having several targets shooting indiscriminately and the use of improvised explosive devices According to Bharti one key difference was that the Mumbai attacks lasted several days and the Paris attackers killed themselves as soon as capture seemed imminent Evidence points to the attackers having regularly used unencrypted communications during the planning of the attack br br br Casualties br br The attackers killed victims and injured with to taken to hospital in serious condition Of the dead died at the Bataclan theatre at La Belle quipe at Le Carillon and Le Petit Cambodge five at Caf Bonne Bi

in attendance br Muslim organisations in France such as the Union of Islamic Organisations of France strongly condemned the attacks in Paris The attacks affected business at high profile venues and

Mediterranean to support bombing operations carried out by the international coalition This decision was taken before the November attacks but was accelerated by the events br French authorities regularly gave detailed information to US authorities on the whereabouts of high ranking IS members in the Syria Iraq zone to be tracked and killed This cooperation led to American air strikes being able to kill the planners of the November attacks United States authorities cooperated as they consider that if terrorist attacks hadn t taken place in France they would have done so in the US instead

right Front National party who was vying to be president of the Nord Pas de Calais area was recommending hardline security measures She was getting a great deal of media attention with her strong anti immigrant stance and may have been helping to sway public opinion across France The influx of migrants must be stopped Le Pen told the CBC in an interview Le Pen was doing well in opinion polls as of early December Since the elections would start only weeks after the Paris attacks she was thought to be getting dividends from the timing when the fear of terrorism was still very strong br br br

Paris attacks br Some of the attackers were known to law enforcement officials prior to the attacks and at least some of the attackers lived in the Molenbeek area of Brussels which is noted for its links to extremist activities A counter terrorism expert said the fact that the perpetrators were known to authorities suggested that intelligence was pretty good but the ability to act on it was lacking The number of Europeans who have links to Syria makes it difficult for security services to keep track of them all br On December Belgian newspaper De Morgen reported that a police oversight body known as Committee P is investigating why prior warnings from a school about the radicalisation of one of the attackers Bilal Hadfi were not reported to Belgian law enforcement br On March
