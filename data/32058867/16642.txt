with the Achaemenid Persian Empire expanding towards the southern region Turkic nomads entered the region from as early as the sixth century In the th century the area was subjugated by the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan Following the disintegration of the Golden Horde in the th century the Kazakh Khanate was established over an area roughly corresponding with modern Kazakhstan By the th century the Kazakh Khanate had fragmented into three j z tribal divisions which were gradually absorbed and conquered by the Russian Empire by the mid th century all of Kazakhstan was nominally under

Cooperation Organization of Turkic States and International Organization of Turkic Culture br br br Etymology br The English word Kazakh meaning a member of the Kazakh people derives from Russian The native name is Kazakh romanized qazaq It might originate from the Turkic word verb qaz to wander reflecting the Kazakhs nomadic culture The term Cossack is of the same origin br In Turko Persian sources the term zbek Qazaq first appeared during the mid th century in the Tarikh i Rashidi by Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat a Chagatayid prince of Kashmir which locates Kazakh in the eastern part of Desht i Qipchaq According to Vasily Bartold the Kazakhs likely began using that name during the th century br Though Kazakh traditionally referred only to ethnic Kazakhs including those living in China Russia Turkey Uzbekistan and other neighbouring countries the term is increasingly being used to refer to any inhabitant of Kazakhstan including residents of other ethnicities br br br History br br Kazakhstan has been inhabited since the Paleolithic era The Botai culture BC is credited with the first domestication of horses The Botai population derived most of their ancestry from a deeply European related population known as Ancient North Eurasians while also displaying some Ancient East Asian admixture Pastoralism developed during the Neolithic The population was Caucasoid during the Bronze and Iron Age period br The Kazakh territory was a key constituent of the Eurasian trading Steppe Route the ancestor of the terrestrial Silk Roads Archaeologists believe that humans first domesticated the horse in the region s vast steppes During recent prehistoric times Central Asia was inhabited by groups such as the possibly Indo European Afanasievo culture later early Indo Iranian cultures such as Andronovo and later Indo Iranians such as the Saka and Massagetae Other groups included the nomadic Scythians and the Persian Achaemenid Empire in the southern territory of the modern country The Andronovo and Srubnaya cultures precursors to the peoples of the Scythian cultures were found to harbor mixed ancestry from the Yamnaya Steppe herders and peoples of the Central European Middle Neolithic br In BC Alexander the Great and his Macedonian army fought in the Battle of Jaxartes against the Scythians along the Jaxartes River now known as the Syr Darya along the southern border of modern Kazakhstan br br br Cuman Kipchak and the Golden Horde br br The main migration of Turkic peoples occurred between the th and th centuries when they spread across most of Central Asia The Turkic peoples slowly replaced and assimilated the previous Iranian speaking locals turning the population of Central Asia from largely Iranian into primarily of East Asian descent br The first Turkic Khaganate was founded by Bumin in on the Mongolian Plateau and quickly spread west toward the Caspian Sea The G kt rks drove before them various peoples Xionites Uar Oghurs and others These seem to have merged into the Avars and Bulgars Within years the eastern half and the Western Turkic Khaganate were independent The Western Khaganate reached its peak in the early th century br The Cumans entered the steppes of modern day Kazakhstan around the early th century where they later joined with the Kipchak and established the vast Cuman Kipchak confederation While ancient cities Taraz Aulie Ata and Hazrat e Turkestan had long served as important way stations along the Silk Road connecting Asia and Europe true political consolidation began only with the Mongol rule of the early th century Under the Mongol Empire the first strictly structured administrative districts Ulus were established After the division of the Mongol Empire in the land that would become modern day Kazakhstan was ruled by the Golden Horde also known as the Ulus of Jochi During the Golden Horde period a Turco Mongol tradition emerged among the ruling elite wherein Turkicised descendants of Genghis Khan followed Islam and continued to reign over the lands br br br Kazakh Khanate br br In the Kazakh Khanate emerged as a result of the dissolution of the Golden Horde Established by Janibek Khan and Kerei Khan it continued to be ruled by the Turco Mongol clan of Tore Jochid dynasty Throughout this period traditional nomadic life and a livestock based economy continued to dominate the steppe In the th century a distinct Kazakh identity began to emerge among the Turkic tribes This was followed by the Kazakh War of Independence where the Khanate gained its sovereignty from the Shaybanids The process was consolidated by the mid th century with the appearance of the Kazakh language culture and economy br br Nevertheless the region was the focus of ever increasing disputes between the native Kazakh emirs and the neighbouring Persian speaking peoples to the south At its height the Khanate would rule parts of Central Asia and control Cumania The Kazakh Khanate s territories would expand deep into Central Asia By the early th century the Kazakh Khanate was struggling with the impact of tribal rivalries which had effectively divided the population into the Great Middle and Little or Small hordes j z Political disunion tribal rivalries and the diminishing importance of overland trade routes between east and west weakened the Kazakh Khanate The Khiva Khanate used this opportunity and annexed the Mangyshlak Peninsula Uzbek rule there lasted two centuries until the Russian arrival br During the th century the Kazakhs fought the Oirats a federation of western Mongol tribes including the Dzungar The beginning of the th century marked the zenith of the Kazakh Khanate During this period the Little Horde participated in the war against the Dzungar Khanate following their Great Disaster invasion of Kazakh territory Under the leadership of Abul Khair Khan the Kazakhs won major victories over the Dzungar at the Bulanty River in and at the Battle of A yraqai in br Ablai Khan participated in the most significant battles against the Dzungar from the s to the s for which he was declared a batyr hero by the people The Kazakhs suffered from the frequent raids against them by the Volga Kalmyks The Kokand Khanate used the weakness of Kazakh j zs after Dzungar and Kalmyk raids and conquered present Southeastern Kazakhstan including Almaty the formal capital in the first quarter of the th century The Emirate of Bukhara ruled ymkent before the Russians gained dominance br br br Russian Kazakhstan br br In the first half of the th century the Russian Empire constructed the Irtysh line a series of forty six forts and ninety six redoubts including Omsk Semipalatinsk Pavlodar Orenburg and Petropavlovsk to prevent Kazakh and Oirat raids into Russian territory In the late th century the Kazakhs took advantage of Pugachev s Rebellion which was centred on the Volga area to raid Russian and Volga German settlements In the th century the Russian Empire began to expand its influence into Central Asia The Great Game period is generally regarded as running from approximately to the Anglo Russian Convention of The tsars effectively ruled over most of the territory belonging to what is now the Republic of Kazakhstan br The Russian Empire introduced a system of administration and built military garrisons and barracks in its effort to establish a presence in Central Asia in the so called Great Game for dominance in the area against the British Empire which was extending its influence from the south in India and Southeast Asia Russia built its first outpost Orsk in Russia introduced the Russian language in all schools and governmental organisations br Russia s efforts to impose its system aroused the resentment of the Kazakhs and by the s some Kazakhs resisted its rule Russia had disrupted the traditional nomadic lifestyle and livestock based economy and people were suffering from starvation with some Kazakh tribes being decimated The Kazakh national movement which began in the late th century sought to preserve the native language and identity by resisting the attempts of the Russian Empire to assimilate and stifle Kazakh culture br From the s onward ever larger numbers of settlers from the Russian Empire began colonizing the territory of present day Kazakhstan in particular the province of Semirechye The number of settlers rose still further once the Trans Aral Railway from Orenburg to Tashkent was completed in A specially created Migration Department in St Petersburg oversaw and encouraged the migration to expand Russian influence in the area During the th century about Russians immigrated to Kazakhstan and about one million Slavs Germans Jews and others immigrated to the region during the first third of the th century Vasile Balabanov was the administrator responsible for the resettlement during much of this time br The competition for land and water that ensued between the Kazakhs and the newcomers caused great resentment against colonial rule during the final years of the Russian Empire The most serious uprising the Central Asian revolt occurred in The Kazakhs attacked Russian and Cossack settlers and military garrisons The revolt resulted in a series of clashes and in brutal massacres committed by both sides Both sides resisted the communist government until late br br br Kazakh SSR br br Following the collapse of central government in Petrograd in November the Kazakhs then in Russia officially referred to as Kirghiz experienced a brief period of autonomy the Alash Autonomy before eventually succumbing to the Bolsheviks rule On August the Kirghiz Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic RSFSR was established The Kirghiz ASSR included the territory of present day Kazakhstan but its administrative centre was the mainly Russian populated town of Orenburg In June the Kirghiz ASSR was renamed the Kazak ASSR and its administrative centre was transferred to the town of Kyzylorda and in April to Alma Ata br Soviet repression of the traditional elite along with forced collectivisation in the late s and s brought famine and high fatalities leading to unrest see also Famine in Kazakhstan of During the s some members of the Kazakh intelligentsia were executed as part of the policies of political reprisals pursued by the Soviet government in Moscow br On December the Kazakh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic whose territory by then corresponded to that of modern Kazakhstan was detached from the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic RSFSR and made the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic a full union republic of the USSR one of eleven such republics at the time along with the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic br The republic was one of the destinations for exiled and convicted persons as well as for mass resettlements or deportations affected by the central USSR authorities during the s and s such as approximately Volga Germans deported from the Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in September October and then later the Greeks and Crimean Tatars Deportees and prisoners were interned in some of the biggest Soviet labour camps the Gulag including ALZhIR camp outside Astana which was reserved for the wives of men considered enemies of the people Many moved due to the policy of population transfer in the Soviet Union and others were forced into involuntary settlements in the Soviet Union br br The Soviet German War led to an increase in industrialisation and mineral extraction in support of the war effort At the time of Joseph Stalin s death in however Kazakhstan still had an overwhelmingly agricultural economy In Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev initiated the Virgin Lands Campaign designed to turn the traditional pasturelands of Kazakhstan into a major grain producing region for the Soviet Union The Virgin Lands policy brought mixed results However along with later modernisations under Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev in power it accelerated the development of the agricultural sector which remains the source of livelihood for a large percentage of Kazakhstan s population Because of the decades of privation war and resettlement by the Kazakhs had become a minority making up percent of the population Ethnic Russians accounted for percent br In the USSR as part of its atomic bomb project founded an atomic bomb test site near the north eastern town of Semipalatinsk where the first Soviet nuclear bomb test was conducted in Hundreds of nuclear tests were conducted until with adverse consequences for the nation s environment and population The Anti nuclear movement in Kazakhstan became a major political force in the late s br In April Baikonur became the springboard of Vostok a spacecraft with Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin being the first human to enter space br In December mass demonstrations by young ethnic Kazakhs later called the Jeltoqsan riot took place in Almaty to protest the replacement of the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Kazakh SSR Dinmukhamed Konayev with Gennady Kolbin from the Russian SFSR Governmental troops suppressed the unrest several people were killed and many demonstrators were jailed In the waning days of Soviet rule discontent continued to grow and found expression under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev s policy of glasnost openness br br br Independence br On October Kazakhstan declared its sovereignty on its territory as a republic within the Soviet Union Following the August aborted coup attempt in Moscow Kazakhstan declared independence on December thus becoming the last Soviet republic to declare independence Ten days later the Soviet Union itself ceased to exist br Kazakhstan s communist era leader Nursultan Nazarbayev became the country s first President Nazarbayev ruled in an authoritarian manner An emphasis was placed on converting the country s economy to a market economy while political reforms lagged behind economic advances By Kazakhstan was generating percent of the GDP of Central Asia primarily through its oil industry br In the government moved the capital to Astana renamed Nur Sultan on March from Almaty Kazakhstan s largest city where it had been established under the Soviet Union br Elections to the Majilis in September yielded a lower house dominated by the pro government Otan Party headed by President Nazarbayev Two other parties considered sympathetic to the president including the agrarian industrial bloc AIST and the Asar Party founded by President Nazarbayev s daughter won most of the remaining seats The opposition parties which were officially registered and competed in the elections won a single seat

people of Central Asia Kazakh literature expands from the current territory of Kazakhstan also including the era of Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic Kazakh recognised territory under the Russian Empire and the Kazakh Khanate There is some overlap with several complementary themes including the literature of Turkic tribes that inhabited Kazakhstan over the course of its history and literature written by ethnic Kazakhs br br According to Chinese written sources from the th th centuries CE the Turkic tribes of Kazakhstan had an oral poetry tradition These came from earlier periods and were primarily transmitted by bards professional storytellers and musical performers Traces of this tradition are shown on Orkhon script stone carvings dated th th centuries CE that describe rule of Kultegin and Bilge two early Turkic rulers kagans Amongst the Kazakhs the bard was a primarily though not exclusively male profession Since at least the th century Kazakh bards could be divided into two main categories the zh raws zhiraus yraus who passed on the works of others usually not creating and adding their own original work and the aqyns akyns who improvised or created their own poems stories or songs There were several types of works such as didactic termes elegiac tolgaws and epic zh rs Although the origins of such tales are often unknown most of them were associated with bards of the recent or more distant past who supposedly created them or passed them on by the time most Kazakh poetry and prose was first written down in the second half of the th century There are clear stylistic differences between works first created in the th century and works dating from earlier periods but not documented before the th century such as those attributed to such th and th century bards as Er Shoban and Dosmombet Zh raw also known as Dospambet yrau he appeared to have been literate and reportedly visited Constantinople and even to such th century bards as Shalkiz and Asan Qaygh br Other notable bards include Kaztugan yrau iembet yrau Axtamberdy yrau and Buxar yrau Kalkamanuly who was an advisor to Ablai Khan and whose works have been preserved by M h r sip K peev Er Targh n

E br The preeminent role in the development of modern literary Kazakh belongs to Abai Qunanbaiuly Kazakh sometimes Russified to Abay Kunanbayev whose writings did much to preserve Kazakh folk culture Abai s major work is The Book of Words Kazakh Qara s zderi a philosophical treatise and collection of poems where he criticises Russian colonial policies and encourages other Kazakhs to embrace

executed by academically trained performers who aim at preserving the traditional music for coming generations As far as can be reconstructed the music of Kazakhstan from the period before a strong Russian influence consists of instrumental music and vocal music Instrumental music with the pieces K y being performed by soloists Text is often seen in the background or program for the music as a lot of K y titles refer to stories Vocal music either as part of a ceremony such as a wedding mainly performed by women or as part of a feast Here we might divide into subgenres epic singing containing not only historical facts but as well the tribe s genealogy love songs and didactic verses and as a special form the composition of two or more singers in public Aitys of dialogue character and usually unexpectedly frankly in content br br The Russian influence on the music life in Kazakhstan can be seen in two spheres first the introduction of musical academic institutions such as concert houses with opera stages and conservatories where European music was performed and taught and second by trying to incorporate Kazakh traditional music into these academic structures Controlled first by the Russian Empire and then the Soviet Union Kazakhstan s folk and classical traditions became connected with ethnic Russian music and Western European music Prior to the th century Kazakh folk music was collected and studied by ethnographic research teams including composers music critics and musicologists In the first part of the th century Kazakh music was transcribed in linear notation Some composers of this era set Kazakh folk songs to Russian style European classical music br The Kazakhs themselves however did not write their own music in notation until Later as part of the Soviet Union Kazakh folk culture was encouraged in a sanitised manner designed to avoid political and social unrest The result was a bland derivative of real Kazakh folk music In Aleksandr Zatayevich a Russian official created major works of art music with melodies and other elements of Kazakh folk music Beginning in and accelerating in the s he also adapted traditional Kazakh instruments for use in Russian style ensembles such as by increasing the number of frets and strings Soon these styles of modern orchestral playing became the only way for musicians to officially play
