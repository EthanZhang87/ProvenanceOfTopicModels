Internet Explorer formerly Microsoft Internet Explorer and Windows Internet Explorer commonly abbreviated as IE or MSIE is a retired series of graphical web browsers developed by Microsoft that were used in the Windows line of operating systems While IE has been discontinued on most Windows editions it remains supported on certain editions of Windows such as Windows LTSB LTSC Starting in it was first released as part of the add on package Plus for Windows that year Later versions were available as free downloads or in service packs and included in the original equipment manufacturer OEM service releases of Windows and later versions of Windows Microsoft spent over US million per year on Internet Explorer in the late s with over people involved in the project by New feature development for the browser was discontinued in and ended support on June for Windows Semi Annual Channel SAC in favor of its successor Microsoft Edge br Internet Explorer was once the most widely used web browser attaining a peak of usage share by It has since fallen out of general use after retirement This came after Microsoft used bundling to win the first browser war against Netscape which was the dominant browser in the s Its usage share has since declined with the launches of Firefox and Google Chrome and with the growing popularity of mobile operating systems such as Android and iOS that do not support Internet Explorer Microsoft Edge IE s successor first overtook Internet Explorer in terms of market share in November Versions of Internet Explorer for other operating systems have also been produced including an Xbox version called Internet Explorer for Xbox and for platforms Microsoft no longer supports Internet Explorer for Mac and Internet Explorer for UNIX Solaris and HP UX and an embedded OEM version called Pocket Internet Explorer later rebranded Internet Explorer Mobile made for Windows CE Windows Phone and previously based on Internet Explorer for Windows Phone br The browser has been scrutinized throughout its development for its use of third party technology such as the source code of Spyglass Mosaic used without royalty in early versions and security and privacy vulnerabilities and the United States and the European Union have determined that the integration of Internet Explorer with Windows has been to the detriment of fair browser competition br Internet Explorer was supported on Windows Embedded Compact until October The core of Internet Explorer will continue being shipped and supported until at least as IE Mode a feature of Microsoft Edge enabling Edge to display web pages using Internet Explorer s Trident layout engine and other components Through IE Mode the underlying technology of Internet Explorer partially exists on versions of Windows that do not support IE as a proper application including newer versions of Windows as well as Windows Windows Server Insider Build and Windows Server Insider Build br br br History br br br Internet Explorer br br The Internet Explorer project was started in the summer of by Thomas Reardon who according to former project lead Ben Slivka used source code from Spyglass Inc Mosaic which was an early commercial web browser with formal ties to the pioneering National Center for Supercomputing Applications NCSA Mosaic browser In late Microsoft licensed Spyglass Mosaic for a quarterly fee plus a percentage of Microsoft s non Windows revenues for the software Although bearing a name like NCSA Mosaic Spyglass Mosaic had used the NCSA Mosaic source code sparingly br The first version dubbed Microsoft Internet Explorer was installed as part of the Internet Jumpstart Kit in the Microsoft Plus pack for Windows The Internet Explorer team began with about six people in early development Internet Explorer was released several months later for Windows NT and added support for basic table rendering By including it free of charge with their operating system they did not have to pay royalties to Spyglass Inc resulting in a lawsuit and a US million settlement on January br Microsoft was sued by SyNet Inc in for trademark infringement claiming it owned the rights to the name Internet Explorer It ended with Microsoft paying million to settle the lawsuit br br br Internet Explorer br br Internet Explorer is the second major version of Internet Explorer released on November for Windows and Windows NT and on April for Apple Macintosh and Windows br br br Internet Explorer br br Internet Explorer is the third major version of Internet Explorer released on August for Microsoft Windows and on January for Apple Mac OS br br br Internet Explorer br br Internet Explorer is the fourth major version of Internet Explorer released in September for Microsoft Windows Mac OS Solaris and HP UX It was the first version of Internet Explorer to use the Trident web engine br br br Internet Explorer br br Internet Explorer is the fifth major version of Internet Explorer released on March for Windows Windows NT Windows Windows NT SP Windows Mac OS X up to v Classic Mac OS up to v Solaris and HP UX up to SP br br br Internet Explorer br br Internet Explorer is the sixth major version of Internet Explorer released on August for Windows NT SP a Windows Windows Windows ME and as the default web browser for Windows XP and Windows Server br br br Internet Explorer br br Internet Explorer is the seventh major version of Internet Explorer released on October for Windows XP SP Windows Server SP and as the default web browser for Windows Vista Windows Server and Windows Embedded POSReady IE introduces tabbed browsing br br br Internet Explorer br br Internet Explorer is the eighth major version of Internet Explorer released on March for Windows XP Windows Server Windows Vista Windows Server and as the default web browser for Windows later default was Internet Explorer and Windows Server R br br br Internet Explorer br br Internet Explorer is the ninth major version of Internet Explorer released on March for Windows Windows Server R Windows Vista Service Pack and Windows Server SP with the Platform Update br br br Internet Explorer br br Internet Explorer is the tenth major version of Internet Explorer released on October and is the default web browser for Windows and Windows Server It became available for Windows SP and Windows Server R SP in February br br br Internet Explorer br br Internet Explorer is featured in Windows Windows Server R and Windows RT which was released on October It includes an incomplete mechanism for syncing tabs It is a major update to its developer tools enhanced scaling for high DPI screens HTML prerender and prefetch hardware accelerated JPEG decoding closed captioning HTML full screen and is the first Internet Explorer to support WebGL and Google s protocol SPDY starting at v This version of IE has features dedicated to Windows including cryptography WebCrypto adaptive bitrate streaming Media Source Extensions and Encrypted Media Extensions br Internet Explorer was made available for Windows users to download on November with Automatic Updates in the following weeks br Internet Explorer s user agent string now identifies the agent as Trident the underlying browser engine instead of MSIE It also announces compatibility with Gecko the browser engine of Firefox br Microsoft claimed that Internet Explorer running the WebKit SunSpider JavaScript Benchmark was the fastest browser as of October br Internet Explorer was made available for Windows Server and Windows Embedded Standard the only still supported edition of Windows in April br br br End of life br Microsoft Edge was officially unveiled on January as Project Spartan On April Microsoft announced that Microsoft Edge would replace Internet Explorer as the default browser in Windows However Internet Explorer remained the default web browser on the Windows Long Term Servicing Channel LTSC and on Windows Server until primarily for enterprise purposes br Internet Explorer is still installed in Windows to maintain compatibility with older websites and intranet sites that require ActiveX and other legacy web technologies The browser s MSHTML rendering engine also remains for compatibility reasons br Additionally Microsoft Edge shipped with the Internet Explorer mode feature which enables support for legacy internet applications This is possible through use of the Trident MSHTML engine the rendering code of Internet Explorer Microsoft has committed to supporting Internet Explorer mode at least through with a one year notice before it is discontinued br With the release of Microsoft Edge the development of new features for Internet Explorer ceased Internet Explorer was the final release and Microsoft began the process of deprecating Internet Explorer During this process it will still be maintained as part of Microsoft s support policies br Since January only the latest version of Internet Explorer available for each version of Windows has been supported At the time nearly half of Internet Explorer users were using an unsupported version br In February Microsoft Chief of Security Chris Jackson recommended that users stop using Internet Explorer as their default browser br Various websites have dropped support for Internet Explorer On June the Internet Archive removed Internet Explorer from its list of supported browsers due to the browser s dated nature Since November the web version of Microsoft Teams can no longer be accessed using Internet Explorer followed by the remaining Microsoft applications since August WordPress also dropped support for the browser in July br Microsoft disabled the normal means of launching Internet Explorer in Windows and later versions of Windows but it is still possible for users to launch the browser from the Control Panel s browser toolbar settings or via PowerShell br On June Internet Explorer support ended for the Windows Semi Annual Channel SAC Users on these versions of Windows were redirected to Microsoft Edge starting on February and visual references to the browser such as icons on the taskbar would have been removed on June However on May various organizations disapproved leading Microsoft to withdraw the change br Other versions of Windows that were still supported at the time were unaffected Specifically Windows ESU Windows x Windows RT Windows Server R ESU Windows Server R and later and Windows LTSB LTSC continued to receive updates until their respective end of life dates br On other versions of Windows Internet Explorer will still be supported until their own end of support dates IE was supported until October alongside the end of support for Windows Embedded Compact while IE was supported until January alongside the end of ESU support for Azure customers on Windows Server Barring additional changes to the support policy Internet Explorer will be supported until January concurrent with the end of support for Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC br br br Features br br Internet Explorer has been designed to view a broad range of web pages and provide certain features within the operating system including Microsoft Update During the height of the browser wars Internet Explorer superseded Netscape only when it caught up technologically to support the progressive features of the time br br br Standards support br Internet Explorer using the MSHTML Trident browser engine br br Supports HTML parts of HTML CSS Level Level and Level XML and DOM Level with minor implementation gaps br Fully supports XSLT as well as an obsolete Microsoft dialect of XSLT often referred to as WD xsl which was loosely based on the December W C Working Draft of XSL Support for XSLT lies in the future semi official Microsoft bloggers have indicated that development is underway but no dates have been announced br Almost full conformance to CSS has been added in the Internet Explorer release The MSHTML browser engine in Internet Explorer in scored highest in the official W C conformance test suite for CSS of all major browsers br Supports XHTML in Internet Explorer MSHTML Trident version Prior versions can render XHTML documents authored with HTML compatibility principles and served with a text html MIME type br Supports a subset of SVG in Internet Explorer MSHTML Trident version excluding SMIL SVG fonts and filters br Internet Explorer uses DOCTYPE sniffing to choose between standards mode and a quirks mode in which it deliberately mimics nonstandard behaviors of old versions of MSIE for HTML and CSS rendering on screen Internet Explorer always uses standards mode for printing It also provides its own dialect of ECMAScript called JScript br Internet Explorer was criticized by Tim Berners Lee for its limited support for SVG which is promoted by W C br br br Non standard extensions br Internet Explorer has introduced an array of proprietary extensions to many of the standards including HTML CSS and the DOM This has resulted in several web pages that appear broken in standards compliant web browsers and has introduced the need for a quirks mode to allow for rendering improper elements meant for Internet Explorer in these other browsers br Internet Explorer has introduced several extensions to the DOM that have been adopted by other browsers br These include the inner HTML property which provides access to the HTML string within an element which was part of IE and was standardized as part of HTML roughly years later after all other browsers implemented it for compatibility the XMLHttpRequest object which allows the sending of HTTP request and receiving of HTTP response and may be used to perform AJAX and the designMode attribute of the content Document object which enables rich text editing of HTML documents Some of these functionalities were not possible until the introduction of the W C DOM methods Its Ruby character extension to HTML is also accepted as a module in W C XHTML though it is not found in all versions of W C HTML br Microsoft submitted several other features of IE for consideration by the W C for standardization These include the behavior CSS property which connects the HTML elements with JScript behaviors known as HTML Components HTC HTML TIME profile which adds timing and media synchronization support to HTML documents similar to the W C XHTML SMIL and the VML vector graphics file format However all were rejected at least in their original forms VML was subsequently combined with PGML proposed by Adobe and Sun resulting in the W C approved SVG format one of the few vector image formats being used on the web which IE did not support until version br Other non standard behaviors include support for vertical text but in a syntax different from W C CSS candidate recommendation support for a variety of image effects and page transitions which are not found in W C CSS support for obfuscated script code in particular JScript Encode as well as support for embedding EOT fonts in web pages br br br Favicon br Support for favicons was first added in Internet Explorer Internet Explorer supports favicons in PNG static GIF and native Windows icon formats In Windows Vista and later Internet Explorer can display native Windows icons that have embedded PNG files br br br Usability and accessibility br Internet Explorer makes use of the accessibility framework provided in Windows Internet Explorer is also a user interface for FTP with operations similar to Windows Explorer Internet Explorer and had a side bar for web searches enabling jumps through pages from results listed in the side bar Pop up blocking and tabbed browsing were added respectively in Internet Explorer and Internet Explorer Tabbed browsing can also be added to older versions by installing MSN Search Toolbar or Yahoo Toolbar br br br Cache br br Internet Explorer caches visited content in the Temporary Internet Files folder to allow quicker access or offline access to previously visited pages The content is indexed in a database file known as Index dat Multiple Index dat files exist which index different content visited content web feeds visited URLs cookies etc br Prior to IE clearing the cache used to clear the index but the files themselves were not reliably removed posing a potential security and privacy risk In IE and later when the cache is cleared the cache files are more reliably removed and the index dat file is overwritten with null bytes br Caching has been improved in IE br br br Group Policy br br Internet Explorer is fully configurable using Group Policy Administrators of Windows Server domains for domain joined computers or the local computer can apply and enforce a variety of settings on computers that affect the user interface such as disabling menu items and individual configuration options as well as underlying security features such as downloading of files zone configuration per site settings ActiveX control behavior and others Policy settings can be configured for each user and for each machine Internet Explorer also supports Integrated Windows Authentication br br br Architecture br br Internet Explorer uses a componentized architecture built on the Component Object Model COM technology It consists of several major components each of which is contained in a separate dynamic link library DLL and exposes a set of COM programming interfaces hosted by the Internet Explorer main executable iexplore exe br br WinInet dll is the protocol handler for HTTP HTTPS and FTP It handles all network communication over these protocols br URLMon dll is responsible for MIME type handling and download of web content and provides a thread safe wrapper around WinInet dll and other protocol implementations br MSHTML dll houses the MSHTML Trident browser engine introduced in Internet Explorer which is responsible for displaying the pages on screen and handling the Document Object Model DOM of the web pages MSHTML dll parses the HTML CSS file and creates the internal DOM tree representation of it It also exposes a set of APIs for runtime inspection and modification of the DOM tree The DOM tree is further processed by a browser engine which then renders the internal representation on screen br IEFrame dll contains the user interface and window of IE in Internet Explorer and above br ShDocVw dll provides the navigation local caching and history functionalities for the browser br BrowseUI dll is responsible for rendering the browser user interface such as menus and toolbars br br Internet Explorer does not include any native scripting functionality Rather MSHTML dll exposes an API that permits a programmer to develop a scripting environment to be plugged in and to access the DOM tree Internet Explorer includes the bindings for the Active Scripting engine which is a part of Microsoft Windows and allows any language implemented as an Active Scripting module to be used for client side scripting By default only the JScript and VBScript modules are provided third party implementations like ScreamingMonkey for ECMAScript support can also be used Microsoft also makes available the Microsoft Silverlight runtime that allows CLI languages including DLR based dynamic languages like IronPython and IronRuby to be used for client side scripting br Internet Explorer introduced some major architectural changes called loosely coupled IE LCIE LCIE separates the main window process frame process from the processes hosting the different web applications in different tabs tab processes A frame process can create multiple tab processes each of which can be of a different integrity level each tab process can host multiple web sites The processes use asynchronous inter process communication to synchronize themselves Generally there will be a single frame process for all web sites In Windows Vista with protected mode turned on however opening privileged content such as local HTML pages will create a new tab process as it will not be constrained by protected mode br br br Extensibility br Internet Explorer exposes a set of Component Object Model COM interfaces that allows add ons to extend the functionality of the browser Extensibility is divided into two types Browser extensibility and content extensibility Browser extensibility involves adding context menu entries toolbars menu items or Browser Helper Objects BHO BHOs are used to extend the feature set of the browser whereas the other extensibility options are used to expose that feature in the user interface Content extensibility adds support for non native content formats It allows Internet Explorer to handle new file formats and new protocols e g WebM or SPDY In addition web pages can integrate widgets known as ActiveX controls which run on Windows only but have vast potentials to extend the content capabilities Adobe Flash Player and Microsoft Silverlight are examples Add ons can be installed either locally or directly by a web site br Since malicious add ons can compromise the security of a system Internet Explorer implements several safeguards Internet Explorer with Service Pack and later feature an Add on Manager for enabling or disabling individual add ons complemented by a No Add Ons mode Starting with Windows Vista Internet Explorer and its BHOs run with restricted privileges and are isolated from the rest of the system Internet Explorer introduced a new component Add on Performance Advisor Add on Performance Advisor shows a notification when one or more of installed add ons exceed a pre set performance threshold The notification appears in the Notification Bar when the user launches the browser Windows and Windows RT introduce a Metro style version of Internet Explorer that is entirely sandboxed and does not run add ons at all In addition Windows RT cannot download or install ActiveX controls at all although existing ones bundled with Windows RT still run in the traditional version of Internet Explorer br Internet Explorer itself can be hosted by other applications via a set of COM interfaces This can be used to embed the browser functionality inside a computer program or create Internet Explorer shells br br br Security br br Internet Explorer uses a zone based security framework that groups sites based on certain conditions including whether it is an Internet or intranet based site as well as a user editable whitelist Security restrictions are applied per zone all the sites in a zone are subject to the restrictions br Internet Explorer SP onwards uses the Attachment Execution Service of Microsoft Windows to mark executable files downloaded from the Internet as being potentially unsafe Accessing files marked as such will prompt the user to make an explicit trust decision to execute the file as executables originating from the Internet can be potentially unsafe This helps in preventing the accidental installation of malware br Internet Explorer introduced the phishing filter which restricts access to phishing sites unless the user overrides the decision With version it also blocks access to sites known to host malware Downloads are also checked to see if they are known to be malware infected br In Windows Vista Internet Explorer by default runs in what is called Protected Mode where the privileges of the browser itself are severely restricted it cannot make any system wide changes One can optionally turn this mode off but this is not recommended This also effectively restricts the privileges of any add ons As a result even if the browser or any add on is compromised the damage the security breach can cause is limited br Patches and updates to the browser are released periodically and made available through the Windows Update service as well as through Automatic Updates Although security patches continue to be released for a range of platforms most feature additions and security infrastructure improvements are only made available on operating systems that are in Microsoft s mainstream support phase br On December Trend Micro recommended users switch to rival browsers until an emergency patch was released to fix a potential security risk which could allow outside users to take control of a person s computer and steal their passwords Microsoft representatives countered this recommendation claiming that of internet sites were affected by the flaw A fix for the issue was released the following day with the Security Update for Internet Explorer KB on Microsoft Windows Update br In Germany s Federal Office for Information Security known by its German initials BSI advised temporary use of alternative browsers because of a critical security hole in Microsoft s software that could allow hackers to remotely plant and run malicious code on Windows PCs br In a report by Accuvant funded by Google rated the security based on sandboxing of Internet Explorer worse than Google Chrome but better than Mozilla Firefox br A browser security white paper comparing Google Chrome Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer by X D Sec in came to similar conclusions also based on sandboxing and support of legacy web technologies br br br Security vulnerabilities br br Internet Explorer has been subjected to many security vulnerabilities and concerns such that the volume of criticism for IE is unusually high Much of the spyware adware and computer viruses across the Internet are made possible by exploitable bugs and flaws in the security architecture of Internet Explorer sometimes requiring nothing more than viewing of a malicious web page to install themselves This is known as a drive by install There are also attempts to trick the user into installing malicious software by misrepresenting the software s true purpose in the description section of an ActiveX security alert br A number of security flaws affecting IE originated not in the browser itself but in ActiveX based add ons used by it Because the add ons have the same privilege as IE the flaws can be as critical as browser flaws This has led to the ActiveX based architecture being criticized for being fault prone By some experts maintained that the dangers of ActiveX had been overstated and there were safeguards in place In new techniques using automated testing found more than a hundred vulnerabilities in standard Microsoft ActiveX components Security features introduced in Internet Explorer mitigated some of these vulnerabilities br In Internet Explorer had a number of published security vulnerabilities According to research done by security research firm Secunia Microsoft did not respond as quickly as its competitors in fixing security holes and making patches available The firm also reported vulnerabilities in ActiveX controls an increase from the previous year br According to an October report in The Register researcher Chris Evans had detected a known security vulnerability which then dating back to had not been fixed for at least six hundred days Microsoft says that it had known about this vulnerability but it was of exceptionally low severity as the victim web site must be configured in a peculiar way for this attack to be feasible at all br In December researchers were able to bypass the Protected Mode feature in Internet Explorer br br br Vulnerability exploited in attacks on U S firms br br In an advisory on January Microsoft said that attackers targeting Google and other U S companies used software that exploits a security hole which had already been patched in Internet Explorer The vulnerability affected Internet Explorer from on Windows XP and Server IE SP on Windows SP IE on Windows Vista XP Server and Server IE on Windows Vista XP Server and Server R br The German government warned users against using Internet Explorer and recommended switching to an alternative web browser due to the major security hole described above that was exploited in Internet Explorer The Australian and French Government issued a similar warning a few days later br br br Major vulnerability across versions br On April Microsoft issued a security advisory relating to CVE use after free vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer through a vulnerability that could allow remote code execution in Internet Explorer versions to On April the United States Department of Homeland Security s United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team US CERT released an advisory stating that the vulnerability could result in the complete compromise of an affected system US CERT recommended reviewing Microsoft s suggestions to mitigate an attack or using an alternate browser until the bug is fixed The UK National Computer Emergency Response Team CERT UK published an advisory announcing similar concerns and for users to take the additional step of ensuring their antivirus software is up to date Symantec a cyber security firm confirmed that the vulnerability crashes Internet Explorer on Windows XP The vulnerability was resolved on May with a security update br br br Market adoption and usage share br br The adoption rate of Internet Explorer seems to be closely related to that of Microsoft Windows as it is the default web browser that comes with Windows Since the integration of Internet Explorer with Windows OSR in and especially after version s release in the adoption was greatly accelerated from below in to about in and over in This made Microsoft the winner in the infamous first browser war against Netscape Netscape Navigator was the dominant browser during and until but rapidly lost share to IE starting in and eventually slipped behind in The integration of IE with Windows led to a lawsuit by AOL Netscape s owner accusing Microsoft of unfair competition The infamous case was eventually won by AOL but by then it was too late as Internet Explorer had already become the dominant browser br Internet Explorer peaked during and with about share Its first notable competitor after beating Netscape was Firefox from Mozilla which itself was an offshoot from Netscape br Firefox had surpassed Internet Explorer in early with Firefox at percent market share br Approximate usage over time based on various usage share counters averaged for the year overall or for the fourth quarter or for the last month in the year depending on availability of reference br According to StatCounter Internet Explorer s market share fell below in September In May Google Chrome overtook Internet Explorer as the most used browser worldwide according to StatCounter br br br Industry adoption br Browser Helper Objects are also used by many search engines companies and third parties for creating add ons that access their services such as search engine toolbars Because of the use of COM it is possible to embed web browsing functionality in third party applications Hence there are several Internet Explorer shells and several content centric applications like RealPlayer also use Internet Explorer s web browsing module for viewing web pages within the applications br br br Removal br br While a major upgrade of Internet Explorer can be uninstalled in a traditional way if the user has saved the original application files for installation the matter of uninstalling the version of the browser that has shipped with an operating system remains a controversial one br The idea of removing a stock install of Internet Explorer from a Windows system was proposed during the United States v Microsoft Corp case One of Microsoft s arguments during the trial was that removing Internet Explorer from Windows may result in system instability Indeed programs that depend on libraries installed by IE including Windows help and support system fail to function without IE Before Windows Vista it was not possible to run Windows Update without IE because the service used ActiveX technology which no other web browser supports br br br Impersonation by malware br The popularity of Internet Explorer led to the appearance of malware abusing its name On January a fake Internet Explorer browser calling itself Internet Explorer Emergency Mode appeared It closely resembled the real Internet Explorer but had fewer buttons and no search bar If a user attempted to launch any other browser such as Google Chrome Mozilla Firefox Opera Safari or the real Internet Explorer this browser would be loaded instead It also displayed a fake error message claiming that the computer was infected with malware and Internet Explorer had entered Emergency Mode It blocked access to legitimate sites such as Google if the user tried to access them br br br See
