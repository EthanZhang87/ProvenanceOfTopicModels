end it is one of the co sponsors of the Special Programme on Human Reproduction br In a joint declaration of UNICEF argued the need to combat the spread of selective abortion through plans that favored inter alia the use of safe abortion services and family planning programs in order to decrease the use of abortion br In together with WHO it published an integrated plan of guidelines for the

populations which supported the spread of emergency contraceptive practices br Despite this on several occasions senior UNICEF officials have denied that the organization promoted abortion or family planning methods br UNICEF also supports the adoption by states of laws that guarantee LGBT couples and their children the legal recognition of their status as these rules would help ensure the best interests of children br br br Controversies br br br Adoption program br UNICEF has a policy preferring orphanages only be used as temporary accommodation for children when there is no alternative UNICEF has historically opposed the creation of large scale permanent orphanages for children preferring instead to find children places in their extended families and communities wherever possible This has led UNICEF to be skeptical of international adoption efforts as a solution to child care problems in developing countries UNICEF has preferred to see children cared for in their birth countries rather than be adopted by foreign parents br A article in U S News World Report magazine asserted UNICEF s intervention that on giving large cash payments to developing countries can lead to a cessation of international adoptions until all of its recommendations are in place and have even labelled UNICEF a villain for the extent of its negative impact on orphans br br br Child mortality br One concern is that the child mortality rate has not decreased in some areas as rapidly as had been planned especially in Sub Saharan Africa where in the region still has the highest child mortality rate deaths per live births and that Globally nearly half of under five deaths are attributable to undernutrition br In Richard Horton editor in chief of The Lancet editorialized that over of these deaths were and remain preventable and that the coverage levels for these interventions are appallingly low in the countries that account for of child deaths br A million UNICEF program in West Africa in which was meant to decrease child deaths from disease has been deemed a failure according to a study that found higher survival rates of children in some regions that weren t included in that program br Critics argue that UNICEF s focus on rights rather than safety and survival is idealistic and that by focusing on politicized children s rights instead of mere child survival UNICEF has contributed indirectly to the child mortality crisis br br br Mismanagement and abuse of funding br In in what was called the worst scandal in its history UNICEF disclosed that employees in its Kenya office stole or squandered million this fraud consumed more than a quarter of the UNICEF s million two year budget for Kenya br In Germany in the late s UNICEF was accused of mismanagement abuse and waste of funds This has resulted in of UNICEF regular donors abandoning their support from the charity and politicians and public figures including Angela Merkel demanding explanations and the chairwoman of UNICEF Germany resigning in br In UNICEF confirmed fraud in a Pakistan school rehabilitation project where an estimated US million was lost when funds were misappropriated br br br NSA surveillance br br Documents released by Edward Snowden in December showed that UNICEF was among the surveillance targets of British and American intelligence agencies br br br Sexual assault br Press reports in disclosed that women in the Democratic Republic of Congo accused foreign aid workers including UNICEF workers of sexually assaulting them The World Health Organization described the alleged actions as reprehensible and a UNICEF spokesperson acknowledged that such sexual assault cases are underreported in the region Prior to this in UNICEF was hit by a wave of sexual misconduct accusations in deputy director Justin Forsyth resigned from UNICEF following allegations that he behaved inappropriately toward female staff members br UNICEF has also admitted to shortcomings in its humanitarian support of children who said that they were raped and sexually abused by French peacekeepers in Central African Republic br Peter Newell a convicted child sex offender has worked closely with UNICEF he managed a charity that received hundreds of thousand of pounds from the NSPCC Barnardo s Save the Children and UNICEF and cowrote a manual on children s rights called Implementation Handbook for the Convention on the Rights of the Child for Unicef which was published by UNICEF br Andrew MacLeod the former chief of operations at the UN s Emergency Co ordination Center had accused UNICEF of failure to take action to prevent abuses he stated There are tens of thousands of aid workers around the world with pedophile tendencies but if you wear a UNICEF T shirt nobody will ask what you re up to br br br Funding of UK food charities br In December UNICEF made funding available to feed children in the UK for the first time as part of its Food Power for Generation COVID initiative UNICEF pledged to School Food Matters a south London charity to help feed children over the Christmas holidays A partnership of Devon charities had also been given to help feed families over the winter of UNICEF said it was helping children in the UK because of an increase in food poverty in Britain caused by the COVID pandemic It estimates there are children going hungry in a fifth of households Anna Kettley from UNICEF said We are one of the richest countries in the world and we should not have to be relying on food banks or food aid Labour MP Zarah Sultana in the House of Commons said For the first time ever UNICEF the UN agency responsible for providing humanitarian aid to children is having to feed working class kids in the UK but while children go hungry a wealthy few enjoy obscene riches In response Jacob Rees Mogg Tory MP and Leader of the House of Commons said I think it is a real scandal that UNICEF should be playing politics in this way when it is meant to be looking after people in the poorest the most deprived countries of the world where people are starving where there are famines and where there are civil wars and they make cheap political points of this kind giving I think to one council It is a political stunt of the lowest order UNICEF should be ashamed of itself Chris Forster from Transforming Plymouth Together one of the Devon charities to benefit from UNICEF donations said We had one family as part of the deliveries last week literally in tears with gratitude because their cupboard was bare Scottish National Party MP Tommy Sheppard said It is astonishing that these comments are coming from the same government that had to be publicly shamed into following Scotland s lead and providing free school meals for children over the holidays LBC reported that the UN humanitarian aid agency are providing over to feed hungry children in the UK br br br Digital Age Assurance Tools and Children s Rights Online across the Globe report br In UNICEF published a report called Digital Age Assurance Tools and Children s Rights Online across the Globe The paper focusing on human rights and digital tools generated controversy after misleading claims and headlines about the report were spread online originating from a story by the conservative Center for Family and Human Rights The fact checking website Snopes rated the claim that the report said pornography is not always harmful to children and blocking children from watching pornography online violates their rights as false UNICEF pulled down the report citing misrepresentation of one of its portions br br br See also br br br Notes br br br br br br Links br br Official UNICEF website br UNICEF Annual Report downloadable in several languages br United
