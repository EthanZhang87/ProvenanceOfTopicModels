Secretary br Traditionally the most important part of the Cabinet Office s role was facilitating collective decision making by the Cabinet through running and supporting Cabinet level committees This is still its principal role but since the absorption of some of the functions of the Civil Service Department in the Cabinet Office has also helped to ensure that a wide range of Ministerial priorities are taken forward across Whitehall br It also contains miscellaneous units that do not sit well in other departments For example br br The Historical Section was founded in as part of the Committee for Imperial Defence and is concerned with Official Histories br The Joint Intelligence Committee was founded in and transferred to the department in It deals with intelligence assessments and directing the national intelligence organisations of the UK br The Ceremonial Branch was founded in and transferred to the department in It was originally concerned with all ceremonial functions of state but today it handles honours and appointments br In modern times the Cabinet Office often takes on responsibility for areas of policy which are the priority of the Government of the time The units that administer these areas migrate in and out of the Cabinet Office as government priorities and governments change br br br Ministers and civil servants br br The Cabinet Office Ministers are as follows with cabinet ministers in bold br br Leaders of the Houses of Commons and Lords supported by the Cabinet Office are as follows br br The Cabinet Office senior civil servants are as follows br br The Cabinet Office also supports the work of the Whips Offices of the House of Lords and House of Commons br The Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Cabinet Office supports the work of ministers br br br Committees br br Cabinet committees have two key purposes br br To relieve the burden on the Cabinet by dealing with business that does not need to be discussed at full Cabinet Appeals to the Cabinet should be infrequent and Ministers chairing Cabinet Committees should exercise discretion in advising the prime minister whether to allow them br To support the principle of collective responsibility by ensuring that even though a question may never reach the Cabinet itself it will be fully considered In this way the final judgement is sufficiently authoritative that Government as a whole can be expected to accept responsibility for it In this sense Cabinet Committee decisions have the same authority as Cabinet decisions br br br Buildings br br The main building of the Cabinet Office is at Whitehall adjacent to Downing Street The building connects three historically distinct properties as well as the remains of Henry VIII s tennis courts part of the Palace of Whitehall which can be seen within the building The Whitehall frontage was designed by Sir John Soane and completed by Sir Charles Barry between and as the Treasury Buildings Immediately to the west
