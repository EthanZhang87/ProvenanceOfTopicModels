Israel officially the State of Israel is a country in the Southern Levant West Asia It is bordered by Lebanon and Syria to the north the West Bank and Jordan to the east Egypt the Gaza Strip and the Red Sea to the south and the Mediterranean Sea to the west Tel Aviv is the country s financial economic and technological center Israel s governmental seat is in its proclaimed capital of Jerusalem though Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem is not recognised under international law and only has limited recognition internationally br Israel is located in a region known historically as Canaan Palestine and the Holy Land In antiquity it was home to Canaanite city states then the kingdoms of Israel and Judah and is referred to as the Land of Israel in Jewish tradition Situated at a continental crossroad the region was then ruled by various empires Amid European antisemitism the late th century saw the rise of Zionism which sought a Jewish homeland British occupation led to the establishment of Mandatory Palestine in Jewish immigration combined with British colonial policy led to intercommunal conflict between Jews and Arabs The UN Partition Plan triggered civil war between them br The State of Israel declared its establishment on May The next day armies of neighboring Arab states invaded starting the First Arab Israeli War A majority of Palestinians were expelled or fled due to various causes Over the following decades Israel received an influx of immigration from Jews who emigrated fled or were expelled from the Muslim world The Armistice Agreements established Israel s borders over most of the former Mandate territory The Six Day War saw Israel occupy the West Bank Gaza Strip Egyptian Sinai Peninsula and Syrian Golan Heights Israel has established and continues to expand settlements across the occupied territories which is deemed illegal under international law and has annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights which is largely unrecognized internationally Since the Yom Kippur War Israel has signed peace treaties with Egypt returning the Sinai Peninsula and Jordan and into the s has normalized relations with several Arab countries However efforts to resolve the Israeli Palestinian conflict have not succeeded Israel has been internationally criticised for its illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories and been accused of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity against the Palestinians by human rights organizations and UN officials br The country has a parliamentary system elected by proportional representation The prime minister is head of government and elected by the Knesset a unicameral legislature Israel is the only country to have a revived language Hebrew as the official language The culture of Israel is composed of Jewish culture and Jewish diaspora influences alongside elements of Arab culture involving cuisine music and art Israel has one of the biggest and most advanced economies in the Middle East It also has of the highest GDP per capita as well as standard of living in the Middle East and Asia The country has been a member of the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development since br br br Etymology br br Under the British Mandate the whole region was known as Palestine Upon establishment in the country formally adopted the name State of Israel Hebrew medi nat jis a el Arabic Dawlat Isr l dawlat isra i l after other proposed names including Land of Israel Eretz Israel Ever from ancestor Eber Zion and Judea were considered but rejected The name Israel was suggested by Ben Gurion and passed by a vote of In the early weeks after establishment the government chose the term Israeli to denote a citizen of the Israeli state br The names Land of Israel and Children of Israel have historically been used to refer to the biblical Kingdom of Israel and the entire Jewish people respectively The name Israel Hebrew Y sr l Septuagint Greek Isra l El God persists rules though after Hosea often interpreted as struggle with God refers to the patriarch Jacob who according to the Hebrew Bible was given the name after he successfully wrestled with the angel of the Lord The earliest known archaeological artefact to mention the word Israel as a collective is the Merneptah Stele of ancient Egypt dated to the late th century BCE br br br History br br br Prehistory br br Early hominin presence in the Levant where Israel is located dates back at least million years based on the Ubeidiya prehistoric site The Skhul and Qafzeh hominins dating back years are some of the earliest traces of anatomically modern humans outside of Africa The Natufian culture emerged by the th millennium BCE followed by the Ghassulian culture by around BCE br br br Bronze and Iron Ages br br Early references to Canaanites and Canaan appear in Near Eastern and Egyptian texts c BCE these populations were structured as politically independent city states During the Late Bronze Age BCE large parts of Canaan formed vassal states of the New Kingdom of Egypt As a result of the Late Bronze Age collapse Canaan fell into chaos and Egyptian control over the region collapsed br A people named Israel appear for the first time in the Merneptah Stele an ancient Egyptian inscription which dates to about BCE Ancestors of the Israelites are thought to have included ancient Semitic speaking peoples native to this area Modern archaeological accounts suggest that the Israelites and their culture branched out of the Canaanite peoples through the development of a distinct monolatristic and later monotheistic religion centered on Yahweh They spoke an archaic form of Hebrew known as Biblical Hebrew Around the same time the Philistines settled on the southern coastal plain br Modern archaeology has largely discarded the historicity of the narrative in the Torah and instead views the narrative as the Israelites national myth However some elements of these traditions do appear to have historical roots There is debate about the earliest existence of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah and their extent and power While it is unclear if there was ever a United Kingdom of Israel historians and archaeologists agree that the northern Kingdom of Israel existed by ca BCE and the Kingdom of Judah by ca BCE The Kingdom of Israel was the more prosperous of the two and soon developed into a regional power with a capital at Samaria during the Omride dynasty it controlled Samaria Galilee the upper Jordan Valley the Sharon and large parts of the Transjordan br The Kingdom of Israel was conquered around BCE by the Neo Assyrian Empire The Kingdom of Judah with its capital in Jerusalem later became a client state of first the Neo Assyrian Empire and then the Neo Babylonian Empire It is estimated that the region s population was around in the Iron Age II In BCE following a revolt in Judah King Nebuchadnezzar II besieged and destroyed Jerusalem and Solomon s Temple dissolved the kingdom and exiled much of the Judean elite to Babylon After capturing Babylon in BCE Cyrus the Great founder of the Achaemenid Empire issued a proclamation allowing the exiled Judean population to return to Judah br br br Classical antiquity br br The construction of the Second Temple was completed c BCE The Achaemenids ruled the region as the province of Yehud Medinata In BCE Alexander the Great of Macedon conquered the region as part of his campaign against the Achaemenid Empire After his death the area was controlled by the Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires as a part of Coele Syria Over the ensuing centuries the Hellenization of the region led to cultural tensions that came to a head during the reign of Antiochus IV giving rise to the Maccabean Revolt of BCE The civil unrest weakened Seleucid rule and in the late nd century the semi autonomous Hasmonean Kingdom of Judea arose eventually attaining full independence and expanding into neighboring regions br br The Roman Republic invaded the region in BCE first taking control of Syria and then intervening in the Hasmonean Civil War The struggle between pro Roman and pro Parthian factions in Judea led to the installation of Herod the Great as a dynastic vassal of Rome In CE the area was annexed as the Roman province of Judaea tensions with Roman rule led to a series of Jewish Roman wars resulting in widespread destruction The First Jewish Roman War CE resulted in the destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple and a sizable portion of the population being killed or displaced br A second uprising known as the Bar Kokhba revolt CE initially allowed the Jews to form an independent state but the Romans brutally crushed the rebellion devastating and depopulating Judea s countryside Jerusalem was rebuilt as a Roman colony Aelia Capitolina and the province of Judea was renamed Syria Palaestina Jews were expelled from the districts surrounding Jerusalem Nevertheless there was a continuous small Jewish presence and Galilee became its religious center br br br Late antiquity and the medieval period br br With the transition to Byzantine rule under Emperor Constantine Early Christianity displaced the more tolerant Roman Paganism A series of laws were passed that discriminated against Jews and Judaism and Jews were persecuted by both the church and the authorities Many Jews had emigrated to flourishing Diaspora communities while locally there was both Christian immigration and local conversion By the middle of the th century there was a Christian majority Towards the end of the th century Samaritan revolts erupted continuing until the late th century and resulting in a large decrease in the Samaritan population After the Sasanian conquest of Jerusalem and the short lived Jewish revolt against Heraclius in CE the Byzantine Empire reconsolidated control of the area in br In CE the Rashidun Caliphate conquered the Levant Over the next six centuries control of the region transferred between the Umayyad Abbasid Fatimid caliphates and subsequently the Seljuks and Ayyubid dynasties The population drastically decreased during the following several centuries dropping from an estimated million during Roman and Byzantine periods to about by the early Ottoman period and there was a steady process of Arabization and Islamization The end of the th century brought the Crusades papally sanctioned incursions of Christian crusaders intent on wresting Jerusalem and the Holy Land from Muslim control and establishing Crusader States The Ayyubids pushed back the crusaders before Muslim rule was fully restored by the Mamluk sultans of Egypt in br br br Modern period and the emergence of Zionism br br In the Ottoman Empire conquered the region and ruled it as part of Ottoman Syria Two violent incidents took place against Jews the Safed attacks and the Hebron attacks after the Turkish Ottomans ousted the Mamluks during the Ottoman Mamluk War Under the Ottoman Empire the Levant was fairly cosmopolitan with religious freedoms for Christians Muslims and Jews In the Ottoman sultan invited Sephardi Jews escaping the Spanish Inquisition to settle in and rebuild the city of Tiberias br Under the Ottoman Empire s millet system Christians and Jews were considered dhimmi meaning protected under Ottoman law in exchange for loyalty to the state and payment of the jizya tax Non Muslim Ottoman subjects faced geographic and lifestyle restrictions though these were not always enforced The millet system organized non Muslims into autonomous communities on the basis of religion br br Since the existence of the Jewish diaspora many Jews have aspired to return to Zion The Jewish population of Palestine from the Ottoman rule to the beginning of the Zionist movement known as the Old Yishuv comprised a minority and fluctuated in size During the th century Jewish communities struck roots in the Four Holy Cities Jerusalem Tiberias Hebron and Safed and in Rabbi Yehuda Hachasid led a group of Jews to Jerusalem A Druze revolt against the Ottomans destroyed Safed and Tiberias In the second half of the th century Eastern European Jews who were opponents of Hasidism known as the Perushim settled in Palestine br In the late th century local Arab Sheikh Zahir al Umar created a de facto independent Emirate in the Galilee Ottoman attempts to subdue the Sheikh failed After Zahir s death the Ottomans regained control of the area In governor Jazzar Pasha repelled an assault on Acre by Napoleon s troops prompting the French to abandon the Syrian campaign In a revolt by Palestinian Arab peasants against Egyptian conscription and taxation policies under Muhammad Ali was suppressed Muhammad Ali s army retreated and Ottoman rule was restored with British support in The Tanzimat reforms were implemented across the Ottoman Empire br The first wave of modern Jewish migration to Ottoman ruled Palestine known as the First Aliyah began in as Jews fled pogroms in Eastern Europe The May Laws increased economic discrimination against Jews and restricted where they could live In response political Zionism took form a movement that sought to establish a Jewish state in the Land of Israel thus offering a solution to the Jewish question of the European states br The Second Aliyah began after the Kishinev pogrom some Jews settled in Palestine although nearly half left eventually Both the first and second waves of migrants were mainly Orthodox Jews The Second Aliyah included Zionist socialist groups who established the kibbutz movement based on the idea of establishing a separate Jewish economy based exclusively on Jewish labor Those of the Second Aliyah who became leaders of the Yishuv in the coming decades believed that the Jewish settler economy should not depend on Arab labor This would be a dominant source of antagonism with the Arab population with the new Yishuv s nationalist ideology overpowering its socialist one Though the immigrants of the Second Aliyah largely sought to create communal Jewish agricultural settlements Tel Aviv was established as the first planned Jewish town in Jewish armed militias emerged during this period the first being Bar Giora in Two years later the larger Hashomer organization was founded as its replacement br br br British Mandate for Palestine br br Chaim Weizmann s efforts to garner British support for the Zionist movement eventually secured the Balfour Declaration stating Britain s support for the creation of a Jewish national home in Palestine Weizmann s interpretation of the declaration was that negotiations on the future of the country were to happen directly between Britain and the Jews excluding Arabs The years that followed would see Jewish Arab relations in Palestine deteriorate dramatically br In the Jewish Legion primarily Zionist volunteers assisted in the British conquest of Palestine In the territory was divided between Britain and France under the mandate system and the British administered area including modern Israel was named Mandatory Palestine Arab opposition to British rule and Jewish immigration led to the Palestine riots and the formation of a Jewish militia known as the Haganah as an outgrowth of Hashomer from which the Irgun and Lehi paramilitaries later split In the League of Nations granted Britain the Mandate for Palestine under terms which included the Balfour Declaration with its promise to the Jews and with similar provisions regarding the Arab Palestinians The population of the area was predominantly Arab and Muslim with Jews accounting for about and Arab Christians about of the population br br The Third and Fourth Aliyahs brought an additional Jews to Palestine The rise of Nazism and the increasing persecution of Jews in s Europe led to the Fifth Aliyah with an influx of a quarter of a million Jews This was a major cause of the Arab revolt of which was suppressed by British security forces and Zionist militias Several hundred British security personnel and Jews were killed Arabs were killed were wounded and were detained An estimated ten percent of the adult male Palestinian Arab population was killed wounded imprisoned or exiled br The British introduced restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine with the White Paper of With countries around the world turning away Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust a clandestine movement known as Aliyah Bet was organized to bring Jews to Palestine By the end of World War II of the total population of Palestine was Jewish The UK found itself facing a Jewish insurgency over immigration restrictions and continued conflict with the Arab community over limit levels The Haganah joined Irgun and Lehi in an armed struggle against British rule The Haganah attempted to bring tens of thousands of Jewish refugees and Holocaust survivors to Palestine by ship in a programme called Aliyah Bet Most of the ships were intercepted by the Royal Navy and the refugees placed in detention camps in Atlit and Cyprus br br On July Irgun bombed the British administrative headquarters for Palestine killing The attack was a response to Operation Agatha a series of raids including one on the Jewish Agency by the British and was the deadliest directed at the British during the Mandate era The Jewish insurgency continued throughout and despite concerted efforts by the British military and Palestine Police Force to suppress it British efforts to mediate a negotiated solution with Jewish and Arab representatives also failed as the Jews were unwilling to accept any solution that did not involve a Jewish state and suggested a partition of Palestine into Jewish and Arab states while the Arabs were adamant that a Jewish state in any part of Palestine was unacceptable and that the only solution was a unified Palestine under Arab rule In February the British referred the Palestine issue to the newly formed United Nations On May the UN General Assembly resolved that a Special Committee be created to prepare a report on the question of Palestine The Report of the Committee proposed a plan to replace the British Mandate with an independent Arab State an independent Jewish State and the City of Jerusalem the last to be under an International Trusteeship System Meanwhile the Jewish insurgency continued and peaked in July with a series of widespread guerrilla raids culminating in the Sergeants affair in which the Irgun took two British sergeants hostage as attempted leverage against the planned execution of three Irgun operatives After the executions were carried out the Irgun killed the two British soldiers hanged their bodies from trees and left a booby trap at the scene which injured a British soldier The incident caused widespread outrage in the UK In September the British cabinet decided to evacuate Palestine as the Mandate was no longer tenable br On November the General Assembly adopted Resolution II The plan attached to the resolution was essentially that proposed in the report of September The Jewish Agency the recognized representative of the Jewish community accepted the plan which assigned of Mandatory Palestine to the Jews At the time the Jews were about a third of the population and owned around of the land Arabs constituted the majority and owned about of the land with the remainder held by the Mandate authorities or foreign landowners The Arab League and Arab Higher Committee of Palestine rejected it and indicated that they would reject any other plan of partition On December the Arab Higher Committee proclaimed a three day strike and riots broke out in Jerusalem The situation spiraled into a civil war Colonial Secretary Arthur Creech Jones announced that the British Mandate would end on May at which point the British would evacuate As Arab militias and gangs attacked Jewish areas they were faced mainly by the Haganah as well as the smaller Irgun and Lehi In April the Haganah moved onto the offensive During this period Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled due to numerous factors br br br State of Israel br br br Establishment and early years br br On May the day before the expiration of the British Mandate David Ben Gurion the head of the Jewish Agency declared the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel The only reference in the text of the Declaration to the borders of the new state is the use of the term Eretz Israel Land of Israel The following day the armies of four Arab countries Egypt Syria Transjordan and Iraq entered what had been Mandatory Palestine launching the Arab Israeli War contingents from Yemen Morocco Saudi Arabia and Sudan joined the war The apparent purpose of the invasion was to prevent the establishment of the Jewish state some Arab leaders talked about driving the Jews into the sea The Arab league stated the invasion was to restore order and prevent further bloodshed br After a year of fighting a ceasefire was declared and temporary borders known as the Green Line were established Jordan annexed what became known as the West Bank including East Jerusalem and Egypt occupied the Gaza Strip Over Palestinians were expelled by or fled by Zionist militias and the Israeli military what would become known in Arabic as the Nakba catastrophe The events also led to the destruction of most of Palestine s predominantly Arab population s society culture identity political rights and national aspirations Some remained and became Arab citizens of Israel br br Israel was admitted as a member of the UN on May In the early years of the state the Labor Zionist movement led by Prime Minister David Ben Gurion dominated Israeli politics Immigration to Israel during the late s and early s was aided by the Israeli Immigration Department and the non government sponsored Mossad LeAliyah Bet lit Institute for Immigration B The latter engaged in clandestine operations in countries particularly in the Middle East and Eastern Europe where the lives of Jews were believed to be in danger and exit was difficult Mossad LeAliyah Bet was disbanded in The immigration was in accordance with the One Million Plan Some immigrants held Zionist beliefs or came for the promise of a better life while others moved to escape persecution or were expelled br An influx of Holocaust survivors and Jews from Arab and Muslim countries to Israel during the first three years increased the number of Jews from to By the population had risen to two million Between and approximately Jewish refugees relocated to Israel Some new immigrants arrived as refugees and were housed in temporary camps known as ma abarot by over people were living in these tent cities Jews of European background were often treated more favorably than Jews from Middle Eastern and North African countries housing units reserved for the latter were often re designated for the former so Jews newly arrived from Arab lands generally ended up staying longer in transit camps During this period food clothes and furniture were rationed in what became known as the austerity period The need to solve the crisis led Ben Gurion to sign a reparations agreement with West Germany that triggered mass protests by Jews angered at the idea that Israel could accept monetary compensation for the Holocaust br br br Arab Israeli conflict br br During the s Israel was frequently attacked by Palestinian fedayeen nearly always against civilians mainly from the Egyptian occupied Gaza Strip leading to several Israeli reprisal operations In the UK and France aimed at regaining control of the Suez Canal which Egypt had nationalized The continued blockade of the Suez Canal and Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping together with increasing Fedayeen attacks against Israel s southern population and recent Arab threatening statements prompted Israel to attack Egypt Israel joined a secret alliance with the UK and France and overran the Sinai Peninsula in the Suez Crisis but was pressured to withdraw by the UN in return for guarantees of Israeli shipping rights The war resulted in significant reduction of Israeli border infiltration br br In the early s Israel captured Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in Argentina and brought him to Israel for trial Eichmann remains the only person executed in Israel by conviction in an Israeli civilian court In Israel was engaged in a diplomatic standoff with the United States due to the Israeli nuclear programme br Since Arab countries concerned over Israeli plans to divert waters of the Jordan River into the coastal plain had been trying to divert the headwaters to deprive Israel of water resources provoking tensions between Israel on the one hand and Syria and Lebanon on the other Arab nationalists led by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser refused to recognize Israel and called for its destruction By Israeli Arab relations had deteriorated to the point of battles taking place between Israeli and Arab forces br br In May Egypt massed its army near the border with Israel expelled UN peacekeepers stationed in the Sinai Peninsula since and blocked Israel s access to the Red Sea Other Arab states mobilized their forces Israel reiterated that these actions were a casus belli and launched a pre emptive strike against Egypt in June Jordan Syria and Iraq attacked Israel In the Six Day War Israel captured and occupied the West Bank from Jordan the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt and the Golan Heights from Syria Jerusalem s boundaries were enlarged incorporating East Jerusalem The Green Line became the administrative boundary between Israel and the occupied territories br Following the war and the Three Nos resolution of the Arab League Israel faced attacks from the Egyptians in the Sinai Peninsula during the War of Attrition and from Palestinian groups targeting Israelis in the occupied territories globally and in Israel Most important among the Palestinian and Arab groups was the Palestinian Liberation Organization PLO established in which initially committed itself to armed struggle as the only way to liberate the homeland In the late s and early s Palestinian groups launched attacks against Israeli and Jewish targets around the world including a massacre of Israeli athletes at the Summer Olympics in Munich The Israeli government responded with an assassination campaign against the organizers of the massacre a bombing and a raid on the PLO headquarters in Lebanon br On October the Egyptian and Syrian armies launched a surprise attack against Israeli forces in the Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights opening the Yom Kippur War The war ended on October with Israel repelling Egyptian and Syrian forces but suffering great losses An internal inquiry exonerated the government of responsibility for failures before and during the war but public anger forced Prime Minister Golda Meir to resign In July an airliner was hijacked in flight from Israel to France by Palestinian guerrillas Israeli commandos rescued out of Israeli hostages br br br Peace process br br The Knesset elections marked a major turning point in Israeli political history as Menachem Begin s Likud party took control from the Labor Party Later that year Egyptian President Anwar El Sadat made a trip to Israel and spoke before the Knesset in what was the first recognition of Israel by an Arab head of state Sadat and Begin signed the Camp David Accords and the Egypt Israel peace treaty In return Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula and agreed to enter negotiations over autonomy for Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip br On March a PLO guerilla raid from Lebanon led to the Coastal Road massacre Israel responded by launching an invasion of southern Lebanon to destroy PLO bases Most PLO fighters withdrew but Israel was able to secure southern Lebanon until a UN force and the Lebanese army could take over The PLO soon resumed its insurgency against Israel and Israel carried out numerous retaliatory attacks br Meanwhile Begin s government provided incentives for Israelis to settle in the occupied West Bank increasing friction with the Palestinians there The Jerusalem Law was believed by some to reaffirm Israel s annexation of Jerusalem by government decree and reignited international controversy over the status of the city No Israeli legislation has defined the territory of Israel and no act specifically included East Jerusalem therein In Israel effectively annexed the Golan Heights The international community largely rejected these moves with the UN Security Council declaring both the Jerusalem Law and the Golan Heights Law null and void Several waves of Ethiopian Jews immigrated to Israel since the s while between and immigration from the post Soviet states increased Israel s population by twelve percent br On June during the Iran Iraq War the Israeli air force destroyed Iraq s sole nuclear reactor then under construction in order to impede the Iraqi nuclear weapons program Following a series of PLO attacks in Israel invaded Lebanon to destroy the PLO bases In the first six days the Israelis destroyed the military forces of the PLO in Lebanon and decisively defeated the Syrians An Israeli government inquiry the Kahan Commission held Begin and several Israeli generals indirectly responsible for the Sabra and Shatila massacre and held Defense minister Ariel Sharon as bearing personal responsibility Sharon was forced to resign In Israel responded to a Palestinian terrorist attack in Cyprus by bombing the PLO headquarters in Tunisia Israel withdrew from most of Lebanon in but maintained a borderland buffer zone in southern Lebanon until from where Israeli forces engaged in conflict with Hezbollah The First Intifada a Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule broke out in with waves of uncoordinated demonstrations and violence in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Over the following six years the Intifada became more organized and included economic and cultural measures aimed at disrupting the Israeli occupation Over a thousand people were killed During the Gulf War the PLO supported Saddam Hussein and Iraqi missile attacks against Israel Despite public outrage Israel heeded American calls to refrain from hitting back br br In Yitzhak Rabin became prime minister following an election in which his party called for compromise with Israel s neighbours The following year Shimon Peres on behalf of Israel and Mahmoud Abbas for the PLO signed the Oslo Accords which gave the Palestinian National Authority PNA the right to govern parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip The PLO also recognized Israel s right to exist and pledged an end to terrorism In the Israel Jordan peace treaty was signed making Jordan the second Arab country to normalize relations with Israel Arab public support for the Accords was damaged by the continuation of Israeli settlements and checkpoints and the deterioration of economic conditions Israeli public support for the Accords waned after Palestinian suicide attacks In November Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by Yigal Amir a far right Jew who opposed the Accords br During Benjamin Netanyahu s premiership at the end of the s Israel agreed to withdraw from Hebron though this was never ratified or implemented and signed the Wye River Memorandum giving greater control to the PNA Ehud Barak elected Prime Minister in withdrew forces from Southern Lebanon and conducted negotiations with PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat and U S President Bill Clinton at the Camp David Summit Barak offered a plan for the establishment of a Palestinian state including the entirety of the Gaza Strip and over of the West Bank with Jerusalem as a shared capital Each side blamed the other for the failure of the talks br br br st century br br In late after a controversial visit by Likud leader Ariel Sharon to the Temple Mount the year Second Intifada began Suicide bombings were a recurrent feature Some commentators contend that the Intifada was pre planned by Arafat due to the collapse of peace talks Sharon became prime minister in a election he carried out his plan to unilaterally withdraw from the Gaza Strip and spearheaded the construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier ending the Intifada Between and Israelis Palestinians and foreign citizens were killed br In a Hezbollah artillery assault on Israel s northern border communities and a cross border abduction of two Israeli soldiers precipitated the month long Second Lebanon War In the Israeli Air Force destroyed a nuclear reactor in Syria In a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel collapsed resulting in the three week Gaza War In what Israel described as a response to over a hundred Palestinian rocket attacks on southern Israeli cities Israel began an operation in the Gaza Strip in lasting eight days Israel started another operation in Gaza following an escalation of rocket attacks by Hamas in July In May another round of fighting took place in Gaza and Israel lasting eleven days br By the s increasing regional cooperation between Israel and Arab League countries have been established culminating in the signing of the Abraham Accords The Israeli security situation shifted from the traditional Arab Israeli conflict towards the Iran Israel proxy conflict and direct confrontation with Iran during the Syrian civil war On October Palestinian militant groups from Gaza led by Hamas launched a series of coordinated attacks on Israel leading to the start of the Israel Hamas war On that day approximately Israelis predominantly civilians were killed in communities near the Gaza Strip border and during a music festival Over hostages were kidnapped and taken to the Gaza Strip br br br Geography br br Israel is located in the Levant area of the Fertile Crescent The country is at the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea bounded by Lebanon to the north Syria to the northeast Jordan and the West Bank to the east and Egypt and the Gaza Strip to the southwest It lies between latitudes and N and longitudes and E br The sovereign territory of Israel according to the demarcation lines of the Armistice Agreements and excluding all territories captured by Israel during the Six Day War is approximately square kilometers sq mi of which two percent is water However Israel is so narrow km at its widest compared to km from north to south that the exclusive economic zone in the Mediterranean is double the land area of the country The total area under Israeli law including East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights is square kilometers sq mi and the total area under Israeli control including the military controlled and partially Palestinian governed territory of the West Bank is square kilometers sq mi br Despite its small size Israel is home to a variety of geographic features from the Negev desert in the south to the inland fertile Jezreel Valley mountain ranges of the Galilee Carmel and toward the Golan in the north The Israeli coastal plain on the shores of the Mediterranean is home to most of the nation s population East of the central highlands lies the Jordan Rift Valley a small part of the kilometer mi Great Rift Valley The Jordan River runs along the Jordan Rift Valley from Mount Hermon through the Hulah Valley and the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea the lowest point on the surface of the Earth Further south is the Arabah ending with the Gulf of Eilat part of the Red Sea Makhtesh or erosion cirques are unique to the Negev and the Sinai Peninsula the largest being the Makhtesh Ramon at km in length Israel has the largest number of plant species per square meter of the countries in the Mediterranean Basin Israel contains four terrestrial ecoregions Eastern Mediterranean conifer sclerophyllous broadleaf forests Southern Anatolian montane conifer and deciduous forests Arabian Desert and Mesopotamian shrub desert br Forests accounted for of the country s area in up from in as the result of a large scale forest planting program by the Jewish National Fund br br br Tectonics and seismicity br br The Jordan Rift Valley is the result of tectonic movements within the Dead Sea Transform DSF fault system The DSF forms the transform boundary between the African Plate to the west and the Arabian Plate to the east The Golan Heights and all of Jordan are part of the Arabian Plate while the Galilee West Bank Coastal Plain and Negev along with the Sinai Peninsula are on the African Plate This tectonic disposition leads to a relatively high seismic activity The entire Jordan Valley segment is thought to have ruptured repeatedly for instance during the last two major earthquakes along this structure in and The deficit in slip that has built up since the event is sufficient to cause an earthquake of Mw br The most catastrophic known earthquakes occurred in BCE and CE that is every ca years on average Destructive earthquakes leading to serious loss of life strike about every years While stringent construction regulations are in place and recently built structures are earthquake safe as of many public buildings as well as residential buildings did not meet the new standards and were expected to collapse if exposed to a strong earthquake br br br Climate br br Temperatures in Israel vary widely especially during the winter Coastal areas such as those of Tel Aviv and Haifa have a typical Mediterranean climate with cool rainy winters and long hot summers The area of Beersheba and the Northern Negev have a semi arid climate with hot summers cool winters and fewer rainy days The Southern Negev and the Arava areas have a desert climate with very hot dry summers and mild winters with few days of rain The highest temperature in the world outside Africa and North America as of C F was recorded in in the Tirat Zvi kibbutz in the northern Jordan River valley Mountainous regions can be windy and cold and areas at elevation of metres ft or more same elevation as Jerusalem usually receive at least one snowfall each year From May to September rain in Israel is rare br There are four different phytogeographic regions in Israel due to the country s location between the temperate and tropical zones For this reason the flora and fauna are extremely diverse There are known species of plants in Israel Of these at least species are introduced and non native There are Israeli nature reserves br With scarce water resources Israel has developed various water saving technologies including drip irrigation The considerable sunlight available for solar energy makes Israel the leading nation in solar energy use per capita practically every house uses solar panels for water heating The Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection has reported that climate change will have a decisive impact on all areas of life particularly for vulnerable populations br br br Government and politics br br Israel has a parliamentary system proportional representation and universal suffrage A member of parliament supported by a parliamentary majority becomes the prime minister usually this is the chair of the largest party The prime minister is the head of government and of cabinet The president is head of state with limited and largely ceremonial duties br Israel is governed by a member parliament known as the Knesset Membership of the Knesset is based on proportional representation of political parties with a electoral threshold which in practice has resulted in coalition governments Residents of Israeli settlements in the West Bank are eligible to vote and after the election of the members of the Knesset were settlers Parliamentary elections are scheduled every four years but unstable coalitions or a no confidence vote can dissolve a government earlier The first Arab led party was established in and as of Arab led parties hold about of seats The Basic Law The Knesset and its amendments prevent a party list from running for election to the Knesset if its objectives or actions include the negation of the existence of the State of Israel as the state of the Jewish people br The Basic Laws of Israel function as an uncodified constitution In its Basic Laws Israel defines itself as a Jewish and democratic state and the nation state of exclusively the Jewish people In the Knesset began to draft an official constitution based on these laws br Israel has no official religion but the definition of the state as Jewish and democratic creates a strong connection with Judaism On July the Knesset passed a Basic Law that characterizes the State of Israel as principally a Nation State of the Jewish People and Hebrew as its official language The bill ascribes an undefined special status to the Arabic language The same bill gives Jews a unique right to national self determination and views the developing of Jewish settlement in the country as a national interest empowering the government to take steps to encourage advance and implement this interest br br br Administrative divisions br br The State of Israel is divided into six main administrative districts known as mehozot Hebrew sg mahoz Center Haifa Jerusalem North South and Tel Aviv districts as well as the Judea and Samaria Area in the West Bank All of the Judea and Samaria Area and parts of the Jerusalem and Northern districts are not recognized internationally as part of Israel Districts are further divided into fifteen sub districts known as nafot Hebrew sg nafa which are themselves partitioned into fifty natural regions br br a Including Arabs and Jews in East Jerusalem as of br b Israeli citizens only br br br Israeli citizenship law br br The two primary pieces of legislation relating to Israeli citizenship are the Law of Return and Citizenship Law The law of return grants Jews the unrestricted right to immigrate to Israel and obtain Israeli citizenship Individuals born within the country receive birthright citizenship if at least one parent is a citizen br Israeli law defines Jewish nationality as distinct from Israeli nationality and the Supreme Court of Israel has ruled that an Israeli nationality does not exist Israeli law defines a Jewish national as any person practicing Judaism and their descendants Legislation has defined Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people since br br br Israeli occupied territories br br In as a result of the Six Day War Israel captured and occupied the West Bank including East Jerusalem the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights Israel also captured the Sinai Peninsula but returned it to Egypt as part of the Egypt Israel peace treaty Between and Israel occupied part of southern Lebanon in what was known as the Security Belt Since Israel s capture of these territories Israeli settlements and military installations have been built within each of them except Lebanon br The Golan Heights and East Jerusalem have been fully incorporated into Israel under Israeli law but not under international law Israel has applied civilian law to both areas and granted their inhabitants permanent residency status and the ability to apply for citizenship The UN Security Council has declared the annexation of the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem to be null and void and continues to view the territories as occupied The status of East Jerusalem in any future peace settlement has at times been a difficult issue in negotiations between Israeli governments and representatives of the Palestinians br br The West Bank excluding East Jerusalem is known in Israeli law as the Judea and Samaria Area The almost Israeli settlers residing in the area are considered part of Israel s population have Knesset representation are subject to a large part of Israel s civil and criminal laws and their output is considered part of Israel s economy The land itself is not considered part of Israel under Israeli law as Israel has consciously refrained from annexing the territory without ever relinquishing its legal claim to the land or defining a border Israeli political opposition to annexation is primarily due to the perceived demographic threat of incorporating the West Bank s Palestinian population into Israel Outside of
