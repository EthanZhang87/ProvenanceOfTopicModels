University was founded in by Leland and Jane Stanford dedicated to the memory of Leland Stanford Jr their only child The institution opened in on Stanford s previous Palo Alto farm The Stanfords modeled their university after the great Eastern universities specifically Cornell University in Ithaca New York Stanford was referred to as the Cornell of the West in due to a majority of its faculty being former Cornell affiliates including its first president David Starr Jordan and second president John Casper Branner Both Cornell and Stanford were among the first to make higher education accessible non sectarian and open to women as well as men Cornell is credited as one of the first American universities to adopt that radical departure from traditional education and Stanford became an early adopter as well br br From an architectural point of view the Stanfords wanted their university to look different and sought to emulate the style of English university buildings They specified in the founding grant that the buildings should be like the old adobe houses of the early Spanish days they will be one storied they will have deep window seats and open fireplaces and the roofs will be covered with the familiar dark red tiles The Stanfords also hired renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted who previously designed the Cornell campus to design the Stanford campus br br When Leland Stanford died in the continued existence of the university was in jeopardy due to a federal lawsuit against his estate but Jane Stanford insisted the university remain in operation throughout the financial crisis The university suffered major damage from the San Francisco earthquake most of the damage was repaired but a new library and gymnasium were demolished and some original features of Memorial Church and the Quad were never restored During the early th century the university added four professional graduate schools Stanford University School of Medicine was established in when the university acquired Cooper Medical College in San Francisco it moved to the Stanford campus in br The university s law department established as an undergraduate curriculum in was transitioned into a professional law school starting in and received accreditation from the American Bar Association in The Stanford University Graduate School of Education grew out of the Department of the History and Art of Education one of the original twenty one departments at Stanford and became a professional graduate school in The Stanford Graduate School of Business was founded in at the urging of then trustee Herbert Hoover In The Hoover Institution on War Revolution and Peace was started by Herbert Hoover to preserve artifacts related to World War I The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory established in performs research in particle physics br In the s and s Frederick Terman an engineering professor who later became provost encouraged Stanford engineering graduates to start their own companies and invent products During the s he established Stanford Industrial Park a high tech commercial campus on university land Also in the s William Shockley co inventor of the silicon transistor recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physics and later professor of physics at Stanford moved to the Palo Alto area and founded a company Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory The next year eight of his employees resigned and formed a competing company Fairchild Semiconductor The presence of so many high tech and semiconductor firms helped to establish Stanford and the mid Peninsula as a hotbed of innovation eventually named Silicon Valley after the key ingredient in transistors Shockley and Terman are both often described as the fathers of Silicon Valley br br In the s Stanford intentionally reduced and restricted Jewish admissions and for decades denied and dismissed claims from students parents and alumni that they were doing so Stanford issued its first institutional apology to the Jewish community in after an internal task force confirmed that the university deliberately discriminated against Jewish applicants while also misleading those who expressed concerns including students parents alumni and the ADL Stanford was once considered a school for the wealthy but controversies in later decades damaged its reputation The Stanford prison experiment was criticized as unethical and the misuse of government funds from resulted in severe penalties for the school s research funding and the resignation of President Donald Kennedy in br In the s Stanford rose from a regional university to one of the most prestigious in the United States when it appeared on lists of the top ten universities in America This swift rise to performance was
