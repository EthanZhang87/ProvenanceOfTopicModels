during the Great Depression whom they considered a mentor in forming the company In Packard and Hewlett began part time work in a rented garage with an initial capital investment of US equivalent to in In Hewlett and Packard decided to formalize their partnership They tossed a coin to decide whether the company they founded would be called Hewlett Packard HP or Packard Hewlett br Hewlett and Packard s first financially successful product was a precision audio oscillator known as the HP A which used a small incandescent light bulb known as a pilot light as a temperature dependent resistor in a critical portion of the circuit and a negative feedback loop to stabilize the amplitude of the output sinusoidal waveform This allowed the HP A to be sold for when competitors were selling less stable oscillators for over The series of generators continued production until at least as the AB still tube based but improved in design through the years br One of the company s earliest customers was Bud Hawkins chief sound engineer for Walt Disney Studios who bought eight HP B audio oscillators at each to be used in the animated film Fantasia HP s profit at the end of its first full year of business was equivalent to in on revenues of br In they built their first building at Page Mill Road and were awarded the Army Navy E Award in HP employed people and produced the audio oscillator a wave analyzer distortion analyzers an audio signal generator and the Model A vacuum tube voltmeter during the war br Hewlett and Packard worked on counter radar technology and artillery shell

established around developed semiconductor devices primarily for internal use HP Associates was co founded by another former Bell Labs researcher MOSFET inventor Mohamed Atalla who served as Director of Semiconductor Research Instruments and calculators were some of the products using semiconductor devices from HP Associates br During the s HP partnered with Sony and Yokogawa Electric in Japan to develop several high quality products The products were not a huge success as there were high costs involved in building HP looking products in Japan In HP and Yokogawa formed the joint venture Yokogawa Hewlett Packard to market HP products in Japan HP bought Yokogawa Electric s share of Hewlett Packard Japan in br HP spun off the small company Dynac to specialize in digital equipment The name was picked so that the HP logo could be turned upside down to be a reflected image of the logo of the new company Dynac was eventually renamed Dymec and folded back into HP in HP experimented with using Digital Equipment Corporation DEC minicomputers with its instruments but entered the computer market in with the HP HP series of minicomputers after it decided that it would be easier to build another small design team than deal with DEC The minicomputers had a simple accumulator based design with two accumulator registers and in the HP models two index registers The series was produced for years in spite of several attempts to replace it and was a forerunner of the HP and HP series of desktop and business computers br At the end of Packard handed over the duties of CEO to

a personal computer the Hewlett Packard A introduced in HP called it a desktop calculator because as Hewlett said If we had called it a computer it would have been rejected by our customers computer gurus because it didn t look like an IBM We therefore decided to call it a calculator and all such nonsense disappeared An engineering triumph at the time the logic circuit was produced without any integrated circuits and the CPU assembly was entirely executed in discrete components With CRT display magnetic card storage and printer the price was around The machine s keyboard was a cross between the keyboard of a scientific calculator and the keyboard of an adding machine There was no alphabetic keyboard br Apple co founder Steve Wozniak originally designed the Apple I computer while working at HP and offered it to them under their right of first refusal to his work They did not take it up as the company wanted to stay in scientific business and industrial markets Wozniak said that HP

Packard Interface Bus HPIB computer peripheral interface later cloned by National Instruments as GPIB and standardized by the IEEE as IEEE on their relay actuator products in HPIB was later integrated into most high end test measurement equipment it produced from onward br As early as HP began production of the HP x spectrum analyzers to complement its RF power meters and sensors capable of measuring signals in excess of GHz HP also produced configurable chassis based sweep generators capable of generating signals to GHz Other T M products of the time included lab grade multimeters microwave frequency counters RF amplifiers high accuracy microwave detectors lab grade power supplies and more These products were succeeded by modernized versions as well as the introduction of the scalar and vector network analyzer product lines prior to the business being spun off into Agilent Technologies br The HP series of technical desktop computers started in with the A The HP Series

disclosure related to the friendship Some observers have argued that Hurd was innocent but the board asked for his resignation to avoid negative public relations br Public analysis was divided between those who saw it as a commendable tough action by HP in handling expenses irregularities and those who saw it as an ill advised hasty and expensive reaction in ousting a remarkably capable leader who

reaction from Ellison who complained that Apotheker had been in charge of SAP when one of its subsidiaries was systematically stealing software from Oracle SAP accepted that its subsidiary which has now closed illegally accessed Oracle intellectual property Following Hurd s departure HP was seen to be problematic by the market with margins falling and having failed to redirect and establish itself in major new markets such as cloud and mobile services Apotheker s strategy was to broadly aim at disposing hardware and moving into the more profitable software services sector On August HP announced that it would strategically exit the smartphone and tablet computer business and focus on higher margin strategic priorities of Cloud solutions and software with an emphasis on enterprise commercial and government markets It also contemplated selling off its personal computer division or spinning it off into a separate company and quitting PC development while continuing to sell

initial one year warranty to replace the motherboards of selected models However this option was not extended to all models with the defective Nvidia chipsets despite research showing that these

paid billion for of the shares valuing Autonomy at around billion billion overall a premium of around over market price The deal was widely criticized as absurdly high a botched strategy shift and a chaotic attempt to rapidly reposition HP and enhance earnings and had been objected to even by HP s own CFO Within a year Apotheker was fired major culture clashes became apparent and HP wrote off billion of Autonomy s value br HP claimed that this resulted from accounting improprieties misrepresentations and disclosure failures by the previous management who in turn accused HP of a textbook example of defensive stalling to conceal evidence of its own prior knowledge gross mismanagement and undermining of the company noting public awareness since of its financial reporting issues and that
