CrypTool is an open source project br that is a free e learning software for illustrating cryptographic and cryptanalytic concepts br According to Hakin CrypTool is worldwide the most widespread e learning software in the field of cryptology br CrypTool implements more than algorithms br br br Development history and roadmap br The development of CrypTool started in Originally developed by German companies and universities it is an open source project since More than sixty people worldwide contribute regularly to the project Contributions as software plugins came from universities or schools in the following towns Belgrad Berlin Bochum Brisbane Darmstadt Dubai Duisburg Essen Eindhoven Hagenberg Jena Kassel Klagenfurt Koblenz London Madrid Mannheim San Jose Siegen Utrecht Warsaw br Currently versions of CrypTool are maintained and developed The CrypTool CT software is available in languages English German Polish Spanish Serbian and French CrypTool CT is available in languages English German Russian All others JCrypTool JCT and CrypTool Online CTO are available only in English and German br The goal of the CrypTool project is to make users aware of how cryptography can help against network security threats and to explain the underlying concepts of cryptology br CrypTool CT is written in C and designed for the Microsoft Windows operating system A port of CT to Linux with Qt was started but there is no progress anymore br In development began on two additional projects both based on a pure plugin architecture to serve as successors to the original CrypTool program Both successors regularly publish new stable versions br br CrypTool built with C NET WPF abbreviated CT br uses the concept of visual programming to clarify cryptographic processes Currently CT contains more than crypto functions br br JCrypTool built with Java Eclipse RCP SWT abbreviated JCT br runs on Windows macOS and Linux and offers both a document centric and a function centric perspective Currently JCT contains more than crypto functions One of its focal points are modern digital signatures like Merkle trees and SPHINCS br br br Awards br CrypTool has received several international awards as an educational program such as the TeleTrusT Special Award EISA IT Security Award NRW and Selected Landmark in the Land of Ideas award br br br Use br CrypTool is used in schools universities companies and agencies for education and awareness training br Worldwide the CrypTool packages are downloaded more than times per month from the CrypTool website Just over of the downloads are for the English version br br br CrypTool Online abbreviated CTO br The CrypTool project also includes the website CrypTool Online launched in This website allows users to try cryptographic methods directly within a browser on a PC or on a smartphone using JavaScript without the need to download and install software br This site aims to present the topic in an easy and attractive way for new users and young people Advanced tasks still require the offline versions of CrypTool br br br MysteryTwister MTC br In the international cipher contest MTC started as part of the CrypTool project br The contest currently offers more than challenges derived from old and modern ciphers and designed by more than different authors from different countries All challenges are presented in PDF templates in English and German The challenges are clustered in four levels of difficulty which range from simple riddles solvable with paper and pencil to mathematical challenges from modern cryptanalysis for researchers and experts Additionally a moderated forum user statistics and a hall of fame are available Currently more than registered users are engaged in solving these challenges br br br Merger with CrypTools br In early the CrypTool project decided to merge with a similar project of the same name CrypTools founded in in Australia by Luka Lafaye de Micheaux Arthur Guiot and Lucas Gruwez CrypTool much older and known thus completely absorbs the project under its name br br The first impact of this merger is the rebranding of the project A new logo a new website and the new CTO version are announced Currently it s still in development Another change was the targeted audience Previously CrypTool focused on university students and CrypTools on developers and young people It was therefore necessary to broaden the audience br On May in the midst of the COVID pandemic CrypTool announces the creation of tools to test Decentralized contact tracing protocols A new page is added to CTO with technical description of the algorithms involved in DP T and Exposure Notification In addition to this CrypTool also announced the implementation of a page dedicated to raising awareness of the cryptographic means related to privacy in these protocols called the Corona Tracing Animation The newer page stands out for its new design and its accessibility to ordinary users br br br See also br br Asymmetric key algorithm br Topics in cryptography br Cryptosystem br br br br br br External links br Official website br CrypTool Online br International Cipher Contest
