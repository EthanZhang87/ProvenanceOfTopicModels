It has a two way sliding mechanism which can be used to access either media playback buttons or a numeric keypad It was first released in silver and later on in black with limited edition quantities in gold and purple The launch price of the N was around about US br The N was a high end model that was marketed as a multimedia computer much like other Nseries devices It featured a then high megapixel resolution digital camera with Carl Zeiss optics and with a flash as well as a then large display measuring inches It was also Nokia s first device with a built in Global Positioning System GPS receiver used for maps or turn by turn navigation and their first with an accelerometer It was also one of the earliest devices in the market supporting HSDPA G signals br After the introduction of the original model technically named N several updated versions were released most notably the N GB with gigabytes of internal storage a larger display and improved battery The classic N and its upgraded variant N GB are widely considered as breakthrough devices at the time of their launch The N was well regarded for its camera GPS and mapping capabilities and its innovative dual slider form

considered to have been a turning point in the mobile industry due to its various capabilities however the device took a further six months until it was released On March Nokia was shipping N in key European Asian and Middle Eastern markets It was on sale in many more countries during the week of March The N was still only available in limited quantities at this early stage and therefore its price was briefly raised to euros br On April the N went on sale in the United States through Nokia s Flagship stores in New York and Chicago and through Nokia s nseries com website No US carriers were expected to offer this phone The U S version started retailing without carrier branding or discounts in Nokia s flagship stores in New York and Chicago on September br On August two updated versions of the N were announced at a press event in London first the N N GB an updated version for the European Asian markets with gigabytes of internal storage and larger screen secondly the N N NAM

Finally later on January Nokia introduced the N which is the US GB version of the N The phone got its FCC approval on January and launched March The first carrier to utilise this approval was Rogers Wireless in May Also at CES a red coloured limited edition Nokia N was announced and released that year br The N s main competitors during its lifetime were the LG Prada Apple s iPhone st generation Sony Ericsson s W i and K The N managed to outsell its rivals Despite Apple s much hyped iPhone with its multi touch technology thin design and advanced web capabilities the N had several key features against the iPhone such as its camera with flash video camera Bluetooth file sharing G and G connectivity GPS third party applications and several other features br Even after the release of later Nseries phones the N s retail price was still around US about as of early despite its three year old age br br br Features br br br Integrated GPS ability br The N contained an integrated GPS receiver

be played through the TV out feature TV out is a feature offered by the phones OMAP processor that allowed users to connect the smartphone using the supplied cable to a TV or any other composite video input Its main purpose was to allow users to show photos and videos on a large screen The N s built in UPnP and DLNA capabilities also allowed the user to share the phones media over a WLAN network This provides easy access to the photos music and videos stored on the phone from other UPnP DLNA capable devices on the network enabling them to be watched or downloaded over the air br br br

UMTS HSDPA or EDGE The webkit based browser displayed full web pages as opposed to simplified pages as on most other phones Web pages may be viewed in portrait or landscape mode and automatic zooming was supported The N also has built in Bluetooth and works with wireless earpieces that use Bluetooth technology and for file transfer br The original N did not support US based versions of UMTS HSDPA UMTS features in these versions of the phone are disabled by default Furthermore the later N US versions support only AT T s MHz UMTS HSDPA bands neither MHz of T Mobile USA nor MHz bands are supported internationally br The phone could also act as a WAN access point allowing a tethered PC access to a carrier s packet data network VoIP software and functionality is also included with the phone though some carriers have opted to remove this feature br br br Accelerometer br The N included a built in accelerometer This was originally only used for video stabilization and photo orientation to keep landscape or portrait shots oriented as taken br Nokia Research Center allowed an application interface directly to the accelerometer allowing software to use the data from it Nokia has released a step counter application to demonstrate this Another Nokia created application taking advantage of the accelerometer is Nokia Sports Tracker br Third party programs were created including software that will automatically change the screen orientation when the phone is tilted a program that simulates the sounds of a Star Wars lightsaber when the phone is waved through the air a program allowing the user to mute the phone by turning it face down etc br br br N Gage br The N was compatible with the N Gage mobile gaming service br br br Reception br The N was much talked about after announcement but was initially viewed as a niche feature packed device However it became a huge sales success for Nokia when released in most regions million Nokia N units were sold by the
