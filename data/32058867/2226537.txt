Brocade was an American technology company specializing in storage networking products now a subsidiary of Broadcom Inc The company is known for its Fibre Channel storage networking products and technology Prior to the acquisition the company expanded into adjacent markets including a wide range of IP Ethernet hardware and software products Offerings included routers and network switches for data center campus and carrier environments IP storage network fabrics Network Functions Virtualization NFV and software defined networking SDN markets such as a commercial edition of the OpenDaylight Project controller and network management software that spans physical and virtual devices br On November Singapore based chip maker Broadcom Limited announced it was buying Brocade for about billion As part of the acquisition Broadcom divested all of the IP networking hardware and software defined networking assets Broadcom has since re domesticated to the United States and is now known as Broadcom Inc br br br History br Brocade was founded in August by Seth Neiman a venture capitalist a former executive from Sun Microsystems and a professional auto racer Kumar Malavalli a co author of the Fibre Channel specification and Paul R Bonderson a former executive from Intel Corporation and Sun Neiman became the first CEO of the company Brocade was incorporated on May in Delaware br The company s first product SilkWorm which was a Fibre Channel switch was released in early br On May the company went public at a split adjusted price of On initial public offering IPO the company offered shares with an additional shares offered to the underwriters to cover over allotments The top three underwriters based on number of shares for Brocade s IPO were in order Morgan Stanley Dean Witter BT Alex Brown and Dain Rauscher Wessels br Brocade stock is traded in the National Market System of the NASDAQ GS stock market under the ticker symbol BRCD br The second generation of switches was announced in br On January Brocade named Lloyd Carney as new chief executive br On November Singapore based chip maker Broadcom Limited announced they were buying Brocade for billion As part of the announcement Broadcom said they would sell Brocade s networking business to avoid competing with its top customers such as Cisco Systems br On August Brocade announced that its SDN technology had been spun off as a new company called Lumina Networks This follows the sales of other divisions designed to allow the Broadcom acquisition to proceed including Ruckus Wireless Connectem vEPC Virtual ADC Vyatta vRouter and Brocade s data center networking business br Broadcom announced the acquisition of Brocade in Nov and it completed the acquisition in Nov for billion br br br Products br Brocade focuses on Fibre Channel and FICON storage area network SAN directors and switches SAN extension switches FCIP embedded switches for blade servers optical transceivers and SAN management software br Prior to the acquisition by Broadcom Brocade also provided ultra low latency data center switches Ethernet fabrics Federal and enterprise Ethernet LAN WLAN switches WAN Internet routers application delivery controllers load balancers embedded Ethernet switch blades Fibre Channel host bus adapters HBAs converged Fibre Channel Ethernet network adapters CNAs and Ethernet transceivers Other hardware from Brocade supports common protocols including iSCSI Gigabit Ethernet FCoE DCB CEE and Layer networking protocols br Brocade also previously sold software based networking devices including technology for SDN Network virtualization virtual routers virtual firewalls virtual Application Delivery Controllers load balancers network security appliances and VPNs through its wholly owned subsidiary Vyatta br br br Fibre Channel br Brocade s first Fibre Channel switch SilkWorm SW released in was based on the Stitch ASIC and their own VxWorks based firmware Fabric OS or FOS SilkWorm eventually came to be a long lived marketing designation for an entire line of products with the first product being retro named the SilkWorm SW to distinguish it from subsequent platforms Bruce Bergman was the CEO during most of this period Product names were generally puns on various kinds of woven fabric since a switched Fibre Channel network is also called a fabric br In Gregory Reyes joined the company as CEO In Brocade released the SilkWorm which was designated a director similarly to IBM ESCON directors already well established in the mainframe computer market The term director became universally used for more expensive FC switches br From to Brocade released switches based on its third generation ASIC BLOOM Big LOOM BLOOM introduced increased throughput of Gbit s instead of Gbit s Brocade integrated BLOOM into its first pure director the SilkWorm in April The director offered up to ports in two port pseudo switches domains The represented several internal architecture and technical changes besides the new ASIC it had an upgraded control processor architecture Intel i moved to PowerPC GP changed the embedded operating system FOS v migrated from Wind River Systems VxWorks to MontaVista Linux and introduced the backplane architecture hierarchical PCI buses with replaceable blades attached to a backplane The Bloom ASIC also introduced a notable capability of frame level Fibre Channel trunking which provided high throughput with load balancing across multiple cables It needed to be implemented in the ASIC hardware to ensure in order delivery of frames Also hot firmware upgrade was introduced with FOS v in October br At the time Brocade s main rival McDATA held over market share in director segment owing to a strong position first in the ESCON market and then in the FICON market The SilkWorm director gained over one third of the market share after its release in Brocade added mainframe customers with FICON and FICON CUP support on the SilkWorm br In the BLOOM II improved on the previous ASIC design by reducing its power consumption and die size while maintaining Gbit s technology It powered Brocade s second generation director the SilkWorm Still a port design it was the first one which could operate as a single port switch a single domain The new director also used approximately two thirds less power than its predecessor Brocade also introduced its first multiprotocol Fibre Channel router the SilkWorm Brocade also acquired Rhapsody Networks a SAN virtualization startup company This was also the time frame in which
