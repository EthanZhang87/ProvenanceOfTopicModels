A touchscreen or touch screen is a type of display that can detect touch input from a user It consists of both an input device a touch panel and an output device a visual display The touch panel is typically layered on the top of the electronic visual display of a device Touchscreens are commonly found in smartphones tablets laptops and other electronic devices br The display is often an LCD AMOLED or OLED display br A user can give input or control the information processing system through simple or multi touch gestures by touching the screen with a special stylus or one or more fingers Some touchscreens use ordinary or specially coated gloves to work while others may only work using a special stylus or pen The user can use the touchscreen to react to what is displayed and if the software allows to control how it is displayed for example zooming to increase the text size br A touchscreen enables the user to interact directly with what is displayed instead of using a mouse touchpad or other such devices other than a stylus which is optional for most modern touchscreens br Touchscreens are common in devices such as smartphones handheld game consoles and personal computers They are common in point of sale POS systems automated teller machines ATMs and electronic voting machines They can also be attached to computers or as terminals to networks They play a prominent role in the design of digital appliances such as personal digital assistants PDAs and some e readers Touchscreens are important in educational settings such as classrooms or on college campuses br The popularity of smartphones tablets and many types of information appliances has driven the demand and acceptance of common touchscreens for portable and functional electronics Touchscreens are found in the medical field heavy industry automated teller machines ATMs and kiosks such as museum displays or room automation where keyboard and mouse systems do not allow a suitably intuitive rapid or accurate interaction by the user with the display s content br Historically the touchscreen sensor and its accompanying controller based firmware have been made available by a wide array of after market system integrators and not by display chip or motherboard manufacturers Display manufacturers and chip manufacturers have acknowledged the trend toward acceptance of touchscreens as a user interface component and have begun to integrate touchscreens into the fundamental design of their products br br br History br br One predecessor of the modern touchscreen includes stylus based systems br DIRECT LIGHT PEN A patent was filed by Philco Company for a stylus designed for sports telecasting which when placed against an intermediate cathode ray tube display CRT would amplify and add to the original signal Effectively this was used for temporarily drawing arrows or circles onto a live television broadcast as described in US A Denk William E Electronic pointer for television images issued br OPTICAL The first version of a touchscreen which operated independently of the light produced from the screen was patented by AT T Corporation US A Harmon Leon D Electrographic transmitter issued This touchscreen utilized a matrix of collimated lights shining orthogonally across the touch surface When a beam is interrupted by a stylus the photodetectors which no longer are receiving a signal can be used to determine where the interruption is Later iterations of matrix based touchscreens built upon this by adding more emitters and detectors to improve resolution pulsing emitters to improve optical signal to noise ratio and a nonorthogonal matrix to remove shadow readings when using multi touch br INDIRECT LIGHT PEN Later inventions built upon this system to free telewriting styli from their mechanical bindings By transcribing what a user draws onto a computer it could be saved for future use See US A Graham Robert E Telewriting apparatus issued br CAPACITANCE AND RESISTANCE The first finger driven touchscreen was developed by Eric Johnson of the Royal Radar Establishment located in Malvern England who described his work on capacitive touchscreens in a short article published in and then more fully with photographs and diagrams in an article published in br MID s ULTRASONIC CURTAIN Another precursor of touchscreens an ultrasonic curtain based pointing device in front of a terminal display had been developed by a team around Rainer Mallebrein at Telefunken Konstanz for an air traffic control system In this evolved into a device named Touchinput Einrichtung touch input facility for the SIG terminal utilizing a conductively coated glass screen in front of the display This was patented in and the patent was granted a couple of years later The same team had already invented and marketed the Rollkugel mouse RKS for the SIG a couple of years earlier br CAPACITANCE The application of touch technology for air traffic control was described in an article published in Frank Beck and Bent Stumpe engineers from CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research developed a transparent touchscreen in the early s based on Stumpe s work at a television factory in the early s Then manufactured by CERN and shortly after by industry partners it was put to use in br OPTICAL A group at the University of Illinois filed for a patent on an optical touchscreen that became a standard part of the Magnavox Plato IV Student Terminal and thousands were built for this purpose These touchscreens had a crossed array of infrared position sensors each composed of an LED on one edge of the screen and a matched phototransistor on the other edge all mounted in front of a monochrome plasma display panel This arrangement could sense any fingertip sized opaque object in close proximity to the screen br MULTI TOUCH CAPACITANCE In Beck and Stumpe published another article describing their capacitive touchscreen This indicated that it was capable of multi touch but this feature was purposely inhibited presumably as this was not considered useful at the time A variable called BUT changes value from zero to five when a button is touched The touching of other buttons would give other non zero values of BUT but this is protected against by software Page section Actual contact between a finger and the capacitor is prevented by a thin sheet of plastic Page section At that time Projected capacitance had not yet been invented br RESISTIVE An American company Elographics in partnership with Siemens began work on developing a transparent implementation of an existing opaque touchpad technology U S patent No October which had been developed by Elographics founder George Samuel Hurst The resulting resistive technology touch screen was first shown on the World s Fair at Knoxville in br MULTI TOUCH CAMERA Multi touch technology began in when the University of Toronto s Input Research Group developed the first human input multi touch system using a frosted glass panel with a camera placed behind the glass br OPTICAL An optical touchscreen was used on the HP starting in The HP was one of the world s earliest commercial touchscreen computers HP mounted their infrared transmitters and receivers around the bezel of a inch Sony cathode ray tube CRT br MULTI TOUCH FORCE SENSING TOUCHSCREEN Bob Boie of AT T Bell Labs used capacitance to track the mechanical changes in thickness of a soft deformable overlay membrane when one or more physical objects interact with it the flexible surface being easily replaced if damaged by these objects The patent states the tactile sensor arrangements may be utilized as a touch screen br Many derivative sources retrospectively describe Boie as making a major advancement with his touchscreen technology but no evidence has been found that a rugged multi touch capacitive touchscreen that could sense through a rigid protective overlay the sort later required for a mobile phone was ever developed or patented by Boie Many of these citations rely on anecdotal evidence from Bill Buxton of Bell Labs However Bill Buxton did not have much luck getting his hands on this technology As he states in the citation Our assumption false as it turned out was that the Boie technology would become available to us in the near future Around I took a group from Xerox to see this technology it sic since I felt that it would be appropriate for the user interface of our large document processors This did not work out br UP TO CAPACITANCE Although as cited earlier Johnson is credited with developing the first finger operated capacitive and resistive touchscreens in these worked by directly touching wires across the front of the screen br Stumpe and Beck developed a self capacitance touchscreen in and a mutual capacitance touchscreen in Both these devices could only sense the finger by direct touch or through a thin insulating film This was microns thick according to Stumpe s report br br FIRST PROJECTED CAPACITANCE TOUCHSCREEN PATENT A capacitance keypad and touchscreen capable of multi touch that could project touch sensing through several centimeters of air and other non conductive materials was invented by a British inventor Ron Binstead This enabled the accurate detection of fingers through very thick glass and even double glazing see keypad for image The massively increased functionality was due to much greater processing power being available at that time and the use of a simple form of artificial intelligence see Patent Claim An Acorn BBC Computer was initially used to process the data This technique later became known as projected capacitance br Projected capacitance uses a simple form of artificial intelligence to measure the changes in capacitance caused by one or more fingers by specifically profiling the capacitance effects expected for finger touch and eliminating any measured capacitance changes attributable to other global and or local events br Instead of a keypad the device could be used as a continuous x y sensing area see Claim A transparent version was usable as a projected capacitance touchscreen see Claim but it was limited in size due to the high resistance of the narrow transparent Indium Tin Oxide tracks numbered in the image used to link all sensing zones independently to a common edge br TOUCHPAD Fujitsu released a touch pad for the Micro to accommodate the complexity of kanji characters which were stored as tiled graphics br GRAPHIC TABLET A graphic touch tablet was released for the Sega AI Computer br EARLY s EVALUATION FOR AIRCRAFT Touch sensitive control display units CDUs were evaluated for commercial aircraft flight decks in the early s Initial research showed that a touch interface would reduce pilot workload as the crew could then select waypoints functions and actions rather than be head down typing latitudes longitudes and waypoint codes on a keyboard An effective integration of this technology was aimed at helping flight crews maintain a high level of situational awareness of all major aspects of the vehicle operations including the flight path the functioning of various aircraft systems and moment to moment human interactions br EARLY s EVALUATATION FOR CARS also in the early s General Motors tasked its Delco Electronics division with a project aimed at replacing an automobile s non essential functions i e other than throttle transmission braking and steering from mechanical or electro mechanical systems with solid state alternatives wherever possible The finished device was dubbed the ECC for Electronic Control Center a digital computer and software control system hardwired to various peripheral sensors servos solenoids antenna and a monochrome CRT touchscreen that functioned both as display and sole method of input The ECC replaced the traditional mechanical stereo fan heater and air conditioner controls and displays and was capable of providing very detailed and specific information about the vehicle s cumulative and current operating status in real time The ECC was standard equipment on the Buick Riviera and later the Buick Reatta but was unpopular with consumers partly due to the technophobia of some traditional Buick customers but mostly because of costly technical problems suffered by the ECC s touchscreen which would render climate control or stereo operation impossible br GRAPHIC TABLET Sega released the Terebi Oekaki also known as the Sega Graphic Board for the SG video game console and SC home computer It consisted of a plastic pen and a plastic board with a transparent window where pen presses are detected It was used primarily with a drawing software application br MULTI TOUCH CAPACITANCE The University of Toronto group including Bill Buxton developed a multi touch tablet that used capacitance rather than bulky camera based optical sensing systems see History of multi touch br USED FOR POINT OF SALE The first commercially available graphical point of sale POS software was demonstrated on the bit Atari ST color computer It featured a color touchscreen widget driven interface The ViewTouch POS software was first shown by its developer Gene Mosher at the Atari Computer demonstration area of the Fall COMDEX expo in br br FIRST LARGE PROJECTED CAPACITANCE TOUCHSCREEN INVENTED A large projected capacitance touchscreen was invented by British inventor Ron Binstead This sensed fingers through very thick glass and double glazing enabling touchscreens to be operated through shop windows touch sensing zones were connected directly to the four edges of the touchscreen see inset image thereby avoiding the necessity for narrow tracks linking sensing zones to the edge An order was placed for M worth of these touchscreens for use in a US hotel chain br CAPACITANCE TOUCH KEYS Casio launched the Casio PB pocket computer with a touchscreen consisting of a matrix resulting in touch areas in its small LCD graphic screen br SELECT ON LIFT OFF Touchscreens had a bad reputation of being imprecise until Most user interface books would state that touchscreen selections were limited to targets larger than the average finger At the time selections were done in such a way that a target was selected as soon as the finger came over it and the corresponding action was performed immediately Errors were common due to parallax or calibration problems leading to user frustration Lift off strategy was introduced by researchers at the University of Maryland Human Computer Interaction Lab HCIL As users touch the screen feedback is provided as to what will be selected users can adjust the position of the finger and the action takes place only when the finger is lifted off the screen This allowed the selection of small targets down to a single pixel on a Video Graphics Array VGA screen a standard of that time br SINGLE AND MULTI TOUCH GESTURES Sears et al gave a review of academic research on single and multi touch human computer interaction of the time describing gestures such as rotating knobs adjusting sliders and swiping the screen to activate a switch or a U shaped gesture for a toggle switch The HCIL team developed and studied small touchscreen keyboards including a study that showed users could type at wpm on a touchscreen keyboard aiding their introduction on mobile devices They also designed and implemented multi touch gestures such as selecting a range of a line connecting objects and a tap click gesture to select while maintaining location with another finger br TOUCHSCREEN SLIDER AND TOGGLE SWITCHES HCIL demonstrated a touchscreen slider which was later cited as prior art in the lock screen patent litigation between Apple and other touchscreen mobile phone vendors in relation to U S patent br THE FIRST PROJECTED CAPACITANCE PATENT IS GRANTED The projected capacitance patent application is granted to Binstead Designs of Nottingham England br INERTIAL CONTROL From to the Sun Star prototype PDA implemented a touchscreen with inertial scrolling br CAPACITANCE MOUSE KEYPAD Bob Boie of AT T Bell Labs patented a simple mouse or keypad that capacitively sensed just one finger through a thin insulator Although not claimed or even mentioned in the patent this technology could potentially have been used as a capacitance touchscreen br FIRST RESISTIVE TOUCHSCREEN PHONE IBM released the IBM Simon which is the first touchscreen phone br EARLY s ABANDONED GAME CONTROLLER An early attempt at a handheld game console with touchscreen controls was Sega s intended successor to the Game Gear though the device was ultimately shelved and never released due to the expensive cost of touchscreen technology in the early s br br FIRST X Y PROJECTED CAPACITANCE TOUCHSCREEN PATENT An x y multiplexed projected capacitance multiple input proximity detector and touchpad touchscreen was invented by British inventor Ron Binstead This was capable of multi touch and could accurately and reliably sense fingers through thick plastic and glass overlays Together with the inventors earlier patent this was very similar to an Apple patent taken out years later in br br FIRST WIRE BASED PROJECTED CAPACITANCE Stumpe and Beck s touchscreens already cited used opaque conductive copper tracks that obscured about of the screen micron track micron space The advent of projected capacitance in however with its improved sensing capability indicated that most of these tracks could be eliminated This proved to be so and led to the invention of a wire based touchscreen in where one micron diameter insulation coated wire replaced about of these micron wide tracks and could also accurately sense fingers through thick glass Screen masking caused by the copper was reduced from to less than br The use of fine wire meant that very large touchscreens several meters wide could be plotted onto a thin polyester support film with a simple x y pen plotter eliminating the need for expensive and complicated sputter coating laser ablation screen printing or etching The resulting incredibly flexible touchscreen film less than microns thick could be attached by static or non setting weak adhesive to one side of a sheet of glass for sensing through that glass Early versions of this device were controlled by the PIC C microchip br FIRST PUB GAME WITH TOUCHSCREEN Appearing in pubs in JPM s Monopoly SWP skill with prizes was the first machine to use touch screen technology instead of buttons see Quiz machine History It used a inch version of this newly invented wire based projected capacitance touchscreen and had sensing areas the wiring pattern being similar to that shown in the lower diagram The zig zag pattern was introduced to minimize visual reflections and prevent Moire interference between the wires and the monitor line scans About of these were sold for this purpose retailing at apiece which was very cheap for the time Working through very thick glass made it ideal for operation in a hostile environment such as a pub Although reflected light from the copper wires was noticeable under certain lighting conditions this problem was eliminated by using tinted glass The reflection issue was later resolved by using finer micron diameter dark coated wires Throughout the following decade JPM continued to use touchscreens for many other games such as Cluedo and Who wants to be a Millionaire br PROJECTED CAPACITANCE LICENSES This technology was licensed four years later to Romag Glass Products later to become Zytronic Displays and Visual Planet in see page br MOBILE MULTI TOUCH PROJECTED CAPACITANCE PATENT Apple patents its multi touch capacitive touchscreen for mobile devices br VIDEO GAMES WITH TOUCHSCREENS Touchscreens were not be popularly used for video games until the release of the Nintendo DS in br MOBILE PHONE WITH CAPACITANCE The first mobile phone with a capacitive touchscreen was LG Prada released in May which was before the first iPhone released By touchscreen enabled mobile phones were becoming trendy and quickly gaining popularity in both basic and advanced devices In Quarter for the first time a majority of smartphones i e not all mobile phones shipped with touchscreens over non touch br RESISTIVE VERSUS PROJECTED CAPACITANCE SALES In of touchscreens shipped were resistive and only were projected capacitance In of touchscreens shipped were resistive and were projected capacitance see page br FORCE SENSING TOUCHSCREENS Until recently most consumer touchscreens could only sense one point of contact at a time and few have had the capability to sense how hard one is touching This has changed with the commercialization of multi touch technology and the Apple Watch being released with a force sensitive display in April br br FIRST DIAGONALLY WIRED TOUCHSCREEN PATENT A new diagonal wiring arrangement was invented by British inventor Ron Binstead for use with resistive and multi touch projected capacitance touchscreens all the I O elements coming from just one edge and no bussed wires or dead zone round the other three edges see top image on right Touch resolution is almost doubled compared to x y multiplexing For example x y I Os create a maximum of sensing element intersections whereas diagonal I Os create intersections br BISTATE PROJECTED CAPACITANCE When used as a Projected Capacitance touchscreen in mutual capacitance mode diagonal wiring requires each I O line to be capable of switching between two states bistate an output some of the time and an input at other times I Os are inputs most of the time but once every scan one of the I Os has to take its turn at being an output the remaining input I Os sensing any signals it generates The I O lines therefore may have to change from input to output and vice versa many times a second br This new design won an Electronics Weekly Elektra Award in br FIRST INFINITELY WIDE TOUCHSCREEN PATENT With standard x y array touchscreens the length of the horizontal sensing elements increases as the width of the touchscreen increases Eventually a limit is hit where the resistance gets so great that the touchscreen can no longer function properly br The patent describes how the use of diagonal elements ensures that the length of any element never exceeds times the height br br br br br br br H br br br br br br br br br br br textstyle left lceil H sqrt right rfloor br br of the touchscreen no matter how wide it is This could be reduced to times the height if opposing diagonal elements intersect at degrees instead of degrees The elongated touchscreen could be controlled by a single processor or the distant ends could be controlled totally independently by different processors linked by a synchronizing processor in the overlapping middle section The number of unique intersections could be increased by allowing individual sensing elements to run in two opposing directions as shown in the diagram br br br Technologies br br There are a number of touchscreen technologies with different methods of sensing touch br br br Resistive br br A resistive touchscreen panel comprises several thin layers the most important of which are two transparent electrically resistive layers facing each other with a thin gap between The top layer that which is touched has a coating on the underside surface just beneath it is a similar resistive layer on top of its substrate One layer has conductive connections along its sides the other along top and bottom A voltage is applied to one layer and sensed by the other When an object such as a fingertip or stylus tip presses down onto the outer surface the two layers touch to become connected at that point The panel then behaves as a pair of voltage dividers one axis at a time By rapidly switching between each layer the position of pressure on the screen can be detected br Resistive touch is used in restaurants factories and hospitals due to its high tolerance for liquids and contaminants A major benefit of resistive touch technology is its low cost Additionally as only sufficient pressure is necessary for the touch to be sensed they may be used with gloves on or by using anything rigid as a finger substitute Disadvantages include the need to press down and a risk of damage by sharp objects Resistive touchscreens also suffer from poorer contrast due to having additional reflections i e glare from the layers of material placed over the screen This type of touchscreen has been used by Nintendo in the DS family the DS family and the Wii U GamePad br br Due to their simple structure with very few inputs resistive touchscreens are mainly used for single touch operation although some two touch versions often described as multi touch are available There are however some true multi touch resistive touchscreens available These need many more inputs and rely on x y multiplexing to keep the I O count down br One example of a true multi touch resistive touchscreen can detect fingers at the same time This has I O connections These are possibly split x inputs y outputs forming a standard aspect ratio touchscreen with x y intersecting touch sensing nodes br Tri state multiplexing could have been used instead of x y multiplexing This would have reduced the I O count from to while creating unique touch sensing nodes with no need for a bezel and with all inputs coming from just one edge br br br Surface acoustic wave br br Surface acoustic wave SAW technology uses ultrasonic waves that pass over the touchscreen panel When the panel is touched a portion of the wave is absorbed The change in ultrasonic waves is processed by the controller to determine the position of the touch event Surface acoustic wave touchscreen panels can be damaged by outside elements Contaminants on the surface can also interfere with the functionality of the touchscreen br SAW devices have a wide range of applications including delay lines filters correlators and DC to DC converters br br br Capacitive touchscreen br br A capacitive touchscreen panel consists of an insulator such as glass coated with a transparent conductor such as indium tin oxide ITO As the human body is also an electrical conductor touching the surface of the screen results in a distortion of the screen s electrostatic field measurable as a change in capacitance Different technologies may be used to determine the location of the touch The location is then sent to the controller for processing Some touchscreens use silver instead of ITO as ITO causes several environmental problems due to the use of indium The controller is typically a complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS application specific integrated circuit ASIC chip which in turn usually sends the signals to a CMOS digital signal processor DSP for processing br Unlike a resistive touchscreen some capacitive touchscreens cannot be used to detect a finger through electrically insulating material such as gloves This disadvantage especially affects usability in consumer electronics such as touch tablet PCs and capacitive smartphones in cold weather when people may be wearing gloves It can be overcome with a special capacitive stylus or a special application glove with an embroidered patch of conductive thread allowing electrical contact with the user s fingertip br A low quality switching mode power supply unit with an accordingly unstable noisy voltage may temporarily interfere with the precision accuracy and sensitivity of capacitive touch screens br Some capacitive display manufacturers continue to develop thinner and more accurate touchscreens Those for mobile devices are now being produced with in cell technology such as in Samsung s Super AMOLED screens that eliminates a layer by building the capacitors inside the display itself This type of touchscreen reduces the visible distance between the user s finger and what the user is touching on the screen reducing the thickness and weight of the display which is desirable in smartphones br A simple parallel plate capacitor has two conductors separated by a dielectric layer Most of the energy in this system is concentrated directly between the plates Some of the energy spills over into the area outside the plates and the electric field lines associated with this effect are called fringing fields Part of the challenge of making a practical capacitive sensor is to design a set of printed circuit traces which direct fringing fields into an active sensing area accessible to a user A parallel plate capacitor is not a good choice for such a sensor pattern Placing a finger near fringing electric fields adds conductive surface area to the capacitive system The additional charge storage capacity added by the finger is known as finger capacitance or CF The capacitance of the sensor without a finger present is known as parasitic capacitance or CP br br br Surface capacitance br In this basic technology only one side of the insulator is coated with a conductive layer A small voltage is applied to the layer resulting in a uniform electrostatic field When a conductor such as a human finger touches the uncoated surface a capacitor is dynamically formed The sensor s controller can determine the location of the touch indirectly from the change in the capacitance as measured from the four corners of the panel As it has no moving parts it is moderately durable but has limited resolution is prone to false signals from parasitic capacitive coupling and needs calibration during manufacture It is therefore most often used in simple applications such as industrial controls and kiosks br Although some standard capacitance detection methods are projective in the sense that they can be used to detect a finger through a non conductive surface they are very sensitive to fluctuations in temperature which expand or contract the sensing plates causing fluctuations in the capacitance of these plates These fluctuations result in a lot of background noise so a strong finger signal is required for accurate detection This limits applications to those where the finger directly touches the sensing element or is sensed through a relatively thin non conductive surface br br br Projected capacitance br br Projected capacitive touch PCT also PCAP technology is a variant of capacitive touch technology but where sensitivity to touch accuracy resolution and speed of touch have been greatly improved by the use of a simple form of artificial intelligence This intelligent processing enables finger sensing to be projected accurately and reliably through very thick glass and even double glazing br Projected capacitance is a method for accurately detecting and tracking a particular variable or group of variables such as finger s by a using a simple form of artificial intelligence to develop a profile of the capacitance changing effects expected for that variable b specifically looking for such changes and c eliminating measured capacitance changes that do not match this profile attributable to global variables such as temperature humidity dirt build up electrical noise and local variables such as rain drops partial shade and hands elbows Capacitance sensors may be discrete possibly but not necessarily in a regular array or they may be multiplexed br Assumptions br In practice various assumptions are made such as a fingers will not be touching the screen at power up b a finger will not be on the same spot for more than a fixed period of time and c fingers will not be touching everywhere at the same time br a If a finger IS touching the screen at power up then as soon as it is removed a large anti touch capacitance change will be detected This signals to the processor to reset the touch thresholds and store new no touch values for each input br b Long term drift compensation is used to gradually raise or lower these thresholds trending eventually to no touch This compensates for global changes in temperature and humidity It also eliminates the possibility of any position appearing to be touched for too long due to some non finger event This might be caused for example by a wet leaf landing on and sticking to the screen br c When a decision is to be made about the validity of one or more touches then assumption c means that the average value of changes measured for some of the inputs with the smallest change can be used to offset the touch thresholds of the inputs in contention This minimizes the influence of hands and arms br By these and other means the processor is constantly fine tuning the touch thresholds and tweaking the touch sensitivity of each input This enables very small changes caused only by fingers to be accurately detected through thick overlays or several centimeters of air br When a conductive object such as a finger comes into contact with a PCT panel it distorts the local electrostatic field at that point This is measurable as a change in capacitance If a finger bridges the gap between two of the tracks the charge field is further interrupted and detected by the controller The capacitance can be changed and measured at every individual point on the grid This system is able to accurately track touches br Due to the top layer of a PCT being glass it is sturdier than less expensive resistive touch technology br Unlike traditional capacitive touch technology it is possible for a PCT system to sense a passive stylus or gloved fingers br Moisture on the surface of the panel high humidity or collected dust are not a problem especially with fine wire based touchscreens due to the fact that wire based touchscreens have a very low parasitic capacitance and there is a greater distance between neighboring conductors Projected capacitance has long term drift compensation built in This minimizes the effects of slowly changing environmental factors such as the build up of dirt and effects caused by changes in the weather Drops of rain have little effect but flowing water and especially flowing sea water due to its electrical conductivity can cause short term issues br A high frequency RF signal possibly from kHz to MHz is imposed on one track at a time and appropriate capacitance measurements are taken as described later in this article This process is repeated until all the tracks have been sampled br Conductive tracks are often transparent one example being Indium tin oxide ITO a transparent electrical conductor but these conductive tracks can be made of very fine non transparent metal mesh or individual fine wires br br br Projected capacitance touchscreen layout br br Layout can vary depending on whether a single finger is to be detected or multiple fingers br In order to detect many fingers at the same time some modern PCT touch screens are composed of thousands of discrete keys each key being linked individually to the edge of the touch screen This is enabled by etching an electrode grid pattern in a transparent conductive coating on one side of a sheet of glass or plastic br To reduce the number of input tracks most PCT touch screens use multiplexing This enables for example n discrete key inputs to be reduced to br br br br br br br br br br n br br br br br br br br textstyle left lceil sqrt n right rfloor br br when using x y multiplexing or br br br br br br br br br br n br br br br br br br br textstyle left lceil sqrt n right rfloor br br if using bistate multiplexing or tri state multiplexing br Capacitance multiplexing requires a grid of intersecting but electrically isolated conductive tracks This can be achieved in many different ways One way is by creating parallel conductive tracks on one side of a plastic film and similar parallel tracks on the other side orientated at degrees to the first side br Another way is to etch tracks on separate sheets of glass and join these sheets with tracks at right angles to each other face to face using a thin non conductive adhesive interlayer br A simple alternative is to embed an x y or diagonal grid of very fine insulation coated conductive wires in a thin polyester film This film can then be attached to one side of a sheet of glass for operation through the glass br Touch resolution and the number of fingers that can be detected simultaneously is determined by the number of cross over points x y If x y n then the maximum possible number of cross overs is n However the number of cross over points can be almost doubled by using a diagonal lattice layout see Lattice diagonal touchscreen diagrams where instead of x elements only ever crossing y elements each conductive element crosses every other element Under these circumstances the maximum number of cross overs is n n All the connector inputs come from just one edge br See video above of raw data from input diagonally wired touchscreen br br br Diagonal touchscreen arrays br br In a new diagonal array suited to a range of touchscreen and keypad technologies was invented and patented by Ron Binstead of Binstead Designs Ltd br The diagram left shows how a group of parallel conductive elements folded back on themselves at right angles can create a triangular array of unique intersections An x y array with conductive elements would only have created a maximum of unique intersections br Although conductive elements are normally connected to a terminal at one end of the conductor the left diagram shows that these folded elements can be terminated at the fold thereby forming split or bifurcated elements br A square rectangular diagonal array can be formed by double folding the parallel conductors see diagram on the right Two connectors could be fitted at the folds on opposite sides of the array Alternatively a single connector can be fitted at one end of the array as shown in the diagram br Cylindrical touchscreens br br Diagonal sensing elements can also be formed into a seamless cylindrical array The diagram on the right shows a split I O bi state cylindrical layout with unique intersections all the I O lines connected to one end of the cylinder a standard x y array would require horizontal I O lines entering the side of the cylinder Unsplit diagonal sensing elements can also be formed into cylinders but I Os would only create x unique intersections These cylinders can be physically transformed into complex dimensional shapes by a range of different methods such as blow molding vacuum forming etc br A similar layout is possible for a complementary cylindrical LED display see Charlieplexing Diagonal arrays br Infinitely wide touchscreens br br Touchscreen width is normally restricted by the resistance of the conductive material used As the width of an x y touchscreen is increased eventually the resistance of the horizontal conductors becomes too great for the touchscreen to work properly br Infinitely wide touchscreens are possible however when using diagonal wiring because track lengths are always x the height of the touchscreen br br br br br br br H br br br br br br br br br br br textstyle left lceil H sqrt right rfloor br br and are independent of touchscreen width see diagram on right br There are two types of PCT mutual capacitance and self capacitance br br br Mutual capacitance br An electrical signal imposed on one electrical conductor can be capacitively sensed by another electrical conductor that is in very close proximity but electrically isolated a feature that is exploited in mutual capacitance touchscreens In a mutual capacitive sensor array the mutual crossing of one electrical conductor with another electrical conductor but with no direct electrical contact forms a capacitor see touchscreen Construction br High frequency voltage pulses are applied to these conductors one at a time These pulses capacitively couple to every conductor that intersects it br Bringing a finger or conductive stylus close to the surface of the sensor changes the local electrostatic field which in turn reduces the capacitance between these intersecting conductors Any significant change in the strength of the signal sensed is used to determine if a finger is present or not at an intersection br The capacitance change at every intersection on the grid can be measured to accurately determine one or more touch locations br Mutual capacitance allows multi touch operation where multiple fingers palms or styli can be accurately tracked at the same time The greater the number of intersections the better the touch resolution and the more independent fingers that can be detected br This indicates a distinct advantage of diagonal wiring over standard x y wiring since diagonal wiring creates nearly twice the number of intersections br br A i o x y array for example would have of these intersections capacitors and a i o diagonal lattice array could have intersections br Each trace of an x y mutual capacitance array only has one function it is either an input or an output The horizontal traces may be transmitters while the vertical traces are sensors or vice versa br The traces in a diagonal mutual capacitance array however have to continuously change their functionality on the fly by a process called bi state multiplexing or Tri state multiplexing Some of the time a trace will be an output at another time it will be an input or grounded A look up table can be used to simplify this process By slightly distorting the conductors in a n I O diagonal matrix the equivalent of a n by n array is formed After address decoding this can then be processed as a standard x y array br br br Self capacitance br Self capacitance sensors can have the same X Y or diagonal grid layout as mutual capacitance sensors but with self capacitance all the traces usually operate independently with no interaction between different traces Along with several other methods the extra capacitive load of a finger on a trace electrode may be measured by a current meter or by the change in frequency of an RC oscillator br Traces are sensed one after the other until all the traces have been sensed A finger may be detected anywhere along the whole length of a trace even off screen but there is no indication where the finger is along that trace If however a finger is also detected along another intersecting trace then it is assumed that the finger position is at the intersection of the two traces This allows for the speedy and accurate detection of a single finger br There is however ambiguity if more than one finger is to be detected Two fingers may have four possible detection positions only two of which are true the other two being ghosts However by selectively de sensitizing any touch points in contention conflicting results are easily resolved This enables self capacitance to be used for two touch operation br Although mutual capacitance is simpler for multi touch multi touch can be achieved using self capacitance br br If the trace being sensed is intersected by another trace that has a desensitizing signal on it then that intersection is insensitive to touch By imposing such a desensitizing signal on all the intersecting traces except one along the trace being sensed then just a short length of that trace will be sensitive to touch By selecting a sequence of these sensing sections along the trace it is possible to determine the accurate position of multiple fingers along the one trace This process can then be repeated for all the other traces until the whole screen has been scanned br Self capacitive touch screen layers are used on mobile phones such as the Sony Xperia Sola the Samsung Galaxy S Galaxy Note Galaxy S and Galaxy Alpha br Self capacitance is far more sensitive than mutual capacitance and is mainly used for single touch simple gesturing and proximity sensing where the finger does not even have to touch the glass surface Mutual capacitance is mainly used for multitouch applications Many touchscreen manufacturers use both self and mutual capacitance technologies in the same product thereby combining their individual benefits br br br Self capacitance vs mutual capacitance br br When using a x X Y array to determine the position of a single finger by self capacitance i e capacitance measurements are required The finger being determined to be at the intersection of the strongest of the x measurements and the strongest of the y measurements However when using mutual capacitance every intersection may have to be measured making a total of i e x capacitance measurements In this example therefore mutual capacitance requires nearly times as many measurements as self capacitance to detect the position of a finger br Many applications such as selecting items from a list or menu require just one finger and self capacitance is eminently suitable for such applications due to the relatively low processing load simpler processing method the ability to sense through thick dielectric materials or air and the possibility of reducing the number of inputs required through repeat track layouts br For many other applications however such as for expanding contracting items on the screen and for other gestures two or more fingers need to be tracked br Two fingers can be detected and tracked accurately using self capacitance but this does involve a few extra calculations and extra capacitance measurements to eliminate the ghost positions One method is to undertake a full self capacitance scan to detect the ambiguous finger positions then use just targeted mutual capacitance measurements to discover which two of the positions are valid and which are not This gives a total of measurements still far less than the required when using mutual capacitance alone br With fingers disambiguations are required with fingers disambiguations etc br With more fingers it may be decided that the process of disambiguation is too unwieldy If sufficient processing power is available the switch can then be made to full mutual capacitance scanning br br br Use of stylus on capacitive screens br Capacitive touchscreens do not necessarily need to be operated by a finger but until recently the special styli required could be quite expensive to purchase The cost of this technology has fallen greatly in recent years and capacitive styli are now widely available for a nominal charge and often given away free with mobile accessories These consist of an electrically conductive shaft with a soft conductive rubber tip thereby resistively connecting the fingers to the tip of the stylus br br br Infrared grid br br An infrared touchscreen uses an array of X Y infrared LED and photodetector pairs around the edges of the screen to detect a disruption in the pattern of LED beams These LED beams cross each other in vertical and horizontal patterns This helps the sensors pick up the exact location of the touch A major benefit of such a system is that it can detect essentially any opaque object including a finger gloved finger stylus or pen It is generally used in outdoor applications and POS systems that cannot rely on a conductor such as a bare finger to activate the touchscreen Unlike capacitive touchscreens infrared touchscreens do not require any patterning on the glass which increases durability and optical clarity of the overall system Infrared touchscreens are sensitive to dirt and dust that can interfere with the infrared beams and suffer from parallax in curved surfaces and accidental press when the user hovers a finger over the screen while searching for the item to be selected br br br Infrared acrylic projection br A translucent acrylic sheet is used as a rear projection screen to display information The edges of the acrylic sheet are illuminated by infrared LEDs and infrared cameras are focused on the back of the sheet Objects placed on the sheet are detectable by the cameras When the sheet is touched by the user frustrated total internal reflection results in leakage of infrared light which peaks at the points of maximum pressure indicating the user s touch location Microsoft s PixelSense tablets use this technology br br br Optical imaging br Optical touchscreens are a relatively modern development in touchscreen technology in which two or more image sensors such as CMOS sensors are placed around the edges mostly the corners of the screen Infrared backlights are placed in the sensor s field of view on the opposite side of the screen A touch blocks some lights from the sensors and the location and size of the touching object can be calculated see visual hull This technology is growing in popularity due to its scalability versatility and affordability for larger touchscreens br br br Dispersive signal technology br Introduced in by M this system detects a touch by using sensors to measure the piezoelectricity in the glass Complex algorithms interpret this information and provide the actual location of the touch The technology is unaffected by dust and other outside elements including scratches Since there is no need for additional elements on screen it also claims to provide excellent optical clarity Any object can be used to generate touch events including gloved fingers A downside is that after the initial touch the system cannot detect a motionless finger However for the same reason resting objects do not disrupt touch recognition br br br Acoustic pulse recognition br The key to this technology is that a touch at any one position on the surface generates a sound wave in the substrate which then produces a unique combined signal as measured by three or more tiny transducers attached to the edges of the touchscreen The digitized signal is compared to a list corresponding to every position on the surface determining the touch location A moving touch is tracked by rapid repetition of this process Extraneous and ambient sounds are ignored since they do not match any stored sound profile The technology differs from other sound based technologies by using a simple look up method rather than expensive signal processing hardware As with the dispersive signal technology system a motionless finger cannot be detected after the initial touch However for the same reason the touch recognition is not disrupted by any resting objects The technology was created by SoundTouch Ltd in the early s as described by the patent family EP and introduced to the market by Tyco International s Elo division in as Acoustic Pulse Recognition The touchscreen used by Elo is made of ordinary glass giving good durability and optical clarity The technology usually retains accuracy with scratches and dust on the screen The technology is also well suited to displays that are physically larger br br br Construction br There are several principal ways to build a touchscreen The key goals are to recognize one or more fingers touching a display to interpret the command that this represents and to communicate the command to the appropriate application br Multi touch projected capacitance screens br br A very simple low cost way to make a multi touch projected capacitance touchscreen is to sandwich an x y or diagonal matrix of fine insulation coated copper or tungsten wires between two layers of clear polyester film This creates an array of proximity sensing micro capacitors One of these micro capacitors every to mm is probably sufficient spacing if fingers are relatively widely spaced apart but very high discrimination multi touch may need a micro capacitor every or mm A similar system can be used for ultra high resolution sensing such as fingerprint sensing Fingerprint sensors require a micro capacitor spacing of about to microns br The touchscreens can be manufactured at home using readily available tools and materials or it can be done industrially br First a continuous trace wiring pattern is generated using a simple CAD system br The wire is threaded through a plotter pen and plotted directly as one continuous wire onto a thin sheet of adhesive coated clear polyester film such as window film using a standard low cost x y pen plotter After plotting the single wire is gently cut into individual sections with a sharp scalpel taking care not to damage the film br A second identical polyester film is laminated over the first film The resulting touchscreen film is then trimmed to shape and a connector is retro fitted br The end product is extremely flexible being about microns thick about the thickness of a human hair It can even be creased without loss of functionality br br The film can be mounted on or behind non conducting or slightly conducting surfaces Usually it is mounted behind a sheet of glass up to mm thick or more for sensing through the glass br This method is suitable for a wide range of touchscreen sizes from very small to several meters wide or even wider if using a diagonally wired matrix br The end product is environmentally friendly as it uses recyclable polyester and minute quantities of copper wire The film could even have a second life as another product such as drawing film or wrapping film Unlike some other touchscreen technologies no complex processes or rare materials are used br For non touchscreen applications other plastics e g vinyl or ABS may be used The film can be blow molded or heat formed into complex three dimensional shapes such as bottles globes or car dashboards Alternatively the wires can be embedded in thick plastic such as fiber glass or carbon fiber body panels br Single touch resistive touchscreens br In the resistive approach which used to be the most popular technique there are typically four layers br br Top polyester coated layer with a transparent metallic conductive coating on the bottom br Adhesive spacer br Glass layer coated with a transparent metallic conductive coating on the top br Adhesive layer on the backside of the glass for mounting br When a user touches the surface the system records the change in the electric current that flows through the display br Dispersive signal br Dispersive signal technology measures the piezoelectric effect the voltage generated when mechanical force is applied to a material that occurs chemically when a strengthened glass substrate is touched br Infrared br There are two infrared based approaches In one an array of sensors detects a finger touching or almost touching the display thereby interrupting infrared light beams projected over the screen In the other bottom mounted infrared cameras record heat from screen touches br In each case the system determines the intended command based on the controls showing on the screen at the time and the location of the touch br br br Development br The development of multi touch screens facilitated the tracking of more than one finger on the screen thus operations that require more than one finger are possible These devices also allow multiple users to interact with the touchscreen simultaneously br With the growing use of touchscreens the cost of touchscreen technology is routinely absorbed into the products that incorporate it and is nearly eliminated Touchscreen technology has demonstrated reliability and is found in airplanes automobiles gaming consoles machine control systems appliances and handheld display devices including cellphones the touchscreen market for mobile devices was projected to produce US billion by br The ability to accurately point on the screen itself is also advancing with the emerging graphics tablet screen hybrids Polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF plays a major role in this innovation due its high piezoelectric properties which allow the tablet to sense pressure making such things as digital painting behave more like paper and pencil br TapSense announced in October allows touchscreens to distinguish what part of the hand was used for input such as the fingertip knuckle and fingernail This could be used in a variety of ways for example to copy and paste to capitalize letters to activate different drawing modes etc br br br Ergonomics and usage br br br Touchscreen enable br For touchscreens to be effective input devices users must be able to accurately select targets and avoid accidental selection of adjacent targets The design of touchscreen interfaces should reflect technical capabilities of the system ergonomics cognitive psychology and human physiology br Guidelines for touchscreen designs were first developed in the s based on early research and actual use of older systems typically using infrared grids which were highly dependent on the size of the user s fingers These guidelines are less relevant for the bulk of modern touch devices which use capacitive or resistive touch technology br From the mid s makers of operating systems for smartphones have promulgated standards but these vary between manufacturers and allow for significant variation in size based on technology changes so are unsuitable from a human factors perspective br Much more important is the accuracy humans have in selecting targets with their finger or a pen stylus The accuracy of user selection varies by position on the screen users are most accurate at the center less so at the left and right edges and least accurate at the top edge and especially the bottom edge The R accuracy required radius for target accuracy varies from mm in in the center to mm in in the lower corners Users are subconsciously aware of this and take more time to select targets which are smaller or at the edges or corners of the touchscreen br This user inaccuracy is a result of parallax visual acuity and the speed of the feedback loop between the eyes and fingers The precision of the human finger alone is much much higher than this so when assistive technologies are provided such as on screen magnifiers users can move their finger once in contact with the screen with precision as small as mm in br br br Hand position digit used and switching br Users of handheld and portable touchscreen devices hold them in a variety of ways and routinely change their method of holding and selection to suit the position and type of input There are four basic types of handheld interaction br br Holding at least in part with both hands tapping with a single thumb br Holding with two hands and tapping with both thumbs br Holding with one hand tapping with the finger or rarely thumb of another hand br Holding the device in one hand and tapping with the thumb from that same hand br Use rates vary widely While two thumb tapping is encountered rarely for many general interactions it is used for of typing interaction br In addition devices are often placed on surfaces desks or tables and tablets especially are used in stands The user may point select or gesture in these cases with their finger or thumb and vary use of these methods br br br Combined with haptics br Touchscreens are often used with haptic response systems A common example of this technology is the vibratory feedback provided when a button on the touchscreen is tapped Haptics are used to improve the user s experience with touchscreens by providing simulated tactile feedback and can be designed to react immediately partly countering on screen response latency Research from the University of Glasgow Brewster Chohan and Brown and more recently Hogan demonstrates that touchscreen users reduce input errors by increase input speed by and lower their cognitive load by when touchscreens are combined with haptics or tactile feedback On top of this a study conducted in by Boston College explored the effects that touchscreens haptic stimulation had on triggering psychological ownership of a product Their research concluded that a touchscreens ability to incorporate high amounts of haptic involvement resulted in customers feeling more endowment to the products they were designing or buying The study also reported that consumers using a touchscreen were willing to accept a higher price point for the items they were purchasing br br br Customer service br Touchscreen technology has become integrated into many aspects of customer service industry in the st century The restaurant industry is a good example of touchscreen implementation into this domain Chain restaurants such as Taco Bell Panera Bread and McDonald s offer touchscreens as an option when customers are ordering items off the menu While the addition of touchscreens is a development for this industry customers may choose to bypass the touchscreen and order from a traditional cashier To take this a step further a restaurant in Bangalore has attempted to completely automate the ordering process Customers sit down to a table embedded with touchscreens and order off an extensive menu Once the order is placed it is sent electronically to the kitchen These types of touchscreens fit under the Point of Sale POS systems mentioned in the lead section br br br Gorilla arm br br Extended use of gestural interfaces without the ability of the user to rest their arm is referred to as gorilla arm It can result in fatigue and even repetitive stress injury when routinely used in a work setting Certain early pen based interfaces required the operator to work in this position for much of the workday Allowing the user to rest their hand or arm on the input device or a frame around it is a solution for this in many contexts This phenomenon is often cited as an example of movements to be minimized by proper ergonomic design br Unsupported touchscreens are still fairly common in applications such as ATMs and data kiosks but are not an issue as the typical user only engages for brief and widely spaced periods br br br Fingerprints br br Touchscreens can suffer from the problem of fingerprints on the display This can be mitigated by the use of materials with optical coatings designed to reduce the visible effects of fingerprint oils Most modern smartphones have oleophobic coatings which lessen the amount of oil residue Another option is to install a matte finish anti glare screen protector which creates a slightly roughened surface that does not easily retain smudges br br br Glove touch br Capacitive touchscreens rarely work when the user wears gloves The thickness of the glove and the material they are made of play a significant role on that and the ability of a touchscreen to pick up a touch br Some devices have a mode which increases the sensitivity of the touchscreen This allows the touchscreen to be used more reliably with gloves but can also result in unreliable and phantom inputs However thin gloves such as medical gloves are thin enough for users to wear when using touchscreens mostly applicable to medical technology and machines br br br See also br br Charlieplexing br br br br br br Sources br br br External links
