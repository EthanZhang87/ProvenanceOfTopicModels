Cocos d is an open source game development framework for creating D games and other graphical software for iOS Android Windows macOS Linux HarmonyOS OpenHarmony and web platforms It is written in C and provides bindings for various programming languages including C C Lua and JavaScript The framework offers a wide range of features including physics particle systems skeletal animations tile maps and others br Cocos d was first released in and was originally written in Python It contains many branches with the best known being Cocos d ObjC formerly known as Cocos d iPhone Cocos d x Cocos d JS and Cocos d XNA There are also many third party tools editors and libraries made by the Cocos d community such as particle editors spritesheet editors font editors and level editors like SpriteBuilder and CocoStudio br br br Sprites and scenes br All versions of Cocos d work using the basic primitive known as a sprite A sprite can be thought of as a simple D image but can also be a container for other sprites In Cocos D sprites are arranged together to form a scene like a game level or a menu Sprites can be manipulated in code based on events or actions or as part of animations The sprites can be moved rotated scaled have their image changed etc br br br Features br br br Animation br Cocos D provides basic animation primitives that can work on sprites using a set of actions and timers They can be chained and composed together to form more complex animations Most Cocos D implementations let you manipulate the size scale position and other effects of the sprite Some versions of Cocos D let you also animate particle effects image filtering effects via shaders warp ripple etc br br br GUI br Cocos D provides primitives to representing common GUI elements in game scenes This includes things like text boxes labels menus buttons and other common elements br br br Physics system br Many Cocos D implementations come with support for common D physics engines like Box D and Chipmunk br br br Audio br Various versions of Cocos D have audio libraries that wrap OpenAL or other libraries to provide full audio capabilities Features are dependent on the implementation of Cocos D br br br Scripting support br Support binding to JavaScript Lua and other engines exist for Cocos D For example Cocos d JavaScript Binding JSB for C C Objective C is the wrapper code that sits between native code and JavaScript code using Mozilla s SpiderMonkey With JSB you can accelerate your development process by writing your game using easy and flexible JavaScript br br br Editor support br br br End of life support br SpriteBuilder Previously known as CocosBuilder SpriteBuilder is an IDE for Cocos D SpriteBuilder apps SpriteBuilder is free and its development was sponsored by Apportable who also sponsored the free Cocos D SpriteBuilder Cocos D and Chipmunk physics projects It was available as a free app in the Mac App Store Its latest official version is Its latest unofficial version is which is compatible with cocos d objC It supports Objective C br CocoStudio a proprietary toolkit based on Cocos d x containing UI Editor Animation Editor Scene Editor and Data Editor together forming a complete system the former two are tools mainly for artists while the latter are two mainly for designers This is a proprietary project developed by Chukong Technologies Its latest version is which is compatible with cocos d X It supports C In April it was deprecated and replaced with Cocos Creator br br br Current support br Cocos Creator which is a proprietary unified game development tool for Cocos d X As of August it supports JavaScript and TypeScript only and does not support neither C nor Lua It was based on the free Fireball X C and Lua support for creator is under alpha stage development since April br SpriteBuilderX a free scene editor for Cocos d X with C support and runs on macOS only br X Studio a proprietary scene editor for Cocos d X with Lua support and runs on Windows only br CCProjectGenerator a project generator for Cocos d ObjC that generates Swift or Objective C projects for Xcode br br br Supported platforms and languages br br br History br br br Cocos d Python br February in the village of Los Cocos near C rdoba Argentina Ricardo Quesada a game developer and Lucio Torre created a D game engine for Python with several of their developer friends They named it Los Cocos after its birthplace A month later the group released the version and changed its name to Cocos d br br br Cocos d iPhone br Attracted by the potential of the new Apple App Store for the iPhone Quesada rewrote Cocos d in Objective C and in June released Cocos d for iPhone v the predecessor of the later Cocos d family br Cocos D ObjC formerly known as Cocos D iPhone and Cocos D SpriteBuilder is maintained by Lars Birkemose br Also the English designer Michael Heald designed a new logo for Cocos d the Cocos d logo was previously a running coconut br br br Cocos d x br November a developer from China named Zhe Wang branched Cocos d x based on Cocos d Cocos d x is also a free engine under MIT License and it allows for compiling and running on multiple platforms with one code base br In Quesada left cocos d iPhone and joined in cocos d x team In March Quesada was laid off from the Chukong company In there are cocos d branches being actively maintained br Cocos d x Cocos d html is maintained and sponsored by developers at Chukong Technologies Chukong is also developing CocoStudio which is a WYSIWYG editor for Cocos d x and Cocos D html and a free Cocos d x fork of the Cocos D project br br br Other ports forks and bindings br Cocos d has been ported into various programming languages and to all kinds of platforms Among them there are br br ShinyCocos in Ruby br Cocos d Android in Java for Android br Cocos d windows in C for Windows XP and Windows br CocosNet in C based on Mono br Cocos d javascript in JavaScript for web browsers br Cocos d XNA was born in cocos d x community for supporting Windows Phone but now it s branched to an independent project using C and mono to run on multiple platforms Jacob Anderson at Totally Evil Entertainment is leading this branch br Cocos d works as an extension on cocos d iPhone written in Objective C Bill Hollings at Brenwill Workshop Ltd is leading this branch br br br Games developed
