Newgrounds is a company and entertainment website founded by Tom Fulp in It hosts user generated content such as games films audio and artwork Fulp produces in house content at the headquarters and offices in Glenside Pennsylvania br In the s Newgrounds played an important role in Internet culture and in Internet animation and independent video gaming in particular It has been called a distinct time in gaming history a place where many animators and developers cut their teeth and gained a following long before social media was even a thing and a haven for fostering the greats of internet animation br br br Content br br User generated content can be uploaded and categorized into either one of the site s four web portals Games Movies Audio and Art A Movie or Games submission entered undergoes the process termed judgment where it can be rated by all users from to stars and reviewed by other users The average score calculated at various points during judgment determines if whether the content will be saved added onto the database or blammed deleted with only its reviews saved in the Obituaries section br Since Adobe Flash Player was shut down on most browsers by late Newgrounds uses the Ruffle emulator an Adobe Flash emulator written in Rust and sponsored by Newgrounds along with other popular sites like Cool Math Games and Armor Games In Ruffle supported most Flash content written in ActionScript and and only a select few Flashes written in which meant to play then unsupported content users had to use the Newgrounds Player the site s previous downloadable Flash end of life solution which it used prior to Ruffle for playing content br Art and Audio are processed using a different method called scouting which the site describes as a way to vet users and weed out spam stolen works low quality submissions etc All users can put art and audio onto their own page but only those that are scouted will appear in the public area Like the judgment system it stops stolen content spam or prohibited material reaching the public area relying on users and site moderators Once an individual is scouted they are given the privilege to scout others though users caught scouting other users who regularly break the site s terms of service and or guidelines abusing the system get unscouted themselves br Content and context are liable to be reported for review to the moderators and staff members by flagging it for violations to the site s guidelines A weighted system recognizes experienced users and gives their flag more voice Newgrounds homepage includes featured submissions from each category as well as awards and honors to users whose submission that fall under the site s requirements to earn them Members of Newgrounds also organize animations called collabs through the discussion forum on the site Some scholars noted that while hundreds of these collabs are produced every year only are completed due to stress on those making the animations while other scholars said that animators maintain a strong sense of authorship and ownership of what they produce especially solo animators br Although the site hosted animations about Osama bin Laden Saddam Hussein and the Taliban some scholars argued that the site has had a relatively balanced conversation on politics even though those with right wing views reflected a sizable part of the site s user base at the time br br br History br br In at the age of Tom Fulp launched a Neo Geo fanzine called New Ground and sent issues to approximately members of a club originating on the online service Prodigy Using a hosting service he launched a website called New Ground Remix in which increased in popularity during the summer of after Fulp created the BBS games Club a Seal and Assassin while a student at Drexel University He then created Club a Seal II and Assassin II along with a separate hosting site titled New Ground Atomix The release of Pico s School a Flash browser game that exhibited a complexity of design and polish in presentation that was virtually unseen in amateur Flash game development of the time helped establish Newgrounds as a public force br also saw the consolidation of both sites into one domain name newgrounds com and the creation of The Portal a place on the site for Fulp to put his Flash projects that were smaller and more unfinished Site visitors began to reach out through e mail with their own Flash content that they had nowhere online to put which were manually given a webpage on the site in The Portal to showcase it By there were so many Portal submissions that submitting Flash content to the Portal would become an automated process with the help of Fulp s friend Ross Tom has stated that the automated Portal ultimately defined Newgrounds s purpose br br While Macromedia Flash Player was required for Newgrounds in order to play games the site also brought together members who were interested in producing Flash games and gained considerable online influence as a result It subsequently became one of the most active Flash creator communities in the English speaking Internet and served as a place that video game developers could begin their careers Flash was once described by Newgrounds as the driving force behind the site Even so those on the site had a low tolerance for poor quality work referring mainly to humor and storytelling instead of animation quality Some animators on the site moved to YouTube by the mid s By November Newgrounds had over million users and over animations This had increased by August when it was reported that the site had over million users and over games and animated films most of which were animations made by only one person with others collaboratively made by various individuals It was also said in that users had created hundreds of thousands of animated movies and online games br Time ranked the website at No on its list of Best Websites in br In Newgrounds began to encourage contributors to submit their games in an HTML format rather than Flash In November and December it experienced surges of new members originally from Tumblr when that site began restricting adult content after illegal child pornography was found on it resulting in the Tumblr iOS app being removed from the App Store br In the summer of with the discontinuation of Flash upcoming the administration of Newgrounds unveiled the Newgrounds Player for Windows which was described as a solution for playing Flash games and movies hosted on the site The application would launch via the website upon a request to view Flash content and play it The player would later be followed up with the Ruffle Flash emulator in August with the two options being offered in tandem as development on Ruffle progressed br In April an update for the browser game Friday Night Funkin was exclusively released on Newgrounds at the time causing the site s server to become overloaded after an influx of site traffic br In July Fulp received the Game Developers Choice Awards Pioneer Award for his contributions to establishing Newgrounds and subsequent work in The Behemoth br In September an update to the site s Art Portal was rolled out implementing it in the existing Project system for animation games and audio as well as adding the ability to use multi author credits on Art submissions and adding multi art support in either Inline Strip or Gallery formats br In March the site s reporting system was updated to enable users to report content predominantly generated by artificial intelligence AI br br br See also br br Internet art br History of the Internet br List of video game websites br br br Notes br br br br br br Citations br br br Sources br Luther Kurt Caine Kelly
