The iPad is a brand of iOS and iPadOS based tablet computers that are developed by Apple first introduced on January The iPad range consists of the original iPad lineup and the flagship products iPad Mini iPad Air and iPad Pro br The iPhone s iOS operating system OS was initially used for the iPad but in September its OS was switched to a fork of iOS called iPadOS that has better support for the device s hardware and its user interface is customized for the tablets larger screens The iPad s App Store is subject to application and content approval Many older devices are susceptible to jailbreaking which circumvents these restrictions The original iPad was well received for its software and was recognized as one of the most influential inventions of br As of the third quarter of iPad had a market share of beside personal use the iPad is used in the business education healthcare and technology sectors There are two connectivity variants of iPad one has only Wi Fi and one has support for cellular networks Accessories for the iPad include the Apple Pencil Smart Case Smart Keyboard Smart Keyboard Folio Magic Keyboard and several adapters br br br History br br br Background br br Apple co founder and CEO Steve Jobs said in a speech What we want to do is we want to put an incredibly great computer in a book that you can carry around with you and learn how to use in minutes and we really want to do it with a radio link in it so you don t have to hook up to anything and you re in communication with all of these larger databases and other computers br In Apple worked on the Newton MessagePad a tablet like personal digital assistant PDA John Sculley Apple s chief executive officer led the development The MessagePad was poorly received for its indecipherable handwriting recognition feature and was discontinued at the direction of Jobs who returned to Apple in after an internal power struggle Apple also prototyped a PowerBook Duo based tablet computer but decided not to release it to avoid hurting MessagePad sales br In May Apple filed a design trademark patent in Europe for a handheld computer hypothetically referencing the iPad beginning a new round of speculation that led to a report of Apple affiliated manufacturer Quanta leaking Apple s orders for wireless displays In May Apple filed US Design Patent No D that included an illustration depicting a man touching and using a tablet device In August Apple filed a page patent application that includes an illustration of hands touching and gesturing on a tablet computer In September Taiwan Economic News citing industry sources reported the tablet computer Apple was working on would be announced in February although the announcement was made in that year s January br The iPad s concept predates that of the iPhone although the iPhone was developed and released before the iPad In Apple s chief design officer Jonathan Ive devised an industrial design of a stylus based tablet the Macintosh Folio which led to the development of a larger tablet prototype project codenamed K that Apple began in Ive sought to develop the tablet first but came to an agreement with Jobs the

Keyboard Folio and Smart Keyboard lack br br br Software br br Since its introduction in the iPad runs on the iPhone s iOS mobile operating system but it was later replaced with an optimized derivation iPadOS in September It shares the former s development environment and many of its applications and features The iPad is compatible with nearly every iPhone application through iOS and developers can optimize these applications to take full advantage of the iPad s software They used iOS SDK a software development kit br The iOS user interface is based upon direct manipulation using multi touch gestures such as swipe tap pinch and reverse pinch Interface control elements include sliders switches and buttons Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device one common result is the undo command or rotating it in three dimensions one common result is switching between portrait and landscape mode Various accessibility described in Accessibility functions enable users with vision and hearing disabilities to properly use iOS br iOS devices boot to the homescreen the primary navigation and information hub on iOS devices analogous to the desktop found on personal computers iOS homescreens are typically made up of app icons and widgets app icons launch the associated app whereas widgets display live auto updating content such as a weather forecast the user s email inbox or a news ticker directly on the homescreen br Along the top of the screen is a status bar showing information about the device and its connectivity The status bar itself contains two elements the Control Center and the Notification Center br iOS Control Center can be pulled down from the top right of the notch giving access to various toggles to manage the device more quickly without having to open the Settings It is possible to manage brightness volume wireless connections music player etc A homescreen may be made up of several pages between which the user can swipe back and forth one of the ways to do this is to hold down on the dots shown on each page and swipe left or right To the right of the last page the App Library lists and categorizes apps installed on the device Apps within each category are arranged based on the frequency of their usage In addition to a category for suggested apps a recent category lists apps recently installed alongside App Clips recently accessed Users can search for the app they want or browse them in alphabetical order br iOS multitasking API included Background audio application continues to run in the background as long as it is playing audio or video content voice over IP application is suspended when a phone call is not in progress Push notification Local notifications application schedules local notifications to be delivered at a predetermined time Task completion application asks the system for extra time to complete a given task Fast app switching application does not execute any code and may be removed from memory at any time Newsstand applications can download content in the background to be ready for the uses External Accessory application communicates with an external accessory and shares data at regular intervals Bluetooth Accessory application communicates with a Bluetooth accessory and shares data at regular intervals and Background application update br iPadOS features a multitasking system developed with more capabilities compared to iOS with features like Slide Over and Split View that make it possible to use multiple different applications simultaneously Double clicking the Home Button or swiping up from the bottom of the screen and pausing will display all currently active spaces Each space can feature a single app or a Split View featuring two apps The user can also swipe left or right on the Home Indicator to go between spaces at any time or swipe left right with four fingers br In iPadOS while using an app swiping up slightly from the bottom edge of the screen will summon the Dock where apps stored within can be dragged to different areas of the current space to be opened in either Split View or Slide Over Dragging an app to the left or right edge of the screen will create a Split View which will allow both apps to be used side by side The size of the two apps in Split View can be adjusted by dragging a pill shaped icon in the center of the vertical divider and dragging the divider all the way to one side of the screen closes the respective app If the user drags an app from the dock over the current app it will create a floating window called Slide Over which can be dragged to either the left or right side of the screen A Slide Over window can be hidden by swiping it off the right side of the screen and swiping left from the right edge of the screen will restore it Slide Over apps can also be cycled between by swiping left or right on the Home Indicator in the Slide Over window and pulling up on it will open an app switcher for Slide Over windows A pill shaped icon at the top of apps in Split View or Slide Over allows them to be switched in an out of Split View and Slide Over br br br Model support status br br br Restrictions br br br Digital rights management br br The iPad does not employ digital rights management DRM but the OS prevents users from copying or transferring certain content outside of Apple s platform without authorization such as TV shows movies and apps Also the iPad s development model requires anyone creating an app for the iPad to sign a non disclosure agreement and pay for a developer subscription Critics argue Apple s centralized app approval process and control of the platform itself could stifle software innovation Of particular concern to digital rights advocates is Apple s ability to remotely disable or delete apps on any iPad at any time br Digital rights advocates including the Free Software Foundation Electronic Frontier Foundation and computer engineer and activist Brewster Kahle have criticized the iPad for its digital rights restrictions In April Paul Sweeting an analyst with GigaOM was quoted by NPR as saying With the iPad you have the anti Internet in your hands It offers the major media companies the opportunity to essentially re create the old business model wherein they are pushing content to you on their terms rather than you going out and finding content or a search engine discovering content for you But Sweeting also thought that the limitations imposed by Apple impart the feeling of a safe neighborhood saying Apple is offering you a gated community where there s a guard at the gate and there s probably maid service too Laura Sydell the article s author concludes As more consumers have fears about security on the Internet viruses and malware they may be happy to opt for Apple s gated community The Russian government has switched from iPads to Android devices over security concerns br br br Jailbreaking br br Like other iOS devices the iPad can be jailbroken depending on which version of iOS or iPadOS it is running thus allowing applications and programs that are not authorized by Apple to run on the device Once it is jailbroken users are able to download many applications previously unavailable through the App Store via unofficial installers such as Cydia as well as illegally pirated applications Apple claims jailbreaking can void the factory warranty on the device in the United States even though jailbreaking is legal The iPad released in April was first jailbroken in May with the Spirit jailbreak for iOS version The iPad can be jailbroken on iOS versions through with the web based tool JailbreakMe released in July and on iOS versions including and using redsn w Absinthe was released on May as the first jailbreak method for all iOS devices except the nm version of the iPad br br br Censorship br Apple s App Store which provides iPhone and iPad applications imposes censorship of content which has become an issue for book publishers and magazines seeking to use the platform The Guardian newspaper described the role of Apple as analogous to that of British magazine distributor WH Smith which for many years imposed content restrictions br Due to the exclusion of pornography from the App Store YouPorn and others changed their video format from Flash to H and HTML specifically for the iPad In an e mail exchange with Ryan Tate from Valleywag Steve Jobs claimed that the iPad offers freedom from porn leading to many upset replies including Adbustings in Berlin by artist Johannes P Osterhoff and in San Francisco during WWDC br br br Original reception br Media reaction to the original iPad was mixed The media noted the positive response from fans of the device with thousands of people queued on the first day of sale in a number of these countries br The iPad was quickly successful and sold in large numbers after its launch Analysts have noted that while Apple s previous iPod and iPhone launches took some time till taking off the iPad was commercially popular from the beginning and faced little market competition during its first year br br br Reaction to the announcement br Media reaction to the announcement of the original iPad was mixed Walter Mossberg wrote It s about the software stupid meaning hardware features and build are less important to the iPad s success than software and user interface his first impressions of which were largely positive Mossberg also called the price modest for a device of its capabilities and praised the ten hour battery life Others including PC Advisor and the Sydney Morning Herald wrote that the iPad would also compete with proliferating netbooks most of which use Microsoft Windows The base model s price was lower than pre release estimates by the tech press Wall Street analysts and Apple s competitors all of whom were expecting a much higher entry price point br CNET also criticized the iPad for its apparent lack of wireless sync which other portable devices such as Microsoft s Zune have had for a number of years The built in iTunes app is able to download from the Internet as well br br br Critical response br Reviews of the original iPad have been generally favorable Walt Mossberg then of The Wall Street Journal called it a pretty close laptop killer David Pogue of The New York Times wrote a dual review one part for technology minded people and the other part for non technology minded people In the former section he notes that a laptop offers more features for a cheaper price than the iPad In his review for the latter audience however he claims that if his readers like the concept of the device and can understand what its intended uses are then they will enjoy using the device PC Magazine s Tim Gideon wrote you have yourself a winner that will undoubtedly be a driving force in shaping the emerging tablet landscape Michael Arrington of TechCrunch said the iPad beats even my most optimistic expectations This is a new category of device But it also will replace laptops for many people PC World criticized the iPad s file sharing and printing abilities and Ars Technica said sharing files with a computer is one of our least favorite parts of the iPad experience br The media also praised the quantity of applications as well as the bookstore and other media applications In contrast they criticized the iPad for being a closed system and mentioned that the iPad faces competition from Android based tablets that outsold iPads in surpassing iPads in the second quarter of and have overtaken iPad s installed base and has lost majority of web browsing to Android by StatCounter estimates in South America Africa most of Asia many large countries there and in Eastern Europe The Independent criticized the iPad for not being as readable in bright light as paper but praised it for being able to store large quantities of books After its UK release The Daily Telegraph said the iPad s lack of Adobe Flash support was annoying br br br Recognition br The original iPad was selected by Time magazine as one of the Best Inventions of the Year while Popular Science chose it as the top gadget behind the overall Best of What s New winner Groasis Waterboxx br br br Usage br br br Market share br br The iPad had a relatively stable tablet global market share It received a significant drop in the third quarter of but gradually recovered although not as abundant as before As of the third quarter of it had a market share of br br br Business br While the iPad is mostly used by consumers it also has been taken up by business users Within days of its release the iPad managed to penetrate of Fortune companies Some companies are adopting iPads in their business offices by distributing or making available iPads to employees Examples of uses in the workplace include attorneys responding to clients medical professionals accessing health records during patient exams and managers approving employee requests br A survey by Frost Sullivan shows that iPad usage in office workplaces is linked to the goals of increased employee productivity reduced paperwork and increased revenue The research firm estimates that The mobile office application market in North America may reach billion in up from an estimated billion in br Since March the US Federal Aviation Administration FAA has approved the iPad for in cockpit use to cut down on the paper consumption in several airlines In Alaska Airlines became the first airline to replace pilots paper manuals with iPads weighing kg lb compared to kg lb for the printed flight manuals It hopes to have fewer back and muscle injuries More than a dozen airlines have followed suit including United which has distributed iPads to cockpits Also many airlines now offer their inflight magazine as a downloadable application for the iPad br br br Education and healthcare br The iPad has several uses in the classroom and has been praised as a valuable tool for homeschooling and distance education Soon after the iPad was released it was reported that of the top book apps were for children The iPad has also been called a revolutionary tool to help children with autism learn how to communicate and socialize more easily br In the healthcare field iPads and iPhones have been used to help hospitals manage their supply chain For example Novation a healthcare contracting services company developed VHA PriceLynx based on the mobile application platform of business intelligence software vendor MicroStrategy a business intelligence app to help health care organizations manage its purchasing procedures more efficiently and save money for hospitals Guillermo Ramas of Novation states Doctors won t walk around a hospital with a laptop With an iPad it s perfect to walk around the hospital with as long as they have the information they need br In Gianna Chien aged presented to more than doctors at the Heart Rhythm Society meeting that the Apple iPad can in some cases interfere with life saving heart devices pacemakers because of the magnets inside The iPad User Guide advised pacemaker users to keep iPads at least in cm away from the pacemaker A study in found that the iPad could cause electromagnetic interference EMI in implantable cardioverter defibrillators br br br Consumer usage br In the United States fans attending Super Bowl XLV the first Super Bowl since the iPad was released could use an official National Football League NFL app to navigate Cowboys Stadium In the Tampa Bay Buccaneers became the first NFL club to discontinue the use of paper copies of playbooks and instead distributed all players their playbook and videos in electronic format via an iPad br The iPad is able to support many music creation applications in addition to the iTunes music playback software These include sound samplers guitar and voice effects processors sequencers for synthesized sounds and sampled loops virtual synthesizers and drum machines theremin style and other touch responsive instruments drum pads and many more Gorillaz s album The
