The iPod is a discontinued series of portable media players and multi purpose mobile devices designed and marketed by Apple Inc The first version was released on November about months after the Macintosh version of iTunes was released Apple sold an estimated million iPod products as of Apple discontinued the iPod product line on May At over years the iPod brand is the oldest to be discontinued by Apple br Some versions of the iPod can serve as external data storage devices like other digital music players Prior to macOS Apple s iTunes software and other alternative software could be used to transfer music photos videos games contact information e mail settings Web bookmarks and calendars to the devices supporting these features from computers using certain versions of Apple macOS and Microsoft Windows operating systems br Before the release of iOS the iPod branding was used for the media player included with the iPhone and iPad which was separated into apps named Music and Videos on the iPod Touch As of iOS separate Music and Videos apps are standardized across all iOS powered products While the iPhone and iPad have essentially the same media player capabilities as the iPod line they are generally treated as separate products During the middle of iPhone sales overtook those of the iPod br br br History br br Portable MP players had existed since the mid s but Apple found existing digital music players big and clunky or small and useless with user interfaces that were unbelievably awful They also identified weaknesses in existing models attempt to negotiate the trade off between capacity and portability flash memory based players held too few songs while the hard drive based models were too big and heavy To address these deficits the company decided to develop its own MP player br At Apple CEO Steve Jobs direction hardware engineering chief Jon Rubinstein recruited Tony Fadell a former employee of General Magic and Philips who had a business idea to invent a better MP player and build a complementary music sales store Fadell had previously developed the Philips Velo and Nino PDA before starting a company called Fuse Systems to build the new MP player but RealNetworks Sony and Philips had already passed on the project Rubinstein had already discovered the Toshiba hard disk drive while meeting with an Apple supplier in Japan ultimately purchasing the rights to it for Apple Rubinstein had also already made substantial progress on development of other key hardware elements including the device s screen and battery br Fadell found support for his project with Apple Computer and was hired by Apple in as an independent contractor to work on the iPod project then code named project P Because most of Apple s engineering manpower and resources were already dedicated to the iMac line Fadell hired engineers from his startup company Fuse and veteran engineers from General Magic and Philips to build the core iPod development team br Time constraints forced Fadell to develop various components of the iPod outside Apple Fadell partnered with a company called PortalPlayer to design software for the device this work eventually took shape as the iPod OS Within eight months Tony Fadell s team and PortalPlayer had completed a prototype The power supply was then designed by Michael Dhuey while the display was designed in house by Apple design engineer Jonathan Ive The original iPod s physical appearance was inspired by the Braun T transistor radio designed by Dieter Rams while the wheel based user interface drew on Bang Olufsen s BeoCom telephone Apple CEO Steve Jobs set an exacting standard for the device s physical design one anecdote relates an occasion on which Jobs dropped a prototype into an aquarium in front of engineers to demonstrate from bubbles leaving its housing that the current design contained unused internal space br Apple contracted another company Pixo to help design and implement the user interface as well as Unicode memory management and event processing under Jobs direct supervision br The name iPod was proposed by Vinnie Chieco a freelance copywriter who with others was contracted by Apple to determine how to introduce the new player to the public After Chieco saw a prototype he was reminded of the phrase Open the pod bay doors Hal from the classic sci fi film A Space Odyssey referring to the white EVA Pods of the Discovery One spaceship Chieco s proposal drew an analogy between the relationship of the spaceship to the smaller independent pods and that of a personal computer to its companion music player br The product which Fortune called Apple s st Century Walkman was developed in less than one year and unveiled on October Jobs announced it as a Mac compatible product with a GB hard drive that put songs in your pocket br Apple researched the trademark and found that it was already in use Joseph N Grasso of New Jersey had originally listed an iPod trademark with the U S Patent and Trademark Office USPTO in July for Internet kiosks The first iPod kiosks had been demonstrated to the public in New Jersey in March and commercial use began in January but the venture had apparently been discontinued by The trademark was registered by the USPTO in November and Grasso assigned it to Apple Computer Inc in Separately the earliest recorded use in commerce of an iPod trademark was in by Chrysalis Corp of Sturgis Michigan styled iPOD for office furniture br As development of the iPod progressed Apple continued to refine the software s look and feel rewriting much of the code Starting with the iPod Mini the Chicago font was replaced with Espy Sans Later iPods switched fonts again to Podium Sans a font similar to Apple s corporate font Myriad Color display iPods then adopted some Mac OS X themes like Aqua progress bars and brushed metal meant to evoke a combination lock br On January Hewlett Packard HP announced that they would sell HP branded iPods under a license agreement from Apple Several new retail channels were used including Walmart and these iPods eventually made up of all iPod sales In July HP stopped selling iPods due to unfavorable terms and conditions imposed by Apple br In Apple partnered with Irish rock band U to present a special edition of the th generation iPod Like its predecessor this iPod has the signatures of the four members of the band engraved on its back but this one was the first time the company changed the color of the stainless steel back from a silver chrome to black This iPod was only available with GB of storage capacity The special edition entitled purchasers to an exclusive video with minutes of interviews and performance by U downloadable from the iTunes Store br In Apple modified the iPod interface again with the introduction of the sixth generation iPod Classic and third generation iPod Nano by changing the font to Helvetica and in most cases splitting the screen in half displaying the menus on the left and album artwork photos or videos on the right br In mid several new color schemes for all of the current iPod models were spotted in the iTunes update Belgian website Belgium iPhone originally found the images after plugging in an iPod for the first time and subsequent photos were discovered by Pierre Dandumont before being leaked br On July Apple removed the iPod Nano and Shuffle from its stores marking the end of Apple s production of standalone music players On May Apple discontinued the iPod Touch the last remaining product in the iPod line iOS was the last iOS release the th generation iPod touch received as future versions from iOS onward no longer support the device br br br Hardware br br br Audio br Audio tests showed that the third generation iPod has a weak bass response The combination of the undersized DC blocking capacitors and the typical low impedance of most consumer headphones form a high pass filter which attenuates the low frequency bass output Similar capacitors were used in the fourth generation iPods The problem is reduced when using high impedance headphones and is completely masked when driving high impedance line level loads such as when using an external headphone amplifier The first generation iPod Shuffle uses a dual transistor output stage rather than a single capacitor coupled output and does not exhibit reduced bass response for any load br For all iPods released in and earlier some equalizer EQ sound settings can easily distort the bass sound even on undemanding tracks This occurs when using EQ settings such as R B Rock Acoustic and Bass Booster because the equalizer amplifies the digital audio level beyond the software s limit causing distortion clipping on bass instruments br From the fifth generation iPod on Apple introduced a user configurable volume limit in response to concerns about hearing loss Users report that in the sixth generation iPod the maximum volume output level is limited to dB in EU markets Apple previously had to remove iPods from shelves in France for exceeding this legal limit However users who bought new sixth generation iPods in late reported a new option that allowed them to disable the EU volume limit Some have attributed this change to a software update that shipped with these devices Older sixth generation iPods however are unable to update to this software version br br br Connectivity br br Originally a FireWire connection to the host computer was used to update songs or recharge the battery The battery could also be charged with a power adapter that was included with the first four generations br The third generation began including a pin dock connector allowing for FireWire or USB connectivity This provided better compatibility with non Apple machines as most of them did not have FireWire ports at the time Eventually Apple began shipping iPods with USB cables instead of FireWire although the latter was available separately As of the first generation iPod Nano and the fifth generation iPod Classic Apple discontinued using FireWire for data transfer while still allowing for use of FireWire to charge the device in an attempt to reduce cost and form factor As of the second generation iPod Touch and the fourth generation iPod Nano FireWire charging ability has been removed The second third and fourth generation iPod Shuffle uses a single mm minijack phone connector which acts as both a headphone jack or a USB data and charging port for the dock cable br The dock connector also allowed the iPod to connect to accessories which often supplement the iPod s music video and photo playback Apple sold a few accessories such as the now discontinued iPod Hi Fi but most are manufactured by third parties such as Belkin and Griffin Some peripherals use their own interface while others use the iPod s own screen Because the dock connector is a proprietary interface the implementation of the interface requires paying royalties to Apple br Apple introduced a new pin dock connector named Lightning on September with their announcement of the iPhone the fifth generation iPod Touch and the seventh generation iPod Nano which all feature it The new connector replaces the older pin dock connector used by older iPods iPhones and iPads Apple Lightning cables have pins on both sides of the plug so it can be inserted with either side facing up br Bluetooth connectivity was added to the last model of the iPod Nano and Wi Fi to the iPod Touch br br br Accessories br br Many accessories have been made for the iPod line A large number are made by third party companies although many such as the iPod Hi Fi and iPod Socks are made by Apple Some accessories add extra features that other music players have such as sound recorders FM radio tuners wired remote controls and audio visual cables for TV connections Other accessories offer unique features like the Nike iPod pedometer and the iPod Camera Connector Other notable accessories include external speakers wireless remote controls protective case screen films and wireless earphones Among the first accessory manufacturers were Griffin Technology Belkin JBL Bose Monster Cable and SendStation br BMW released the first iPod automobile interface allowing drivers of newer BMW vehicles to control an iPod using either the built in steering wheel controls or the radio head unit buttons Apple announced in that similar systems would be available for other vehicle brands including Mercedes Benz Volvo Nissan Toyota Alfa Romeo Ferrari Acura Audi Honda Renault Infiniti and Volkswagen Scion offered standard iPod connectivity on all their cars br Some independent stereo manufacturers including JVC Pioneer Kenwood Alpine Sony and Harman Kardon also have iPod specific integration solutions Alternative connection methods include adapter kits that use the cassette deck or the CD changer port audio input jacks and FM transmitters such as the iTrip although personal FM transmitters are illegal in some countries Many car manufacturers have added audio input jacks as standard br Beginning in mid four major airlines United Continental Delta and Emirates reached agreements to install iPod seat connections The free service will allow passengers to power and charge an iPod and view video and music libraries on individual seat back displays Originally KLM and Air France were reported to be part of the deal with Apple but they later released statements explaining that they were only contemplating the possibility of incorporating such systems br br br Software br The iPod line can play several audio file formats including MP AAC M A Protected AAC AIFF WAV Audible audiobook and Apple Lossless The iPod Photo introduced the ability to display JPEG BMP GIF TIFF and PNG image file formats Fifth and sixth generation iPod Classic models as well as third generation iPod Nano models can also play MPEG H MPEG AVC and QuickTime video formats with restrictions on video dimensions encoding techniques and data rates Originally iPod software only worked with Classic Mac OS and macOS iPod software for Microsoft Windows was launched with the second generation model Unlike most other media players Apple does not support Microsoft s WMA audio format but a converter for WMA files without digital rights management DRM is provided with the Windows version of iTunes MIDI files also cannot be played but can be converted to audio files using the Advanced menu in iTunes Alternative open source audio formats such as Ogg Vorbis and FLAC are not supported without installing custom firmware onto an iPod e g Rockbox br During installation an iPod is associated with one host computer Each time an iPod connects to its host computer iTunes can synchronize entire music libraries or music playlists either automatically or manually Song ratings can be set on an iPod and synchronized later to the iTunes library and vice versa A user can access play and add music on a second computer if an iPod is set to manual and not automatic sync but anything added or edited will be reversed upon connecting and syncing with the main computer and its library If a user wishes to automatically sync music with another computer an iPod s library will be entirely wiped and replaced with the other computer s library br br br Interface br br iPods with color displays use anti aliased graphics and text with sliding animations All iPods except the rd generation iPod Shuffle the th th generation iPod Nano and iPod Touch have five buttons and the later generations have the buttons integrated into the click wheel an innovation that gives an uncluttered minimalist interface The buttons perform basic functions such as menu play pause next track and previous track Other operations such as scrolling through menu items and controlling the volume are performed by using the click wheel in a rotational manner The rd generation iPod Shuffle does not have any controls on the actual player instead it has a small control on the earphone cable with volume up and down buttons and a single button for play and pause next track etc The iPod Touch has no click wheel instead it uses a touch screen along with a home button sleep wake button and on the second and third generations of the iPod Touch volume up and down buttons The user interface for the iPod Touch is identical to that of the iPhone Differences include the lack of a phone application Both devices use iOS br br br iTunes Store br br The iTunes Store introduced April is an online media store run by Apple and accessed through iTunes The store became the market leader soon after its launch and Apple announced the sale of videos through the store on October Full length movies became available on September br At the time the store was introduced purchased audio files used the AAC format with added encryption based on the FairPlay DRM system Up to five authorized computers and an unlimited number of iPods could play the files Burning the files with iTunes as an audio CD then re importing would create music files without the DRM The DRM could also be removed using third party software However in a deal with Apple EMI began selling DRM free higher quality songs on the iTunes Stores in a category called iTunes Plus While individual songs were made available at a cost of US more than the cost of a regular DRM song entire albums were available for the same price US as DRM encoded albums On October Apple lowered the cost of individual iTunes Plus songs to US per song the same as DRM encoded tracks On January Apple announced that DRM has been removed from of the music catalog and that it would be removed from all music by April br iPods cannot play music files from competing music stores that use rival DRM technologies like Microsoft s protected WMA or RealNetworks Helix DRM Example stores include Napster and MSN Music RealNetworks claims that Apple is creating problems for itself by using FairPlay to lock users into using the iTunes Store Steve Jobs stated that Apple makes little profit from song sales although Apple uses the store to promote iPod sales However iPods can also play music files from online stores that do not use DRM such as eMusic or Amie Street br Universal Music Group decided not to renew their contract with the iTunes Store on July Universal will now supply iTunes in an at will capacity br Apple debuted the iTunes Wi Fi Music Store on September in its Media Event entitled The Beat Goes On This service allows users to access the Music Store from either an iPhone or an iPod Touch and download songs directly to the device that can be synced to the user s iTunes Library over a WiFi connection or in the case of an iPhone the cellular network br br br Games br br Video games are playable on various versions of iPods The original iPod had the game Brick originally invented by Apple s co founder Steve Wozniak included as an easter egg hidden feature later firmware versions added it as a menu option Later revisions of the iPod added three more games Parachute Solitaire and Music Quiz br In September the iTunes Store began to offer additional games for purchase with the launch of iTunes compatible with the fifth generation iPod with iPod software or later Those games were Bejeweled Cubis Mahjong Mini Golf Pac Man Tetris Texas Hold Em Vortex Asphalt Elite Racing and Zuma Additional games have since been added These games work on the th and th generation iPod Classic and the th and th generation iPod Nano br With third parties like Namco Square Enix Electronic Arts Sega and Hudson Soft all making games for the iPod Apple s MP player has taken steps towards entering the video game handheld console market Even video game magazines like GamePro and EGM have reviewed and rated most of their games as of late br The games are in the form of ipg files which are actually zip archives in disguise When unzipped they reveal executable files along with common audio and image files leading to the possibility of third party games Apple has not publicly released a software development kit SDK for iPod specific development Apps produced with the iPhone SDK are compatible only with the iOS on the iPod Touch and iPhone which cannot run click wheel based games br br br File storage and transfer br All iPods except for the iPod Touch can function in disk mode as mass storage devices to store data files but this has to be manually activated If an iPod is formatted on a Mac OS computer it uses the HFS file system format which allows it to serve as a boot disk for a Mac computer If it is formatted on Windows the FAT format is used With the release of the Windows compatible iPod the default file system used on the iPod line switched from HFS to FAT although it can be reformatted to either file system excluding the iPod Shuffle which is strictly FAT Generally if a new iPod excluding the iPod Shuffle is initially plugged into a computer running Windows it will be formatted with FAT and if initially plugged into a Mac running Mac OS it will be formatted with HFS br Unlike many other MP players simply copying audio or video files to the drive with a typical file management application will not allow an iPod to properly access them The user must use software that has been specifically designed to transfer media files to iPods so that the files are playable and viewable Usually iTunes is used to transfer media to an iPod though several alternative third party applications are available on a number of different platforms br iTunes and above can transfer purchased media of the iTunes Store from an iPod to a computer provided that computer containing the DRM protected media is authorized to play it br Media files are stored on an iPod in a hidden folder along with a proprietary database file The hidden content can be accessed on the host operating system by enabling hidden files to be shown The media files can then be recovered manually by copying the files or folders off the iPod Many third party applications also allow easy copying of media files off of an iPod br br br Models and features br While the suffix Classic was not introduced until the sixth generation it has been applied here retroactively to all non suffixed iPods for clarity br br br Patent disputes br In Apple faced two lawsuits claiming patent infringement by the iPod line and its associated technologies Advanced Audio Devices claimed the iPod line breached its patent on a music jukebox while a Hong Kong based IP portfolio company called Pat rights filed a suit claiming that Apple s FairPlay technology breached a patent issued to inventor Ho Keung Tse The latter case also includes the online music stores of Sony RealNetworks Napster and Musicmatch as defendants br Apple s application to the United States Patent and Trademark Office for a patent on rotational user inputs as used on the iPod interface received a third non final rejection NFR in August Also in August Creative Technology one of Apple s main rivals in the MP player market announced that it held a patent on part of the music selection interface used by the iPod line which Creative Technology dubbed the Zen Patent granted on August On May Creative filed another suit against Apple with the United States District Court for the Northern District of California Creative also asked the United States International Trade Commission to investigate whether Apple was breaching U S trade laws by importing iPods into the United States br On August Apple and Creative announced a broad settlement to end their legal disputes Apple will pay Creative US million for a paid up license to use Creative s awarded patent in all Apple products As part of the agreement Apple will recoup part of its payment if Creative is successful in licensing the patent Creative then announced its intention to produce iPod accessories by joining the Made for iPod program br br br Sales br br Sales of iPods peaked in following rapid growth in the period of to br In January Apple reported record quarterly revenue of US billion of which was made from iPod sales On April it was announced that Apple had sold its one hundred millionth iPod making it the best selling digital music player of all time Its second quarter revenue of US billion of which was made from iPod sales Apple and several industry analysts suggest that iPod users are likely to purchase other Apple products such as Mac computers of Apple s revenue for the First fiscal quarter of came from iPod sales followed by from notebook sales and from desktop sales br On October Apple reported that only of total revenue for fiscal quarter of the year came from iPods At the September keynote presentation at the Apple Event Phil Schiller announced total cumulative sales of iPods exceeded million The continual decline of iPod sales since has not been a surprising trend for the Apple corporation as Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer explained in June We expect our traditional MP players to decline over time as we cannibalize ourselves with the iPod Touch and the iPhone Since the company s iPod sales have continually decreased every financial quarter and in a new model was not introduced onto the market br As of September Apple reported that total number of iPods sold worldwide was million br br br Market share br Since October the iPod line has dominated digital music player sales in the United States with over of the market for hard drive based players and over of the market for all types of players During the year from January to January the high rate of sales caused its U S market share to increase from to and in July this market share was measured at In January the iPod market share reached according to Bloomberg Online In the Japanese market iPod market share was in albeit still leader there In Europe Apple also led the market especially the UK but local brands such as Archos managed to outsell Apple in certain categories br One of the reasons for the iPod s early success having been released three years after the very first digital audio player namely the MPMan was its seamless integration with the company s iTunes software and the ecosystem built around it such as the iTunes Music Store as well as a competitive price As a result Apple achieved a dominance in the MP player market as Sony s Walkman did with personal cassette players two decades earlier The software similarity between computer and player made it easy to transfer music over and synchronize it tasks that were considered difficult on pre iPod MP players such as those from Rio and Creative br br Some of the iPod s chief competitors during its pinnacle include Creative s Zen SanDisk s Sansa Sony s Walkman iriver and Samsung s Yepp The iPod s dominance was challenged numerous times in Sony s first hard disk Walkman was designed to take on the iPod accompanied by its own music store Sony Connect Microsoft initially attempted to compete using a software platform called Portable Media Center and in later years designed the Zune line the most vocal rival was Creative whose CEO in November declared war on the iPod Samsung declared that they would take the top spot from Apple by while SanDisk ran a specific anti iPod marketing campaign called iDon t These competitors failed to make major dents and Apple remained dominant in the fast growing digital audio player market during the decade Mobile phone manufacturers Nokia and Sony Ericsson also made music phones to rival iPod br A suggested factor of iPod s popularity has been cited to be Apple s popular iTunes Store catalog playing a part in keeping Apple firmly market leader while also helped by the mismanagement of others such as Sony s unpopular SonicStage software br One notable exception where iPod was not faring well was in South Korea where as of Apple held a small market share of less than compared to market leaders iriver Samsung and Cowon br As of iPod held a market share in global MP players Its closest competitor was noted to be the Sansa line from SanDisk br br br Industry impact br iPods have won several awards ranging from engineering excellence to most innovative audio product to fourth best computer product of iPods often receive favorable reviews scoring on looks clean design and ease of use PC World wrote that iPod line has altered the landscape for portable audio players Several industries are modifying their products to work better with both the iPod line and the AAC audio format Examples include CD copy protection schemes and mobile phones such as phones from Sony Ericsson and Nokia which play AAC files rather than WMA br Besides earning a reputation as a respected entertainment device the iPod has also been accepted as a business device Government departments major institutions and international organizations have turned to the iPod line as a delivery mechanism for business communication and training such as the Royal and Western Infirmaries in Glasgow Scotland where iPods have been used to train new staff br iPods have also gained popularity for use in education Apple offers more information on educational uses for iPods on its website including a collection of lesson plans There has also been academic research done in this area in nursing education and more general K education Duke University provided iPods to all incoming freshmen in the fall of and the iPod program continues today with modifications Entertainment Weekly put it on its end of the decade best of list saying Yes children there really was a time when we roamed the earth without thousands of our favorite jams tucked comfortably into our hip pockets Weird br The iPod has also been credited with accelerating shifts within the music industry The iPod s popularization of digital music storage allows users to abandon listening to entire albums and instead be able to choose specific singles which hastened the end of the album era in popular music br br br Criticism br br br Battery problems br The advertised battery life on most models is different from the real world achievable life For example the fifth generation GB iPod Classic was advertised as having up to hours of music playback However an MP com report stated that this was virtually unachievable under real life usage conditions with a writer for the site getting on average less than hours from an iPod In class action lawsuits were brought against Apple complaining that the battery charges lasted for shorter lengths of time than stated and that the battery degraded over time The lawsuits were settled by offering individuals with first or second generation iPods either US store credit or a free battery replacement and offering individuals with third generation iPods an extended warranty that would allow them to get a replacement iPod if they experienced battery problems br As an instance of planned obsolescence iPod batteries are not designed to be removed or replaced by the user although some users have been able to open the case themselves usually following instructions from third party vendors of iPod replacement batteries Compounding the problem Apple initially would not replace worn out batteries The official policy was that the customer should buy a refurbished replacement iPod at a cost almost equivalent to a brand new one All lithium ion batteries lose capacity during their lifetime even when not in use guidelines are available for prolonging life span and this situation led to a market for third party battery replacement kits br Apple announced a battery replacement program on November a week before a high publicity stunt and website by the Neistat Brothers The initial cost was US and it was lowered to US in One week later Apple offered an extended iPod warranty for US For the iPod Nano soldering tools are needed because the battery is soldered onto the main board Fifth generation iPods have their battery attached to the backplate with adhesive br The first generation iPod Nano may overheat and pose a health and safety risk Affected iPod Nanos were sold between September and December This is due to a flawed battery used by Apple from a single battery manufacturer Apple recommended that owners of affected iPod Nanos stop using them Under an Apple product replacement program affected Nanos were replaced with current generation Nanos free of charge br br br Reliability and durability br iPods have been criticized for alleged short lifespan and fragile hard drives A survey conducted on the MacInTouch website found that the iPod line had an average failure rate of although they note that comments from respondents indicate that the true iPod failure rate may be lower than it appears It concluded that some models were more durable than others In particular failure rates for iPods employing hard drives were usually above while those with flash memory had a failure rate below In late many users complained that the surface of the first generation iPod Nano can become scratched easily rendering the screen unusable A class action lawsuit was also filed Apple initially considered the issue a minor defect but later began shipping these iPods with protective sleeves br br br Labor disputes br On June the British tabloid The Mail on Sunday reported that iPods are mainly manufactured by workers who earn no more than US per month and work hour shifts Apple investigated the case with independent auditors and found that while some of the plant s labor practices met Apple s Code of Conduct others did not employees worked over hours a week for of the time and worked more than six consecutive days for of the time br Foxconn Apple s manufacturer initially denied the abuses but when an auditing team from Apple found that workers had been working longer hours than were allowed under Chinese law they promised to prevent workers working more hours than the code allowed Apple hired a workplace standards auditing company Verit and joined the Electronic Industry Code of Conduct Implementation Group to oversee the measures On December workers at the Foxconn factory in Longhua Shenzhen formed a union affiliated with the All China Federation of Trade Unions the Chinese government approved union umbrella organization br In a number of workers committed suicide at a Foxconn operations in China Apple HP and others stated that they were investigating the situation Foxconn guards have been videotaped beating employees Another employee killed himself in when an Apple prototype went missing and claimed in messages to friends that he had been beaten and interrogated br As of the iPod was produced by about workers in the U S and overseas Further the salaries attributed to this product were overwhelmingly distributed to highly skilled U S professionals as opposed to lower skilled U S retail employees or overseas manufacturing labor One interpretation of this result is that U S innovation can create more jobs overseas than domestically br br br
