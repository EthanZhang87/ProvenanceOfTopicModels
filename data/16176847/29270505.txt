system was said to be available exclusively as a download from the Mac App Store for US The only prior version of OS X that supports the Mac App Store is Snow Leopard which implied that any machines that support Lion currently running Tiger or Leopard would first have to be upgraded to Snow Leopard as opposed to allowing a direct upgrade to Lion br Apple later announced two alternative distribution mechanisms for the benefit of users without broadband Internet access in store downloads at retail Apple Stores and a USB flash drive containing the OS priced at US available through the

Scrollbar arrows have been removed br Scrolling is reversed by default to act more like a touch screen device so that content moves in the direction of finger movement on touch pad or mouse with the

when the scroll bar hits the top or bottom of the window br When resizing a window by clicking on the green button left top a transform effect animates the enlargement br New windows fly to the front like opening an app in iOS br The dashboard is its own space in Mission Control rather than in previous versions of OS X where the widgets simply flew in and the background dimmed As a result there is

external disk as long as the hard disk is not damaged br Apple USB Modem is not compatible with Lion br QuickTime Streaming Server software used to deliver video and audio on request to users over a computer network including the Internet br WPA Enterprise configuration for wireless networks was replaced by the requirement to obtain a configuration profile br The Post Install Welcome Video was removed br br br Reception br Reception for OS X Lion at launch was mixed complaints include the fact that the normal save workflow had been disrupted by the Autosave Revert workflow Other highly criticized decisions include the change to natural scrolling hiding of the scroll bar the omission of the iSync program necessary to synchronize a Mac with non Apple mobile devices as well as abandoned functionality in Expos and Spaces br However in an extensive review of the operating system Ars Technica recommended Lion They noted that it feels like it is the start of a new line of operating systems that will continue to be influenced by Apple s iOS platform The review also compared the introduction of Lion along with its new conventions that change traditional ways of computing with the original Mac OS X and when it replaced the classic Mac OS Macworld stated that Lion was a radical revision praising the changes made to the operating system to be more user friendly to new Mac users who are familiar with the iOS interface while criticizing the limited utility of the interface Ultimately the magazine considered Lion an operating system worth getting giving it out of stars guardian co uk called Lion a substantial improvement from its predecessors and considered it a steal given its price br On the other hand Gizmodo stated that the new interface feels like a failure and concluded by saying that it doesn t feel like a must have upgrade Ted Landau of MacObserver also had serious criticism of Lion reversing his earlier praise of Autosave and writing Auto Save takes irritatingly long when working with large documents Still others lament the loss of the Save As command noting that the new Duplicate option is not as convenient to use The consensus is that none of this would matter much if you could disable Auto Save If you like how it works leave things as is Otherwise get rid of it But Lion offers no way to turn Auto Save off This is the heart of the my way or the highway complaint A posting sums it up The new features are intrusive non respectful of the users choices and cannot be changed br Due to Lion s enhanced security features including application sandboxing Dino Dai Zovi characterized Lion s security as a significant improvement He also said I generally tell Mac users that if they care about security they should upgrade to Lion sooner rather than later and the same goes for Windows users too br The update was released with bugs so Apple removed the standard download from their server and instead recommended that users download the Client Combo update instead which can fully update a system to br br br Software incompatibilities br Applications that depend on Rosetta such as Office for Mac AppleWorks and early versions of Quicken for Mac are no longer supported This affects applications listed as Classic or PowerPC in System Profiler br Unix package managers for Mac OS X such as Fink and MacPorts require
