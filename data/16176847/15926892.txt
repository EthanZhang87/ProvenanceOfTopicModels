In communication media are the outlets or tools used to store and deliver content semantic information or subject matter of which the media contains The term generally refers to components of the mass media communications industry such as print media publishing news media photography cinema broadcasting radio and television digital media and advertising br The development of early writing and paper enabling longer distance communication systems such as mail including in the Persian Empire Chapar Khaneh and Angarium and Roman Empire can be interpreted as early forms of media Writers such as Howard Rheingold have framed early forms of human communication such as the Lascaux cave paintings and early writing as early forms of media Another framing of the history of media starts with the Chauvet Cave paintings and continues with other ways to carry human communication beyond the short range of voice smoke signals trail markers and sculpture br In its modern application the term media is relating to communication channels was first used by Canadian communications theorist Marshall McLuhan who stated in Counterblast The media are not toys they should not be in the hands of Mother Goose and Peter Pan executives They can be entrusted only to new artists because they are art forms By the mid s the term had spread to general use in North America and the United Kingdom According to H L Mencken the phrase mass media was used as early as in the United States br The term medium the singular form of media is defined as one of the means or channels of general communication information or entertainment in society as newspapers radio or television br br br Regulations br br The role of regulatory authorities license broadcaster institutions content providers platforms and the resistance to political and commercial interference in the autonomy of the media sector are both considered as significant components of media independence In order to ensure media independence regulatory authorities should be placed outside of governments directives This can be measured through legislation agency statutes and rules br br br Government regulations br br br Licensing br In the United States the Radio Act of established that the radio frequency spectrum was public property This prohibited private organizations from owning any portion of the spectrum A broadcast license is typically given to broadcasters by communications regulators allowing them to broadcast on a certain frequency and typically in a specific geographical location Licensing is done by regulators in order to manage a broadcasting medium and as a method to prevent the concentration of media ownership br Licensing has been criticized for an alleged lack of transparency Regulatory authorities in certain countries have been accused of exhibiting political bias in favor of the government or ruling party which has resulted in some prospective broadcasters being denied licenses or being threatened with license withdrawal As a consequence there has been a decrease in diversity of content and views in certain countries due to actions made against broadcasters by states via their licensing authorities This can have an impact on competition and may lead to an excessive concentration of power with potential influence on public opinion Examples include the failure to renew or retain licenses for editorially critical media reducing the regulator s competences and mandates for action and a lack of due process in the adoption of regulatory decisions br br br Government endorsed appointments br State control is also evident in the increasing politicization of regulatory bodies operationalized through transfers and appointments of party aligned individuals to senior positions in regulatory authorities Anatol Lieven in his book explains how Pakistan a less economically developed country regulated its media in the s br br br Internet regulation br br br br Self regulation br br br At the regional level br In Western Europe self regulation provides an alternative to state regulatory authorities In such contexts newspapers have historically been free of licensing and regulation and there has been repeated pressure for them to self regulate or at least to have in house ombudsmen However it has often been difficult to establish meaningful self regulatory entities br In many cases self regulations exists in the shadow of state regulation and is conscious of the possibility of state intervention In many countries in Central and Eastern Europe self regulatory structures seems to be lacking or have not historically been perceived as efficient and effective br The rise of satellite channels that delivered directly to viewers or through cable or online systems renders much larger the sphere of unregulated programing There are however varying efforts to regulate the access of programmers to satellite transponders in parts of the Western Europe North America the Arab region and in Asia and the Pacific The Arab Satellite Broadcasting Charter was an example of efforts to bring formal standards and some regulatory authority to bear on what is transmitted but it appears to not have been implemented br br br International organizations and NGOs br Self regulation is expressed as a preferential system by journalists but also as a support for media freedom and development organizations by intergovernmental organizations such as UNESCO and non governmental organizations There has been a continued trend of establishing self regulatory bodies such as press councils in conflict and post conflict situations br Major internet companies have responded to pressure by governments and the public by elaborating self regulatory and complaints systems at the individual company level using principles they have developed under the framework of the Global Network Initiative The Global Network Initiative has grown to include several large telecom companies alongside internet companies such as Google Facebook and others as well as civil society organizations and academics br The European Commission s publication ICT Technology Sector Guide on Implementing the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights impacts on the presence of independent journalism by defining the limits of what should or should not be carried and prioritized in the most popular digital spaces br br br Private sector br br Public pressure on technology giants has motivated the development of new strategies aimed not only at identifying fake news but also at eliminating some of the structural causes of their emergence and proliferation Facebook has created new buttons for users to report content they believe is false following previous strategies aimed at countering hate speech and harassment online These changes reflect broader transformations occurring among tech giants to increase their transparency As indicated by the Ranking Digital Rights Corporate Accountability Index most large internet companies have reportedly become relatively more forthcoming in terms of their policies about transparency in regard to third party requests to remove or access content especially in the case of requests from governments At the same time however the study signaled a number of companies that have become more opaque when it comes to disclosing how they enforce their own terms of service in restricting certain types of content and account State governments can also use Fake news in order to spread propaganda br br br Fact checking and news literacy br In addition to responding to pressure for more clearly defined self regulatory mechanisms and galvanized by the debates over so called fake news internet companies such as Facebook have launched campaigns to educate users about how to more easily distinguish between fake news and real news sources Ahead of the United Kingdom national election in for example Facebook published a series of advertisements in newspapers with Tips for Spotting False News which suggested things that might signal whether a story is genuine or not There have also been broader initiatives bringing together a variety of donors and actors to promote fact checking and news literacy such as the News Integrity Initiative at the City University of New York s School of Journalism This million USD investment by groups including the Ford Foundation and Facebook was launched in so its full impact remains to be seen It will however complement the offerings of other networks such as the International Fact Checking Network launched by the Poynter Institute in which seeks to outline the parameters of the field Instagram has also created a way to potentially expose fake news that is posted on the site After looking into the site it seemed as more than a place for political memes but a weaponized platform instead of the creative space it used to be Since that Instagram has started to put warning labels on certain stories or posts if third party fact checkers believe that false information is being spread Instagram works with these fact checkers to ensure that no false information is being spread around the site Instagram started this work in following Facebook with the idea as they started fact checking in br br br Electronic media br br Developments
