devices with a keyboard Kindle Keyboard devices with touch sensitive lighted high resolution screens Kindle Paperwhite early generations of a tablet computer with the Kindle app Kindle Fire and low

second Kindle device that is connected to the cloud and is registered to the same user as the result of this operation the documents that are on the second device now become organized according to the
