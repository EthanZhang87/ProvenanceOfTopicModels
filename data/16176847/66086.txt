DR DOS written as DR DOS without a hyphen in versions up to and including is a disk operating system for IBM PC compatibles Upon its introduction in it was the first DOS that attempted to be compatible with IBM PC DOS and MS DOS which were the same product sold under different names br DR DOS was developed by Gary A Kildall s Digital Research and derived from Concurrent PC DOS which was an advanced successor of CP M As ownership changed various later versions were produced with names including Novell DOS and Caldera OpenDOS br br br History br br br Origins in CP M br Digital Research s original CP M for the bit Intel and Z based systems spawned numerous spin off versions most notably CP M for the Intel family of processors Although CP M had dominated the market since the mid s and was shipped with the vast majority of non proprietary architecture personal computers the IBM PC in brought the beginning of what was eventually to be a massive change br IBM originally approached Digital Research in seeking an x version of CP M However there were disagreements over the contract and IBM withdrew Instead a deal was struck with Microsoft who purchased another operating system DOS from Seattle Computer Products SCP This became Microsoft MS DOS and IBM PC DOS DOS s command structure and application programming interface imitated that of CP M with BDOS Digital Research threatened legal action claiming PC DOS MS DOS to be too similar to CP M In early IBM settled by agreeing to sell Digital Research s x version of CP M CP M alongside PC DOS However PC DOS sold for US while CP M had a price tag The proportion of PC buyers prepared to spend six times as much to buy CP M was very small and the limited availability of compatible application software at first in Digital Research s favor was only temporary br Digital Research fought a long losing battle to promote CP M and its multi tasking multi user successors MP M and Concurrent CP M and eventually decided that they could not beat the Microsoft IBM lead in application software availability so they modified Concurrent CP M to allow it to run the same applications as MS DOS and PC DOS br This was shown publicly in December and shipped in March as Concurrent DOS a k a CDOS with BDOS to hardware vendors While Concurrent DOS continued to evolve in various flavours over the years to eventually become Multiuser DOS and REAL it was not specifically tailored for the desktop market and too expensive for single user applications Therefore over time two attempts were made to sideline the product br In Digital Research developed DOS Plus to a stripped down and modified single user derivative of Concurrent DOS and which ran applications for both platforms and allowed switching between several tasks as did the original CP M Its DOS compatibility was limited and Digital Research made another attempt this time a native DOS system This new disk operating system was launched in as DR DOS br Although DRI was based in Pacific Grove and later in Monterey California USA the work on DOS Plus started in Newbury Berkshire in the UK where Digital Research Europe had its OEM Support Group located since Beginning in most of the operating system work on Concurrent DOS and XM Multiuser DOS DR DOS and PalmDOS was done in Digital Research s European Development Centre EDC in Hungerford Berkshire Later on some work was also done by Digital Research GmbH in Munich Germany br br br First DR DOS version br As requested by several OEMs Digital Research started a plan to develop a new DOS operating system addressing the defects left by MS DOS in Of particular importance was a million dollar deal with Kazuhiko Kay Nishi of ASCII Corporation who had previously been instrumental in opening the Japanese OEM market for Microsoft The first DR DOS version was released on May Version numbers were chosen to reflect features relative to MS DOS the first version promoted to the public was DR DOS which offered features comparable to Compaq MS DOS with large disk support FAT B a k a BIGDOS DR DOS reported itself as IBM PC DOS while the internal BDOS Basic Disk Operating System kernel version was reported as single user nature reflecting its origin as derivative of Concurrent DOS with the multitasking and multiuser capabilities as well as CP M API support stripped out and the XIOS replaced by an IBM compatible DOS BIOS The system files were named DRBIOS SYS for the DOS BIOS and DRBDOS SYS for the BDOS kernel the disk OEM label used was DIGITAL br DR DOS offered some extended command line tools with command line help verbose error messages sophisticated command line history and editing HISTORY directive as well as support for file and directory passwords built right into the kernel It was also cheaper to license than MS DOS and was ROMable right from the start The ROMed version of DR DOS was also named ROS ROM Operating System DRI was approached by a number of PC manufacturers who were interested in a third party DOS which prompted several updates to the system br At this time MS DOS was only available to OEMs bundled with hardware Consequently DR DOS achieved some immediate success when it became possible for consumers to buy it through normal retail channels beginning with version x br Known versions are DR DOS BDOS June OEM only BDOS August OEM only BDOS September OEM only BDOS OEM only BDOS October OEM only BDOS January BDOS June OEM and retail Like MS DOS most of them were produced in several variants for different hardware While most OEMs kept the DR DOS name designation Sales Inc marketed it under the name EZ DOS also known as EZ DOS br br br DR DOS br DR DOS version code named Leopard was released in May still reporting itself as PC DOS for compatibility purposes but internally indicating a single user BDOS kernel Version was skipped to avoid being associated with the relatively unpopular MS DOS This introduced ViewMAX a GEM based GUI file management shell ViewMAX s startup screen would present the slogan Digital Research We make computers work DR DOS also introduced the patented BatteryMAX power management system bundled disk caching software DRCACHE a remote file transfer tool FILELINK a cursor shape configuration utility CURSOR and offered a vastly improved memory management system MemoryMAX For compatibility purposes the DR DOS system files were now named IBMBIO COM for the DOS BIOS and IBMDOS COM for the BDOS kernel and due to the advanced loader in the boot sector could be physically stored anywhere on disk The OEM label in the boot sectors was changed to IBM br br DR DOS was the first DOS to include load high capabilities The kernel and data structures such as disk buffers could be relocated in the High Memory Area HMA the first KB of extended memory which are accessible in real mode This freed up the equivalent amount of critical base or conventional memory the first KB of the PC s RAM the area in which all DOS applications run br Additionally on Intel machines DR DOS s EMS memory manager allowed the operating system to load DOS device drivers into upper memory blocks further freeing base memory br DR DOS was the first DOS to integrate such functionality into the base OS loading device drivers into upper memory blocks was already possible using third party software like QEMM This allowed it on systems with supported chipsets and on systems to provide significantly more free conventional memory than any other DOS Once drivers for a mouse multimedia hardware and a network stack were loaded an MS DOS PC DOS machine typically might only have had to KB of free conventional memory too little to run much late s software In contrast to this DR DOS with a little manual tweaking could load all this and still keep all of its conventional memory free allowing for some necessary DOS data structures as much as KB out of the KB With MEMMAX V the conventional memory region could even be extended into unused portions of the graphics adapter card typically providing another to KB more free DOS memory br Because DR DOS left so much conventional memory available some old programs using certain address wrapping techniques failed to run properly as they were now loaded unexpectedly or under MS DOS impossibly low in memory inside the first KB segment known as low memory Therefore DR DOS s new MEMMAX L command worked around this by pre allocating a chunk of memory at the start of the memory map in order for programs to load above this barrier but with less usable conventional memory then By default MEMMAX was configured for L so that applications could take advantage of the extra memory br br br DR DOS Competition from Microsoft br br Faced with substantial competition in the DOS arena Microsoft responded with an announcement of a yet to be released MS DOS in May This would be released in June and include similar advanced features to those of DR DOS It included matches of the DR s enhancements in memory management br Almost immediately in September Digital Research responded with DR DOS code named Buxton DR DOS while already at BDOS level internally would still report itself as IBM PC DOS to normal DOS applications for compatibility purposes br This bundled in SuperStor on the fly disk compression to maximize available hard disk space and file deletion tracking and undelete functionality by Roger A Gross br DR DOS also included a task switcher named TASKMAX with support for the industry standard task switching API to run multiple applications at the same time In contrast to Digital Research s Multiuser DOS successor of Concurrent DOS in the multi user products line which would run DOS applications in pre emptively multitasked virtual DOS machines the DR DOS task switcher would freeze background applications until brought back into the foreground While it ran on x machines it was able to swap to XMS memory on machines TASKMAX did support some Copy Paste facility between applications br Via the task switcher API graphical user interfaces such as ViewMAX or PC GEOS could register as the task manager menu and thereby replace the TASKMAX text mode menu so that users could switch between tasks from within a GUI br Microsoft responded with MS DOS which again matched some features of DR DOS br In December a pre release version of Windows was found to return a non fatal error message if it detected a non Microsoft DOS This check came to be known as the AARD code It was a simple matter for Digital Research to patch DR DOS to circumvent the AARD code authenticity check in the Windows beta by rearranging the order of two internal tables in memory with no changes in functionality and the patched version named business update was on the streets within six weeks of the release of Windows With the detection code disabled Windows ran perfectly under DR DOS and its successor Novell DOS The code was present but disabled in the released version of Windows br In July Digital Research Japan released DR DOS V a Japanese DOS V compatible version of DR DOS A Korean version appears to have been available as well br br br PalmDOS br In Digital Research still under its old name but already bought by Novell in July also embarked on a spin off product code named Merlin and later released as NetWare PalmDOS which as its name implies was a very resource light DR DOS derivative aimed at the emerging Palmtop PDA market br PalmDOS was the first operating system in the family to support the new BDOS kernel with native DOS compatible internal data structures instead of emulations thereof Replacing the DOS emulation on top of a CP M kernel by a true DOS compatible kernel helped a lot in improving compatibility with some applications using some of DOS internal data structures and also was the key in reducing the resident size of the kernel code even further a particular requirement for the PDA market On the other hand introducing a genuine Current Directory Structure CDS imposed a limit on the depth of working directories down to characters as in MS DOS PC DOS whereas previous issues of DR DOS had no such limitation due to their internal organization of directories as relative links to parent directories instead of as absolute paths PalmDOS still reported itself as PC DOS to applications in order to keep the kernel small and not run into compatibility problems with Windows which would expect the DOSMGR API to be implemented for any DOS version since br As well as a ROM executing kernel PalmDOS had palmtop type support for features such as PCMCIA PC Cards with DPMS support power management BatteryMAX and the IDLE device driver with its patented dynamic idle detection by Gross and John P Constant MINIMAX task switcher support for PIM Personal Information Modules applications stored and executed from ROM via XIP Execute In Place etc br The PCMCIA stack for PalmDOS was partially written by Ian H S Cullimore br br br Novell DOS Contribution by Novell br br Novell DOS was Novell Corporation s name for DR DOS during the period when Novell sold DR DOS after the acquisition of Digital Research in Regarding features and performance it was typically at least one release ahead of MS DOS In PC DOS MS DOS and PC DOS were trumped by Novell s DOS br Novell CEO Robert J Frankenberg s strategy included major trimming selling off products like transactional database Btrieve and killing others such as Novell DOS and WordPerfect s multimedia Main Street children s titles Novell licensed technology from Stac Electronics for use in Novell DOS and its Network operating system NetWare Novell sold the product line off to Caldera on July after it approached Novell looking for a DOS operating system to bundle with its OpenLinux distribution br Marc Perkel claimed to have had inspired Novell in February to buy Digital Research and develop something he envisioned as NovOS Novell had actually bought Digital Research in July with a view to using DR s product line as a lever in their comprehensive strategy to break the Microsoft monopoly This was part of a massive and ultimately disastrous spending spree for Novell they bought WordPerfect Corporation at about the same time some of Borland s products and invested heavily in Unix as well The planned DR DOS internally named Panther intended to trump Microsoft s troubled MS DOS was repeatedly delayed while Novell was working on an optionally loadable Unix like multi user security extension with if loaded file commands like BACKUP DELPURGE MOVE TOUCH TREE UNDELETE XATTRIB XCOPY XDEL and XDIR supporting an otherwise disabled U name command line option to select specific users or groups compatible with Multiuser DOS and two new graphical user interfaces ViewMAX a derivative of GEM and Star Trek a true port of Apple s System to run under the new DR DOS multitasker named Vladivar br When DR DOS eventually arrived in December with localized versions released in March renamed Novell DOS a k a NWDOS and without these three components it was a disappointment to some It was larger and lacked some finishing touches but was nevertheless seen as best DOS by many industry experts br In Germany Novell DOS was aggressively marketed with the slogan Trau keinem DOS unter Don t trust any DOS below in the press and with free demo floppies in computer magazines The campaign aimed at of the DOS market and resulted in about million copies sold until February and more than dealers interested to carry the product Novell DOS was available through various OEMs a dedicated mail order shop and authorized dealers br A major functional addition was Novell s second attempt at a peer to peer networking system Personal NetWare PNW This was better than its predecessor NetWare Lite NWL but it was incompatible with Microsoft s networking system now growing popular with support in Windows for Workgroups OS and Windows NT A considerable amount of manual configuration was needed to get both to co exist on the same PC and Personal NetWare never achieved much success br Since Novell DOS implemented the DOSMGR API and internal data structures had been updated its BDOS kernel could report with a DOS version of and OEM ID IBM without risking compatibility problems with Windows Most tools would report this as PC DOS because IBM PC DOS also reported as DOS to applications br Novell DOS introduced much advanced memory management including new support for DPMI DOS Protected Mode Interface and DPMS DOS Protected Mode Services as well as more flexible loadhigh options It also introduced support for true pre emptive multitasking of multiple DOS applications in virtual DOS machines VDM a component originally named MultiMAX This was similar to Multiuser DOS but now on the basis of a natively DOS compatible environment similar to Windows Enhanced Mode but without a GUI By default the bundled TASKMGR would behave similar to the former DR DOS TASKMAX However if EMM was loaded with the option MULTI EMM would load a natively bit Protected Mode operating system core providing API support for pre emptive multitasking multi threading hardware virtualization and domain management of virtual DOS machines This API could be used by DR DOS aware applications If TASKMGR was run later on it would use this API to instance the current bit DOS system environment create virtual DOS machines and run applications in them instead of using its own Real Mode task switcher support The multitasker was compatible with Windows so that tasks started before launching Windows could be seen as tasks under Windows as well br Novell DOS and Personal NetWare also shipped with NetWars a network enabled D arcade game br Novell DOS and Personal NetWare required several bug fix releases D xyy with x language yy number and were not completely stable when the next development occurred With beta versions of Microsoft s Chicago what would later become Windows in sight Novell wound down further development on Novell DOS in September and stopped maintenance in January after more than updates br br br After Novell br When Caldera approached Novell looking for a DOS operating system to bundle with their OpenLinux distribution Novell sold the product line off to Caldera on July by which time it was of little commercial value to them br Between the Caldera owned DR DOS and competition from IBM s PC DOS Microsoft moved to make it impossible to use or buy the subsequent Windows version Windows with any DOS product other than their own Claimed by them to be a purely technical change this was later to be the subject of a major lawsuit brought in Salt Lake City by Caldera with the help of the Canopy Group Microsoft lawyers tried repeatedly to have the case dismissed but without success Immediately after the completion of the pre trial deposition stage where the parties list the evidence they intend to present there was an out of court settlement on January for an undisclosed sum This was revealed in November to be million br In August the US based Caldera Inc was approached by Roger A Gross one of the original DR DOS engineers with a proposal to restart DR DOS development and to make Windows run on DR DOS which would help the court case Following a meeting in September in Lindon Utah USA between Gross Ransom H Love Bryan Wayne Sparks and Raymond John Noorda Gross was hired and tasked to set up a new subsidiary in the UK On September Caldera announced the coming release of OpenDOS COD and their intent to also release the source code to the system and Caldera UK Ltd was incorporated on September Gross hired some of the original developers of the operating system from the Novell EDC as well as some new talents to continue work on the operating system in a converted barn at the periphery of Andover Hampshire UK nearby the former Digital Research and Novell EDC Besides other improvements and enhancements all over the system a string of new key features were added subsequently over the course of the next two years including a TCP IP stack derived from LAN WorkPlace for DOS NetWare Mobile a graphical bit DOS Protected Mode HTML web browser DR WebSpyder originally based on source code from the Arachne web browser by Michal Pol k with LAN and modem dialup a POSIX Pthreads extension to the multi tasker by Andy T Wightman long filename LONGNAME support by Edward N Hill Jr as well as LBA and FAT support DRFAT by Matthias R Paul Gross also hired Andrew Schulman who had been with Geoff Chappell instrumental in identifying the AARD code in to work as a consultant and in Andover assist Paul in his work on WinGlue a secret project to create a version of DR DOS compatible with Windows and SE and replace its MS DOS xx component This was demonstrated at CeBIT in March and later in a small team developed into WinBolt both versions of DR DOS which remained unreleased as of but played an important role in the court case br Caldera UK officially released Caldera OpenDOS on February but this version was just Novell DOS update as of December compiled only with the necessary adaptations to incorporate the new name in display messages as well as in environment variables and file names It was missing a year s worth of patches which had been developed for the Novell DOS updates January to January This was due to parts of the Novell DOS sources having been lost at Novell meanwhile Consequently this version still reported an internal BDOS version of identical to Novell DOS The new suite also lacked the SETFIFO command which had been added with one of the Novell DOS updates as well as Fifth Generation s Search Destroy virus scanner and FastBack Plus utility which previously came bundled with Novell DOS Instead it came bundled with a newer version of PNUNPACK and brought a much advanced version of NetWars br Parts of OpenDOS were released as open source in form of the M R S kit for Machine Readable Sources in May but with license terms mostly incompatible with existing open source licenses The source was then closed again as Gross felt this would undermine the commercial aspirations of the system br After beta releases in September and November the next official release came in December with the name changed to Caldera DR OpenDOS soon followed by a further release in March when the DR DOS name returned as Caldera DR DOS now for the first time written with a hyphen Version now reporting itself as BDOS incorporated improved BIOS and BDOS issues developed by Paul adding many new boot and configuration options integrating many compatibility enhancements bug fixes and optimizations for size and speed and re implementing all fixes of the missing Novell DOS updates The BIOS improved the coexistence of DR DOS with Windows x and its support for third party disk compression drivers such as Microsoft s DriveSpace It introduced a diagnostics mode activated by Scroll Lock integrated debugger support with DEBUG ON and a debugger loaded before or from within CONFIG SYS and more flexible CONFIG SYS tracing capabilities via the F F F F hotkeys and the TRACE and TIMEOUT commands thereby also improving the integration of alternative command line shells such as DOS Together with LOADER SYS DR ext and the CHAIN directive it brought enhanced multi configuration support for DR D CONFIG ext files and came with enhancements to the BASIC like CONFIG SYS language for more powerful boot menus convenient user interaction and programmatical acting upon conditions CPU return codes and error levels ERROR ONERROR It also allowed to change the SCROLLOCK CAPSLOCK INSERT and VERIFY settings as well as the SWITCHAR YESCHAR NOCHAR and RESUMECHAR characters Various behavioural details could be controlled with new parameters Q Quiet L Lowercase Y Yes and S Switch for SWITCHES Further it provided optional support for a LPT device and allowed to configure the built in COMx and LPTx devices as well as to change the PRN and AUX defaults The handling of environment variables in CONFIG SYS was improved and new load high facilities included such as the HIFILES FILESHIGH and HIFCBS FCBSHIGH options to relocate file handles and FCB structures into UMBs which typically gave between and KB and up to KB more free conventional memory compared to previous versions or the HISHELL SHELLHIGH SIZE directive to control the pre allocation of HMA memory for COMMAND COM which helped to avoid memory fragmentation and thereby typically gave between and KB more continuous HMA memory for HMA capable third party drivers to work with in conjunction with third party command line shells which could not load into the HMA as COMMAND COM with its MH option At a reduced memory footprint version also brought an enhanced NLS xx sub system by Paul to allow multiple distributed and possibly user configured COUNTRY SYS files to be used by the system at the same time in a hierarchical model This also gave dynamic parser support for MS DOS PC DOS COUNTRY SYS file formats in addition to DR DOS own COUNTRY SYS formats and it introduced support for the ISO international date format including automatic detection and the then new Euro currency Some DR DOS files such as IBMBIO COM IBMDOS COM and COUNTRY SYS carried misleading file extensions for compatibility reasons with DR DOS they were enhanced to incorporate a fat binary style safety feature devised by Paul so that they would exit gracefully when called inappropriately DR DOS was fully Year compliant and provided special support to work with buggy system BIOSes It also came with an updated FDISK which could partition and format FAT volumes but not yet work with LBA The sources of the Novell patches for the external tools and drivers had meanwhile been found in Germany and could thus be retro fitted into the system as well so that DR DOS finally not only caught up with Novell DOS but was a true step forward The release was followed by various updates in June August and September br The updated internal BDOS version number introduced a new problem some legacy third party applications with special support for Novell DOS which were no longer being updated stopped working SETVER already allowed Novell DOS to disguise itself as DOS versions by file name and globally and specifying a magic sub version of it would even disable its own internal BDOS version check in order to cope with programs specifically probing for DR DOS The modified kernel and SETVER driver by Paul would in an hierarchical model also support load paths in order to distinguish between multiple executables of the same file name and it introduced an extended mode in which SETVER could not only fake DOS versions but also BDOS kernel versions Sub versions of to would be reported as DOS sub versions to to applications but with the BDOS version check disabled while sub versions to could be used to fake different BDOS versions whereas the DOS revision number typically set to in a static pre boot patchable data structure would be taken as the reported sub version instead so that SETVER G X would allow versions of DR DOS since to still report themselves as a DOS and with a faked BDOS version decimal hexadecimal thereby masquerading as Novell DOS OpenDOS br While otherwise beneficial the new HIFILES triggered a compatibility problem in the DOS UP feature of the third party memory manager QEMM which was hard wired to expect a chunk of five handle structures in conventional memory under DR DOS as with previous versions up to whereas version by design left eight handles in low memory when loading high files in order to maintain full compatibility with older versions of Windows xx Compatibility with Windows for Workgroups had not been affected by this A maintenance fix was devised to patch a single byte in IBMBIO COM in order to switch the behaviour and optionally re invoke the old chunking This freed some bytes of conventional memory and enabled full compatibility with DOS UP but at the same time broke compatibility with older versions of Windows xx when using the HIFILES feature and vice versa The patch named IBMBIO SCR continued to work with newer versions of DR DOS br In August the US based Caldera Inc created two new subsidiaries Caldera Systems Inc for the Linux business and Caldera Thin Clients Inc for the embedded and thin client market br Another version DR DOS still with BDOS and reporting itself to applications as PC DOS for compatibility purposes was pre released at Christmas and then officially released on January by Caldera UK It came with significantly improved memory managers in particular enhanced DPMI support in conjunction with the multitasker and other enhancements such as added DEVLOAD and DRMOUSE utilities but a changed OEM label in the boot sector of volumes formatted under DR DOS could also cause problems under other operating systems which can be circumvented by NOVOLTRK DR DOS would become the last version of DR DOS also tailored for desktop use br Caldera Inc wanted to relocate the DR DOS business into the US and closed the highly successful UK operation in February after Gross resigned and set up iCentrix to develop the MarioNet split web browser Development was then moved into the US which never worked out due to a total lack of expertise in this field at Caldera US and the DR DOS line fell to its branch company Caldera Thin Clients which was renamed Lineo Inc on July DR WebSpyder was renamed Embrowser and was said to be ported to Linux Lineo re released DR DOS in June and September still branded as Caldera DR DOS and without any changes but otherwise focussed on Linux for embedded systems based on a stripped down version of OpenLinux named Embedix br Among the latest and independently developed versions of DR DOS were OEM DR DOS as of August and as of November still branded as Caldera DR DOS These were variants of the system consisting only of the kernel and command shell With a specialized native implementation of FAT and large hard disk support they could be found bundled with Ontrack s Easy Recovery in replacing the dynamically loadable DRFAT redirector driver which still came with Easy Recovery They were also used for Seagate Technology s SeaTools and the CD imaging software Nero Burning ROM While still reporting a BDOS internally these were the first versions to report themselves as PC DOS to applications in order to indicate integrated FAT support Designed to be mostly backwards compatible the DR DOS IBMBIO COM could be combined with the DR DOS IBMDOS COM in order to give the desktop approved DR DOS kernel LBA capabilities and work with drives larger than GB For specific OEM requirements DR DOS as of December by Wightman combined the kernel files into a single binary executable so that similar to IO SYS of Windows it could be booted by MS DOS boot sectors but no longer by DR DOS boot sectors DR DOS with BDOS by Paul introduced new bootstrap loaders and updated disk tools in order to combine support for CHS and LBA disk access the FAT FAT and FAT file systems and the differing bootstrapping conventions of DR DOS PC DOS MS DOS Windows REAL and LOADER into a single NEWLDR MBR and boot sector so that the code would continue to load any version of DR DOS down to and since DR DOS also with FAT support but could also be used to launch the PC DOS or MS DOS system files including those of Windows x and PC DOS At the same time the kernel could not only be booted by the new sectors but also by any previously DR DOS formatted disks as well as off disks with existing PC DOS or MS DOS boot sectors and a variety of other boot loaders thereby easing the coexistence and setup of multi boot scenarios in conjunction with other operating systems br br br Later versions br In Lineo was bought out and some of Lineo s former managers purchased the name and formed a new company DRDOS Inc dba DeviceLogics L L C They have continued to sell DR DOS for use in embedded systems DR DOS was released on March featuring FAT and large disk support the ability to boot from ROM or Flash multitasking and a DPMI memory manager This version was based on the kernel from version br The company later released DR DOS with better FAT support in autumn This version was instead based on OpenDOS xx DR DOS was withdrawn for GPL violations see Controversies br Aside from selling copies of the operating system the DRDOS Inc website lists a buyout option for DR DOS the asking price is br US br The OpenDOS source code was a base for The DR DOS OpenDOS Enhancement Project set up in July in an attempt to bring the functionality of DR DOS up to parity with modern PC non Windows operating systems The project s added native support for large disks LBA and the FAT file system and several other enhancements including improved memory management and support for the new FAT file system extension which allows files of up to GB in size on normal FAT partitions DR DOS was released on July br br br Controversies br In October it was discovered that DR DOS included several utilities from FreeDOS as well as other sources and that the kernel was an outdated version of the Enhanced DR DOS kernel DR DOS Inc failed to comply with the GNU General Public License GPL by not crediting the FreeDOS utilities to their authors and including the source code After complaints from FreeDOS developers including the suggestion to provide the source code and hence comply with the GPL DR DOS Inc instead withdrew version and also the unaffected from its website br br br Commands br APPEND ASSIGN BATCH DBG DELQ ERA ERAQ MORE and SUBST have been among the internal commands supported since DR DOS DR DOS removed BATCH and added HILOAD GOSUB IDLE RETURN and SWITCH were added as internal commands with DR DOS ASSIGN and SUBST were changed to become external
