maintaining market leadership due to the rise of more innovative smartphone offerings from Apple Samsung and Google Due to various factors including the shift in the mobile market to smartphones and the poor choice of mobile operating systems Nokia was unable to maintain the popularity it once had back in the s Its initial partnership with Microsoft to use its operating system did not help either as Windows Phone s mobile app offerings were not as comprehensive as the ones available on Apple s iOS and Google s Android br At this point of time Nokia had a lineup of feature phones and a range of low to high end smartphones under the Microsoft Lumia and Nokia Asha product lines br By the early s Nokia had lost major market share in the mobile phone market and was overtaken by Apple and Samsung

brand primarily as a means of introducing its Windows Phone mobile operating system which was itself struggling to establish any kind of significant market presence The range of Microsoft Lumia smartphones did not gain significant traction in the highly competitive smartphone market dominated by Android and iOS devices There were further internal struggles as Microsoft tried to reconcile the Nokia brand with its own objectives under Microsoft Mobile By October Microsoft decided to drop the Nokia brand in favor of its Microsoft branded Lumia smartphone range with the release of Microsoft Lumia while only the featurephone segment kept the Nokia brand br br br Return to Nokia br The CEO of Nokia Rajeev Suri said in June that the Nokia brand would return to smartphones Earlier that year

diversify its portfolio This came to fruition with the release of the HMD Vibe as the first non Nokia HMD smartphone br br br Product naming br The product naming of Nokia devices has historically been based on the numerical system with new Nokia branded Android smartphones being named from to with Nokia series being the lowest end entry level smartphone and the Nokia series being the highest end offering of the portfolio For device successors and new products launched under the same series the decimal system similar to the naming convention of software versions is being used to denote the

Symbian operating system and making it open source In as competition stiffened Nokia lost some partners of the Symbian Foundation who then supported Google only By now Nokia planned to replace Symbian with the Linux based MeeGo after the N flagship As MeeGo and Android are based upon Linux some speculated that this would be a roadmap in Nokia s eventual adoption of Android br Under CEO Stephen Elop the company chose to halt the MeeGo project in favour of adopting Windows Phone which resulted in a partnership with Microsoft in with Symbian to be relegated Google s chief executive Eric Schmidt confirmed that the company held extensive confidential negotiations with Nokia to encourage using Android Despite this Nokia still experimented with Android that year and leaked images showed a Nokia N prototype running Android In late when Microsoft announced its intention to purchase the Nokia mobile phone division the New York Times reported that a team at Nokia were secretly testing Android on Microsoft Lumia devices but that Microsoft was aware of this Some analysts think Microsoft bought the business because Nokia were thinking of switching to Android which could have resulted in Microsoft losing its dominant Windows Phone OEM In December there were leaks of a Nokia Android smartphone codenamed Normandy along with the cancelled Meltineme Project on Lumia hardware which was eventually introduced as the Nokia X series in February featuring a heavily customized version of the Android Open Source Project AOSP and released in emerging markets The acquisition was completed
