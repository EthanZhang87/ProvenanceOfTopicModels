id: 14260687
A mobile operating system is an operating system used for smartphones tablets smartwatches smartglasses or other non laptop personal mobile computing devices While computers such as typical mobile laptops are mobile the operating systems used on them are generally not considered mobile as they were originally designed for desktop computers that historically did not have or need specific mobile features This line distinguishing mobile and other forms has become blurred in recent years due to the fact that newer devices have become smaller and more mobile unlike hardware of the past Key notabilities blurring this line are the introduction of tablet computers light laptops and the hybridization of the two in in PCs br Mobile operating systems combine features of a desktop computer operating system with other features useful for mobile or handheld use and usually including a wireless inbuilt modem and SIM tray for telephone and data connection In Q over million smartphones were

desktop operating system Microsoft Windows and in general smartphone use even without tablets outnumbers desktop use br Mobile devices with mobile communications abilities e g smartphones contain two mobile operating systems the main user facing software platform is supplemented by a second low level proprietary real time operating system which operates the radio and other hardware Research has
