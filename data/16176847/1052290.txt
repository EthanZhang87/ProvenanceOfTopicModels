title: Newton OS
id: 1052290
Newton OS is a discontinued operating system for the Apple Newton PDAs produced by Apple Computer Inc between and It was written entirely in C and trimmed to be low power consuming and use the available memory efficiently Many applications were pre installed in the ROM of the Newton making for quick start up to save on RAM and flash memory storage for user applications br br br Features br Newton OS features many interface elements that the Macintosh system software didn t have at the time such as drawers and the poof animation An animation similar to this is found in Mac OS X and parts of the Newton s handwriting recognition system have been implemented as Inkwell in Mac OS X br br Sound responsive Clicking menus and icons makes a sound this feature was later introduced in Mac OS br Icons Similar to the Macintosh Desktop metaphor Newton OS uses icons to open applications br Tabbed documents Similar to tabbed browsing in today s browsers and Apple s At Ease interface documents titles appear in a small tab at the top right hand of the screen br Screen rotation In Newton the screen can be rotated to be used for drawing or word processing br File documents Notes and Drawings can be categorized E g Fun Business Personal etc br Print documents Documents on the Newton can be printed br Send documents Documents can be sent to another Newton via Infrared technology or sent using the Internet by E Mail or faxed br Menus Similar to menus seen in Mac OS but menu titles are instead presented at the bottom of the screen in small rectangles making them similar to buttons with attached pop up menus br Many features of the Newton are best appreciated in the context of the history of Pen computing br br br Software br Shortly after the Newton PDA s release in developers were not paying much attention to the new Newton OS API and were still more interested in developing for the Macintosh and Windows platforms It was not until two years later that developers saw a potential market available to them in creating software for Newton OS Several programs were made by third party developers including software to enhance the disappointing hand writing recognition technology of Newton OS x br The basic software that came with Newton OS br br Works A program for drawing and word processing with typical capabilities such as rulers margins page breaks formatting printing spell checking and find replace tools br Notes Used for checklists as well as both drawing and writing in the same program either with a newton keyboard or a stylus pen br Dates Calendar program where you can schedule appointments and other special events br Names Program for storing extensive contacts information in a flexible format br Formulas Program that offers metric conversions currency conversions loan and mortgage calculators etc br Calculator A basic calculator with square root percentage MR M and M functions additional to the basic functions found on a calculator br Clock A small floating window type application known as a desktop accessory on the Macintosh The Newton clock also includes features for an alarm minute timer and the date br Book Reader Support for displaying electronic books is built in br br br Version history br br br Handwriting recognition br The Newton uses the CalliGrapher word based handwriting recognition engine developed by ParaGraph International Inc led by former Soviet scientist Stepan Pachikov br The earliest versions had weaknesses that resulted in bad publicity and reviews However with the release of Newton PDAs based upon version of the OS the handwriting recognition substantially improved partially being a product of ParaGraph and an Apple created recognizer pair Apple s Rosetta and Mondello Newton s handwriting recognition particularly the print recognizer has been considered by many reviewers testers and users to be the best in the industry even years after it was introduced It was developed by Apple s Advanced Technology Group and was described in as the world s first genuinely usable handwriting recognition system br The Newton can recognize hand printed text cursive or a mix of the two and can also accept free hand Sketches Shapes and ink text Text can also be entered by tapping with the stylus on a small on screen pop up QWERTY keyboard With Shapes Newton can recognize that the user was attempting to draw a circle a line a polygon etc and it cleans them up into perfect vector representations with modifiable control points and defined vertices of what the user is attempting to draw Shapes and Sketches can be scaled or deformed once drawn Ink text captures the user s free hand writing but allows it to be treated somewhat like recognized text when manipulating for later editing purposes ink text supported word wrap could be formatted to be bold italic etc At any time a user can also direct the Newton to recognize selected ink text and turn it into recognized text deferred recognition A Newton Note document or the notes attached to each contact in Names and each calendar event can contain any mix of interleaved text ink text Shapes and Sketches br br br NewtonScript br br Newton OS runs applications written in C along with an interpreted user friendly language called NewtonScript These applications are stored in packages br br br Timeline br br br See also br Apple
