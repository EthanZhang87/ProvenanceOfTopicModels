the import export industry used electronic customs clearance data which is published by U S Customs and Border Protection pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act to detect the arrival of the iPhone G prior to Apple s announcement br br br Software br br The iPhone G came preloaded with the latest version of iOS and continued to receive updates to its software for over two years with major iterations released on an annual basis However the phone had access to a decreasing proportion of new features with each update as its hardware became superseded by later models br When it was

set a home screen wallpaper or Bluetooth keyboard support However it does provide access to a unified mailbox feature home screen folders to better organize apps playlist creation and other

provide iPhone G owners with access to important features in this case the Game Center application br On November the iPhone G received the iOS software update as iOS which introduced features such as YouTube voting and security fixes However the iPhone G is unable to use many features included in this update such as AirPlay and Safari Text Search This is the last iOS release to support this iPhone model iOS and later are not compatible with this iPhone model due to hardware limitations and performance issues br Virtually all apps released after the release of iOS in late September do not run on the iPhone G as the software development kit SDK was changed to no longer allow the targeting minimum of iOS versions older than including x and up to or ARMv devices first two generations br br br Hardware br br br Design br br The iPhone G s back featured a redesigned polycarbonate plastic housing replacing the aluminum back of the first generation Buttons were changed from plastic to metal and the edges of the phone were tapered providing a better grip The iPhone G introduced the first official color options for the outer casing with the GB version available in black and white br The dimensions of the iPhone G were marginally larger than those of the original iPhone It was millimetres in high millimetres in wide and millimetres in deep compared to its predecessor which was millimetres in high millimetres in wide and millimetres in deep br The iPhone G sported a in mm capacitive touchscreen with a HVGA resolution at ppi The scratch resistant glass sits on top of the display Just like the original iPhone the touchscreen was designed for a bare finger or multiple fingers for multi touch sensing br The device featured the same sensors as its predecessor The proximity sensor which deactivates the display during calls when the face is near was repositioned to save battery power and to prevent inadvertent inputs from the user s face and ears An ambient light sensor was included to adjust the display brightness for different lighting conditions which helps save battery power A axis accelerometer was included to sense the orientation of the phone and change the screen accordingly allowing the user to easily switch between portrait and landscape mode br br br Processor and memory br Most of the iPhone G s internal hardware is based on the original iPhone It includes a Samsung bit RISC ARM MHz processor underclocked to MHz a PowerVR MBX Lite D GPU and MB of package on package PoP DRAM as the original iPhone did br br br Rear camera br On the

supports Assisted GPS G data and tri band UMTS HSDPA These enhancements allow faster data downloads and turn by turn navigation with maps compared to previous devices br Like its predecessor the iPhone G features a proprietary pin dock connector for charging the device It can also be used to synchronize the device with a computer and to connect various accessories br The iPhone G features a flush mounted mm headphone jack instead of the recessed headphone jack that was included on the original iPhone it could therefore be used with any headphones other than those provided by Apple br br br Battery br The iPhone G features an internal rechargeable battery rated at mAh which like its predecessor is not user replaceable Apple stated that the iPhone G s battery is capable of providing up to six hours of web browsing via Wi Fi or five hours via G or hours of audio playback Alternatively it is said to provide hours of standby time br br br Reception br br Walt Mossberg of The Wall Street Journal described the device as a more capable version of an already excellent device However he said that it had hidden costs br br br Issues br br br Dropped calls and slow web connections br Shortly after its release the iPhone G faced criticism for frequent dropped calls and sluggish web browsing experiences Investigations by various sources pointed towards a specific chip within the phone as the culprit for these connectivity problems br Apple addressed these issues through a software update avoiding the need for a more drastic measure like a product recall This update presumably addressed the problematic chip s behavior improving call quality and internet connection speeds for iPhone G users br While user reports indicated connectivity issues AT T the primary carrier for the iPhone G at the time offered a contrasting perspective In a statement they said Overall the new iPhone is performing just great on our G network br br br Battery drain br iOS which was still compatible with the iPhone G was released on June An article in the Wall Street Journal s Digits column on July reported that iPhone G phones updating to iOS responded slowly had diminished battery life and became excessively hot br br br See also br List of iPhone models br Comparison of smartphones br Timeline of iPhone models br br br br br br External links br iPhone G Technical
