Mac OS X Tiger also had a number of additional features that Microsoft had spent several years struggling to add to Windows with acceptable performance such as fast file search and improved graphics processing br Mac OS X Tiger was included with all new Macs and was also available as an upgrade for existing Mac OS X users or users of supported pre Mac OS X systems The server edition Mac OS X Server was also available for some Macintosh product lines Six weeks after the official release Apple had delivered million copies of Mac OS X Tiger representing of all Mac OS X users Apple claimed that Mac OS X Tiger was the most successful Apple OS release in the company s history At the WWDC on June Apple s CEO Steve Jobs announced that out of the million Mac OS X users more than were using Mac OS X Tiger br Apple announced a transition to Intel x processors during Mac OS X Tiger s lifetime making it the first Apple operating system to work on Apple Intel architecture machines The original Apple TV released in March of shipped with a customized version of Mac OS X Tiger branded Apple TV OS that replaced the usual GUI with an updated version of Front Row br Mac OS X Tiger was succeeded by Mac OS X Leopard on October after months making Mac OS X Tiger the longest running version of Mac OS X The last security update released for Mac OS X Tiger users was the update The latest supported version of QuickTime is The latest version of iTunes that can run on Mac OS X Tiger is Safari is the final version for Mac OS X Tiger br Despite not having received security updates since Mac OS X Tiger remains popular with Power Mac users and retrocomputing enthusiasts due to its wide software and hardware compatibility as it is the last Mac OS X version to support the Classic Environment a Mac OS compatibility layer and PowerPC G processors br br br System requirements br Mac OS X Tiger was initially available in a PowerPC edition with an Intel edition released beginning at Mac OS X Tiger There is no universal version of the client operating system although Mac OS X Tiger Server was made available on a universal DVD from version Mac OS X Tiger While Apple shipped the PowerPC edition bundled with PowerPC based Macs and also sold it as a separate retail box the only way to obtain the Intel version was to buy an Intel based Mac bundled with it However it was possible to buy the restore DVDs containing the Intel version through unofficial channels such as eBay and officially through Apple if one could provide proof of purchase of the appropriate Intel Mac These grey colored restore DVDs supplied with new Macs are designed to only restore on the model of Mac that they are intended for However they can be modified to work on any Intel Mac The retail PowerPC only DVD can be used on any PowerPC based Mac supported by Mac OS X Tiger br The system requirements of the PowerPC edition are br br Macintosh computer with a PowerPC G G or G family processor br

overrides the checks made at the beginning of the installation process Likewise machines such as beige Power Mac G s and Wall Street PowerBook G s that were dropped by Mac OS X Panther can also be made to run both Mac OS X Panther and Mac OS X Tiger in this way Also Mac OS X Tiger can be installed on unsupported New World ROM Macs by installing it on a supported Mac then swapping hard drives Old World ROM Macs require the use of XPostFacto to install Mac OS X Tiger br Mac OS X Tiger was the last version of Mac OS X to support the PowerPC G family of processors br br br History br The name

is a developer application for testing and mixing Audio Units br br br Improvements br An upgraded kernel with optimized kernel resource locking and access control lists and with support for bit userland address spaces on machines with bit processors br An updated libSystem with both bit and bit versions combined with the aforementioned kernel change this allows individual applications to address more than GB of memory when run on bit processors although an application using Apple libraries or frameworks other than libSystem would need to have two processes one running the bit code and one running the code that requires other libraries and frameworks br A new startup daemon called launchd that allows for faster booting br The printing dialog in Tiger now features a drop down menu for creating PDFs sending PDFs to Mail and other PDF related actions However the user interface was criticized for creating a hybrid UI element that looks like a plain button but acts like a pop up

Tiger is also the first version of Mac OS X to include the Zoom screen magnifier functionality br br br Tiger trademark lawsuit br Shortly before the release of Mac OS X Tiger the computer retailer TigerDirect com Inc filed a lawsuit against Apple alleging that Apple infringed TigerDirect com s trademark with the Mac OS X Tiger operating system br The following is a quotation from TigerDirect com s court memorandum br br Apple Computer s use of its infringing family of Tiger marks to expand sales of products besides its operating system software is already evident for example Apple Computer is offering free iPods and laptops as part of its Tiger World Premiere giveaway In short notwithstanding its representation to the PTO that it would only use Tiger in connection with their unique computer operating system software Apple Computer has in recent weeks used a family of Tiger marks in connection with a substantially broader group of products and services including the very products and services currently offered by Tiger Direct under its famous family of Tiger marks br In TigerDirect was denied a preliminary injunction that would have prevented Apple from using the mark while the case was decided Apple and TigerDirect reached a settlement in after which TigerDirect withdrew its opposition br br br Support for Intel processors br br At Apple s Worldwide Developers Conference CEO Steve Jobs announced that the company would begin selling Mac computers with Intel x processors in To allow developers to begin producing software for these Intel based Macs Apple made available a prototype Intel based Mac Developer Transition Kit that included a version of Mac OS X v compiled to run on x processors br This build included Apple s Rosetta compatibility layer a translation process that allows x based Macs to run software built only for PowerPC with a moderate performance penalty This is contrasted with the contemporary Mac OS Classic mode which used comparably larger amounts of system resources br Soon after the Developer Transition Kits began shipping copies of Tiger x were leaked onto file sharing networks Although Apple had implemented a Trusted Computing DRM scheme in the transition hardware and OS in an attempt to stop people installing Tiger x on non Apple PCs the OSx project soon managed to remove this restriction As Apple released each update with newer safeguards to prevent its use on non Apple hardware unofficially modified versions were released that circumvented Apple s safeguards However with the release of and the unofficially modified versions continued to use the kernel from because later kernels have hardware locks and depend heavily on EFI By late the kernel had been cracked br At MacWorld San Francisco Jobs announced the immediate availability of Mac OS X v the first publicly available release of Tiger compiled for both PowerPC and Intel x based machines This version was the first version other than the version provided with the Developer Transition Kits to include Rosetta br br br Release history br br br Timeline br br br br br br External links br Mac OS X Tiger at the Wayback Machine archived
