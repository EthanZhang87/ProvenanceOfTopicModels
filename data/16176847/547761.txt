MkLinux for Microkernel Linux is an open source software computer operating system begun by the Open Software Foundation Research Institute and Apple Computer in February to port Linux to the PowerPC platform and Macintosh computers The name refers to the Linux kernel being adapted to run as a server hosted on the Mach microkernel version br br br History br br MkLinux started as a project sponsored by Apple Computer and OSF Research Institute to get Linux on Mach ported to the Macintosh computer and for Apple to explore alternative kernel technologies on the Mac platform At the time there was no officially sponsored PowerPC port of Linux and none specifically for Macintosh hardware The OSF Institute owner of the Mach microkernel and several other Unix based technologies was interested in promoting Mach on other platforms Unlike the design of the later macOS versions and newer not to be confused with the contemporaneous Mac OS versions and older MkLinux was designed to take full advantage of the Mach microkernel br The effort was spearheaded by Apple s VP of Development Tools Ike Nassi and Brett Halle at Apple and development was later split between two main people Michael Burg on device drivers and distribution at Apple in Cupertino California and Nick Stephen on Mach porting and development at the OSF in Grenoble France Other key individuals to work on the project included Fran ois Barbou at OSF and Vicki Brown and Gilbert Coville at Apple br MkLinux was officially announced at the World Wide Developers Conference WWDC A free CD containing a binary distribution of MkLinux was handed out to the attendees br In mid the community led MkLinux Developers Association took over development of the operating system br The MkLinux distribution was too large for casual users to have downloaded via the slow dial up Internet access of the day even using k modems However the official CDs were available in a book from Prime Time Freeware published in English and in Japanese The book covers installation management and use of the OS and serves as a hardcopy manual br Apple later released the Open Firmware based Power Macintosh computers an official PowerPC branch of the Linux kernel was created and was spearheaded by the LinuxPPC project MkLinux and LinuxPPC developers traded a lot of ideas back and forth as both worked on their own ways of running Linux Debian also released a traditional monolithic kernel distribution for PowerPC as did SUSE and Terra Soft Solutions with Yellow Dog Linux br When Apple dropped support for MkLinux the developer community struggled to improve the Mach kernel and to support various Power Macintosh models MkLinux continued to be the only option for Macintosh NuBus computers until June when PPC Linux for NuBus Power Macs was released br br br Reception br MacTech magazine observed this of the general state of Linux on Macintosh in Seen as a Windows NT or commercial Unix killer in some circles Linux also promises to give the Mac OS a boost in the right direction and might even give Mac OS X Server a run for its money among Apple shops The installation process was seen as either smooth as silk or very very rough and that it can also be slightly more difficult to recompile the MkLinux kernel because of the extra steps to placate the Mach microkernel MkLinux had greater hardware compatibility than LinuxPPC at the time supporting both NuBus and PCI Macintosh systems whereas LinuxPPC only supports PCI Compared to LinuxPPC MkLinux was generally known as having a performance cost due to the overhead of the Mach kernel The Linux environment was found to provide a potentially adequate desktop suite but one that forgoes the entire Macintosh experience in favor of pure Linux br br br Legacy br MkLinux is the first official attempt by Apple to support a free and open source software project The work done with the Mach kernel in MkLinux is said to have been extremely helpful in the initial porting of NeXTSTEP to the Macintosh hardware platform which would later become macOS br br OS X is based on the Mach microkernel designed by Carnegie Mellon University and later adapted to the Power Macintosh by Apple and the Open Software Foundation Research Institute now part of Silicomp This was known as osfmk and was part of MkLinux http www mklinux org Later this and code from OSF s commercial development efforts were incorporated into Darwin s kernel Throughout this evolutionary process the Mach APIs used in OS X diverged in many ways from the original CMU Mach APIs br You may find older versions of the Mach source code interesting both to satisfy historical curiosity and to avoid remaking mistakes made in earlier implementations br br br Releases br br br See also br br L Linux br Darwin operating system br PureDarwin br Copland operating system br Taligent br Workplace OS br br br br br br External links br Official website
