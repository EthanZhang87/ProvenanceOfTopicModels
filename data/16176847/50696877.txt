his review The Verge s Dieter Bohn wrote that the new features introduced in iOS are an evolution of some of the design and interaction ideas that Apple has been working on for a couple of years He wrote that iMessage is becoming a platform all its own and although he liked that extensions mean access to information from apps without needing to open the respective apps he wrote that new iMessage interface is difficult to understand and that the use of third party apps stickers crazy confetti effects and emoji all over the place is a nightmare although finishing with Or maybe that s a wonderland not a nightmare Your call Regarding third party support in Siri he called it great while noting the limited class of apps calls messaging payments photos ride sharing apps some CarPlay systems and workouts and that sometimes a button press was required to complete the process Beyond app integrations he criticized Siri writing Siri doesn t seem to have gotten a whole lot smarter than you remember Bohn enjoyed the new machine learning technology present in the Photos app writing that he was impressed by Apple s image recognition technology which he noted is done locally on the device but did criticize the error rate where he compares the technology to Google Photos as a step ahead Bohn liked the new designs for the Music and Maps apps saying both the redesigns were for the better Bohn particularly enjoyed the new lock screen where he highlighted that notification bubbles can be D Touch ed to access more information all without needing to unlock the phone Other small bits of new features he liked included deletable apps upgraded widgets when D Touch ing a home screen icon and breaking news notifications in Apple News Overall Bohn referred to iOS as Still a walled garden but with more doors br Engadget s Devindra Hardawar wrote that iOS is Apple basically polishing a pearl Hardawar noted that the major changes in the release focus on features rather than the visual interface He wrote that the lock screen is now far more customizable than before He praised the new features added to D Touch writing that it finally feels useful where he likes that D Touch works in almost every part of the OS In regard to iMessage he wrote that it has new features that are particularly useful including Invisible ink that obscures text in a conversation when others might be looking but criticized the user interface writing that it needs some work The Memories feature in the new Photos app usually turned out well but wrote that they re still clearly a work in progress Hardawar praised the new Apple Music app but added that really anything is better than the last iteration He also liked lyrics support He wrote that Siri s third party support was actually starting to get useful but did run into accuracy issues He finished by writing that although iOS does add features seen in Google s Android operating system before the mobile industry is shamelessly getting inspired by the competition His summary states that iOS is a collection of useful changes to an already solid OS br In October a month after its initial release of iOS devices were running iOS a slightly slower migration than for the release of iOS in the preceding year a result speculated by MacRumors s Tim Hardwick as being caused by an early release issue that disabled some devices and may have put some users off downloading the update User adoption increased to of active devices in January in February in June in July and in September before the release of iOS br br br Problems br br br Recovery mode issues br The initial public release of iOS on September saw many iPhones and iPads sent into recovery mode by the over the air update requiring devices to be connected to a Mac or PC with iTunes in order to retry the update or restore the device to factory settings Apple very shortly after released iOS and issued an apology br br br Local backup encryption issue br In September it was discovered that the encryption of local iOS backups made with iTunes is weaker for iOS devices than for devices running iOS Russian software firm ElcomSoft discovered that the iOS backup process skips several security checks making it approximately times faster to try passwords enabling million password tries per second compared to the password tries per second for the same process ElcomSoft has used on iOS The firm stated that the impact is severe Apple acknowledged the problem said it planned to issue a security update but also stated that iCloud backups were not affected The iOS update subsequently fixed the issue br br br Battery shutdowns and throttling br Some iOS users reported that their devices were prone to unexpectedly shutting down at or around battery charge with one user describing the battery percentage as dropping unexpectedly from to before doing so but still registering as when plugging it in to charge it Apple began the process of diagnosing this bug in iOS and stated following the release of iOS that it had reduced the occurrence of these shutdowns by more than on iPhone S models and over on iPhone models It also became possible to reboot the device after an unexpected shutdown without plugging it into power br In December speculation emerged that Apple had been intentionally throttling the performance of older iPhone models based on battery health especially on the iPhone S which in a separate issue also had isolated incidents of a battery manufacturing issue that was also causing system instability after a user benchmark showed a variance in performance after a battery replacement The developers of Geekbench confirmed that there had been sizable decreases on benchmark scores on iPhone devices running iOS and later and iPhone devices since iOS and later These led to concerns that Apple was instituting planned obsolescence policies in order to encourage sales of newer iPhone models a controversy dubbed Batterygate br Later that month Apple admitted that since iOS it had been implementing performance management techniques on older iPhone models to preserve system stability especially in situations where their batteries are less capable of supplying peak current demands such as cold weather age or low charge Apple stated that these measures were intended to help deliver the best experience for customers which includes overall performance and prolonging the life of their devices The company announced that it would offer a discount on out of warranty battery replacements during br br br Supported devices br iOS supports devices with an Apple A or higher SoC and drops support on Apple A and A X devices including the iPhone s iPad iPad rd generation iPad Mini st generation and iPod Touch th generation The iPhone c and the iPad th generation have limited support while all bit devices compatible with iOS are fully supported It is the last version of iOS to support bit apps and devices with bit processors br br br
