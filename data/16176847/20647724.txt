The Newton is a series of personal digital assistants PDAs developed and marketed by Apple Computer Inc An early device in the PDA category the Newton originated the term it was the first to feature handwriting recognition Apple started developing the platform in and shipped the first devices in August Production officially ended on February Newton devices ran on a proprietary operating system Newton OS examples include Apple s MessagePad series and the eMate and other companies also released devices running on Newton OS Most Newton devices were based on the ARM RISC processor and all featured handwriting based input br The Newton was considered technologically innovative at its debut but a combination of factors including its high price and early problems with its handwriting recognition feature limited its sales This led to Apple ultimately discontinuing the platform at the direction of Steve Jobs in a year after his return to the company br br br Development br br The Newton project was a personal digital assistant platform The PDA category did not exist for most of Newton s genesis and the phrase personal digital assistant was coined relatively late in the development cycle by Apple s CEO John Sculley the driving force behind the project Larry Tesler determined that an advanced low power processor was needed for sophisticated graphics manipulation He found Hermann Hauser co founder of Acorn Computers which had developed the Acorn RISC Machine as first ARM architecture device and put together Advanced RISC Machines now Arm Ltd br A smaller device was then designed by Jonathan Ive br Although PDAs had been developing since the original Psion Organiser in the Newton has left one particular lasting impression the term personal digital assistant was coined to refer to the Newton br According to former Apple CEO John Sculley the company invested approximately million to develop Newton br br br Later history and cancellation br The Newton was considered innovative at its debut but it suffered from its high price and problems with the handwriting recognition element its most anticipated feature The handwriting software was barely ready by and its tendency to misread characters was widely derided in the media This was parodied in The Simpsons episode Lisa on Ice where a scene makes fun of the Newton s handwriting recognition turning Beat up Martin into Eat up Martha Garry Trudeau also mocked the Newton in a weeklong arc of his comic strip Doonesbury portraying it as a costly toy that served the same function as a cheap notepad and using its accuracy problems to humorous effect In one panel Michael Doonesbury s Newton misreads the words Catching on as Egg Freckles a phrase that became widely repeated as symbolic of the Newton s problems This phrase was subsequently included as a trigger for an Easter egg in later editions of the MessagePad producing a panel from the strip when it was entered on the device In acknowledgement of the strip Apple subsequently gifted a MessagePad to Trudeau Although the software improved substantially in Newton OS it was not enough to inspire strong sales br The Newton became popular in some industries notably the medical field However the debut of the competing Palm Pilot substantially reduced its market share Apple struggled to find a new direction for the Newton and when Steve Jobs returned to the company in he killed the product line He was critical of the device s weak performance the management of the development team and the stylus which he disliked as it prevented the use of the fingers Furthermore with Apple already suffering heavy losses which jeopardized its survival this made the unprofitable Newton a tempting target to axe Jobs was likely also motivated by the fact that the Newton was the pet project of his old adversary John Sculley br However Jobs saw potential in the technology and concept if not the execution and eventually led Apple to create its multi touch devices inspired by FingerWorks the iPhone and iPad br br br Product details br br br Application software br Most Newton devices were pre loaded with a variety of software to aid in personal data organization and management This included such applications as Notes Names and Dates as well as a variety of productivity tools such as a calculator conversion calculators metric conversions currency conversions etc time zone maps etc In later x versions of the Newton OS these applications were refined and new ones were added such as the Works word processor and the Newton Internet Enabler as well as the inclusion of bundled rd party applications such as the QuickFigure Works spreadsheet a lite version of Pelicanware s QuickFigure Pro Pocket Quicken the NetHopper web browser and the Netstrategy EnRoute email client Various Newton applications had full import export capabilities with popular desktop office suite and PIM Personal Information Manager application file formats primarily by making use of Apple s bundled Newton Connection Utilities and also the Newton Connection Kit which was sold separately and only worked for Newton devices that used the x versions of the Newton OS br br br Notes br The Notes application allowed users to create small documents that could contain text that had been typed or that had been recognized from handwriting as well as free hand sketches Shapes and ink text br br In version of the Newton OS the Notes application as well as Names could accept what Apple termed stationery rd party created plug in modules that could extend the functionality of the basic applications br One of the new types of Notes stationery added to Newton OS was a hierarchical bullet ed collapsible multi line Checklist an implementation of outliner software This could be used for organizing tasks to do lists sub tasks etc Each bullet point could contain as many lines of text as desired A bullet point could be dragged and placed underneath another bullet point thus forming a hierarchical outline tree When a bullet point was dragged the entire sub tree of child bullet points underneath it if any would be dragged along as well If a bullet point had child bullet points tapping the parent s bullet point once would roll up all the children windowshade effect Tapping the parent bullet point again would make the children re appear Because this functionality arrived in Newton OS several third parties made similar software before for OS x Newton machines the most notable of which was Dyno Notepad released in br br br Names br The Names application was used for storing contacts Contacts created either on the Newton device or on a Windows or Macintosh desktop PIM could be synchronized to each other Entering a date in Names for fields such as birthday or anniversary automatically created corresponding repeating events in the Dates application Each contact had an attached free form notes field available to it that could contain any mix of interleaved text ink text Shapes or Sketches Like Notes Names could be extended by developers to create special new categories of contacts with specialized pre defined fields Names shipped with three types of contacts people companies and groups but a developer could define new types for instance client patient etc Stand Alone Software Inc also created a Newton software package called the Stationery Construction Kit which allowed users to make stationery themselves without aid of any other tools br br br Dates br Dates supplied calendar events meeting and alarms functions including an integrated to do list manager It offered many different display and navigation styles including a list view graphical day time blocking view or a week month or year grid As with Names and Notes Dates items created either on the Newton or on a Windows or Macintosh desktop PIM could be synchronized to each other br br br Hardware models br br From Apple br br MessagePad also

Smith Some programmers complained about the cost of the Toolbox programming environment Additionally it required learning a new way of programming br br br Newton technology after cancellation br br br Before the Newton project was canceled it was spun off into an Apple wholly owned subsidiary company Newton Inc br Speculation continued for several years that Apple might release a new PDA with some Newton technology or collaborate with Palm Feeding a bit of speculation Apple put the Print Recognizer part of the Newton handwriting recognition system into Mac OS X Jaguar It can be used with graphics tablets to seamlessly input handwritten printed text anywhere there was an insertion point on the screen This technology known as Inkwell appears in the System Preferences whenever a tablet input device is plugged in Larry Yaeger was the author of the original Rosetta recognizer on the Newton and was also responsible for porting it to Mac OS X br At an All Things Digital conference in Steve Jobs made reference to a new Apple PDA which the company had developed but had decided not to bring to market br br br Newton emulation br Since the Einstein Project has been working on emulating the Newton for use as an alternative OS on other platforms It is currently available for the Sharp Zaurus Apple s Mac OS X Nokia Maemo Microsoft Windows and the Pepper Pad The emulator is an open source project but requires an original Newton ROM to be installed in order to function iPhones and iPads run Einstein since September The Android operating system runs Einstein since March br br br Future br A possible Newton revival was at one time a common source of speculation among the Macintosh user base Patent applications were issued for a tablet based Macintosh br In September Michael Tchao who pitched the original Newton concept to John Sculley returned to Apple Michael Tchao is now the VP of iPad Product Marketing br br br Development br Programs have been written for the Newton since its cancellation including an RSS reader br br br In popular culture br The Apple Newton and its poor handwriting recognition was lampooned on the episode of The Simpsons titled Lisa on Ice in br In the anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion handheld devices modeled on the Newton can be seen multiple times serving various internal functions within NERV br In the film Under Siege Dark Territory the main character Casey Ryback Steven Seagal connects an Apple Newton PDA to the telephone network of the hijacked train on which the film is set and sends a fax to his workplace which is then forwarded to Admiral Bates Ryback s contact at the Pentagon The hijackers subsequently discover and hack the Newton thus learning of Ryback s presence on the train br In the interactive video game The X Files Game the main character uses an Apple Newton to make notes read e mail and navigate the different locations of the game br During Apple s March keynote conference a celebration video called Years in Seconds was unveiled The video featured flashing text of names from Apple s most notable products and taglines in their forty year history including Newton However in Newton s case it was the only name depicted in the video being explicitly scratched out mimicking how users deleted text on the device and referencing the full cancellation of the product line br In the TV series For
