The iOS SDK iOS Software Development Kit formerly the iPhone SDK is a software development kit SDK developed by Apple Inc The kit allows for the development of mobile apps on Apple s iOS and iPadOS operating systems br The iOS SDK is a free download for users of Macintosh or Mac personal computers It is not available for Microsoft Windows PCs The SDK contains sets giving developers access to various functions and services of iOS devices such as hardware and software attributes It also contains an iPhone simulator to mimic the look and feel of the device on the computer while developing New versions of the SDK accompany new versions of iOS In order to test applications get technical support and distribute apps through App Store developers are required to subscribe to the Apple Developer Program br Combined with Xcode the iOS SDK helps developers write iOS apps using officially supported programming languages including Swift and Objective C Other companies have also created tools that allow for the development of native iOS apps using their respective programming languages br br br History br While originally developing iPhone prior to its unveiling in Apple s then CEO Steve Jobs did not intend to let third party developers build native apps for the iOS operating system instead directing them to make web applications for the Safari web browser However backlash from developers prompted the company to reconsider with Jobs announcing on October that Apple would have a software development kit SDK available for developers by February The SDK was released on March br br br Features br The iOS SDK is a free download for Mac users It is not available for Microsoft Windows personal computers To test the application get technical support and distribute applications through App Store developers are required to subscribe to the Apple Developer Program br The SDK contents are separated into the following sets br br Cocoa Touch br Multi touch events and controls br Accelerometer support br View hierarchy br Localization i n br Camera support br Media br OpenAL br audio mixing and recording br Video playback br Image file formats br Quartz br Core Animation br OpenGL ES br Core Services br Networking br Embedded SQLite database br Core Location br Threads br CoreMotion br Mac OS X Kernel br TCP IP br Sockets br Power management br File system br Security br The SDK also contains an iPhone simulator a program used to simulate the look and feel of iPhone on the developer s computer br New SDK versions accompany new iOS versions br br br Programming languages br The iOS SDK combined with Xcode helps developers write iOS applications using officially supported programming languages including Swift and Objective C br An ipa iOS App Store Package file is an iOS application archive file which stores an iOS app br br br Java br In Sun Microsystems announced plans to release a Java Virtual Machine JVM for iOS based on the Java Platform Micro Edition version of Java This would enable Java applications to run on iPhone and iPod Touch Soon after the announcement developers familiar with the SDK s terms of agreement believed that by not allowing third party applications to run in the background answer a phone call and still run the application for example and not allowing an application to download code from another source nor allowing an application to interact with a third party application Sun s development efforts could be hindered without Apple s cooperation Sun also worked with a third party company called Innaworks in attempts to get Java on iPhone Despite the apparent lack of interest from Apple a firmware leak of the iPhone release revealed an ARM chip with a processor with Jazelle support for embedded Java execution br br br NET br Novell announced in September that they had successfully developed MonoTouch a software framework that let developers write native iPhone applications in the C and NET programming languages while still maintaining compatibility with Apple s requirements br br br Flash br iOS does not support Adobe Flash and although Adobe has two versions of its software Flash and Flash Lite Apple views neither as suitable for the iPhone claiming that full Flash is too slow to be useful and Flash Lite to be not capable of being used with the Web br In October Adobe announced that an upcoming update to its Creative Suite would feature a component to let developers build native iPhone apps using the company s Flash development tools The software was officially released as part of the company s Creative Suite collection of professional applications br br br policy on development tools br In April Apple made controversial changes to its iPhone Developer Agreement requiring developers to use only approved programming languages in order to publish apps on App Store and banning applications that used third party development tools the ban affected Adobe s Packager tool which converted Flash apps into iOS apps After developer backlash and news of a potential anti trust investigation Apple again revised its agreement in September allowing the use of third party development tools br br br Mac Catalyst br Originally called Project Marzipan Mac Catalyst helps developers bring iPadOS app experiences to macOS and make it easier to take apps developed for iPadOS devices to Macs by avoiding the need to write the underlying software code twice br br br See also br br Android software development br Qt software br br br br br br External links br iOS Developer
