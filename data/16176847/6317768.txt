Core Animation is an animation graphics compositing framework used by macOS Mac OS X Leopard and later iOS watchOS and tvOS to produce animated user interfaces br br br Overview br Core Animation provides a way for developers to produce animated user interfaces via an implicit animation model as well as an explicit model The developer specifies the original and final states of an object and Core Animation handles interpolation This allows animated interfaces to be created with relative ease as no specific code for the animation is required by the developer br Core Animation can animate any visual element and it provides a unified way of accessing Core Image Core Video and the other Quartz technologies Core Animation rendering can be accelerated by a graphics processor GPU br Animated sequences execute in a thread independent from the main run loop allowing application processing to occur while the animation is in progress In this way application performance is not affected and animations can be stopped reversed or retargeted while in progress br br br History br Core Animation first appeared in Mac OS X Leopard but actually first emerged from the iPhone software team It was shown publicly for the first time on August during WWDC At the Macworld Expo Apple announced that the iPhone runs a specially adapted version of OS X and uses Core Animation br br br See also br List of widget toolkits br QtQuick br Clutter br Windows Presentation Foundation br br br br br br External links br Core Animation on Apple s developer site Accessed br Apple s Core Animation Programming Guide Accessed
