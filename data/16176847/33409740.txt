The iPhone s is a smartphone that was designed developed and marketed by Apple Inc It is the seventh generation of the iPhone succeeding the iPhone and unveiled in September alongside the iPhone c br The iPhone s maintained almost the same external design as its predecessor the iPhone although the s received a new white gold color scheme in addition to white silver and space gray black The s has vastly upgraded internal hardware however It introduced the A bit dual core system on chip the first bit processor to be used on a smartphone accompanied by the M motion co processor A redesigned home button with Touch ID a fingerprint recognition system which can be used to unlock the phone and authenticate App Store and iTunes Store purchases was also introduced The camera was also updated with a larger aperture and a dual LED flash optimized for different color temperatures Earphones known as EarPods were included with the s and Apple released accessories including a case and a dock It had a inch display similar to the iPhone and iPhone c br The iPhone s originally shipped with iOS which introduced a revamped visual appearance among other new features Designed by Jony Ive iOS departed from skeuomorphic elements used in previous versions of iOS in favor of a flat colorful design Among new software features introduced to the iPhone s were AirDrop an ad hoc Wi Fi sharing platform Control Center a control panel containing a number of commonly used functions and iTunes Radio an internet radio service The s is the first iPhone to be supported through six major versions of iOS from iOS to iOS along with the iPhone s and the first generation iPhone SE which were supported from iOS to iOS and the second iOS device to support six major updates the first being the iPad which supported iOS versions to br Reception towards the device was positive with some outlets considering it to be the best smartphone available on the market due to its upgraded hardware Touch ID and other changes introduced by iOS Some criticized the iPhone s for keeping the design and small display of the iPhone and others expressed security concerns about the Touch ID system Nine million units of the iPhone s and iPhone c were sold on the weekend of their release breaking Apple s sales record for iPhones The iPhone s was the best selling phone on all major U S carriers in September br The iPhone s was succeeded as Apple s flagship smartphone by the larger iPhone in September On March the iPhone s was discontinued following the release of the iPhone SE which incorporated internal hardware similar to the iPhone s while retaining the smaller form factor and design of the s br br br History br br Before its official unveiling media speculation primarily centered on reports that the next iPhone would include a fingerprint scanner including Apple s acquisition of AuthenTec a developer of mobile security products references to a fingerprint sensor on the home button in the beta release of iOS and leaked packaging for an iPhone s showing that the traditional home button now had a metallic ring around it Similar ring based imagery was seen on the official invitation to Apple s iPhone press event in September where the new device was unveiled Shortly before its official unveiling The Wall Street Journal also reported the rumor br Apple announced the iPhone c and the iPhone s during a media event at its Cupertino headquarters on September While the iPhone c became available for preorder on September the iPhone s was not available for preorder Both devices were released on September While most of the promotion focused on Touch ID the bit Apple A processor was also a highlight during the event br br This is the first ever bit processor in a phone of any kind I don t think the other guys are even talking about it yet Why go through all this The benefits are huge The A is up to twice as fast as the previous generation system at CPU tasks and up to twice as fast at graphics tasks too br Schiller then showed demos of Infinity Blade III to demonstrate the A s processing power and the device s camera using untouched photographs Apple also announced during the keynote that iOS would be available on September br On September the iPhone s was released in the United States United Kingdom Canada China France Germany Australia Japan Hong Kong and Singapore It was released in additional countries on October and in countries on November Indonesia was the last country to receive the iPhone s on January The iPhone s was succeeded as Apple s flagship smartphone by the iPhone and iPhone Plus on September but the older model remained available for purchase at a reduced price while the GB version was discontinued The gold edition of the iPhone s was discontinued on September when Apple revealed the iPhone s and iPhone s Plus br The iPhone s was discontinued on March and succeeded by the first generation iPhone SE which continues the same form factor but features vastly upgraded internals similar to the flagship iPhone s This was a break with Apple s product positioning trend in North America and Western Europe starting with iPhone s released in October which gave each newly released model one year as the flagship phone then moving it to midrange for its second year of production with the third and final year as the entry level offering before discontinuation While the iPhone s was expected to continue on sale until September replacing it and its A processor early meant that Apple just reduced its long term chip support window by a year for iOS In addition a new iPhone launch was meant to stimulate demand as sales of iPhone s and s Plus had not met expectations since their September release and the iPhone family was expected to suffer its first ever negative growth quarter in br br br Specifications br br br Design br br The iPhone s maintained a similar design to the iPhone with a in cm LCD multi touch Retina display and a screen resolution of at ppi Its home button has been updated with a new flat design using a laser cut sapphire cover surrounded by a metallic ring the button is no longer concave nor does it contain the familiar squircle icon seen on previous models The phone itself is in mm thick and weighs grams oz The phone uses an aluminum composite frame The device is available in three color finishes space gray replacing black with slate trim on the iPhone white with silver trim and white with gold trim The iPhone s was the first iPhone to be available in a gold color this decision was influenced by the fact that gold is seen as a popular sign of a luxury product among Chinese customers br br br Hardware br br The iPhone s is powered by the Apple A system on chip the first bit processor ever used on a smartphone The device s operating system and pre loaded software were optimized to run in bit mode promising increased performance although third party app developers would need to optimize their apps to take advantage of these enhanced capabilities The A processor was designed by Apple and manufactured by Samsung The A processor is accompanied by the M motion co processor a dedicated processor for processing motion data from the iPhone s accelerometer and gyroscopes without requiring the attention of the main processor which integrates with iOS s new CoreMotion APIs The same A SoC and M motion co processor are also found in the iPad Air and iPad Mini both of which were released in the same quarter as the iPhone s br The phone includes a mAh battery which provides hours of talk time and hours of standby time br The home button on the iPhone s incorporates a fingerprint recognition system known as Touch ID based on technology from AuthenTec a company which Apple had acquired in The sensor uses a capacitive CMOS based sensor which can detect the sub epidermal layers of fingers at pixels per inch and uses a degree design that can read the print at any angle The sensor itself is activated by a touch sensitive metallic ring surrounding the button Touch ID can be used for various authentication activities within the operating system such as unlocking the device or authenticating App Store and iTunes purchases instead of an Apple ID password The sensor can be trained to recognize the fingerprints of multiple fingers and multiple users Fingerprint data is stored in an encrypted format within a secure enclave of the A chip itself and is not accessible to any other apps or servers including iCloud br br br Camera br br br Camera hardware br While the camera is still megapixels in resolution with the image capture size of the lens has a larger aperture f compared to f on the predecessor and larger sized pixels in its image sensor than previous iPhone models The flashlight has dual True Tone flashes consisting of an amber LED and a white LED which are variably used based on the color temperature of the photo to improve color balancing br br br Camera software br The camera software includes automatic digital image stabilization dynamic tone mapping fps burst mode and slow motion video at fps br Photos captured during the p video recording have a resolution of p br br br Slow motion video br The iPhone s s camera was paired with a dual LED flash allowing for higher quality nighttime photos iOS introduced a new camera app allowing the iPhone s to capture fast continuous shots and record slow motion videos with p at frames per second and an audio track making it the first iPhone to be able to record at any frame rate beyond frames per second br An analysis by GSM Arena suggests that the image quality of the supposedly p slow motion footage resembles approximately p br br br Accessories br br Earphones known as Apple EarPods were included with the iPhone s According to technology commentators the design of the earphones is aimed to improve sound quality by allowing air to travel in and out more freely Apple states that the design of their earphones allows it to rival high end headphones that cost hundreds of dollars more Reviews by Gizmodo and TechRadar reported that although the earphones sounded better than its predecessor reviewers felt that quality of sound produced is poor TechRadar further opined that the EarPods are inferior to other earphones of a similar price br br br Operating system and software br br The iPhone s was initially supplied with iOS released on September Jonathan Ive the designer of iOS s new elements described the update as bringing order to complexity highlighting features such as refined typography new icons translucency layering physics and gyroscope driven parallaxing as some of the major changes to the design The design of both iOS and OS X Yosemite version noticeably departs from skeuomorphic elements such as green felt in Game Center wood in Newsstand and leather in Calendar in favor of flat colorful design br iOS adds AirDrop an ad hoc Wi Fi sharing platform Users can share files with the iPhone onwards the iPod Touch th generation iPad th generation onwards or iPad Mini st generation onwards The operating system also adds Control Center a control panel accessed by swiping up from the bottom of the screen Control Center contains a number of commonly used functions such as volume and brightness controls along with toggles for enabling Wi Fi Bluetooth Airplane mode and for using the rear camera s flash LED as a flashlight br iTunes Radio an Internet radio service was also included on the iPhone s It was a free ad supported service available to all iTunes users featuring Siri integration on iOS Users were able to skip tracks customize stations and purchase the station s songs from the iTunes Store Users could also search through their history of previous songs br Apple announced in June that the iPhone s would support the iOS update This made it the second longest supported iOS device having supported six major versions of the iOS operating system on par with the iPad which supported iOS through iOS The iPhone s would also receive major speed boosts of up to according to Apple This included the camera keyboard and other functions br The iPhone s did not receive iOS released in September br br br Apple accessories br During the keynote Apple announced a case for the iPhone s that was made of soft microfiber on the inside and leather on the outside This case was announced along with iPhone c s case both of which were the first cases Apple had announced since the iPhone Bumpers br Docks for both the iPhone s and c were found on the Apple online store after the announcement Because of the casing difference between the iPhone s and c they have separate docks each made specifically for each respective phone br br br Reception br br br Critical reception br br The iPhone s received a positive reception from reviewers and commentators Walt Mossberg of All Things Digital gave the phone a favorable review saying that Touch ID sounds like a gimmick but it s a real advance the biggest step ever in biometric authentication for everyday devices and labeled it the best smartphone on the market David Pogue of The New York Times praised Touch ID but said that the innovation of the smartphone market has been saturated and maybe the age of annual mega leaps is over He focused much of his review on iOS which he believed was the biggest change of the device over previous generations praising new Siri features Control Center and AirDrop In an editorial Pogue stated that iOS was the biggest change in the iPhone series citing utilitarian interface changes as the main contributor to this Scott Stein of CNET criticized the lack of design change over iPhone and said that although the iPhone s is not a required upgrade but it s easily the fastest and most advanced Apple smartphone to date Although praised for its camera bit A chip M motion chip and fingerprint scanning capabilities some investors thought that the iPhone s although a notable improvement over the iPhone was still relatively unchanged from its predecessor and worried that the iPhone line had become a stagnant dull product Apple s share price fell after the launch to close at a month low of on the NASDAQ br Darrell Etherington of TechCrunch who praised the iPhone s as the best smartphone available said looks may not be different from the iPhone but the internal components have a dramatic impact on day to day activities normal for a smartphone user and went into detail explaining the impact of the improved camera and specifications on the phone Etherington suggested that the bit A processor will not reach its full potential until developers create applications supporting it Myriam Joire of Engadget found that the iPhone s could benefit significantly from the A if developers created applications optimized for the bit processor Anand Lal Shimpi of AnandTech praised the phone s A processor describing it as seriously impressive and stated that it was the most futureproof of any iPhone ever launched As much as it pains me to use the word futureproof if you are one of those people who likes to hold onto their device for a while the iPhone s is as good a starting point as any Scott Lowe of IGN also spoke highly of its bit processor which has a substantial lead in processing power over the HTC One and Samsung Galaxy S accounting for a graphics boost of up to and in CPU benchmarks The debut of Apple s bit A processor took rival Android smartphone makers by surprise particularly Qualcomm whose own bit system on chip was not released until br Most reviewers recommended the iPhone s over the iPhone c which was released at the same time The c retained almost the same hardware as the discontinued iPhone while the iPhone s featured substantially improved performance features thanks to its new bit A processor as well as extra storage space all for a relatively small additional upfront cost over the iPhone c US versus US in March This was especially the case when iOS was released and both iPhone s and iPhone c were moved to the mid and low end of the iPhone range respectively the iPhone s still had or GB or GiB storage available while the iPhone c had to make do with GB storage with only GB available to the user after installing iOS Furthermore the c s polycarbonate exterior received a mixed reception and was seen as a cost cutting downgrade compared to the iPhone s aluminum glass case the s retained the latter design and looked even more premium due to its additional gold finish br As of there were still a significant number of customers who preferred the inch screen size of iPhone s which remained the second most popular iPhone after the iPhone and ahead of the iPhone s Apple stated in their event that they sold million inch iPhones in even as that form factor was succeeded as the flagship iPhone by the redesigned larger display inch iPhone and Plus back in September Furthermore the s design was regarded as long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general with the s s gold finish adding a premium touch to the s already well regarded look while the succeeding and S design was less critically acclaimed as it felt a little bit wrong as though you were holding a slick bar of soap The iPhone was described as elegance rooted in the way the aluminum and glass work together It felt streamlined yet substantial which is different from iPhone which feels substantial in size alone Plus unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the iPhone didn t really look like anything else on the market at the time However the iPhone s design was not suited to scaling up in contrast to the iPhone S which could better accommodate the growing consumer trend towards larger screen sizes and indeed spawned the S Plus phablet models When Apple discontinued the iPhone s it was replaced by the first generation iPhone SE which outwardly appears almost identical to the s even as the SE s internal hardware has been upgraded significantly br br br Commercial reception br The iPhone s and c sold over nine million units in the first three days setting a record for first weekend smartphone sales with the s selling three times more units than the c After the first day of release of all iPhones in the US were iPhone Ss while were iPhone Cs Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray reported that the line at the Fifth Avenue Apple Store contained people on release day compared to for the iPhone in and for the iPhone G in on their respective release days This was the first time that Apple launched two models simultaneously The first day release in China also contributed to the record sales result br On launch day major in stock shortages were reported in most stores across all countries where the iPhone s initially went on sale A great many customers in line outside Apple Stores worldwide were left disappointed due to severe shortages across all s models with the gold model in particular being in highly limited supply While this situation eased in the US in the days following the launch other countries reported receiving few restocks Some commentators questioned how Apple handled the initial release as online pre orders were not offered for the iPhone s meaning large numbers of people queuing outside physical stores with most in line not receiving a unit In the US Apple offered an online reservation system so customers could keep checking for units available at their local Apple Stores and order for pickup Online orders were also in short supply on launch day with the shipping date across all model sizes and colors changing from working days to October in all countries within hours of online orders being taken br The iPhone s was the best selling phone on AT T Sprint Verizon and T Mobile in September in the United States outselling the iPhone c and Samsung Galaxy S According to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners the iPhone s outsold the c by a two to one margin during its September release confirming Apple CEO Tim Cook s view that the high end smartphone market was not reaching a point of market saturation While commentators viewed the c as a flop because of supply chain cuts signifying a decline in demand the s was viewed as a massive success Apple admitted that it had failed to anticipate the sales ratio leading to an overstocking of the c and shortages of the s br Six months after the release of the iPhone s on March Apple announced that sales of the iPhone brand had exceeded million units By May despite having been on the market for eight months the iPhone s reportedly outsold the newly released Samsung Galaxy S by with million iPhone s units versus million Galaxy S units The Galaxy S s failure to oust the iPhone s from the top selling spot was a major setback for Samsung Mobile as the preceding Samsung Galaxy SIII and Samsung Galaxy S in the first quarter of their releases had outsold the iPhone s and iPhone respectively br br br Impact of Touch ID br br A number of technology writers including Adrian Kingsley Hughes of ZDNet and Kevin Roose of New York believed that the fingerprint scanning functionality of the iPhone s could help spur the adoption of the technology as an alternative to passwords by mainstream users especially in bring your own device scenarios as fingerprint based authentication systems have only enjoyed wider usage in enterprise environments However citing research by biometrics engineer Geppy Parziale Roose suggested that the CMOS based sensor could become inaccurate and wear out over time unless Apple had designed the sensor to prevent this from occurring Brent Kennedy a researcher of the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team recommended that users not immediately rely on the technology citing the uncertainty over whether the system could properly reject a spoofed fingerprint br Following the release of the iPhone s the German Chaos Computer Club announced on September that they had bypassed Apple s new Touch ID fingerprint sensor by using easy everyday means The group explained that the security system had been defeated by photographing a fingerprint from a glass surface and using that captured image to make a latex model thumb which was then pressed against the sensor to gain access The spokesman for the group stated We hope that this finally puts to rest the illusions people have about fingerprint biometrics It is plain stupid to use something that you can t change and that you leave everywhere every day as a security token However in of American smartphone users used no security measures at all to protect their smartphone Others have also tried Chaos Computer Club s method but concluded that it is not an easy process in either time or effort given that the user has to use a high resolution photocopy of a complete fingerprint special chemicals and expensive equipment and because the spoofing process takes some time to achieve br br br Problems br Several problems were experienced with the iPhone s s hardware after its release The most widely reported issue is that the angle reported by the phone s level sensor had drifted by several degrees which caused the gyroscope compass and accelerometer to become inaccurate Reports suggested that this is a hardware induced problem Some encountered other problems such as crashing with a blue screen and then restarting the power button making a rattling noise when the phone was shaken overheating the microphone not working and Touch ID not working for iTunes purchases Some of these issues have since been fixed by software updates br br br See also br List
