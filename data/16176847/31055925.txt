was created to be a fully unified network service The new network infrastructure provided the means for a unified online multiplayer experience and other online interactions such as leaderboards and communication as well as software downloads and streaming media services br The Nintendo Network was discontinued on April br br br Account system br The Nintendo DS uses a Friend Code system much like the original Wii to connect to the network with the exception that only one code is necessary for each console This makes it much easier and more flexible for players to interact with each other over the Internet Regardless of this as of November some Nintendo Network services require a Nintendo Network ID account in order to be accessed such as Nintendo eShop and Miiverse This account can be shared with a Wii U and a Nintendo Switch The Nintendo Network administration team has moderators on staff to remove inappropriate content from its services such as Miiverse br br br SpotPass and

mode a Nintendo DS can automatically discover other Nintendo DS systems within range establish a connection and exchange content for mutually played games all transparently and without requiring any user input For example in Super Street Fighter IV D Edition if the user passes by someone with the same software they will initiate a battle to collect trophies from each other Each application s StreetPass content is stored in one of twelve data slots in the console Using this data slot Nintendo DS users can readily share and exchange content for multiple games at the same time whenever they are connected regardless of what game card is currently in the console br SpotPass was an always on background network connectivity system which can automatically seek and connect to wireless network nodes such as Wi Fi hotspots sending and downloading information in the background while in sleep mode or playing a game SpotPass also makes uses of certified hotspots with partners such as AT T in

application downloads firmware updates patches and specific in game content It can be customized to fit the user s preferences including opting it out altogether for selected software An application
