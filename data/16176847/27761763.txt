id: 27761763
The iPhone retroactively referred to as the iPhone G iPhone or original iPhone is the first iPhone model and the first smartphone designed developed and marketed by Apple Inc After years of rumors and speculation it was officially announced on January and was released in the United States on June br Development of the iPhone as a product began in and continued in complete secrecy until its public unveiling The device broke with prevailing mobile phone designs by eliminating most physical hardware buttons and eschewing a stylus for its finger friendly touch interface The iPhone instead featured only a few physical buttons and a touch screen It featured quad band GSM cellular connectivity with GPRS and EDGE support for data transfer and it used continuous internet access and onboard processing to support features unrelated to voice communication Its successor the iPhone G was announced on June br The iPhone quickly became Apple s most successful product with later generations propelling it to become the world s most profitable company The introduction of the App Store allowed established companies and startup developers to build careers and earn money via the platform while providing consumers with new ways to access information and connect with other people The iPhone largely appealed to the general public as opposed to the business community BlackBerry and IBM focused on at the time By integrating existing technology and expanding on usability the iPhone turned the smartphone industry on its head br br br History br br In Apple CEO Steve Jobs envisioned an Apple touchscreen product that the user could interact with directly with their fingers rather than using a stylus The stylus was a common tool for many existing touchscreen devices at the time including Apple s own Newton launched in He decided that the device would require a triple layered capacitive multi touch touch screen a very new and advanced technology at the time This helped with removing the physical keyboard and mouse The same as was common at the time for tablet computers human machine interfaces and point of sale systems Jobs recruited a group of Apple engineers to investigate the idea as a side project When Jobs reviewed the prototype and its user interface he saw the potential in developing the concept into a mobile phone to compete with already established brands in the then emerging market for touch screen phones The whole effort was called Project Purple and began in Apple purchased the iphone org domain in December br Apple created the device during a secretive and unprecedented collaboration with Cingular Wireless now part of AT T The development cost of the collaboration was estimated to have been million over a thirty month period Apple rejected the design by committee approach that had yielded the Motorola ROKR E a largely unsuccessful collaboration with Motorola Instead Cingular Wireless gave Apple the liberty to develop the iPhone s hardware and software in house The original iPhone was introduced by Steve Jobs on January in a keynote address at the Macworld Conference Expo held in Moscone West in San Francisco California In his address Jobs said This is a day that I have been looking forward to for two and a half years and that today Apple is going to reinvent the phone Jobs introduced the iPhone as a combination of three devices a widescreen iPod with touch controls a revolutionary mobile phone and a breakthrough Internet communicator br Six weeks prior to the iPhone s release the plastic screen was replaced with glass This was after Jobs was upset when he saw that his keys scratched the prototype in his pocket The quick switch led to a bidding process for a manufacturing contractor that was won by Foxconn which had just opened up a new wing of its Shenzhen factory complex specifically for this bid br br br Release br br Six out of ten Americans surveyed said they knew before its release that the iPhone was coming The iPhone was released in the United States on June at the price of for the GB model and for the GB model both requiring a year contract Thousands of people were reported to

Britain and then France Reports suggested that these launches were met with less enthusiasm In France it was sold by Orange for euros The iPhone was released in Austria and the Republic of Ireland on

Journal published positive but cautious reviews of the iPhone their primary criticisms being the relatively slow speed of the AT T s G EDGE network and the phone s inability to connect using G services The Wall Street Journal s technology columnist Walt Mossberg concluded that despite some flaws and feature omissions the iPhone is on balance a beautiful and breakthrough handheld computer Time magazine named it the Invention of the Year in UK based Mobile Gazette wrote that Although it has many good points the list of bad points is equally impressive It also added Although the iPhone sold well in the US when it finally hit Europe sales were not as high as expected to an extent because European consumers could understand the drawbacks due to a more competitive marketplace br br br
