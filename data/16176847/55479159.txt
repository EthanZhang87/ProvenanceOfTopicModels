postmarketOS abbreviated as pmOS is an operating system primarily for smartphones based on the Alpine Linux distribution br postmarketOS was launched on May with the source code available on GitHub before migrating to GitLab in It is capable of running different X and Wayland based user interfaces such as Plasma Mobile MATE GNOME and XFCE later updates added support for Unity and Phosh It is also capable of running Docker if the device specific kernel has cgroups and relevant configs enabled The project aims to provide a ten year lifecycle for smartphones br br br Architecture br Unlike many other projects porting conventional Linux distributions to Android phones postmarketOS does not use the Android build system or userspace Each phone has only one unique package and flashable installation images are generated using the pmbootstrap tool The project intends to support the mainline Linux kernel on all phones in the future instead of the often outdated Android specific fork to reduce the potential for security exploits A few devices can boot into the mainline kernel already The project aims to support Android apps originally through the use of Anbox which was replaced by Waydroid since postmarketOS v br Alpine Linux was chosen as the base distribution due to its low storage requirements making it more suitable for older devices Excluding the kernel a base installation takes up approximately MB In March the maintainers announced that postmarketOS would migrate from OpenRC to systemd as its init system for select user interfaces br br br State of development br As of it is work in progress software intended for power users br br br Features br Different tools have been published by the project including br br pmbootstrap a utility to help the process of development with cross compilation br osk sdl a virtual keyboard to allow decryption of a password during startup on a device with full disk encryption br charging sdl an application contained in the initramfs to display an animation when the phone is charging while off br br br Device support br As of May over two hundred devices are able to boot the operating system including with WiFi support This includes many smartphones and tablets that originally ran Android as well as some Linux based Nokia smartphones such as the N and N After Corellium s Project Sandcastle ported the Linux kernel to some iPhone versions postmarketOS was also seen to boot on it although no persistent flashing is supported at the moment As of May support for wearable devices including Google Glass and smartwatches like the LG G Watch has been improved through integration with the AsteroidOS user interface and work on mainline kernel for the LG G Watch R br In no devices were yet able to make phone calls with postmarketOS although significant efforts were being made in this regard By a number of devices were fully or mostly supported including for phone calls SMS messages and mobile data These included the BQ Aquaris X Librem Nokia N Motorola Moto G Play Samsung Galaxy A Samsung Galaxy A and Wileyfox Swift br Furthermore the PinePhone launched in with postmarketOS Community Edition as a first party operating system br br br Porting to a new device br The development process to make a new device compatible with the operating system consists of creating a phone specific package using the pmbootstrap tool For that the use of the Linux kernel from the device s original manufacturer is often necessary The source code of the original kernel is often made available by compliance with the requirements of the GPLv license but some drivers necessary for the operation of the device may not be available and must therefore be recreated Examples include GPU drivers such as Lima which has a proprietary equivalent in userspace on Android that is not subject to the GPLv requirements br br br Gallery br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br See also br br br br br br External links br br Official website br Source code on GitLab
