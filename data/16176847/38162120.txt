desktop environments br br br History br Manjaro was first released on July By mid it was in the beta stage though key elements of the final system had all been implemented including a GUI installer then an Antergos installer fork a package manager Pacman with a choice of frontends Pamac GTK for Xfce desktop and Octopi Qt for its Openbox edition MHWD Manjaro Hardware Detection for detection of free proprietary video drivers and Manjaro Settings Manager for system wide settings user management and graphics driver installation and management br GNOME Shell support was dropped with the release of version in However efforts within Arch Linux made it possible to restart the Cinnamon GNOME edition as a community edition An official release offering the GNOME desktop environment was reinstated in March br During the development of Manjaro at the end of August the team decided to switch to year and month designations for Manjaro s version scheme instead of numbers This applies to both the x series as well as the new x series renaming released in June as and so on Manjaro codenamed Bellatrix and formerly known as was released on September with the new Calamares installer and updated packages br In September Manjaro announced that support for i architecture would be dropped because popularity of this architecture is decreasing However in November a semi official community project manjaro based on archlinux continued i support br In September the Manjaro GmbH Co KG company was founded It s FOSS website stated the company was formed to effectively engage in commercial agreements

Gellivara release it offers the GNOME desktop with a version of the Manjaro theme br While not official releases Manjaro Community Editions are maintained by members of the Manjaro community Three of these configurations are available for download at Manjaro s website Cinnamon i and Sway br Manjaro also has official editions for devices with ARM processors such as single board computers or Pinebook notebooks br br br Features br Manjaro comes with both a CLI and a graphical installer The rolling release model means that users do not need to upgrade reinstall the whole system to keep it all up to date inline with the latest release Package management is handled by Pacman via the command line terminal and via front end GUI package manager tools like the pre installed Pamac It can be configured as either a stable system default or bleeding edge in line with Arch br The repositories are managed with their own tool BoxIt which is designed like Git br Manjaro includes its own GUI settings manager where options like language drivers and kernel version can be configured br Certain commonly used Arch utilities such as the Arch Build System ABS are available but have alternate implementations in Manjaro br Manjaro Architect is a CLI net installer that allows users to choose their own kernel versions drivers and desktop environments during the install process Both the official and the community edition s desktop environments are available for selection For GUI based installations Manjaro uses the GUI installer Calamares br br br Release history br The x series releases were the last versions of Manjaro to use a version number The desktop environments offered as well as the number of programs bundled into each separate release have varied in different releases br Manjaro typically includes the latest versions of supported desktop environments br br br Relation to Arch Linux br The main difference compared to Arch Linux is the repositories br Manjaro uses three sets of repositories br br Unstable contains the most up to date Arch Linux packages Unstable is synced several times a day with Arch package releases br Testing contains packages from the unstable repositories after they have been tested by users br Stable contains only packages that are deemed stable by the development team which can mean a delay of a few weeks before getting major upgrades br As of January package updates derived from the Arch Linux stable branch to the Manjaro stable branch typically have a lag of a few weeks br br br Derivatives br Netrunner Rolling in addition to Blue Systems Netrunner which is Debian based The first version of Netrunner Rolling was which was based on Manjaro KDE It was released in The last released version was Netrunner Rolling br The Sonar GNU Linux project was aimed at providing a barrier free Linux to people who required assistive technology for computer use with support for GNOME and MATE desktop The first version was released in February the latest release was in As of the Sonar project was discontinued br br br Hardware br br Although Manjaro can be installed on most systems some vendors sell computers with Manjaro pre installed on them Suppliers of computers pre installed with Manjaro include StarLabs Systems Tuxedo Computers manjarocomputer eu and Pine br Manjaro with Plasma Mobile desktop environment is the default operating system on PinePhone an ARM based smartphone released by Pine br br br Reception br Over the years Manjaro Linux has been recognized as a desktop easy to set up and use suitable for both beginners and experienced users It is recommended as an easy and friendly way to install and maintain a cutting edge Arch derived distribution Some reviewers find appeal in the large range of contributed software available in the AUR which has a reputation for being kept up to date from upstream resources Others highlight the wide selection of official and community editions with different desktop environments br Very early versions of Manjaro had a reputation for crashing and for installation difficulties but this was reported to have improved with later versions and by was according to Jesse Smith of DistroWatch proving to be probably the most polished child of Arch Linux I have used to date The distribution is not only easy to set up but it has a friendly feel complete with a nice graphical package manager quality system installer and helpful welcome screen Manjaro comes with lots of useful software and multimedia support br br Smith did a review of Manjaro Xfce in July and observed that it did a lot of things well He went on to extol some of the notable features as part of his conclusion I found Manjaro s Xfce edition to be very fast and unusually light on memory The distribution worked smoothly and worked well with both my physical hardware and my virtual environment I also enjoyed Manjaro s habit of telling me when new software particularly new versions of the Linux kernel was available br I fumbled a little with Manjaro s settings panel and finding some settings but in the end I was pleased with the range of configuration I could achieve with the distribution I especially like that Manjaro makes it easy to block notifications and keep windows from stealing focus The distribution can be made to stay pleasantly out of the way br br br
