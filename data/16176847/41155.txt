title: Firmware
id: 41155
In computing firmware is software that provides low level control of computing device hardware br For a relatively simple device firmware may perform all control monitoring and data manipulation functionality br For a more complex device firmware may provide relatively low level control as well as hardware abstraction services to higher level software such as an operating system br Firmware is found in a wide range of computing devices including personal computers phones home appliances vehicles computer peripherals and in many of the digital chips inside each of these larger systems br Firmware is stored in non volatile memory either read only memory ROM or programmable memory such as EPROM EEPROM or flash Changing a device s firmware stored in ROM requires physically replacing the memory chip although some chips are not designed to be removed after manufacture Programmable firmware memory can be reprogrammed via a procedure sometimes called flashing br Common reasons for changing firmware include fixing bugs and adding features br br br History and etymology br Ascher Opler used the term firmware in a Datamation article as an intermediary term between hardware and software Opler projected that fourth generation computer systems would have a writable control store a small specialized high speed memory into which microcode firmware would be loaded Many software functions would be moved to microcode and instruction sets could be customized with different firmware loaded for different instruction sets br As computers began to increase in complexity it became clear that various programs needed to first be initiated and run to provide a consistent environment necessary for running more complex programs at the user s discretion This required programming the computer to run those programs automatically Furthermore as companies universities and marketers wanted to sell computers to laypeople with little technical knowledge greater automation became necessary to allow a lay user to easily run programs for practical purposes This gave rise to a kind of software that a user would not consciously run and it led to software that a lay user wouldn t even know about br As originally used firmware contrasted with hardware the CPU itself and software normal instructions executing on a CPU It was not composed of CPU machine instructions but of lower level microcode involved in the implementation of machine instructions It existed on the boundary between hardware and software thus the name firmware Over time popular usage extended the word firmware to denote any computer program that is tightly linked to hardware including BIOS on PCs boot firmware on smartphones computer peripherals or the control systems on simple consumer electronic devices such as microwave ovens remote controls br br br Applications br br br Computers br br In some respects the various firmware components are as important as the operating system in a working computer However unlike most modern operating systems firmware rarely has a well evolved automatic mechanism of updating itself to fix any functionality issues detected after shipping the unit br A computer s firmware may be manually updated by a user via a small utility program In contrast firmware in mass storage devices hard disk drives optical disc drives flash memory storage e g solid state drive is less frequently updated even when flash memory rather than ROM EEPROM storage is used for the firmware br Most computer peripherals are themselves special purpose computers Devices such as printers scanners webcams and USB flash drives have internally stored firmware some devices may also permit field upgrading of their firmware br Examples of computer firmware include br br The BIOS firmware used on PCs br The U EFI compliant firmware used on Itanium systems Intel based Macs and many newer PCs br Hard disk drive solid state drive optical disc drive and optical disc recorder firmware br Video BIOS of a graphics card br Open Firmware used in SPARC based computers from Sun Microsystems and Oracle Corporation PowerPC based computers from Apple and computers from Genesi br ARCS used in computers from Silicon Graphics br Kickstart used in the Amiga line of computers POST hardware init Plug and Play auto configuration of peripherals kernel etc br RTAS Run Time Abstraction Services used in System i and System p computers from IBM br The Common Firmware Environment CFE for Broadcom systems on chip SoCs br br br Home and personal use products br Consumer appliances like gaming consoles digital cameras and portable music players support firmware upgrades Some companies use firmware updates to add new playable file formats codecs Other features that may change with firmware updates include the GUI or even the battery life Smartphones have a firmware over the air upgrade capability for adding new features and patching security issues br br br Automobiles br Since most automobiles have employed an on board computer and various sensors to detect mechanical problems As of modern vehicles also employ computer controlled anti lock braking systems ABS and computer operated transmission control units TCUs The driver can also get in dash information while driving in this manner such as real time fuel economy and tire pressure readings Local dealers can update most vehicle firmware br br br Other examples br Other firmware applications include br br In home and personal use products br Timing and control systems for washing machines br Controlling sound and video attributes as well as the channel list in modern televisions br In routers switches and firewalls br LibreCMC a free software router distribution based on the Linux libre kernel br IPFire an open source firewall router distribution based on the Linux kernel br fli l an open source firewall router distribution based on the Linux kernel br OpenWrt an open source firewall router distribution based on the Linux kernel br m n wall an embedded firewall distribution of FreeBSD br Proprietary firmware br In NAS systems br NAS Free an open source NAS operating system based on FreeBSD br Openfiler an open source NAS operating system based on the Linux kernel br Proprietary firmware br Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA code may be referred to as firmware br br br Flashing br Flashing involves the overwriting of existing firmware or data contained in EEPROM or flash memory module present in an electronic device with new data This can be done to upgrade a device or to change the provider of a service associated with the function of the device such as changing from one mobile phone service provider to another or installing a new operating system If firmware is upgradable it is often done via a program from the provider and will often allow the old firmware to be saved before upgrading so it can be reverted to if the process fails or if the newer version performs worse Free software replacements for vendor flashing tools have been developed such as Flashrom br br br Firmware hacking br br Sometimes third parties develop an unofficial new or modified aftermarket version of firmware to provide new features or to unlock hidden functionality this is referred to as custom firmware An example is Rockbox as a firmware replacement for portable media players There are many homebrew projects for various devices which often unlock general purpose computing functionality in previously limited devices e g running Doom on iPods br Firmware hacks usually take advantage of the firmware update facility on many devices to install or run themselves Some however must resort to exploits to run because the manufacturer has attempted to lock the hardware to stop it from running unlicensed code br Most firmware hacks are free software br br br HDD firmware hacks br The Moscow based Kaspersky Lab discovered that a group of developers it refers to as the Equation Group has developed hard disk drive firmware modifications for various drive models containing a trojan horse that allows data to be stored on the drive in locations that will not be erased even if the drive is formatted or wiped Although the Kaspersky Lab report did not explicitly claim that this group is part of the United States National Security Agency NSA evidence obtained from the code of various Equation Group software suggests that they are part of the NSA br Researchers from the Kaspersky Lab categorized the undertakings by Equation Group as the most advanced hacking operation ever uncovered also documenting around infections caused by the Equation Group in at least countries br br br Security risks br Mark Shuttleworth the founder of the company Canonical which created the Ubuntu Linux distribution has described proprietary firmware as a security risk saying that firmware on your device is the NSA s best friend and calling firmware a trojan horse of monumental proportions He has asserted that low quality closed source firmware is a major threat to system security Your biggest mistake is to assume that the NSA is the only institution abusing this position of trust in fact it s reasonable to assume that all firmware is a cesspool of insecurity courtesy of incompetence of the highest degree from manufacturers and competence of the highest degree from a very wide range of such agencies As a potential solution to this problem he has called for declarative firmware which would describe hardware linkage and dependencies and should not include executable code Firmware should be open source so that the code can be checked and verified br Custom firmware hacks have also focused on injecting malware into devices such as smartphones or USB devices One such smartphone injection was demonstrated on the Symbian OS at MalCon a hacker convention A USB device firmware hack called BadUSB was presented at the Black Hat USA conference demonstrating how a USB flash drive microcontroller can be reprogrammed to spoof various other device types to take control of a computer exfiltrate data or spy on the user Other security researchers have worked further on how to exploit the principles behind BadUSB releasing at the same time the source code of hacking tools that can be used to modify the behavior of different USB devices br br br See also br br
