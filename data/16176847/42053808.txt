title: Intel Management Engine
id: 42053808
The Intel Management Engine ME also known as the Intel Manageability Engine is an autonomous subsystem that has been incorporated in virtually all of Intel s processor chipsets since It is located in the Platform Controller Hub of modern Intel motherboards br The Intel Management Engine always runs as long as the motherboard is receiving power even when the computer is turned off This issue can be mitigated with the deployment of a hardware device which is able to disconnect all connections to mains power as well as all internal forms of energy storage The Electronic Frontier Foundation and some security researchers have voiced concern that the Management Engine is a backdoor br Intel s main competitor AMD has incorporated the equivalent AMD Secure Technology formally called Platform Security Processor in virtually all of its post CPUs br br br Difference from Intel AMT br The Management Engine is often confused with Intel AMT Intel Active Management Technology AMT runs on the ME but is only available on processors with vPro AMT gives device owners remote administration of their computer such as powering it on or off and reinstalling the operating system br However the ME itself has been built into all Intel chipsets since not only those with AMT While AMT can be unprovisioned by the owner there is no official documented way to disable the ME br br br Design br The subsystem primarily consists of proprietary firmware running on a separate microprocessor that performs tasks during boot up while the computer is running and while it is asleep As long as the chipset or SoC is supplied with power via battery or power supply it continues to run even when the system is turned off Intel claims the ME is required to provide full performance Its exact workings are largely undocumented and its code is obfuscated using confidential Huffman tables stored directly in hardware so the firmware does not contain the information necessary to decode its contents br br br Hardware br Starting with ME introduced in Skylake CPUs it is based on the Intel Quark x based bit CPU and runs the MINIX operating system The ME firmware is stored in a partition of the SPI BIOS Flash using the Embedded Flash File System EFFS Previous versions were based on an ARC core with the Management Engine running the ThreadX RTOS Versions x to x of the ME used the ARCTangent A bit only instructions whereas versions x to x used the newer ARCompact mixed and bit instruction set architecture Starting with ME the ARC processor could also execute signed Java applets br The ME has its own MAC and IP address for the out of band management interface with direct access to the Ethernet controller one portion of the Ethernet traffic is diverted to the ME even before reaching the host s operating system for what support exists in various Ethernet controllers exported and made configurable via Management Component Transport Protocol MCTP The ME also communicates with the host via PCI interface Under Linux communication between the host and the ME is done via dev mei or dev mei br Until the release of Nehalem processors the ME was usually embedded into the motherboard s northbridge following the Memory Controller Hub MCH layout With the newer Intel architectures Intel Series onwards the ME is integrated into the Platform Controller Hub PCH br br br Firmware br By Intel s current terminology as of ME is one of several firmware sets for the Converged Security and Manageability Engine CSME Prior to AMT version CSME was called Intel Management Engine BIOS Extension Intel MEBx br br Management Engine ME mainstream chipsets br Server Platform Services SPS server chipsets and SoCs br Trusted Execution Engine TXE tablet embedded low power br The Russian company Positive Technologies Dmitry Sklyarov found that the ME firmware version runs MINIX br br br Modules br Active Management Technology AMT br Intel Boot Guard IBG and Secure Boot br Quiet System Technology QST formerly known as Advanced Fan Speed Control AFSC which provides support for acoustically optimized fan speed control and monitoring of temperature voltage current and fan speed sensors that are provided in the chipset CPU and other devices present on the motherboard Communication with the QST firmware subsystem is documented and available through the official software development kit SDK br Protected Audio Video Path enforces HDCP br Intel Anti Theft Technology AT discontinued in br Serial over LAN SOL br Intel Platform Trust Technology PTT a firmware based Trusted Platform Module TPM br Near Field Communication a middleware for NFC readers and vendors to access NFC cards and provide secure element access found in later MEI versions br br br Security vulnerabilities br Several weaknesses have been found in the ME On May Intel confirmed a Remote Elevation of Privilege bug SA in its Management Technology Every Intel platform with provisioned Intel Standard Manageability Active Management Technology or Small Business Technology from Nehalem in to Kaby Lake in has a remotely exploitable security hole in the ME Several ways to disable the ME without authorization that could allow ME s functions to be sabotaged have been found Additional major security flaws in the ME affecting a very large number of computers incorporating ME Trusted Execution Engine TXE and Server Platform Services SPS firmware from Skylake in to Coffee Lake in were confirmed by Intel on November SA Unlike SA this bug is even present if AMT is absent not provisioned or if the ME was disabled by any of the known unofficial methods In July another set of vulnerabilities was disclosed SA In September yet another vulnerability was published SA br br br Ring rootkit br A ring rootkit was demonstrated by Invisible Things Lab for the Q chipset it does not work for the later Q chipset as Intel implemented additional protections The exploit worked by remapping the normally protected memory region top MB of RAM reserved for the ME The ME rootkit could be installed regardless of whether the AMT is present or enabled on the system as the chipset always contains the ARC ME coprocessor The designation was chosen because the ME coprocessor works even when the system is in the S state Thus it was considered a layer below the System Management Mode rootkits For the vulnerable Q chipset a keystroke logger ME based rootkit was demonstrated by Patrick Stewin br br br Zero touch provisioning br Another security evaluation by Vassilios Ververis showed serious weaknesses in the GM chipset implementation In particular it criticized AMT for transmitting unencrypted passwords in the SMB provisioning mode when the IDE redirection and Serial over LAN features are used It also found that the zero touch provisioning mode ZTC is still enabled even when the AMT appears to be disabled in BIOS For about euros Ververis purchased from GoDaddy a certificate that is accepted by the ME firmware and allows remote zero touch provisioning of possibly unsuspecting machines which broadcast their HELLO packets to would be configuration servers br br br SA a k a Silent Bob is Silent br In May Intel confirmed that many computers with AMT have had an unpatched critical privilege escalation vulnerability CVE The vulnerability was nicknamed Silent Bob is Silent by the researchers who had reported it to Intel It affects numerous laptops desktops and servers sold by Dell Fujitsu Hewlett Packard later Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc Intel Lenovo and possibly others Those researchers claimed that the bug affects systems made in or later Other reports claimed the bug also affects systems made as long ago as The vulnerability was described as giving remote attackers br br full control of affected machines including the ability to read and modify everything It can be used to install persistent malware possibly in firmware and read and modify any data br br br PLATINUM br In June the PLATINUM cybercrime group became notable for exploiting the serial over LAN SOL capabilities of AMT to perform data exfiltration of stolen documents SOL is disabled by default and must be enabled to exploit this vulnerability br br br SA br Some months after the previous bugs and subsequent warnings from the EFF security firm Positive Technologies claimed to have developed a working exploit On November Intel confirmed that a number of serious flaws had been found in the Management Engine mainstream Trusted Execution Engine tablet mobile and Server Platform Services high end server firmware and released a critical firmware update Essentially every Intel based computer for the last several years including most desktops and servers were found to be vulnerable to having their security compromised although all the potential routes of exploitation were not entirely known It is not possible to patch the problems from the operating system and a firmware UEFI BIOS update to the motherboard is required which was anticipated to take quite some time for the many individual manufacturers to accomplish if it ever would be for many systems br br br Affected systems br Source br br Intel Atom C family br Intel Atom Apollo Lake E series br Intel Celeron N and J series br Intel Core i i i i st nd rd th th th th and th generation br Intel Pentium Apollo Lake br Intel Xeon E v and v product family br Intel Xeon Scalable family br Intel Xeon W family br br br Mitigation br None of the known unofficial methods to disable the ME prevent exploitation of the vulnerability A firmware update by the vendor is required However those who discovered the vulnerability note that firmware updates are not fully effective either as an attacker with access to the ME firmware region can simply flash an old vulnerable version and then exploit the bug br br br SA br In July Intel announced that three vulnerabilities CVE CVE CVE had been discovered and that a patch for the CSME firmware would be required Intel indicated there would be no patch for rd generation Core processors or earlier despite chips or their chipsets as far back as Intel Core Duo vPro and Intel Centrino vPro being affected However Intel AMT must be enabled and provisioned for the vulnerability to exist br br br Assertions that ME is a backdoor br Critics like the Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF Libreboot developers and security expert Damien Zammit accused the ME of being a backdoor and a privacy concern Zammit stresses that the ME has full access to memory without the owner controlled CPU cores having any knowledge and has full access to the TCP IP stack and can send and receive network packets independently of the operating system thus bypassing its firewall br Intel responded by saying Intel does not put back doors in its products nor do our products give Intel control or access to computing systems without the explicit permission of the end user and Intel does not and will not design backdoors for access into its products Recent reports claiming otherwise are misinformed and blatantly false Intel does not participate in any efforts to decrease the security of its technology br In the context of criticism of the Intel ME and AMD Secure Technology it has been pointed out that the National Security Agency NSA budget request for contained a Sigint Enabling Project with the goal to Insert vulnerabilities into commercial encryption systems IT systems and it has been conjectured that Intel ME and AMD Secure Technology might be part of that program br br br Disabling the ME br It is normally not possible for the end user to disable the ME and there is no officially supported method to disable it but some undocumented methods to do so were discovered The ME s security architecture is designed to prevent disabling Intel considers disabling the ME to be a security vulnerability as a malware could abuse it to make the computer lose some of the functionality that the typical user expects such as the ability to play media with DRM specifically DRM media that are using HDCP On the other hand it is also possible for malicious actors to use the ME to remotely compromise a system br Strictly speaking none of the known methods can disable the ME completely since it is required for booting the main CPU The currently known methods merely make the ME go into abnormal states soon after boot in which it seems not to have any working functionality The ME is still physically connected to the system and its microprocessor continues to execute code Some manufacturers like Purism and System disable the Intel Management Engine br br br Undocumented methods br br br Firmware neutralization br In the me cleaner project found that the ME s integrity verification is broken The ME is supposed to detect that it has been tampered with and if this is the case shut down the PC forcibly minutes after system start This prevents a compromised system from running undetected yet allows the owner to fix the issue by flashing a valid version of the ME firmware during the grace period As the project found out by making unauthorized changes to the ME firmware it was possible to force it into an abnormal error state that prevented triggering the shutdown even if large parts of the firmware had been overwritten and thus made inoperable br br br High Assurance Platform mode br In August Positive Technologies Dmitry Sklyarov published a method to disable the ME via an undocumented built in mode As Intel has confirmed the ME contains a switch to enable government authorities such as the NSA to make the ME go into High Assurance Platform HAP mode after boot This mode disables most of ME s functions and was intended to be available only in machines produced for specific purchasers like the US government however most machines sold on the retail market can be made to activate the switch Manipulation of the HAP bit was quickly incorporated into the me cleaner project br br br Commercial ME disablement br br From late on several laptop vendors announced their intentions to ship laptops with the Intel ME disabled or let the end users disable it manually br br Minifree Ltd has provided Libreboot pre loaded laptops with Intel ME either not present or disabled since at least br Purism previously petitioned Intel to sell processors without the ME or release its source code calling it a threat to users digital rights In March Purism announced that it had neutralized the ME by erasing the majority of the ME code from the flash memory It further announced in October that new batches of their Librem line of laptops running PureOS will ship with the ME neutralized and additionally disable most ME operation via the HAP bit Updates for existing Librem laptops were also announced br In November System announced their plan to disable the ME on their new and recent machines which ship with Pop OS via the HAP bit br In December Dell began showing certain laptops on its website that offered the Systems Management option Intel vPro ME Inoperable Custom Order for an additional fee Dell has not announced or publicly explained the methods used In response to press requests Dell stated that those systems had been offered for quite a while but not for the general public and had found their way to the website only inadvertently The laptops are available only by custom order and only to military government and intelligence agencies They are specifically designed for covert operations such as providing a very robust case and a stealth operating mode kill switch that disables display LED lights speaker fan and any wireless technology br In March Tuxedo Computers a German company which specializes in PCs which run Linux kernel based operating systems announced an option in the BIOS of their system to disable ME br br br Effectiveness against vulnerabilities br Neither of the two methods to disable the ME discovered so far turned out to be an effective countermeasure against the SA vulnerability This is because the vulnerability is in an early loaded ME module that is essential to boot the main CPU br br br Reactions br br br By Google br As of Google was attempting to eliminate proprietary firmware from its servers and found that the ME was a hurdle to that br br br By AMD processor vendors br Shortly after SA was patched vendors for AMD processor mainboards started shipping BIOS updates that allow disabling the AMD Platform Security Processor a subsystem
