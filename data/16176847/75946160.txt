id: 75946160
HarmonyOS NEXT Chinese pinyin H ngm ng X ngh b n is a proprietary distributed operating system and an iteration of HarmonyOS developed by Huawei to support only HarmonyOS native apps The operating system is primarily aimed at software and hardware developers that deal directly with Huawei It does not include Android s AOSP core and is incompatible with Android applications br While discarding the common Unix like Linux kernel HarmonyOS NEXT also replaces the old HarmonyOS multikernel with its custom unified proprietary system built on OpenHarmony and the global variant Oniro OS for global markets The rich execution environment REE version of HarmonyOS microkernel is placed at its core with a single framework as kernel mode The new kernel architecture built on OpenHarmony and its kernel abstraction layer serves as user mode The OS shares lineage with the lightweight LiteOS real time operating system for resource constrained devices like smart wearables and IoT products br The first internal preview version of the system was revealed on August and the first preview version was released to registered public developers on January br The devices tested on the developer preview version of the system were the Mate Mate Pro and Mate X phones in the first batch br br br History br On August at Huawei Developers Conference HDC Huawei officially announced HarmonyOS NEXT the next version of HarmonyOS supporting only native APP apps via Ark Compiler and native APIs in HarmonyOS SDK br The kernel of HarmonyOS NEXT does not include the compatibility layer of AOSP framework with Android libraries from EMUI in the user space and cannot run Android apk apps natively as is the case with the dual framework HarmonyOS br On August the developer preview version of HarmonyOS NEXT was opened for cooperating enterprise developers and on January to the rest of developers to build and test native mobile apps The beta version was expected to be launched in Q and the commercial version to be made available in Q It has been revealed by Huawei that HarmonyOS NEXT system stack development goes back as far as after R D incubation of HarmonyOS development in br br br Software version
