id: 33304644
The iPhone is a smartphone that was designed developed and marketed by Apple Inc It is the th generation iPhone succeeding the iPhone s and preceding both the iPhone s and iPhone c It was formally unveiled as part of a press event on September and subsequently released on September The iPhone was the first iPhone to be announced in September and setting a trend for subsequent iPhone releases the first iPhone to be completely developed under the guidance of Tim Cook and the last iPhone to be overseen by Steve Jobs The iPhone s design was used three times first with the iPhone itself in then with the iPhone s in and finally with the first generation iPhone SE in br The iPhone featured major design changes in comparison to its predecessor These included an aluminum based body which was thinner and lighter than previous models a taller inch screen with a nearly aspect ratio the Apple A system on chip LTE support and Lightning a new compact dock connector which replaced the pin design used by previous iPhone models This was the second Apple phone to include its new Sony made MP camera which was first introduced on the iPhone s br Apple began taking pre orders on September and over two million were received within hours Initial demand for the iPhone exceeded the supply available at launch on September and was described by Apple as extraordinary with pre orders having sold twenty times faster than its predecessors While reception to the iPhone was generally positive consumers and reviewers noted hardware issues such as an unintended purple hue in photos taken and the phone s coating being prone to chipping Reception was also mixed over Apple s decision to switch to a different dock connector design as the change affected iPhone s compatibility with accessories that were otherwise compatible with previous iterations of the line br The iPhone was officially discontinued by Apple on September with the announcement of its successors the iPhone s and the iPhone c The iPhone has the joint second shortest lifespan of any iPhone ever produced with only twelve months in production breaking with Apple s standard practice of selling an existing iPhone model at a reduced price upon the release of a new model This was broken by the iPhone X which only had ten months in production from November to September and tied with the iPhone XS which had twelve months from September to September br It was replaced as a midrange and then an entry level device by the iPhone c the c internal hardware specifications are almost identical to the albeit having a less expensive polycarbonate exterior shell The iPhone supports iOS and The iPhone does not support iOS due to it dropping support for bit devices The iPhone is the second iPhone to support five major versions of iOS after the iPhone s br br br History br br Rumors about the iPhone began shortly after the announcement of the iPhone s though detailed leaks did not emerge until June On July reports pinpointed the dates on which the iPhone would be unveiled and released along with some accurate predictions of its features On September Apple announced they would be hosting an event at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco on September A shadow of the numeral was featured in the invitations sent to the media suggesting that the next iPhone would be unveiled at the event br At the unveiling Apple announced the iPhone and also introduced new iPod Nano and iPod Touch models They also stated that pre orders would be accepted starting September Over two million pre orders were received within hours Initial demand for the new phone exceeded the record set by its predecessor the iPhone s by selling over million units in the first three days On November Apple added an unlocked version of the iPhone to their online US store with the GB model starting at US br The iPhone was officially discontinued by Apple on September with the announcement of its successors the iPhone s and the iPhone c While the c shared almost the same internal hardware as the iPhone the c used a lower cost polycarbonate plastic case in place of the original s aluminum form The introduction of the c deviated from Apple s previous market strategy where the previous iPhone model would remain in production but sold at a lower price point below the new model br On April Apple initiated an out of warranty recall program to replace any failing power buttons of iPhone models which were manufactured prior to March at no cost On August Apple announced a program to replace batteries of iPhone models that may suddenly experience shorter battery life or need to be charged more frequently which were sold between September and January br br br Litigation br br Following the release of the iPhone Samsung announced that it was filing a lawsuit against Apple for infringing eight of its patents The case was scheduled to begin in In a statement Samsung said it had little choice but to take the steps necessary to protect our innovations and intellectual property rights Litigation between the two involving patent infringement has been ongoing and is being fought in several court cases around the world br br br Production br The components and labor required to construct the most basic iPhone are estimated to cost US which is US more than the cost of components for the corresponding iPhone s model The LTE module in the iPhone alone costs more than the cellular module in the iPhone s Similarly screens used in the iPhone cost which is more than the screen of its predecessor Mashable noted that the profit margin of selling each device is huge as the iPhone retails for US br After the announcement of the device a lack of supply was evident This was due to a shortage of components such as the screen Reports emerged stating that Sharp was unable to ship the screen before the debut of the iPhone and other manufacturers reported that it was difficult to keep up with demand As a result the number of pre orders rose due to the uncertainty of stock at retail stores and the delivery dates for pre orders were postponed to dates that were after the initial release date of the device br br br Quality control inspectors strike br China Labor Watch a New York State based NGO reported that three to four thousand Foxconn workers who work at the iPhone production plant in Zhengzhou stopped working on October The strikes occurred after Apple implemented a stricter quality standard on their products which includes a mm restriction on indentations inflicted during production and imposed demands related to scratches on frames and back covers The strikes were also attributed to the employer forcing employees to work on a public holiday The report stated training was inadequate for quality demands expected and led to employees producing products that did not meet standards During the strike conflicts between quality control inspectors and employees resulted in brawls China Labor Watch also claimed that concerns raised by inspectors were not addressed by factory management Foxconn spokesmen admitted that a micromanagement problem exists but also said that there were only to workers absent and the conflicts did not influence production processes In November Foxconn chairman Terry Gou reported that the delay in production was due to undisclosed difficulties in assembly br br br Features br br br Operating system and software br br The iPhone features iOS Apple s mobile operating system The user interface of iOS is based on the concept of direct manipulation using multi touch gestures Interface control elements consist of sliders switches and buttons Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe tap pinch and reverse pinch all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi touch interface Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device one common result is the undo command or rotating it vertically one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode br The iPhone is shipped with iOS which was released on September Many of the iPhone s features that work specifically with the included iOS operating system only worked in certain territories on release Apple has said this is a rolling program which will take longer to implement across more regions br The phone can act as a hotspot sharing its internet connection over WiFi Bluetooth or USB and also accesses the App Store an online application distribution platform for iOS developed and maintained by Apple The service allows users to browse and download applications from the iTunes Store that were developed with Xcode and the iOS SDK and were published through Apple br The iPhone can play music movies television shows ebooks audiobooks and podcasts and can sort its media library by songs artists albums videos playlists genres composers podcasts audiobooks and compilations Options are always presented alphabetically except in playlists which retain their order from iTunes Users can rotate their device horizontally to landscape mode to access Cover Flow Like on iTunes this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll through photo library Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen Alternatively headset controls can be used to pause play skip and repeat tracks On the iPhone the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist or create a Genius playlist br Like the iPhone s the iPhone has Siri that allows the user to operate the iPhone by spoken commands The software was improved in iOS to include the ability to make restaurant reservations launch apps dictate Facebook or Twitter updates retrieve movie reviews and detailed sports statistics br On the iPhone texting can be aided by the voice assistant which converts speech to text In addition to regular texting messaging on the iPhone supports iMessage a specialized instant messaging program and service that allows unlimited texting to other Apple devices running iOS or later This supports the inclusion of content such as images and sound in text messages integration with the device s voice controlled software assistant and read acknowledgments for sent messages Input to the device comes from a keyboard displayed on the multi touch screen or by voice to text by speaking into the microphone Entered text is supported by predictive and suggestion software there is a multi language spell checker which recognizes many regional accents of different languages br iOS features several new and or updated apps which includes Apple Maps and Passbook Apple s built in Maps app which replaced the former Maps app powered by Google Maps had been universally derided and lacked many features present in competing maps apps It uses Apple s new vector based engine that eliminates lag making for smoother zooming New to Maps is turn by turn navigation spoken directions D views in some major cities and real time traffic iOS is able to retrieve documents such as boarding passes admission tickets coupons and loyalty cards through its new Passbook app An iOS device with Passbook can be scanned under a reader to process a mobile payment at locations that have compatible hardware The app has context aware features such as notifications for relevant coupons when in the immediate vicinity of a given store br Facebook comes integrated through Apple s native apps with iOS Facebook features can be directly accessed from within native apps such as Calendar which can sync Facebook events or use Facebook s like button from within the Apple App Store br New privacy settings are available to the user In addition to location services the following have been added in iOS photos already partially restricted in iOS contacts address book calendars reminders Bluetooth sharing Twitter Facebook and Sina Weibo iOS also comes with a Limit ad tracking user control in the general settings menu to allow users the option to prevent targeted advertising Apple s Advertising Identifier replaces the company s existing Unique Device Identification UDID standard Advertising networks not yet using Apple s Advertising Identifier device identifier standard would not be affected although Apple will require the standard in the future br br br Design br Apple emphasized the improved build quality of the iPhone at its press event The frame used in previous versions was redesigned to use an aluminum composite frame The iPhone and iPhone s used stainless steel instead of aluminium due to Steve Jobs preference for the metal which he thought looks beautiful when it wears br The iPhone is thinner lighter and has less overall volume than its predecessor the iPhone s The phone s aluminum body is in mm thick At the September conference Apple claimed it was the thinnest smartphone in the world at mm though that claim was disputed as the Chinese Oppo Finder was thinner and some other smartphones could be considered to be thinner depending upon where thickness is measured The Oppo Finder measured mm in at its thinnest point and mm in at its thickest point making it overall thinner than the iPhone This design was used three times first with the iPhone in then with the s in and finally with the first generation iPhone SE in br br br Hardware br The iPhone uses a system on chip SoC called the Apple A The SoC comprises a GHz dual core processor GB of RAM and a tri core PowerVR SGX MP running at MHz The iPhone s operating memory LPDDR eDRAM was doubled from MB to GB Storage capacities available are fixed at or GB the same as the s plug in memory cards are not supported The two color options are black with black glass and slate colored metal trim and white with white ceramic and silver colored metal trim again the same color options though differently implemented as its predecessor the s had The iPhone retains the megapixel back camera on the iPhone s but has improved low light performance and has a faster photo capture than its predecessors while having a purple hue when a strong source of light is present in the photograph The front camera which is accessible through the FaceTime and camera app has a lower resolution at megapixels The rechargeable lithium ion battery with a charge capacity of mAh is built in and cannot be replaced by the user it is rated at hours of standby time and hours of talk time There are three separate models of the phone available one supporting CDMA and two GSM versions This can have knock on effects for which version of the device will actually work in which countries regions The phone takes a nano SIM smaller than the micro SIM of the iPhone and iPhone s br Hardware benchmarking conducted using Geekbench and GLBenchmark validates several claims that Apple included on their website and mentioned at the unveiling of the device these include two times faster and two times the graphics performance In the Geekbench overall hardware assessment the iPhone received a score that was approximately times higher than the iPhone s The benchmark conducted using GLBenchmark for the iPhone returned a score that was times better than the iPhone s The result was however inconsistent as a D graphics benchmark assessment using Passmark returned a score that was only approximately times better than the iPhone s Battery life assessments conducted by AnandTech concluded that the battery life is shorter on the iPhone than its predecessor when performing certain tasks however when performing other tasks the iPhone battery outlasts the iPhone s br The Retina Display is pixels with an aspect ratio of almost exactly minus one extra row of horizontal pixels With a diagonal of it has a display size of square inches compared to in iPhone and s The pixel density remains the same as the s model which is pixels per inch Screen icons of the iPhone are arranged in a matrix of six rows of four icons each The increased screen size allows the sixth row of icons to be added to the five rows that were present in the iPhone In cell touch sensor technology from Sharp slims the screen which allows for a thinner phone The screen s color saturation is greater than its predecessor br There are three microphones placed on the front side and back for noise cancellation and video calls br On April Apple initiated an out of warranty recall program to replace any failing power buttons of iPhone models which were manufactured prior to March at no cost br On August Apple announced a program to replace batteries of iPhone models that may suddenly experience shorter battery life or need to be charged more frequently which were sold between September and January br br br Accessories br br The iPhone as well as the iPod Touch th generation iPod Nano th generation iPad th generation and iPad Mini feature a new dock connector named Lightning which replaces the pin Apple Dock connector introduced in by Apple on the iPod rd generation The Apple Lightning connector has eight pins and all signaling is digital This new connector is smaller than the previous one helping the iPhone to be slimmer than its predecessors Apple Lightning cables have duplicate pins on two sides of each plug so it can be inserted either way round Various accessories will be available to convert the Apple Lightning connector to the older pin Apple Dock connector or USB although not all old accessories will work as not all signals are available in particular video output and the iPod Out feature for BMW automobiles br Earphones known as Apple EarPods are included with the iPhone and other devices announced at the Apple media event on September They superseded earphones that were included with previous generation iPhones and iPods According to technology commentators the redesign of the earphones is aimed to improve sound quality by allowing air to travel in and out more freely Apple states that the redesign of their earphones allows it to rival high end headphones that cost hundreds of dollars more Reviews by Gizmodo and TechRadar reported that although the redesigned earphones sounded better than its predecessor reviewers felt that quality of sound produced is poor br br br Network compatibility br br AT T Verizon and Sprint offer LTE access in the US while in the UK only EE and Three are able to offer LTE access On March T Mobile announced they would begin carrying the iPhone making it the first iPhone to be available on all four nationwide carriers in the United States The T Mobile version of the iPhone features a modified version of the A iPhone model enabling Advanced Wireless Services AWS support All carriers in Canada selling the iPhone have their own LTE networks including Rogers Wireless Fido Solutions Bell Mobility Virgin Mobile Canada Telus Mobility and Koodo Mobile br officially recognized bands exist for LTE however rollouts are coalescing around the more popular bands based on what historically has been made available in specific regions In Europe bands available for LTE include GHz the G expansion band and MHz cleared of analogue TV with MHz appearing in a few places including the UK In Germany the only carrier network supported is that of T Mobile with its MHz band allocated to LTE Some countries in Europe including Denmark Norway Sweden and others will not be able to offer LTE connectivity via the iPhone to their customers on their current LTE networks as they have already deployed LTE in the GHz band which the iPhone does not support In November a representative of Swisscom reported that the iPhone only supports LTE on networks that have been tested and certified by Apple br Unlike the iPhone s which was the only world phone produced by Apple there are three versions of the iPhone which differ by the frequency used All three work on G GSM GPRS and G UMTS EDGE networks on both the and MHz bands used in the Americas and the and MHz bands used elsewhere The CDMA A model works on CDMA networks such as that of Sprint and Verizon Another version supports LTE only on the MHz AWS band and the MHz band recovered after the conversion to digital television in the US channels to currently the only network that supports the band is AT T GSM A supports several other LTE bands available in other countries such as LTE bands br br br Reception br br br Critical reception br br The iPhone received mainly positive reviews from commentators and reviewers Tim Stevens from Engadget praised the iPhone for its high resolution screen surpassing that of the iPhone s which he considered to be one of the best phone screens available on the market Stevens was critical of the new connector which is incompatible with devices and cables that use the superseded pin connector although the LA Times reported that this was a change necessary to make the device smaller than its predecessor Engadget agreed that Apple fulfilled most of the promises stated on its website such as better battery performance two times the graphics performance and two times faster David Pogue of The New York Times considered the inch Retina display a nice but not life changing change and praised the Lightning connector for its size sturdiness and reversibility while noting its lack of support for older accessories remarking that Apple has a long history of killing off technologies inconveniently and expensively that the public had come to love Technology columnist Ed Baig of USA Today was impressed that Apple had met the public s lofty expectations for the iPhone in a competitive market In a repair ability review iFixit found the iPhone easier to disassemble and repair than its predecessor br Wired reported that the iPhone design carried on in the iPhone s and first generation iPhone SE was regarded as long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general while the succeeding iPhone s design was less critically acclaimed as it felt a little bit wrong as though you were holding a slick bar of soap Wired described the iPhone as elegance rooted in the way the aluminum and glass work together It felt streamlined yet substantial which is different from the iPhone which feels substantial in size alone Plus unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the the iPhone didn t really look like anything else on the market at the time However the iPhone s design was not suited to scaling up in contrast to the iPhone s which could better accommodate the growing consumer trend towards larger screen sizes and indeed spawned the S Plus phablet models br br br Criticism br Reviewers and commentators were critical of the new Maps app that replaced Google Maps in iOS It had been reported to contain errors such as misplacement of landmark tags directing users to incorrect locations and poor satellite images Nine days after Maps release Apple issued a statement apologizing for the frustration it had caused customers and recommending that they try alternate mapping services br br br Errors br Gizmodo editor Diaz discussed the correspondence between Apple and a reader about purple flare in pictures taken on iPhone camera Apple s response to the issue was that it is normal and advised the customer to aim the camera away from bright light sources when taking photos Tests conducted by TechCrunch indicate that the problem existed on the iPhone s but was more distinct and pronounced on the iPhone Consumer Reports found that the purple haze effect occurred on several other manufacturers phones including the Samsung Galaxy S III and Motorola Droid Razr Maxx and that it was not less pronounced on the iPhone s The report concluded that digital cameras in general including higher end SLRs can all suffer from lens flare in which a purple tinted effect was not uncommon br br br Problems br br There were anecdotal claims of the coating of primarily black iPhone s chipping off exposing the bright aluminium underneath Apple executive s response to email correspondence from an affected customer summarized that it was normal for aluminum to scratch The term scuffgate a reference to antennagate which affected the iPhone was applied by various sources such as CNET Yahoo News and All Things Digital to describe the scuffing issue br Some users reported on the Internet that the white model leaked light behind the screen though the issue was not unique to the iPhone as it also affected other Apple devices br br br Commercial reception br Techcrunch reported that the iPhone sold out twenty times faster than the and s models Apple said that they were blown away by the customer response Phil Schiller Apple s vice president of worldwide marketing said that over two million iPhone orders had been received in the first hours AT T said that the iPhone was the fastest selling iPhone the company had ever offered selling over five million units on launch weekend and exceeding the supply available The release and sale of the iPhone has also slowed down the growth of Android according to market share reports released by Kantar Worldpanel ComTech During the first days after the phone s initial release it comprised over of all phones sold in that period br J P Morgan s chief economist Michael Feroli said that sales of iPhone could boost annualized US GDP growth by billion or billion at an annual rate Shortly after the announcement of the iPhone and preceding the launch Apple s stock price rose to a record but within three months fell to According to the analysis of Eric Savitz Apple s stock decline and resulting losses were not the result of any issue with the new Maps application but disappointed investors He points to initial hardware sales of only five million compared to projections up to twice that as the primary cause br Since the release of the iPhone discounts on previous generation iPhones have enabled Apple to maintain a market lead in the United States and Japan but the iPhone continued to lag behind the combined total of Android phones in the global market br br br See also br List of iPhone models br Comparison of smartphones br Timeline of
