title: Fuchsia (operating system)
id: 51328172
Fuchsia is an open source capability based operating system developed by Google In contrast to Google s Linux based operating systems such as ChromeOS and Android Fuchsia is based on a custom kernel named Zircon It publicly debuted as a self hosted git repository in August without any official corporate announcement After years of development its official product launch was in on the first generation Google Nest Hub replacing its original Linux based Cast OS br br br Etymology br Fuchsia is named for the color fuchsia which is a combination of pink and purple The name is a reference to two operating systems projects within Apple which influenced team members of the Fuchsia project Taligent codenamed Pink and iOS codenamed Purple The color based naming scheme derives from the colors of index cards which Apple employees used to organize their ideas br The name of the color fuchsia is derived from the Fuchsia plant genus which is derived from the name of botanist Leonhart Fuchs br br br History br In August media outlets reported on a mysterious source code repository published on GitHub revealing that Google was developing a new operating system named Fuchsia No official announcement was made but inspection of the code suggested its capability to run on various devices including dash infotainment systems for cars embedded devices like traffic lights digital watches smartphones tablets and PCs Its architecture differs entirely from the Linux based Android and ChromeOS due in part to its unique Zircon kernel formerly named Magenta br In May Ars Technica wrote about Fuchsia s new user interface an upgrade from its command line interface at its first reveal in August A developer wrote that Fuchsia isn t a toy thing it s not a Project it s not a dumping ground of a dead thing that we don t care about anymore Though users could test Fuchsia nothing works because it s all a bunch of placeholder interfaces that don t do anything They found multiple similarities between Fuchsia s interface and Android including a Recent Apps screen a Settings menu and a split screen view for viewing multiple apps at once Multiple media outlets wrote about the project s seemingly close ties to Android with some speculating that Fuchsia might be an effort to re do or replace Android in a way that fixes its problems br In January Google published a guide on how to run Fuchsia on Pixelbooks This was implemented successfully by Ars Technica where experts were impressed with the progress noting that things were then working and were especially pleased by the hardware support and multiple mouse pointers br A Fuchsia device was added to the Android ecosystem in January via the Android Open Source Project AOSP Google talked about Fuchsia at Google I O Hiroshi Lockheimer Senior Vice President of Chrome and Android described it as one of Google s experiments around new operating system concepts br On July Google announced the official website of the development project with source code and documentation Roughly a year and a half later on December Google announced that it was expanding Fuchsia s open source model including making mailing lists public introducing a governance model publishing a roadmap and using a public issue tracker br In May Google employees confirmed that Fuchsia had been deployed in the consumer market for the first time within a software update to the first generation Google Nest Hub that replaces its existing Chromecast based software The update contains no user facing changes to the device s software or user interface After the initial wave of updates to preview devices the update was rolled out to all Nest Hub devices in August Around February the Chrome browser was fully working on Fuchsia br In January Google announced layoffs across the company with of Fuchsia employees being impacted In May Google began rolling out a Fuchsia based update to the second generation Google Nest Hub br br br Overview br Most of Fuchsia is written in Rust br br br UI and mobile apps br Fuchsia s user interface and apps are written in Flutter a software development kit allowing cross platform development abilities for Fuchsia Android and iOS Flutter produces apps from Dart Escher is the Vulkan based graphics rendering engine with specific support for volumetric soft shadows an element that Ars Technica wrote seems custom built to run Google s shadow heavy Material Design interface guidelines The Flutter cross platform software development kit allows users to install parts of Fuchsia on Android devices br A special version of Android Runtime for Fuchsia is planned to run from a FAR file the equivalent of the Android APK br br br Kernel br br Fuchsia is based on a new object capability kernel named Zircon after the mineral Its codebase was derived from that of Little Kernel LK for embedded devices aimed for low resource uses on a wide variety of devices LK was developed by Travis Geiselbrecht who had also co authored the NewOS kernel used by Haiku a free software reimplementation of BeOS br Zircon is written mostly in C with some parts in C and assembly language It is composed of a kernel with a small set of user services drivers and libraries which are all necessary for the system to boot communicate with the hardware and load the user processes Its present features include handling threads virtual memory inter process communication and waiting for changes in the state of objects br It is heavily inspired by Unix kernels but differs greatly For example it does not support Unix like signals but incorporates event driven programming and the observer pattern Most system calls do not block the main thread Resources are represented as objects rather than files unlike traditional Unix systems in which everything is a file br br br br br br External links br br Official website br An IPC for the whole OS Ian McKellar on YouTube
