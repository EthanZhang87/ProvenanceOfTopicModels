Mac OS X Server is an operating system developed by Apple Inc released on March it was the first version of Mac OS X Server br It was Apple s first commercial product to be derived from Rhapsody an eventual replacement for the classic Mac OS derived from NeXTSTEP s architecture acquired in as part of Apple s purchase of NeXT and BSD like Mach kernel It could run applications written using the Yellow Box API and featured components such as NetBoot the QuickTime Streaming Server components carried over from NeXTSTEP and the Blue Box environment which allows a Mac OS session to be launched as a separate process to run legacy Mac OS software br Mac OS X Server was a prelude to the first consumer oriented version of the OS Mac OS X which was released in It did not include the eventual Aqua user interface instead using NeXTSTEP s Workspace Manager shell mixed with aspects of Mac OS s Platinum user interface or Carbon API br br br Features br Mac OS X Server contains a mix of features from the classic Mac OS NeXTSTEP and Mac OS X Like the classic Mac OS it has a single menu bar across the top of the screen but file management is performed in Workspace Manager from NeXTSTEP instead of the classic Mac OS Finder The user interface still uses the Display PostScript based window server from NeXTSTEP instead of the Quartz based WindowServer which would appear a year later in Mac OS X Public Beta Unlike any version of Classic Mac OS windows with unsaved content display a black dot in the window close button like NeXTSTEP did The Dock and the Aqua appearance were not included these were added later in Mac OS X br Carbon essentially a subset of classic Mac OS API calls was also absent This meant that the only native applications for OS X Server were written for the Yellow Box API which went on to become known as Cocoa Furthermore Apple s own FireWire was not supported br Server also includes the first version of a NetBoot server which allows computers to boot from a disk image over a local network This was particularly useful in a school or other public machine setting as it allowed the machines to be booted from a single OS copy stored on Server This made it difficult for users to damage the OS by installing software as soon as they signed out the machine would re boot with a fresh OS from the NetBoot server br To run classic Mac OS applications Mac OS X Server includes the Blue Box which essentially ran a copy of Mac OS this could be updated to Mac OS in version and later in a separate process as an emulation layer Blue Box would eventually be renamed as the Classic Environment in Mac OS X featuring the latest version of Mac OS br br br Reception br Although marketed as a large advancement over AppleShare IP it cost and did not support Apple s own FireWire making it incompatible with products like MicroNet s SANcube a line of external high speed high capacity storage systems debuting in the year for to Buyers of OS X Server who often purchased new Macs to run it and the SANcube were forced to downgrade to AppleShare IP in order to use it OS X Server was quickly orphaned in favor of Mac OS X with no discount for those who purchased it and wished to purchase OS X Server The result is that some considered the release premature and even a bait and switch br br br Release history br br br Timeline br br br See also br Rhapsody operating system br Mac OS X Server br br br br br br External links br Mac OS X Server to System Requirements br Mac OS X Server What s new By Scott AnguishArchived at the Wayback Machine
