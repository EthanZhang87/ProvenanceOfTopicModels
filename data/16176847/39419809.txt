id: 39419809
The Nokia Asha platform is a discontinued mobile operating system OS and computing platform designed for low end borderline smartphones based on software from Smarterphone which was acquired by Nokia The platform inherits UI similarities mostly from MeeGo Harmattan and replaced Series on Nokia s low end devices The user interface design team was headed by Peter Skillman who had worked previously on webOS and the design of MeeGo for the Nokia N br It was the successor to the Meltemi project which Nokia was developing as a Linux platform to replace Series but was cancelled in July br The first phone based on the platform was the Nokia Asha followed by the Asha Asha Dual SIM and Asha all announced at Nokia World in October Another phone the Nokia Asha was announced on February and came pre installed with Asha platform br Apps for the platform were either made using Java ME or as web apps which are rendered by the Nokia Xpress browser which uses the Gecko rendering engine The mobile operating system lacks true multitasking but the radio and music app can run in background mode which is advertised as multitasking while swiping to fastlane apps will actually close down previously opened applications instead of minimising them br It featured a notification centre named Fastlane which was accessible by swiping to the left of the home screen br The platform was supplemented by the Nokia X software platform Nokia s customised version of Android seen on the Nokia X which draws cues from the Asha platform including the Fastlane notification centre br In a company memo released in July Microsoft announced that as part of cutbacks they would cease all development of the Asha Series and X ranges in favor of solely producing and encouraging the use of Lumia Windows Phone products br br br Meltemi br A much rumoured project Meltemi was the codename of a new Linux based operating system for low end handsets This was first reported in June during the N s announcement and before the Lumia s debut Nokia CEO Stephen Elop also reportedly referenced the Meltemi name as well as Clipper br It was reported in June that the Meltemi project was cancelled Reasons have been variously reported due to restructuring efforts focusing on Series Asha devices fundings or the start of a new project that would become the Asha platform An insider s report claimed that a device running Meltemi OS was almost ready before it was cancelled br In December pictures of a working Meltemi prototype device were leaked on the internet The interface is clearly based on that of MeeGo Harmattan on the N br In the book Operation Elop the authors called the Meltemi project one of the biggest secrets during Elop s era at Nokia a project Nokia never officially confirmed existed The authors further explain that Meltemi originated as a research project in under then CEO Olli Pekka Kallasvuo that Clipper was to be a device sibling to the Nokia Lumia that a tablet device for developing markets was planned and that it was part of the company s Next Billion programme much like what the Asha platform would become In addition in June it was announced that a Nokia R D centre in Ulm Germany where apparently much development took place would close down in cuts The book states that the main reason of Meltemi s cancellation was that the costs of bringing it to market would have hit the company s cash assets too hard at a time when they were already financially struggling br br br Platform evolution br br br Asha Platform br Java APIs br HERE API br Nokia Gesture API br

may be a recognition on the part of Nokia that they are unable to move Windows Phone into the bottom end of smartphone devices and may be hedging their commitment to the Windows Phone platform br br br Competition br The Asha Platform s main competition is Firefox OS and Samsung s Java based REX platform both of which are also optimised for low end handsets Furthermore entry level Android handsets are also competition to the platform br br br br br br External links
