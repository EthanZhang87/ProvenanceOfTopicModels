degradation in quality that doesn t really matter in everyday use Segan also praised performance compared to the prior iPad models and also praised improved Wi Fi performance writing that it is quite impressive with double the Wi Fi speeds on the new iPad than I did on the Air Jeff Benjamin of to Mac wrote that Sure it lacks the gorgeous laminated anti reflective display of the iPad Air and sure

users br Igor Bonifacic of MobileSyrup also praised the performance as well as number of iPad apps available but criticized the camera for being outdated and keyboard Pencil incompatibility with a summarization reading The iPad is not an exciting tablet But then it s not supposed to be exciting Apple s latest tablet is an iterative update designed to appeal to a specific subset of consumers

anti reflection on the display calling it another cost saving measure that I wish Apple had reconsidered br br br Timeline br br Source Apple Newsroom Archive br br br Notes br br br br br br External
