iPadOS released on September br br br Overview br The first iPad was released in and ran iPhone OS which added support for the larger device to the operating system previously only used on the iPhone and iPod Touch This shared operating system was rebranded as iOS with the release of iOS br The operating system initially had rough feature parity running on the iPhone iPod Touch and iPad with variations in user interface depending on screen size and minor differences in the selection of apps included However over time the variant of iOS for the iPad incorporated a growing set of differentiating features such as picture in picture the ability to display multiple running apps simultaneously both introduced with iOS in drag and drop and a dock that more closely resembled the one in macOS than the one on the iPhone added in with iOS Standard iPad apps were increasingly designed to support the optional use of a keyboard br To emphasize the different feature set available on the iPad and to signal their intention to develop the platforms in divergent directions at WWDC Apple announced that the variant of iOS that runs on the iPad would be rebranded as iPadOS The new naming

widgets but can still be accessed by swiping down from the center of the home screen or pressing Command Space on a connected keyboard br br br Multitasking br iPadOS features a multitasking system developed with more capabilities compared to iOS with features like Slide Over and Split View that make it possible to use multiple different applications simultaneously Double clicking the Home

left or right on the Home Indicator to go between spaces at any time or swipe left right with four fingers br While using an app swiping up slightly from the bottom edge of the screen will summon the Dock where apps stored within can be dragged to different areas of the current space to be opened in either Split View or Slide Over Dragging an app to the left or right edge of the screen will create a Split View which will allow both apps to be used side by side The size of the two apps in Split View can be adjusted by dragging a pill shaped icon in the center of the vertical divider and dragging the divider all the way to one side of the screen closes the respective app If the user drags an app from the dock over the current app it will create a floating window called Slide Over which can be dragged to either the left or right side of the screen A Slide Over window can be hidden by swiping it off the right side of the screen and swiping left from the right edge of the screen will restore it Slide Over apps can also be cycled between by swiping left or right on the Home Indicator in the Slide Over window and pulling up on it will open an app switcher for Slide Over windows A pill shaped icon at the top of apps in Split View or Slide Over allows them to be switched in an out of Split View and Slide Over br The user can now have several instances of a single app open at once A
