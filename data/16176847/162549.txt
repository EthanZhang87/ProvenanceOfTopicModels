id: 162549
The history of macOS Apple s current Mac operating system formerly named Mac OS X until and then OS X until began with the company s project to replace its classic Mac OS That system up to and including its final release Mac OS was a direct descendant of the operating system Apple had used in its Mac computers since their introduction in However the current macOS is a UNIX operating system built on technology that had been developed at NeXT from the s until Apple purchased the company in early br Although it was originally marketed as simply version of Mac OS indicated by the Roman numeral X it has a completely different codebase from Mac OS as well as substantial changes to its user interface The transition was a technologically and strategically significant one To ease the transition for users and developers versions through were able to run Mac OS and its applications in the Classic Environment a compatibility layer br macOS was first released in as Mac OS X Server It was built using the technologies Apple acquired from NeXT but did not include the signature Aqua user interface UI The desktop version aimed at regular users Mac OS X shipped in March Since then several more distinct desktop and server editions of macOS have been released Starting with Mac OS X Lion macOS Server is no longer offered as a standalone operating system instead server management tools are available for purchase as an add on The macOS Server app was discontinued on April and will stop working on macOS Ventura or later Starting with the Intel build of Mac OS X Leopard most releases have been certified as Unix systems conforming to the Single UNIX Specification br Lion was referred to by Apple as Mac OS X Lion and sometimes as OS X Lion Mountain Lion was officially referred to as just OS X Mountain Lion with the Mac being completely dropped The operating system was further renamed to macOS starting with macOS Sierra br From the introduction of machines not supporting the classic Mac OS in until the introduction of iPhone OS in early Mac OS X was Apple s only software platform br macOS retained the major version number throughout its development history until the release of macOS Big Sur in br Mac OS X and were given names of big cats as internal code names Cheetah and Puma Starting with Mac OS X Jaguar big cat names were used as marketing names starting with OS X Mavericks names of locations in California were used as marketing names instead br The current major version macOS Sonoma was announced on June at WWDC and released on September of that year The current beta major version macOS Sequoia was announced on June at WWDC br br br Development br br br Development outside Apple br br After Apple removed Steve Jobs from management in he left the company and attempted to create the next big thing with funding from Ross Perot and himself The result was the NeXT Computer As the first workstation to include a digital signal processor DSP and a high capacity optical disc drive NeXT hardware was advanced for its time but was expensive relative to the rapidly commoditizing workstation market The hardware was phased out in however the company s object oriented operating system NeXTSTEP had a more lasting legacy as it eventually became the basis for Mac OS X br NeXTSTEP was based on the Mach kernel developed at CMU Carnegie Mellon University and BSD an implementation of Unix dating back to the s It featured an object oriented programming framework based on the Objective C language This environment is known today in the Mac world as Cocoa It also supported the innovative Enterprise Objects Framework database access layer and WebObjects application server development environment among other notable features br All but abandoning the idea of an operating system NeXT managed to maintain a business selling WebObjects and consulting services only ever making modest profits in its last few quarters as an independent company NeXTSTEP underwent an evolution into OPENSTEP which separated the object layers from the operating system below allowing it to run with less modification on other platforms OPENSTEP was for a short time adopted by Sun and HP br However by this point a number of other companies notably Apple IBM Microsoft and even Sun itself were claiming they would soon be releasing similar object oriented operating systems and development tools of their own Some of these efforts such as Taligent did not fully come to fruition others like Java gained widespread adoption br On February Apple Computer acquired NeXT for million and used OPENSTEP as the basis for Mac OS X as it was called at the time Traces of the NeXT software heritage can still be seen in macOS For example in the Cocoa development environment the Objective C library classes have NS prefixes and the HISTORY section of the manual page for the defaults command in macOS straightforwardly states that the command First appeared in NeXTStep br br br Internal development br Meanwhile Apple was facing commercial difficulties of its own The decade old Macintosh System Software had reached the limits of its single user co operative multitasking architecture and its once innovative user interface was looking increasingly outdated A massive development effort to replace it known as Copland was started in but was generally perceived outside Apple to be a hopeless case due to political infighting and conflicting goals By Copland was nowhere near ready for release and the project was eventually cancelled Some elements of Copland were incorporated into Mac OS released on July br After considering the purchase of BeOS a multimedia enabled multi tasking OS designed for hardware similar to Apple s the company decided instead to acquire NeXT and use OPENSTEP as the basis for their new OS Avie Tevanian took over OS development and Steve Jobs was brought on as a consultant At first the plan was to develop a new operating system based almost entirely on an updated version of OPENSTEP with the addition of a virtual machine subsystem known as the Blue Box for running classic Macintosh applications The result was known by the code name Rhapsody slated for release in late br Apple expected that developers would port their software to the considerably more powerful OPENSTEP libraries once they learned of its power and flexibility Instead several major developers such as Adobe told Apple that this would never occur and that they would rather leave the platform entirely This rejection of Apple s plan was largely the result of a string of previous broken promises from Apple after watching one next OS after another disappear and Apple s market share dwindle developers were not interested in doing much work on the platform at all let alone a re write br br br Changed direction under Jobs br Apple s financial losses continued and the board of directors lost confidence in CEO Gil Amelio asking him to resign The board asked Steve Jobs to lead the company on an interim basis essentially giving him carte blanche to make changes to return the company to profitability When Jobs announced at the World Wide Developer s Conference that what developers really wanted was a modern version of the Mac OS and Apple was going to deliver it he was met with applause br Over the next two years a major effort was applied to porting the original Macintosh API to Unix libraries known as Carbon Mac OS applications could be ported to Carbon without the need for a complete re write making them operate as native applications on the new operating system Meanwhile applications written using the older toolkits would be supported using the Classic Mac OS environment Support for C C Objective C Java and Python were added furthering developer comfort with the new platform br During this time the lower layers of the operating system the Mach kernel and the BSD layers on top of it were re packaged and released under the Apple Public Source License They became known as Darwin The Darwin kernel provides a stable and flexible operating system which takes advantage of the contributions of programmers and independent open source projects outside Apple however it sees little use outside the Macintosh community br During this period the Java programming language had increased in popularity and an effort was started to improve Mac Java support This consisted of porting a high speed Java virtual machine to the platform and exposing macOS specific Cocoa APIs to the Java language br The first release of the new OS Mac OS X Server used a modified version of the Mac OS GUI but all client versions starting with Mac OS X Developer Preview used a new theme known as Aqua Aqua was a substantial departure from the Mac OS interface which had evolved with little change from that of the original Macintosh operating system it incorporated full color scalable graphics anti aliasing of text and graphics simulated shading and highlights transparency and shadows and animation A new feature was the Dock an application launcher which took advantage of these capabilities br Despite this Mac OS X maintained a substantial degree of consistency with the traditional Mac OS interface and Apple s own Apple Human Interface Guidelines with its pull down menu at the top of the screen familiar keyboard shortcuts and support for a single button mouse The development of Aqua was delayed somewhat by the switch from OpenStep s Display PostScript engine to one developed in house that was free of any license restrictions known as Quartz br br br Releases br br The Power Mac G had special Jaguar builds br Tiger did not support bit GUI applications only bit CLI applications br bit but not bit PowerPC applications were supported on Intel processors with Rosetta br bit Intel applications are supported on Apple silicon Macs with Rosetta However Intel based Macs are unable to run ARM based applications such as iOS and iPadOS apps br With the exception of Mac OS X Server and the original public beta the first several macOS versions were named after big cats Prior to its release version was code named Cheetah internally at Apple and version was code named internally as Puma br After the code name Jaguar for version received publicity in the media Apple began openly using the names to promote the operating system was marketed as Panther as Tiger as Leopard as Snow Leopard as Lion and as Mountain Lion Panther Tiger and Leopard were registered as trademarks br Apple registered Lynx and Cougar but these were allowed to lapse Apple started using the name of locations in California for subsequent releases Mavericks was named after Mavericks a popular surfing destination Yosemite was named after Yosemite National Park El Capitan was named for the El Capitan rock formation in Yosemite National Park Sierra was named for the Sierra Nevada mountain range and High Sierra was named for the area around the High Sierra Camps br In OS X was renamed to macOS A few years later in with the release of macOS Big Sur the first component of the version number was incremented from to so Big Sur s initial release s version number was instead of making the version numbers of macOS behave the way the version numbers of Apple s other operating systems do All subsequent major releases also increased the first component of the version number br br br Public Beta Kodiak br br On September Apple released a preview version of Mac OS X internally codenamed Kodiak in order to gain feedback from users It marked the first public availability of the Aqua interface and Apple made many changes to the UI based on customer feedback Mac OS X Public Beta expired and ceased to function in spring br br br Version Cheetah br On March Apple released Mac OS X internally codenamed Cheetah br The initial version was slow incomplete and had very few applications available at the time of its launch mostly from independent developers Critics suggested that the operating system was not ready for mainstream adoption but they recognized the importance of its initial launch as a base to improve upon Simply releasing Mac OS X was received by the Macintosh community as a great accomplishment for attempts to completely overhaul the Mac OS had been underway since and delayed by countless setbacks Following some bug fixes kernel panics became much less frequent br br br Version Puma br Mac OS X internally codenamed Puma was released on September br It has better performance and provided missing features such as DVD playback Apple released as a free upgrade CD for users Apple released a US upgrade CD for Mac OS br On January Apple announced that Mac OS X was to be the default operating system for all Macintosh products by the end of that month br br br Version Jaguar br On August br Apple followed up with Mac OS X Jaguar the first release to use its code name as part of the branding br It brought great raw performance improvements a sleeker look and many powerful user interface enhancements over according to Apple br including Quartz Extreme for compositing graphics directly on an ATI Radeon or Nvidia GeForce MX AGP based video card with at least MB of VRAM a system wide repository for contact information in the new Address Book and an instant messaging client named iChat br The Happy Mac which had appeared during the Mac OS startup sequence for almost years was replaced with a large grey Apple logo with the introduction of Mac OS X br br br Version Panther br Mac OS X Panther was released on October In addition to providing much improved performance it also incorporated the most extensive update yet to the user interface Panther included as many or more new features as Jaguar had the year before including an updated Finder incorporating a brushed metal interface Fast user switching Expos Window manager FileVault Safari iChat AV which added videoconferencing features to iChat improved Portable Document Format PDF rendering and much greater Microsoft Windows interoperability br Support for some early G computers such as the Power Macintosh and PowerBook was discontinued br br br Version Tiger br Mac OS X Tiger was released on April Apple stated that Tiger contained more than new features br As with Panther certain older machines were no longer supported Tiger requires a Mac with a built in FireWire port br Among the new features Tiger introduced Spotlight Dashboard Smart Folders updated Mail program with Smart Mailboxes QuickTime Safari Automator VoiceOver Core Image and Core Video The initial release of the Apple TV used a modified version of Tiger with a different graphical interface and fewer applications and services br On January Apple released the first Intel x based Macs along with the update to Tiger This operating system functioned identically on the PowerPC based Macs and the new Intel based machines with the exception of the Intel release dropping support for the Classic environment introduced Rosetta which translated bit PowerPC machine code to bit x code allowing applications for PowerPC to run on Intel based Macs without modification br Only PowerPC Macs can be booted from retail copies of the Tiger client DVD but there is a Universal DVD of Tiger Server K that can boot both PowerPC and Intel Macs br br br Version Leopard br Mac OS X Leopard was released on October Apple called it the largest update of Mac OS X Leopard supports both PowerPC and Intel x based Macintosh computers support for Macs with the G processor was dropped and Macs with the G processor required a minimum clock rate of MHz and at least MB of RAM to be installed The single DVD works for all supported Macs including bit machines New features include a new look an updated Finder Time Machine Spaces Boot Camp pre installed full support for bit applications including graphical applications new features in Mail and iChat and a number of new security features br br Leopard is an Open Brand UNIX registered product on the Intel platform It was also the first BSD based OS to receive UNIX certification Leopard dropped support for the Classic Environment and all Classic applications and was the final version of Mac OS X to support the PowerPC architecture br br br Version Snow Leopard br Mac OS X Snow Leopard was released on August the last version to be available on disc Rather than delivering big changes to the appearance and end user functionality like the previous releases of Mac OS X the development of Snow Leopard was deliberately focused on under the hood changes increasing the performance efficiency and stability of the operating system For most users the most noticeable changes are these the disk space that the operating system frees up after a clean installation compared to Mac OS X Leopard a more responsive Finder rewritten in Cocoa faster Time Machine backups more reliable and user friendly disk ejects a more powerful version of the Preview application as well as a faster Safari web browser br An update introduced support for the Mac App Store Apple s digital distribution platform for macOS applications and subsequent macOS upgrades Snow Leopard only supports Macs with Intel CPUs requires at least GB of RAM and drops default support for applications built for the PowerPC architecture Rosetta can be installed as an additional component to retain support for PowerPC only applications br br br Version Lion br Mac OS X Lion also known as OS X Lion was released on July It brought developments made in Apple s iOS such as an easily navigable display of installed applications Launchpad and a greater use of multi touch gestures to the Mac This release removed Rosetta making it incapable of running PowerPC applications It dropped support for bit Intel processors and requires GB of memory Changes made to the GUI Graphical User Interface include the Launchpad similar to the home screen of iOS and iPadOS devices auto hiding scrollbars that only appear when they are being used and Mission Control which unifies Expos Spaces Dashboard and full screen applications within a single interface br Apple also made changes to applications they resume in the same state as they were before they were closed similar to iOS Documents auto save by default br br br Version Mountain Lion br OS X Mountain Lion was released on July It incorporates some features seen in iOS which include Game Center support for iMessage in the new Messages messaging application and Reminders as a to do list app separate from iCal which is renamed as Calendar like the iOS app It also includes support for storing iWork documents in iCloud GB of memory is required Application pop ups are now concentrated on the corner of the screen and the Center itself is pulled from the right side of the screen Mountain Lion also includes more Chinese features including support for Baidu as an option for Safari search engine Notification Center is added providing an overview of alerts from applications It is a is a desktop version similar to the one in iOS and higher Notes is added as an application separate from Mail synching with its iOS counterpart through the iCloud service Messages an instant messaging software application replaces iChat br br br Version Mavericks br OS X Mavericks was released on October as a free update through the Mac App Store worldwide br It placed emphasis on battery life Finder enhancements other enhancements for power users and continued iCloud integration as well as bringing more of Apple s iOS apps to the OS X platform iBooks and Apple Maps applications were added Mavericks requires GB of memory to operate It is the first version named under Apple s then new theme of places in California dubbed Mavericks after the surfing location Unlike previous versions of OS X which had progressively decreasing prices since was available at no charge to all users of compatible systems running Snow Leopard or later beginning Apple s policy of free upgrades for life on its operating system and business software br br br Version Yosemite br OS X Yosemite was released to the general public on October as a free update through the Mac App Store worldwide It featured a major overhaul of user interface replaced skeuomorphism with flat graphic design and blurred translucency effects following the aesthetic introduced with iOS It introduced features called Continuity and Handoff which allow for tighter integration between paired OS X and iOS devices the user can handle phone calls or text messages on either their Mac or their iPhone and edit the same Pages document on either their Mac or their iPad A later update of the OS included Photos as a replacement for iPhoto and Aperture br br br Version El Capitan br OS X El Capitan was revealed on June during the WWDC keynote speech It was made available as a public beta in July and was made available publicly on September Apple described this release as containing Refinements to the Mac Experience and Improvements to System Performance rather than new features Refinements include public transport built into the Maps application GUI improvements to the Notes application as well as adopting San Francisco as the system font Metal API an application enhancing software had debuted in this operating system being available to all Macs since br br br Version Sierra br macOS Sierra was announced on June during the WWDC keynote speech The update brought the Siri assistant to macOS featuring several Mac specific features like searching for files It also allowed websites to support Apple Pay as a method of transferring payment using either a nearby iOS device or Touch ID to authenticate iCloud also received several improvements such as the ability to store a user s Desktop and Documents folders on iCloud so they could be synced with other Macs on the same Apple ID It was released publicly on September br br br Version High Sierra br macOS High Sierra was announced on June during the WWDC keynote speech It was released on September The release includes many under the hood improvements including a switch to Apple File System APFS the introduction of Metal support for HEVC video and improvements to VR support In addition numerous changes were made to standard applications including Photos Safari Notes and Spotlight br br br Version Mojave br macOS Mojave was announced on June during the WWDC keynote speech It was released on September Some of the key new features were Dark wallpaper in dark mode Desktop stacks and Dynamic Desktop which changes the desktop background image to correspond to the user s current time of day br br br Version Catalina br macOS Catalina was announced on June during the WWDC keynote speech It was released on October It primarily focuses on updates to built in apps such as replacing iTunes with separate Music Podcasts and TV apps redesigned Reminders and Books apps and a new Find My app It also features Sidecar which allows the user to use an iPad as a second screen for their computer or even simulate a graphics tablet with an Apple Pencil It is the first version of macOS not to support bit applications The Dashboard application was also removed in the update Since macOS Catalina iOS apps can run on macOS with Project Catalyst but requires the app to be made compatible unlike ARM powered Apple silicon Macs that can run all iOS apps by default br br br Version Big Sur br macOS Big Sur was announced on June during the WWDC keynote speech It was released November The major version number is changed for the first time since Mac OS X was released making it macOS It brings ARM support new icons GUI changes to the system and other bug fixes br Since macOS it is no longer possible to install iOS apps by default from an IPA file instead of the Mac App Store on Apple silicon Macs which now requires third party software to unlock the functionality Big Sur introduced Rosetta to allow bit Intel applications to run on Apple silicon Macs However Intel based Macs are unable to run ARM based applications including iOS and iPadOS apps br br br Version Monterey br macOS Monterey was announced on June during the WWDC keynote speech It was released on October macOS Monterey introduces new features such as Universal Control which allows users to use a single keyboard and mouse to move between devices AirPlay which now allows users to present and share almost anything the Shortcuts app also introduced to macOS gives users access to galleries of pre built shortcuts designed for Macs a service brought from iOS and users can now also set up shortcuts among other things macOS Monterey is the final version of macOS that officially supports macOS Server br br br Version Ventura br macOS Ventura was announced on June during the WWDC keynote speech It was released on October macOS Ventura introduces Stage Manager a new and optional window manager a redesigned settings app and Continuity Camera which is a program that allows Mac users to use their iPhone as a camera and several other new features It is also the first version of macOS without macOS Server support br br br Version Sonoma br macOS Sonoma was announced on June during the WWDC keynote speech Key changes include a revamp of Widgets the user lock screen and a video wallpaper screensaver feature using Apple TV s screen saver videos It was released on September br br br Version
