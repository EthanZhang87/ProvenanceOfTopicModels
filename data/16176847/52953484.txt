like AT T s HBO would not have the same level of access to the data captured from Apple TV Channels that they currently receive through their own apps and websites to see what everybody s really watching and be able to make certain decisions instead insisting that AT T s digital distribution deals provide it access to data critical to advertising delivery critical to marketing br br br MLS
