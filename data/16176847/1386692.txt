iWork is an office suite of applications created by Apple for its macOS iPadOS and iOS operating systems and also available cross platform through the iCloud website br iWork includes the presentation application Keynote the word processing and desktop publishing application Pages and the spreadsheet application Numbers Apple s design goals in creating iWork have been to allow Mac users to easily create attractive documents and spreadsheets making use of macOS s extensive font library integrated spelling checker sophisticated graphics APIs and its AppleScript automation framework br The equivalent Microsoft Office applications to Pages Numbers and Keynote are Word Excel and PowerPoint respectively Although Microsoft Office applications cannot open iWork documents iWork applications can open Office documents for editing and export documents from iWork s native formats pages numbers key to Microsoft Office formats docx xlsx pptx etc as well as to PDF files br The oldest application in iWork is Keynote first released as a standalone application in for use by Steve Jobs in his presentations Steve Jobs announced Keynote saying It s for when your presentation really matters br Pages was released with the first iWork bundle in Numbers was added in with the release of iWork The next release iWork also included beta access to iWork com an online service that allowed users to upload and share documents on the web now integrated into Apple s iCloud service A version of iWork for iOS was released in with the first iPad and the apps have been regularly updated since including the addition of iPhone support In Apple launched iWork web apps in iCloud even years later however their functionality is somewhat limited compared to equivalents on the desktop br iWork was initially sold as a suite for then later at per app on OS X and per app on iOS Apple announced in October that all iOS and OS X devices purchased onwards whether new or refurbished would be eligible for a free download of all three iWork apps after device setup the user can claim the apps on the App Store after which they re permanently linked to the user s Apple ID iWork for iCloud which also incorporates a document hosting service is free to all iCloud users iWork was released for free on macOS and iOS including older or resold devices in April br In September Apple announced that the real time collaboration feature would be available for all iWork apps br br br History br The first version of iWork iWork was announced on January at the Macworld Conference Expo and made available on January in the United States and worldwide on January iWork comprised two applications Keynote a presentation creation program and Pages a word processor iWork was sold for US A day trial was also made available for download on Apple s website Originally IGG Software held the rights to the name iWork br While iWork was billed by Apple as a successor to AppleWorks it does not replicate AppleWorks s database and drawing tools However iWork integrates with existing applications from Apple s iLife suite through the Media Browser which allows users to drag and drop music from iTunes movies from iMovie and photos from iPhoto and Aperture directly into iWork documents br iWork was released on January and contained updated versions of both Keynote and Pages Both programs were released as universal binaries for the first time allowing them to run natively on both PowerPC processors and the Intel processors used in the new iMac desktop computers and MacBook Pro notebooks which had been announced on the same day as the new iWork suite br The next version of the suite iWork was announced and released on August at a special media event at Apple s campus in Cupertino California iWork like previous updates contained updated versions of Keynote and Pages A new spreadsheet application Numbers was also introduced Numbers differed from other spreadsheet applications including Microsoft Excel in that it allowed users to create documents containing multiple spreadsheets on a flexible canvas using a number of built in templates br iWork was announced on January and released the same day It contains updated versions of all three applications in the suite iWork also included access to a beta version of the iWork com service which allowed users to share documents online until that service was decommissioned at the end of July Users of iWork could upload a document directly from Pages Keynote or Numbers and invite others to view it online Viewers could write notes and comments in the document and download a copy in iWork Microsoft Office or PDF formats iWork was also released with the Mac App Store on January at per application and received regular updates after this point including links to iCloud and a high DPI version designed to match Apple s MacBook Pro with Retina Display br On January Apple announced iWork for iPad to be available as three separate applications from the App Store This version has also received regular updates including a version for pocket iPhone and iPod Touch devices and an update to take advantage of Retina Display devices and the larger screens of recent iPhones br On October Apple announced an overhaul of the iWork software for both the Mac and iOS Both suites were made available via the respective App Stores The update is free for current iWork owners and was also made available free of charge for anyone purchasing an OS X or iOS device after October Any user activating the newly free iWork apps on a qualifying device can download the same apps on another iOS or OS X device logged into the same App Store account br The new OS X versions have been criticized for losing features such as multiple selection linked text boxes bookmarks up page views mail merge searchable comments ability to read export RTF files default zoom and page count integration with AppleScript Apple has provided a road map for feature re introduction stating that it hopes to reintroduce some missing features within the next six months As of April a few features e g the ability to set the default zoom had been reintroduced though scores had not br Due to using a completely new file format that can work across macOS Windows and in most web browsers by using the online iCloud web apps versions of iWork beginning with iWork and later do not open or allow editing of documents created in versions prior to iWork with users who attempt to open older iWork files being given a pop up in the new iWork app versions telling them to use the previous iWork which users may or may not have on their machine in order to open and edit such files Accordingly the current version for OS X which was initially only compatible with OS X Mavericks onwards moves any previously installed iWork apps to an iWork folder on the users machine in Applications iWork as a work around to allow users continued use of the earlier suite in order to open and edit older iWork documents locally on their machine In October Apple released an update to mitigate this issue allowing users to open documents saved in iWork and iWork formats in the latest version of Pages br In Apple announced that the real time collaboration feature would be available for all iWork apps instead of being constrained to using iWork for iCloud The feature is comparable to Google Docs br br br Versions br br br Major releases br br br Updates br iWork received several updates br br iWork DVD for Mac OS X Leopard or newer released August br iWork for Mac OS X Leopard or newer released August br iWork for Mac OS X Snow Leopard or newer released July br iWork for Mac OS X Lion or newer released December br The Mac App Store version of iWork was updated on October for Yosemite or newer It is the final release to support Yosemite and El Capitan Keynote Pages and Numbers are included br iWork received a major update again on March with Keynote Pages and Numbers br br br Components br br br Common components br Products in the iWork suite share a number of components largely as a result of sharing underlying code from the Cocoa and similar shared application programming interfaces APIs Among these are the well known universal multilingual spell checker which can also be found in products like Safari and Mail Grammar checking find and replace style and color pickers are similar examples of design features found throughout the Apple application space br Moreover the applications in the iWork suite also share a new model of the document In most document based applications there is a particular data type which forms the basis of the application s view of the world for instance in word processors the text is the first class citizen of the application while in a spreadsheet it is the cells in the table Other objects images or charts for instance are managed by being attached to or referenced to the underlying primary data type br In iWork all of the applications share a common underlying document format the canvas a generic container type that provides layout and storage mechanisms Each application then adds its own custom objects and places them on the canvas Pages for instance conventionally opens with a single large text object on the canvas To the user it appears to be a typical word processor but they can grab the corner and re size it as in a page layout application In Numbers one initially sees a grid of cells like any other spreadsheet but the user is free to size it smaller than the canvas and then add multiple grids charts or even drawings to the same canvas br The difference is subtle as many of these features are also implemented in more traditional programs like Microsoft Excel However the difference in UI can be significant In Excel for instance charts are stored as part of a sheet and can be moved inadvertently through natural user actions In Numbers charts are like everything else part of the canvas and changes to the sheet s are normally independent br The iWork model bears some resemblance to the earlier Apple effort OpenDoc OpenDoc also used a single underlying document engine along with a single on disk format Unlike iWork however OpenDoc also used a single application in which various editors could be invoked For instance one could open a generic document start a spreadsheet editor then add a spreadsheet iWork lacks this level of flexibility in editing terms but maintains it in layout br br br Desktop applications br br br Pages br br Pages is a word processing application br Besides basic word processing functionality Pages includes templates designed by Apple to allow users to create various types of documents including newsletters invitations stationery and r sum s along with a number of education themed templates for students and teachers such as reports and outlines Pages a complete redesign removed more than of the features of Pages x including bookmarks mail merge linked text boxes multiple section capability ability to set default zoom It has been slowly adding some back in subsequent x releases default zoom for example can now be set but still no linked text boxes multiple select mail merge book marks and more than other features that were present in version br Along with Keynote and Numbers Pages integrates with Apple s iLife suite Using the Media Browser users can drag and drop movies photos and music directly into documents within the Pages application A Full Screen view hides the menubar and toolbars and an outline mode allows users to quickly create outlines which can easily be rearranged by dragging and dropping as well as collapsed and expanded Pages includes support for entering complex equations with MathType and for reference citing using EndNote X br The Pages application can open and edit Microsoft Word documents including DOC and Office Open XML files and plain text documents Pages can no longer read or export rich text format documents Pages can also export documents in the DOC PDF and ePub formats It cannot read or write OpenDocument file formats br As a word processing application targeted towards creating attractive documents for a range of applications such as lesson plans and newsletters Pages competes with Microsoft Word Microsoft Publisher never ported to macOS Apple s own free e book and PDF authoring application iBooks Author and Adobe s professional market desktop publishing application InDesign br br br Keynote br br Keynote is an application used to create and play presentations Its features are comparable to those of Microsoft PowerPoint though Keynote contains several unique features Keynote like Pages and Numbers integrates with the iLife application suite Users can drag and drop media from iMovie iTunes iPhoto and Aperture directly into Keynote presentations using the Media Browser Keynote contains a number of templates transitions and effects Magic Move allows users to apply simple transitions to automatically animate images and text that are repeated on consecutive slides br Apple formerly released a Keynote Remote application for iOS that let users view slides and presenter notes and control Keynote presentations with an iPhone or iPod Touch over a Wi Fi network but that functionality has been rolled into subsequent releases of the main Keynote iOS application br Keynote supports a number of file formats By default presentations are saved as key files Keynote can open and edit Microsoft PowerPoint ppt files In addition presentations can be exported as Microsoft PowerPoint files QuickTime movies which are also playable on iPod and iPhone HTML files and PDF files Presentations can also be sent directly to iDVD iTunes GarageBand iWeb and to YouTube The Keynote file format is not backward compatible key files saved with Keynote cannot be opened with earlier versions of Keynote br br br Numbers br br Numbers is a spreadsheet application that was added to the iWork suite in with the release of iWork Numbers like Microsoft Excel and other spreadsheet applications lets users organize data into tables perform calculations with formulas and create charts and graphs using data entered into the spreadsheet Numbers however differs from other spreadsheet applications in that it allows users to create multiple tables in a single document on a flexible canvas Many prebuilt templates including ones designed for personal finance education and business use are included br Numbers was included with iWork with several improvements Charts that are pasted into Keynote and Pages are automatically updated across documents when they are changed in Numbers Additionally Numbers lets users categorize data in tables by column which can then be collapsed and summarized br Numbers added in the ability to open Numbers spreadsheets among other things br br br Web services br br br iWork com br br iWork com was a free service that enabled users to share iWork documents online directly from within Pages Keynote and Numbers br Users could click the iWork com toolbar icon and login using their Apple ID to upload a document and invite others to view it online Viewers could leave comments and notes on the document and download a copy in iWork Microsoft Office or PDF formats Document owners could track comments at the iWork com website br It was released as a public beta on January at the Macworld Conference Expo The iWork com service provides a web interface for viewing downloading and commenting uploaded documents In contrast to cloud based office applications such as Google Docs and Office Online it did not offer editing br iWork com supported uploading of Pages documents Keynote presentations and Numbers spreadsheets Users could download documents in both Microsoft Office and PDF formats in addition to their native iWork formats Uploading documents to iWork com requires a copy of the iWork software suite and an Apple ID Viewing commenting and downloading require only a web browser and an invitation to view the document br Apple announced that after July users would be no longer able to publish new documents to iWork com from any iWork application Documents stored on iWork com will not be available to download or view after the shut down date Instead users can use iCloud to share documents between their computers running OS X Mountain Lion and their iOS devices Users attempting to access the iWork com site are re directed to the Apple homepage br br br iWork for iCloud br br During the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference WWDC keynote speech iWork for iCloud was announced for release at the same time as the next version of the app versions of iWork later in the year The three apps for both iOS and OS X that form Apple s iWork suite Pages Numbers and Keynote will be made available on a web interface named as Pages for iCloud Numbers for iCloud and Keynote for iCloud respectively and accessed via the iCloud website under each users iCloud Apple ID login They will also sync with the users iOS and OS X versions of the app should they have them via their iCloud Apple ID br Later in iWork for iCloud update added support for real time collaboration such that the same document could be opened by collaborators at the same time and everyone could make changes simultaneously It took a few seconds for changes to propagate to other collaborators This however could not work together with iOS and OS X apps which would cause out of sync dialogs if editing together with collaborators using iWork for iCloud In Apple announced that the real time collaboration feature would be available to iOS and OS X apps br This allows the user to edit and create documents on the web using one of the supported browsers currently Safari Chrome and Internet Explorer It also means that Microsoft Windows users now have access to these native previously only Apple device document editing tools via the web interface iWork for iCloud has more limited set of features compared to the OS X version of the applications For instance the fonts available are more limited and the web version does not fully support printing and may display documents created with the support of external plug ins incorrectly improperly In iWork for iCloud update adds languages new fonts and improved editing in the cloud based versions of Pages Numbers and Keynote br br br iOS apps br On June while showcasing the new iPhone Apple posted a few screenshots of the device in action and inadvertently showed the possibility of opening an email attachment inside of Keynote leading some to believe that an iPhone version of the iWork suite would soon be available in the iOS App Store br On June several websites reported that in an attempt to sell AppleCare for the iPhone several examples of services offered were given including one that read Using iWork for iPhone and other Apple branded iPhone apps These sites also report that it was quickly removed br On May Apple released a press statement that iWork would be available on the iOS app store for the iPhone and iPod Touch br On September Apple announced that iWork iMovie and iPhoto would be available to download for free on new iOS devices activated after September br br br See also br List of
