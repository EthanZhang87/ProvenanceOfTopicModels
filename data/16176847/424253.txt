version br GarageBand was updated to version on October This version adds a dedicated Bass Amp Designer global track effects and dynamic track resizing br Apple released GarageBand on June br br br Features br br br Audio recording br GarageBand is a digital audio workstation DAW and music sequencer that can record and play back multiple tracks of audio Built in audio filters that use the AU audio unit standard allow the user to enhance the audio track with various effects including reverb echo and distortion amongst others GarageBand also offers the ability to record at both bit and bit Audio Resolution but at a fixed sample rate of kHz An included tuning system helps with pitch correction and can effectively imitate the Auto Tune effect when tuned to the maximum level It also has a large array of preset effects to choose from with an option to create one s own effects br br br Virtual software instruments br GarageBand includes a large selection of realistic sampled instruments and software modeled synthesizers These can be used to create original compositions or play music live through the use of a USB MIDI keyboard connected to the computer An on screen virtual keyboard is also available as well as using a standard QWERTY keyboard with the musical typing feature The synthesizers were broken into two groups virtual analog and digital Each synthesizer has a wide variety of adjustable parameters including richness glide cut off standard attack decay sustain and release these allow for a wide array of sound creation The five synth thumbnails are the ARP the Minimoog the Waldorf Wave the Nord Lead and the Yamaha DX br br br Guitar features br In addition to the standard tracks Garageband allows for guitar specific tracks that can use a variety of simulated amplifiers stomp boxes and effects processors These imitate popular hardware from companies including Marshall Amplification Orange Music Electronic Company and Fender Musical Instruments Corporation Up to five simulated effects can be layered on top of the virtual amplifiers which feature adjustable parameters including tone reverb and volume Guitars can be connected to Macs using the built in input requires hardware that can produce a standard stereo signal using a mm output or a USB interface br br br MIDI editing br GarageBand can import MIDI files and offers piano roll or notation style editing and playback By complying with the MIDI Standard a user can edit many different aspects of a recorded note including pitch velocity and duration Pitch was settable to of a semitone on a scale of sometimes described on a scale of for clarity Velocity which determines amplitude volume can be set and adjusted on a scale of Note duration can be adjusted manually via the piano roll or in the score view Note rhythms can be played via the software instruments or created in the piano roll environment rhythm correction is also included to lock notes to any time signature subdivision GarageBand also offers global editing capabilities to MIDI information with Enhanced Timing also known as Quantizing While offering comprehensive control over MIDI files GarageBand does not include several features of professional level DAWs such as a sequencer for drum tracks separate from the normal piano roll However many of these shortcomings have been addressed with each successive release of GarageBand br Also of note MIDI sequences edited or created in GarageBand cannot be exported to other DAWs or programs without first being converted to audio A MIDI file can be extracted from a loop file created from a region but this is not a general MIDI export facility using manual steps and an open source program br br br Music lessons br A new feature included with GarageBand and later is the ability to download pre recorded music lessons from GarageBand s Lesson Store for guitar and piano There are two types of lessons available in the Lesson Store Basic Lessons which are a free download and Artist Lessons which a user must purchase The first Basic Lessons for both guitar and piano are included with GarageBand In GarageBand many sounds aka patches which Apple refers to as audio units that are listed within the sound library are dimmed and unusable until the user pays an additional fee that allows the utilization of those sounds bundled with the guitar and piano lessons Attempting to click on and select the dimmed audio units to apply to the track causes promotional prompts to appear requiring the user to log on with their Apple ID and furnish credit card information before knowing the price of the bundle br In both types of lessons a music teacher presents the lesson which is in a special format offering high quality video and audio instructions The lessons include a virtual guitar or piano which demonstrates finger position and a musical notation area to show the correct musical notations The music examples used in these lessons feature popular music br In an Artist Lesson the music teacher is the actual musician songwriter who composed the song being taught in the lesson As of November the artists featured are br br Sting The Police Roxanne Message in a Bottle Fragile br Sarah McLachlan Angel br Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy I Don t Care Sugar We re Goin Down br Norah Jones Thinking About You br Colbie Caillat Bubbly br Sara Bareilles Love Song br John Fogerty Creedence Clearwater Revival Proud Mary Fortunate Son Centerfield br Ryan Tedder OneRepublic Apologize br Ben Folds Brick Zak and Sara br John Legend Ordinary People br Alex Lifeson Rush Tom Sawyer Limelight Working Man The Spirit of Radio br No new Artist Lessons were released in and Apple has not announced plans to release additional entries br In June the GarageBand update made Artist Lessons free br br br Additional audio loops br Garageband includes an extensive selection of pre made audio loops to choose from with an option to import custom sound loops and an additional loop pack that is purchasable via the App Store All loops have an edit and effects option br The Additional Audio Loops are as follows br br br Jam Packs br Jam Packs are Apple s official add ons for GarageBand Each Jam Pack contains loops and software instruments grouped into certain genres and styles br The Jam Packs are as follows br br GarageBand Jam Pack Remix Tools br GarageBand Jam Pack Rhythm Section br GarageBand Jam Pack Symphony Orchestra br GarageBand Jam Pack World Music br GarageBand Jam Pack Voices br There was also another GarageBand Jam Pack initially known just as GarageBand Jam Pack later GarageBand Jam Pack which Apple discontinued in January Beginning with the release of the Remix Tools and Rhythm Section Jam Packs each Jam Pack has been designated with a number The release of GarageBand Jam Pack World Music also saw a redesign in packaging br br br MainStage br MainStage by Apple also includes built in instruments including synths vintage keyboards and a drum machine to use in GarageBand It also features an interface for live performances and includes a large collection of plug ins and sounds br br br Third party instrument and Apple Loop packages br In addition to Apple many other companies today offer commercial or shareware virtual software instruments designed especially for GarageBand and collections of Apple Loops intended for GarageBand users br GarageBand can also use any third party software synthesizer that adheres to the Core Audio Audio Units standard However there are limitations including that Audio Unit instruments which can respond to multiple MIDI channels or ports can be triggered only on the first channel of the first port This means that multi timbral instruments that contain multiple channels and respond to many MIDI channels such as Native Instruments Kontakt and MOTU MachFive are not ideally suited for use in GarageBand br Third party vendors also offer extra loops for use in GarageBand Users can also record custom loops through a microphone via a software instrument or by using an audio interface to connect physically a guitar or other hardware instruments to a Mac or iOS device br br br Sample multitrack source files br In Trent Reznor from the band Nine Inch Nails released the source multitrack GarageBand files for the song The Hand That Feeds to allow the public to experiment with his music and permitted prospective GarageBand users to remix the song He also gave permission for anyone to share their personalized remix with the world Since then Nine Inch Nails has released several more GarageBand source files and several other artists have also released their GarageBand files that the public could use to experiment br New Zealand band Evermore also released the source multi track files for GarageBand for their song Never Let You Go br Ben Folds released Stems Seeds a special version of his album Way to Normal Stems and Seeds contained a remastered version of Way to Normal and a separate disc containing GarageBand files for each track from the album to allow fans to remix the songs br br br Limitations br A lack of MIDI out capability limits the use of external MIDI instruments There is also only limited support for messages sent from knobs on MIDI keyboards as only real time pitch bend modulation sustain and foot control are recognizable However since GarageBand other parameters affected by MIDI knobs can be automated later per track GarageBand has no functions for changing time signature mid song though the software does now allow a tempo track to automate tempo changes br Other than pitch bend GarageBand is limited to the pitches and intervals of standard tone equal temperament so it does not natively support xenharmonic music Logic Pro supports many different tunings GarageBand does not support different tunings however audio units which support micro tuning using scl or tun files or some other method can be employed in GarageBand to produce alternative pitches br Before GarageBand there was no export option and the only option was to save files as band or export to iTunes There is no built in MIDI export feature although regions can be manually exported as loops and converted to MIDI files br br br GarageBand for iOS br br On March Apple announced a version of GarageBand for the iPad It has many features similar to the macOS version Music can be created using the on screen instruments which include keyboards drums a sampler and various smart instruments It also acts as a multitrack recording studio with stomp box effects and guitar amps Songs can be emailed or sent to an iTunes Library Additionally projects can be imported to GarageBand for macOS where they are further editable This feature also allows
