Apple silicon refers to a series of system on a chip SoC and system in a package SiP processors designed by Apple Inc mainly using the ARM architecture They are the basis of Mac iPhone iPad Apple TV Apple Watch AirPods AirTag HomePod and Apple Vision Pro devices br Apple announced its plan to switch Mac computers from Intel processors to Apple silicon at WWDC on June The first Macs built with the Apple M chip were unveiled on November As of June the entire Mac lineup uses Apple silicon chips br Apple fully controls the integration of Apple silicon chips with the company s hardware and software products Johny Srouji is in charge of Apple s silicon design Manufacturing of the chips is outsourced to semiconductor contract manufacturers such as TSMC br br br A series br br The A series is a family of SoCs used in the iPhone certain iPad models and the Apple TV A series chips were also used in the discontinued iPod Touch line and the original HomePod They integrate one or more ARM based processing cores CPU a graphics processing unit GPU cache memory and other electronics necessary to provide mobile computing functions within a single physical package br br br Apple A br br The Apple A is a PoP SoC manufactured by Samsung the first SoC Apple designed in house It combines an ARM Cortex A CPU also used in Samsung s S PC A SoC and a PowerVR SGX graphics processor GPU all built on Samsung s nanometer silicon chip fabrication process The design emphasizes power efficiency The A commercially debuted in in Apple s iPad tablet and was later used in the iPhone smartphone the fourth generation iPod Touch and the nd generation Apple TV br The Cortex A core used in the A dubbed Hummingbird is thought to use performance improvements developed by Samsung in collaboration with chip designer Intrinsity which was subsequently acquired by Apple It can run at far higher clock rates than other Cortex A designs yet remains fully compatible with the design provided by ARM The A runs at different speeds in different products GHz in the first iPads MHz in the iPhone and fourth generation iPod Touch and an undisclosed speed in the nd generation Apple TV br The A s SGX GPU could theoretically push million polygons per second and million pixels per second although real world performance may be considerably less Other performance improvements include additional L cache br The A processor package does not contain RAM but supports PoP installation The st generation iPad fourth generation iPod Touch and the nd generation Apple TV have an A mounted with two low power MB DDR SDRAM chips totaling MB while the iPhone has two MB packages for a total of MB The RAM is connected to the processor using ARM s bit wide AMBA AXI bus To give the iPad high graphics bandwidth the width of the RAM data bus is double that used in previous ARM and ARM based Apple devices br br br Apple A br br The Apple A is an SoC manufactured by Samsung that replaced the A The chip commercially
