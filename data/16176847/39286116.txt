buttons being hidden as negative aspects of the user experience The addition of the Control Center was praised as were updates to Siri and multitasking Shortly after release there were reports of the new design causing sickness a trend explained as being caused by animations with similar effects as car sickness br User adoption of iOS was fast Its iOS market share was reported to be as high as after one day and installed on million devices within days which Apple stated was the fastest software update in history br iOS is the last version of iOS that supports the iPhone br br br System features br br br Design br iOS introduced a complete visual overhaul of the user interface With sharper flatter icons slimmer fonts a new slide to unlock function and a new control panel that slides up from the bottom of the screen for frequently accessed settings the operating system also significantly redesigned the standard pre installed apps from Apple Jonathan Ive Apple s head of design commented that There is a profound and enduring beauty in simplicity in clarity in efficiency True simplicity is derived from so much more than just the absence of clutter and ornamentation it s about bringing order to complexity iOS is a clear representation of these goals It has a whole new structure that is coherent and applied across the entire system The background color of the Boot screen matches the device s front bezel color of white or black with the oppositely colored brand logo br br br AirDrop br iOS introduced AirDrop a wireless sharing technology accessible from the share icon

device communicates with Apple s servers Siri can now control a limited set of device settings including Bluetooth The assistant can alternatively send the user directly to the settings menu if their query cannot be controlled by voice or otherwise displays an error if the request can t be processed For searching the Internet Bing became the default search engine and Siri s web resources were

notifications turn off the parallax wallpaper animation effect using a Reduce Motion setting and block callers with the block applying across multiple devices and apps including Phone Messages and FaceTime br On the home screen newly installed apps and recently updated apps have a blue dot next to them until the user opens the app for the first time br Folders are updated to incorporate

Also new are live filters nine different filter options that each change the photo s appearance Further improvements to the camera included the ability to pinch to zoom during video recording and a Burst mode for easily taking successive photos by holding the shutter button causing the phone to take frames per second On the iPhone S a slow motion video option was added with the ability to shoot a video at a high frame rate of frames per second All iPhones record slow motion video with audio It can be edited in the Photos app where users can decide where to start and end the slow motion part

shutter button use flat design with simple geometrical shapes br Switching between the camera modes is done using swiping gestures or tapping on the name of the mode text near the on screen shutter button br The camera user interfaces of all succeeding iOS versions are based on this layout and design introduced in iOS br br br Camera controls br The redesigned camera interface offers new controls for adjusting exposure value and locking the autofocus br Tapping inside the viewfinder adjusts the focus and exposure to that area in the camera s field of view In order to hold lock the current focus and exposure state the desired location inside of the viewfinder can be tapped and held down for half a second This is known as the AE AF lock or AF AE lock br After tapping with or without locked focus exposure the exposure value can be adjusted by swiping up or down In case AE AF lock is activated the exposure will be fixed indefinitely until unlocked manually br These controls

discontinued in January with the features moving to the new Apple Music music subscription service and Beats radio station br br br Safari br In iOS the Safari web browser received multiple significant updates The two search bars found in previous iterations of the browser have been combined into a single Smart Search field Tab management was improved to allow more than eight open tabs

a new Do Not Track button allows the user to further manage their privacy levels br br br Maps br Apple Maps now features turn by turn walking directions br The design of Maps was updated to feature a full screen view where interface elements such as the search bar disappear from view alongside new translucent search and lower toolbars and a Night Mode that automatically activates when users drive at night A separate Siri volume control is available in Maps enabling users to change the relative volume of Siri s voice feedback independently of the system volume so it doesn t shout too loud over

new dynamic visual representations of the current weather br br br FaceTime br iOS has its own FaceTime app on iPhone with FaceTime Audio a feature that allows users to call while on Wi Fi FaceTime Audio is accessible from the Phone app the Contacts app or the FaceTime app itself It is available on devices running iOS or later br br br Messages br The Messages app now allows users to see timestamps for every message they have sent or received br br br Reception br br The reception of iOS was mixed Mark Rogowsky of Forbes criticized multiple aspects of the new design including the D effect on the home screen wallpaper writing that the interaction between iOS and the screen background is challenging at best and writing that the new overall design language for the operating system now has your icons fly into the screen whenever you unlock it like some kind of video game effect It s pointless delays your access to the phone by a fraction of a second and is arguably distracting Joshua Topolsky of The Verge also criticized the design noting lack of icon consistency in different parts of the OS as well as writing that instead of correcting issues with the notification panel and alerts Apple has simply given them a fresh coat of paint and several layers of sub navigation doing nothing to actually speed up your productivity on the device br The Nielsen Norman Group a research company wrote an extensive report on the user experience of iOS summarizing the report as Flat design hides calls to action and swiping around the edges can interfere with carousels and scrolling br David Pogue of The New York Times however liked the minimalist design of iOS writing that The longer you spend with the new OS the more you re grateful for the fixing and de annoyifying on display and that you can swipe upward from the bottom of the screen to open the Control Center a compact visual palette of controls for the settings and functions you re most likely to need He also praised the improvements to the Siri voice assistant writing that Siri is much better He concluded by writing The structure layout and features represent some of Apple s best work The look of iOS well that judgment is up to you br Darrell Etherington of TechCrunch focused on many of the new features introduced praising the Control Center as being incredibly useful AirDrop as being great although noting the lack of interoperability between iOS and Mac at the time Siri as being more generally useful and the new multitasking features as smarter with the multitasking screen being much better In conclusion he wrote that There s no question that iOS will be a dramatic change from the iOS many users already know and love but on balance it s an update packed with plenty of new features that make using Apple s mobile devices easier and more enjoyable br Some critics noted the influence of competition from other mobile platforms on the design and functionality of iOS Of note were the use of concepts from Android and Windows Phone such as a similarly minimal and typographic design Control Center being an equivalent to similar settings toggles on the notification shade of Android a similar multitasking menu to WebOS and even the design of the Weather app being almost identical to those on Windows and HTC Sense Sascha Segan of PC Magazine stated that Apple s brilliance is in putting the pieces together and marketing them Apple s developer APIs and its history of making money for developers still reign supreme there s less piracy than on Android and a bigger audience and more design flexibility than on Windows Phone br The adoption rate of iOS was reported to be as high as after one day Within five days iOS was installed on more than million devices which Apple claimed was the fastest software upgrade in history In August it was reported that of iOS devices ran iOS at the time br br br Problems br br br Design causing sickness br In September Pranav Dixit of Fast Company reported about user complaints shared on Apple s support forums that the new design of iOS including many zoom animations while multitasking and opening and closing apps in addition to a slight parallax effect were causing users to feel sick Dixit noted that while the parallax effect could be turned off most animations did not have such an option br Dr George Kikano division chief of family medicine at UH Case Medical Center in Ohio told Fox News that There s some validity to this for people who are susceptible Fox News wrote that Dr Kikano said It s a new parallax function that causes the background of the phone to subtly move back and forth a feature that leads to an effect not unlike car sickness The inner ear is responsible for balance the eyes for vision When things are out of sync you feel dizzy nauseous Some people get it some people don t and some people get used to it br br br Battery drain br Adrian Kingsley Hughes of ZDNet wrote in March that iPhone and iPad users reported battery drain with the iOS update In lab testing Andrew Cunningham of Ars Technica found some hardware models experienced minor battery depletion while others experienced no statistically significant changes br br br Lock screen bypass br Dom Esposito of to Mac reported in June that a new lock screen bypass method had been discovered in iOS allowing access to the phone in seconds under certain circumstances The issue was later fixed br br br Supported devices br With this release Apple dropped support for the iPhone GS and the iPod Touch th generation With support being dropped from the iPhone GS software updates from devices with Samsung processors were no longer available However the iPhone has limited support br br br Version history br br br br br br External links br iOS
