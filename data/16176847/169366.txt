Novell Inc was an American software and services company headquartered in Provo Utah that existed from until Its most significant product was the multi platform network operating system known as Novell NetWare br Under the leadership of chief executive Ray Noorda NetWare became the dominant form of personal computer networking during the second half of the s and first half of the s At its high point NetWare had a percent share of the market for network operating systems and by the early s there were over half a million NetWare based networks installed worldwide encompassing more than million users Novell technology contributed to the emergence of local area networks which displaced the dominant mainframe computing model and changed computing worldwide Novell was the second largest maker of software for personal computers trailing only Microsoft Corporation and became instrumental in making Utah Valley a focus for technology and software development br During the early to mid s Noorda attempted to compete directly with Microsoft by acquiring Digital Research Unix System Laboratories WordPerfect and the Quattro Pro division of Borland These moves did not work out due to new technologies not fitting well with Novell s existing user base or being too late to compete with equivalent Microsoft products br NetWare began losing market share once Microsoft bundled network services with the Windows NT operating system and its successors Despite new products such as Novell Directory Services and GroupWise Novell entered a long period of decline Eventually Novell acquired SUSE Linux and attempted to refocus its technology base Despite building or acquiring several new kinds of products Novell failed to find consistent success and never regained its past dominance br The company was an independent corporate entity until it was acquired as a wholly owned subsidiary by The Attachmate Group in Attachmate was subsequently acquired in by Micro Focus International and then by OpenText in Novell products and technologies are now integrated within various OpenText divisions br br br History br br br Origins as a hardware company br br The company began as Novell Data Systems Inc NDSI a computer systems company located in Orem Utah that intended to manufacture and market small business computers computer terminals and other peripherals It was co founded by George Canova and Jack Davis two experienced computer industry executives While some later sources place the creation of Novell Data Systems as having happened in more contemporaneous sources are in accordance with it happening in August Canova became president of the new company and Davis was in charge of sales and marketing The suggestion for the company s name came from Canova s wife who thought it meant new in French in fact the French word is either the masculine nouveau or the feminine nouvelle While future Brigham Young University professor and Eyring Research Institute ERI figure Dennis Fairclough was not a founder of Novell Data Systems he did work with the company from its early days br A funding proposal was brought to Pete Musser chairman of the board of Safeguard Scientifics Inc a Pennsylvania based technology focused venture capital firm that was an offshoot of the older Safeguard Business Systems Safeguard Scientifics believed that a new computer systems company could help the Business Systems company automate their accounting systems Accordingly Safeguard Scientifics provided over million in seed funding and they became the majority owner of Novell Data Systems Canova also owned a significant portion of the new company br Novell Data Systems set up offices in a former carpet warehouse located in an obscure industrial park down the road from the largely vacant Geneva Steel works By November they were placing display ads in the classifieds pages of Utah Valley newspapers seeking to hire hardware and software engineers and other staff br At first the company began to grow rapidly By mid the company was selling two products the Nexus Series microcomputer and the Image dot matrix printer Orders began shipping during the second half of The computer product was based on the Zilog Z microprocessor and the CP M operating system br The company subsequently did not do well The microcomputer produced by the company was late to an increasingly crowded market and was noncompetitive in terms of performance when it did arrive According to one paraphrase of a Value Line report on Novell Data Systems as a whole during this period their revenue was minimal but expenses were tremendous Davis was fired from Novell Data Systems a change that occurred in November br br In order to compete on systems sales Novell Data Systems planned a program to link more than one microcomputer to operate together The current or former BYU students Drew Major Dale Neibaur and Kyle Powell known as the SuperSet Software group were hired to this task and began consulting for Novell during They developed a multiplayer video game Snipes br During the first calendar quarter of heavy costs continued to be incurred at Novell Data Systems which resulted in management shuffles organizational consolidations and a significant layoff Canova was fired and Jack Messman representing Safeguard Scientifics was named president Seeing Snipes being played on three different types of personal computers persuaded Messman that SuperSet s networking technology was valuable The poor performance of Novell Data Systems resulted in losses being announced in April for the publicly held Safeguard Scientifics and put pressure on that company s stock price However by this point the computer linking work that the SuperSet group had produced was drawing considerable interest and Novell Data Systems was describing themselves as a company that made not just stand alone microcomputers but also products for local area networking LAN The dual emphasis on hardware and software products continued for several months but continued to have troubled results and in July another round of layoffs took place which resulted in the employee count being reduced from people to br At that time Safeguard reported that it would be writing down million in losses due to Novell Data Systems switch from being a hardware company to a software company Throughout there were further management shuffles with other people being named president of the company Major Neibaur and Powell continued to support Novell through their SuperSet Software group As Major later said It was great that our hardware was so lousy because that gave us the idea that hardware wasn t really where the value was br Two other important NDSI employees were strategist Craig Burton and communications specialist Judith Clarke Despite its struggles Novell Data Systems had a presence at the COMDEX show in Las Vegas in November a man named Ray Noorda saw it and become interested in the company s potential br br br Rise to networking dominance br br br A new company br br br On January the company was incorporated under the shortened name of Novell Inc In April the appointment of Noorda as president and CEO of Novell Inc was publicly announced Noorda was a veteran executive of General Electric and the past CEO of several other companies and had garnered a reputation as a turn around expert Messman was chairman of the board and continued to represent the interests of Safeguard Scientifics which was still majority owner in the new Novell br The new Novell started with around employees Noorda emphasized that the file server product acquired from Novell Data Systems would be the heart of what the new Novell would be doing Later that same year the company introduced its most significant product the multi platform network operating system NOS Novell NetWare br Funding for the new company was still an issue and Musser contacted two Safeguard investors and brokers Barry Rubenstein and Fred Dolan who were with the Cleveland brokerage house Prescott Ball and Turben in these efforts Rubenstein and Dolan eventually came up with the idea of a rights offering to Safeguard shareholders Accordingly in January Safeguard Scientifics made an initial offering of shares in Novell Inc to its own shareholders at a share The sale brought Safeguard more than million in cash and Safeguard s ownership in Novell went from percent down to percent Novell Inc began trading as an over the counter stock br br br NetWare br br The first Novell product was a proprietary hardware server based on the Motorola processor and using a star topology This with the network operating system NOS on it was known as Novell S Net or ShareNet and it achieved some visibility by April advertisements were seen in trade publications for third party software products which stated they were compatible with Novell ShareNet br The company realized that making a proprietary solution in this sense was disadvantageous and looked instead to the IBM PC as an alternative platform Now called NetWare the network operating system was ported to run on an IBM PC XT with an Intel processor and supported centralized multitasking file and print services By March Novell was putting out announcements about third party products that worked with Novell NetWare br NetWare came on the computing scene just as the IBM PC was emerging as a market force and applications such as the VisiCalc spreadsheet for the Apple II were showing what microcomputers could do for businesses There was an immediate demand for local area networking that could make files and printers available across many PCs In addition the advent of the PC caused organizational changes within companies and enterprises and allowed Novell to find entryways into individual departments or regional facilities rather than having to convince upper management of the value of networking Thus Novell s timing was spot on As the New York Times subsequently wrote Novell in one of those instances of serendipity and visionary thinking that are the stuff of personal computer legend found itself in the right place at the right time br Partly in consequence of its design of running at kernel level ring without regard for separate or protected address spaces and thus not having the properties of a general purpose operating system NetWare was known for being very fast in operation This trend continued into with the Advanced NetWare release which was well received within the industry NetWare also excelled with respect to computer security considerations supporting user and group based roles and volume and file level access restrictions thus making it attractive to systems administrators br Novell based its network protocol on Xerox Network Systems XNS and created its own standards which it named Internetwork Packet Exchange IPX and Sequenced Packet Exchange SPX These protocols were based on a client server model File and print services ran on the NetWare Core Protocol NCP over IPX as did Routing Information Protocol RIP and Service Advertising Protocol SAP All of these NetWare protocols mapped to various layers of the OSI model br Starting in Novell began selling its own Ethernet based network adapter cards These included the bit NE and then in the bit NE They priced them lower than cards from competitors such as Com whose card Novell had previously been distributing By Novell s cards were being sold at a rate of per month aggressively expanding Novell s market presence At that point Novell transferred the NE NE business to Anthem Electronics the firm that had actually been making them but the cards remained branded as Novell products br As author James Causey would later write NetWare deserves the lion s share of the credit for elevating PC based local area networks from being cute toys to providing powerful reliable and serious network services NetWare was the first Intel based network operating system to provide a serious alternative to mainframe based server networks providing critical reliability and security features needed in the modern enterprise br Novell acquired Kanwal Rekhi s company Excelan in Excelan manufactured smart Ethernet cards and commercialized the Internet protocol TCP IP solidifying Novell s presence in these areas The acquisition combined Novell s million in annual revenue with Excelan s million Rekhi became a high ranking Novell executive and played an influential strategic and managerial role with the company over the next several years Excelan was based in San Jose California and they along with a couple of prior Novell acquisitions formed the basis for Novell s presence in Silicon Valley going forward br br br NetWare br A key software introduction came in with the release of NetWare also known as NetWare which gave NetWare more modern architectural qualities in conjunction with new capabilities in the Intel processor All the while it maintained its character as a dedicated network operating system rather than containing network capabilities as part of a general purpose operating system The NetWare kernel s ability to dynamically load and unload drivers was greatly appreciated by users and the ability to write NetWare Loadable Modules NLMs in the C programming language was also a significant benefit NetWare supported interactions with Apple s Macintosh computers as well as with Unix based workstations thus enabling NetWare to expand upon file and print sharing towards accessing business critical data within companies This allowed NetWare to work with database products from companies such as Oracle Corporation and Sybase br An analyst for Dataquest said that NetWare is truly a blow away the competition type product Overall NetWare was the most significant rewrite that the product would ever get and proved very successful By Novell had an almost monopolistic position in NOS for any business requiring a network br There were competitor companies in the same space such as Corvus Systems Banyan Systems and LANtastic but none of them made much of a dent in Novell s business Microsoft tried on two early occasions to take on Novell in networking first with the MS NET product and then with LAN Manager but both failed badly IBM similarly had limited success in this area From to Novell s revenues rose almost three fold to million a year with about half of Novell s sales coming from North America and half from overseas Earnings also rose to million a year From to Novell s stock price climbed twelve fold br With this market leadership Novell began to acquire and build services on top of its NetWare operating platform These services extended NetWare s capabilities with such products as NetWare for SAA and Novell multi protocol router br However Novell was also diversifying moving away from its smaller users to target large corporations and wide area networks A marketing and development alliance with IBM announced in was part of this initiative The company did later attempt to refocus with NetWare for Small Business It reduced investment in research and was slow to improve the product administration tools although it was helped by the fact its products typically needed little tweaking they just ran br br br Corporate ethos and coopetition br br By early Novell was rapidly expanding but many people were still unaware of either it or the role that local area networks could play and consequently Noorda referred to Novell as the most misunderstood company in the world Nonetheless in The Salt Lake Tribune was hailing Novell as another Utah success story in technology likely to follow in the footsteps of Evans Sutherland and Iomega Novell was quickly outgrowing its original site in Orem with some employees forced to work in trailers A new much larger site for the company was found in nearby Provo Utah and construction was begun by late employees were moving into the first building there while work on a second building was already underway Eventually between and six buildings would be constructed for Novell s use there br br Under Noorda Novell embraced the notion of coopetition or cooperative competition The central idea was that whatever was good for networking in general would be good for Novell and took the form of encouraging the growth of an ecosystem composed of hundreds of suppliers of hardware and software networking products even if some of those suppliers had products that competed with Novell s Com who had been an early competitor of Novell s sold more instances of their Ethernet networking cards for use in conjunction with NetWare than they did for use with their own Share network operating systems and a similar situation existed for IBM and their Token Ring cards It was due to this kind of industry vision that Noorda would become known as the Father of Network Computing br From the first years of the new Novell s success Noorda was credited in the press with forging that path The company reflected aspects of Noorda s personal background such as his Mormon religion which brought about what was termed the Mormon work ethic at Novell As one account later put it Novell was reputedly staffed with lots of hard selling but soft drinking Mormons Noorda himself was famous for his frugal ways and for working from a plain small office br In senior executives Craig Burton and Judith Clarke whom many credited for much of Novell s past success left Novell Burton had been seen as Noorda s most likely successor while Judith Clarke had been instrumental in marketing and positioning Novell br In April Novell and Lotus Development Corporation announced merger of equals based on a billion stock swap that would have been the largest deal in the software industry to that time But it collapsed the following month when Lotus head Jim Manzi refused to give Novell an equal number of seats on the new board Noorda pulled out shortly before the deal would have been completed br At its high point around NetWare had a roughly two thirds share of the market for network operating systems one analysis put the figure at percent There were over half a million NetWare based networks installed worldwide and some million NetWare users on those networks And networking itself was the fastest growing segment of the computer market increasing by percent a year and reaching a billion figure by Novell was the second largest maker of software for personal computers trailing only Microsoft Novell s employee base which had been around when Noorda joined had risen to by the end of Besides Utah Novell continued to grow in San Jose where many of the sales marketing product management and executive functions were located br br br Sales and channel practices br br Equally important as technological factors to NetWare s growth was that Novell did not try to hire a large sales force to do direct sales of the product but instead sold it through a broad channel of some value added resellers Such resellers provided network education installation and subsequent maintenance and included CompUSA and Egghead Software for very small businesses all the way up to sophisticated systems integrators like Andersen Consulting and Electronic Data Systems for enterprise level projects In this way Novell constructed a local area network franchise in literal terms as Novell Authorized Education Centers were set up on a franchising basis Credentialization programs were in place such that becoming a Certified NetWare Engineer was an important step one that could be furthered with levels such as Master Certified NetWare Engineer As one industry analyst said They ve done a wonderful job of farming distribution out They train people who go out and train other people and every time somebody gets trained they get another Netware bigot and make another dollar They are getting paid to have people go out and be evangelists The partnering approach also worked well in overseas markets such as in Japan where Novell set up a subsidiary that major Japanese electronics firms invested in or in South America and Eastern Europe where Novell set up authorized distributors br Under Ray Noorda s leadership Novell provided upgrades to resellers and customers in the same packaging as a newly purchased copy of NetWare but at one third the cost which created a gray market that allowed NetWare resellers to sell upgrades as newly purchased NetWare versions at full price periodically which Novell intentionally did not track Noorda commented to several analysts that he devised this strategy to allow front line resellers to punch through the distributors like Tech Data and Ingram and acquire NetWare versions at a discounted rate as Novell looked the other way this helped fund the salaries of Novell Field Support Technicians who for the most part were employees who worked for the front line resellers as Novell CNE Certified NetWare Engineers br Noorda commented that this strategy was one he learned as an executive at General Electric when competing against imported home appliances allow the resellers to make more money off your product than someone else s br br br Taking on Microsoft br br br Motivations br Unusually for the CEO of a high tech emerging computer company Noorda was nearing years of age by the early s Furthermore he was known for alienating high level executives who might someday be in position to run the company Stock market analysts were expressing concern that Noorda whose personality was the basis for much of the company s culture had no succession plan in place At the same time Novell faced a looming challenge from Microsoft s upcoming Windows NT operating system which after a huge investment of resources from Microsoft featured bundled networking and more advanced OS capabilities and looked to be that company s first offering that could seriously challenge Novell s local area networking franchise br Under Noorda Novell made a series of acquisitions interpreted by many to be a direct challenge to Microsoft Noorda was motivated in part by a realization that NetWare s technology was not suitable as the basis for a full fledged operating system and application platform There was also enmity between the two companies and the two CEOs stemming in part from merger talks between Noorda and Microsoft head Bill Gates that had begun in and been on and off for the next couple of years before breaking down for good Subsequently Novell had played a role in keeping the Federal Trade Commission investigation into Microsoft going br Between and the Noorda led Novell made this series of major acquisitions Digital Research Inc producer of DR DOS to compete with Microsoft s MS DOS Unix System Laboratories holder of Unix operating system technology to improve Novell s technology base versus Windows NT Serius Corp maker of an advanced application development tool and WordPerfect Corporation and Quattro Pro from Borland to provide personal productivity and group collaboration products In all Noorda acquired ten companies within a four year span By September BusinessWeek was writing Of the many rivalries in the personal computer industry for sheer nastiness it s hard to beat the one between Microsoft Corp and Novell Inc In November Noorda confirmed published reports that he had been suffering from some memory lapses and announced that he would be stepping down from the CEO position once a successor was found br In April former HP executive Robert Frankenberg was announced as the new CEO of Novell with Noorda remaining as chairman of the board of directors By then the USL acquisition was already showing difficulties while the WordPerfect acquisition was questioned even more Nonetheless Frankenberg said he was enthusiastic about it For me it was a pivotal item in my decision to join Novell because it makes possible an entirely new category of networked applications which no one else can provide When the WordPerfect and Quattro Pro acquisitions closed in June it was the largest such deal in the software industry to that time it made Novell the third largest software company in the world trailing only Microsoft and Computer Associates br Noorda retired from the chairman position and left Novell completely in November although he was still the largest shareholder of the company At that point in time Frankenberg became chairman as well br br br Desktop OS and embedded systems DOS NEST and Corsair br Novell acquired Digital Research for US million in June The move was seen as a way for Novell to supply software for server focused PCs in alternative to Microsoft NetWare used DR DOS as a boot loader and maintenance platform and Novell intended to extend its desktop presence by integrating networking into DR DOS and providing an alternative to Microsoft s Windows At first the idea was to provide a graphical environment based on Digital Research s GEM but Novell s legal department rejected this due to apprehension of a possible legal response from Apple so the company went directly to Apple starting Star Trek in February a project to run an x port of their Mac OS on top of a multitasking DR DOS br Novell had already abandoned Digital Research s Multiuser DOS in The three former Master Value Added Resellers VARs DataPac Australasia Concurrent Controls and Intelligent Micro Software could license the source code to take over and continue independent development of their derivations in br Digital Research s FlexOS had been licensed to IBM for their OS in and was also utilized for the in house development of Novell s Embedded Systems Technology NEST but was sold off to Integrated Systems Inc ISI for US million in July The deal comprised a direct payment of half this sum as well as shares representing of the company br NEST however held importance for Frankenberg s vision of pervasive computing wherein Novell software would be connecting a billion nodes by Many of those nodes would be common everyday devices running NEST linked by SuperNOS Novell Directory Services and other management services components br Novell also abandoned their Corsair desktop project and in late transferred some components to Caldera a startup funded by Noorda s Canopy Group The Canopy Group was a technology investment firm and real estate company that Noorda focused on after his departure from Novell br Novell DOS and all former DR DOS versions including StarTrek PalmDOS and DOS Plus as well as other remaining Digital Research assets like GEM and the CP M and MP M based operating systems programming languages tools and technologies were sold to Caldera on July Personal NetWare had been abandoned at Novell in but was licensed to Caldera in binary form only The deal consisted of a direct payment of US as well as percentual royalties for any revenues derived from those assets to Novell br In January Novell s NEST initiative was abandoned as well br br br Server OS UnixWare and SuperNOS br br On the server side after their initial October Univel initiative Novell announced in December that it was buying Unix System Laboratories USL from AT T Corporation The measure was intended to help Novell compete against Microsoft which was on the verge of including networking as a built in feature of Windows in conjunction with the Windows NT server Unix did present some attractive characteristics to the market such as its abilities as an application server and the lack of vendor lock in but there were still considerable obstacles to be overcome in using it in this context br The deal closed in June with Novell acquiring rights to the Unix SVR source base and the UnixWare operating system product Novell then turned the Unix brand name and specification over to the industry consortium X Open br Novell created the Unix Systems Group to contain the new business which also absorbed the Univel venture Most of the core USL employees remained in USL s Summit New Jersey facility which was later relocated to Florham Park New Jersey in the summer of The USL Europe office in London was moved into Novell s facility in Bracknell Berkshire br Novell s time with Unix technology saw the release of UnixWare in January in both personal and advanced server editions and with the bundled inclusion of TCP IP a NetWare Unix Client and Merge functionality for running DOS and Windows applications This was followed in early by the release of UnixWare which included full support for multiple processors as well as improved installation and ease of use and additional NetWare integration features br In September Novell began publicly describing its plans to develop a SuperNOS a microkernel based network operating system based on NetWare and UnixWare The aim was to include UnixWare technology inside NetWare provide the strengths of both NetWare s network services and UnixWare s application services be able to run existing NetWare Loadable Modules NLMs and Unix executables and accordingly create a network operating system that could successfully compete with Microsoft s Windows NT SuperNOS would also operate across distributed servers with unified presentation Finally SuperNOS would take advantage of object oriented programming paradigms as a way of fostering easier application development br In terms of operating system architecture SuperNOS would run NLMs in kernel space for maximum throughput while it would run Spec based Unix applications in user space For clustering SuperNOS would embrace elements of a NetWare distributed parallel processing proposal and a UnixWare single system image initiative SuperNOS was based on work that had already started at USL and at the French company Chorus Syst mes SA for cooperative work on the Chorus microkernel technology in the context of supporting SVR on a microkernel This microkernel was arguably superior for this purpose than the more well known Mach one because it gave more flexibility at the kernel mode user mode boundary By mid the SuperNOS project was reportedly about one third completed with being seen as a customer release date for it There were over engineers assigned to it mostly from the UnixWare and Chorus side The project endured prolonged internal architectural debates and resistance from the NetWare side due to a reluctance to believe that Unix was really superior to NetWare in key aspects In one instance Novell s Drew Major and Chorus Syst mes Michel Gien disagreed in the trade press about whether the existent Chorus technology was up to the task The long running disputes reflected cultural and political divisions between the San Jose with Rekhi being a Unix supporter before leaving altogether and Utah camps within Novell In any case the date was seen by industry observers as being too late to forestall the market share gains that Windows NT was already making br br The acquisition of USL never really worked out for Novell During the company s fiscal years of and Novell s Unix Systems Group represented only about percent of the company s revenue on an ongoing basis Very few Certified NetWare Engineers ever reached a similar level of involvement with UnixWare Another aim that Novell might be able to coalesce Unix vendor versions and thus resolve the Unix wars was not achieved either By late summer the company was looking for a way out of the Unix business br In September Novell announced the sale of UnixWare to the Santa Cruz Operation SCO coincident with a licensing arrangement with Hewlett Packard As part of the deal SCO said that it would merge the SVR based UnixWare with its existing SVR based OpenServer operating system and add NetWare services to the new merged product code named Gemini Gemini would then be sold through SCO s well known channel and reseller operation As for HP they said they would add NetWare code and NetWare Directory Services to their own version of Unix HP UX in combination with Distributed Computing Environment elements which would then be sold by HP s strong direct sales force Finally SCO and HP said that they would co develop a next generation bit version of Unix Some Novell software engineers had been working on UnixWare most of them were offered jobs with either SCO or HP while a few remained with Novell br While some lip service was paid to the notion that SuperNOS would go on after the three way deal in fact it was abandoned and never achieved fruition in that form A decade later Novell s Open Enterprise Server product would realize some aspects of a hybrid NetWare Unix like system this time based around SUSE Linux Enterprise Server rather than UnixWare br By December there were already some indications that the three way arrangement was not working out as had been initially advertised The computer industry was not sure that SCO could handle being the primary Unix shepherd The HP project code named White Box focused on making a hybrid environment out of the SVR based Gemini and the SVR based HP UX but that effort faced major technical hurdles The terms of the deal between Novell and SCO which closed in December were uncertain enough that an amendment had to be signed in October and even that was not clear enough to preclude an extended battle between the two companies during the SCO Linux disputes of the s br br br Tools AppWare br In June Novell purchased Serius Corp a firm that made a graphical programming language that could construct applications by connecting together icons representing objects in the program and their commands Novell also purchased Software Transformations Inc who made a cross platform object code library that could be used to port conventional programs to a number of platforms The disparate technologies of the two products were combined and renamed to AppWare with the Serius product being called AppWare Visual AppBuilder the objects it used AppWare Loadable Modules and the Software Transformations library AppWare Foundation The organization working on this was called the AppWare Systems Group The founder of Serius Joe Firmage became vice president of strategy for Novell s Network Systems Group br AppWare was one of the three main strategic focuses of Novell during this period along with NetWare and UnixWare These three prongs were intended to satisfy the growing need for scalable distributed computing at the enterprise level of applications such as general ledger systems or reservation systems as Novell executive Jim Tolonen outlined NetWare being the underlying infrastructure over which those mission critical transactions will be moved Unix being a place on which the applications can run and AppWare as tools that will help programmers write that class of application in a distributed environment br It was not long before the AppWare plans started to fall apart In September Novell announced they would be selling the Appware Foundation product to a third party Novell did state that development of Visual AppBuilder would continue and a Unix port would be following that did not materialize Novell also continued to release a number of new Appware Loadable Modules But overall as Byte magazine wrote in early about the three pronged strategy these unrelated families of products formed an unsteady tripod br Joe Firmage became disillusioned with Novell in mid following its decision to sell UnixWare and abandon the SuperNOS project and left Novell later that year Novell then publicly stated in November that it was looking for a buyer for AppWare In March it was announced based on an agreement that had been signed the month before that Novell had sold all rights to the AppWare technology to a new company called Network Multimedia Inc which was headed by Ed Firmage who had been director of AppWare marketing at Novell br br br Applications WordPerfect Quattro Pro and GroupWise br br In March Novell announced that it was acquiring WordPerfect Corporation whose primary product was the WordPerfect word processor as well as acquiring the Quattro Pro spreadsheet from Borland Novell executives said that goal of the acquisitions was to build a suite of products that could be connected across the network via NetWare and UnixWare Key to this was the idea of groupware for collaboration Noorda said The era of stand alone personal computing is evolving into group collaboration that connects individuals groups and companies Novell s objective is to accelerate this market transition The geographical proximity as well as the cultural similarity between the two companies also made the acquisition seem like a good idea The merger and acquisition from Borland both closed on June with the public announcement being made on June Work on the acquired products was organized into the company s Application Group Both before and after the acquisition there were substantial layoffs of WordPerfect staff at the peak right after the acquisition closed Novell s employee count was around Novell s corporate address was shifted to WordPerfect s Orem location for a while br The market for standalone word processors and spreadsheets was expanding to that of office suites where Microsoft Office had an early lead in marketshare To compete Novell PerfectOffice was released in December It was based upon an earlier effort Borland Office for Windows but had superior look and feel and integration It contained not just WordPerfect and Quattro Pro but also other products most of which had originated at WordPerfect Corporation including Presentations for slides preparation a personal information manager called InfoCentral and the GroupWise collaboration product There was also a professional edition that included AppWare as well as Borland s Paradox database PerfectOffice surpassed in sales one early player in the space Lotus SmartSuite and GroupWise found three times the number of users as Lotus Notes The application products also had the advantage of what Novell s senior vice president for corporate marketing Christine Hughes called an in your face presence for the user Otherwise no one is aware it s Novell providing that connection But industry analyst reaction was that while PerfectOffice was a good product it was arriving too late to head off Microsoft Office s momentum br WordPerfect also played in a role in larger architectural ambitions within Novell as WordPerfect incorporated OpenDoc and IBM System Object Model technology These became part of the basis for Novell s larger distributed object strategy That strategy was tied to having supporting multiple object request brokers that could tie in NetWare Loadable Modules the AppWare Bus UnixWare and eventually SuperNOS itself WordPerfect itself was also supposedly using the AppWare foundation layer in its work Other parts of WordPerfect were deemed less strategic and the Main Street line of multimedia products for children was dropped br During its time in Novell WordPerfect still sold reasonably well as standalone software garnering almost half of all such word processor sales but the market was increasingly dominated by the idea of office suites and there Microsoft Office was supreme with percent of the market compared to only percent for Novell s PerfectOffice As such the WordPerfect and Quattro Pro part of the company dragged down Novell s earnings and stock price br Novell stated in November that it was putting its personal productivity product line up for sale Then in January it announced that the sale of these products primarily WordPerfect and Quattro Pro would be made to Corel for million a large loss from the million that it had originally paid to acquire WordPerfect Novell did hold onto a few pieces that it had acquired from WordPerfect most importantly the GroupWise collaboration product By some estimates Novell had lost million on the WordPerfect experience The sale to Corel was completed in March br br br Results br Overall none of these moves had worked out well for instance Novell suffered a net loss of million for its fiscal year largely due to write offs for the acquisitions and under criticism from Wall Street Novell s stock price underwent a prolonged downturn and many of the companies and products that had been purchased were subsequently sold off Novell did have its two largest revenue years in and generating billion and billion in sales respectively But the Noorda era acquisitions were short lived br The business press was negative on the whole attempt The New York Times referred to acquisitions Mr Noorda had made in his latter years in a disastrous attempt to compete head on with Microsoft while the San Francisco Chronicle talked of a disastrous acquisition spree undertaken by previous CEO Ray Noorda in an effort to compete with Microsoft By the year The Age would say that The WordPerfect acquisition was the biggest disaster in software history br Novell continued to have mediocre at best financial results during and br In August Frankenberg himself departed Novell in what was variously portrayed as a mutual decision or as a resignation under pressure from the company s board of directors His years there had been marked by having to disassemble Noorda s acquisitions but also by failing to fully recognize the growing importance of the Internet for networking applications br br br Loss of networking dominance br br br NDS and other new products br Novell s core products did not stay idle during this challenging of Microsoft time as work in the company s NetWare Systems Group continued br One of Novell s major innovations was Novell Directory Services NDS later known as eDirectory It was based on the CCITT X standard and supported the notion of a distributed directory Introduced with NetWare in NDS replaced the old Bindery server and user management technology employed by NetWare x and earlier Directory services were seen as a crucial strategic key to staying relevant in the networking marketplace It was also one where Novell had a lead over Microsoft as the latter s Active Directory was not yet out br Then with UnixWare gone Novell focused on major upgrades to its core NetWare based network operating system The initial release of NetWare came with compatibility problems for some NetWare users and large enterprises were faced with an upgrade all or upgrade none decision However some million users declined to move to NetWare with the result that Novell lost large amounts of possible revenue in upgrades Although the NetWare release of sought to remedy some of these issues the lag had caused many Novell customers to take a serious look at Windows NT And Windows NT was proving better as a platform for application and database services than NetWare Furthermore Microsoft was having success with its no extra charge bundling of Microsoft s IIS web server on NT while Novell s presence in the Internet market was severely lacking Still as of by one estimate there were three million networks and tens of millions of PCs still using NetWare br In the company began a move into Internet enabled products replacing reliance on the proprietary IPX protocol in favor of a native TCP IP stack Support for the new Java programming language also began to be added to NetWare An Internet focused product released during was called Intranetware br These moves were accelerated when Eric Schmidt became CEO in April the first in the post since Frankenberg s departure Christopher Stone was brought in as senior vice president of strategy and corporate development reporting to Schmidt Many observers were surprised that Schmidt would leave his chief technical officer position at Sun Microsystems which at the time was doing very well to go to Novell which was viewed as a company in real trouble The new CEO said Novell has been defocused by a series of acquisitions and forays that didn t work out In this collaborative world it s more important to do a few things well and just go for them like you ve never seen br One result of these shifts was BorderManager released in August which supplied proxy server firewall and other services for connecting NetWare networks to the Internet Another was a new version of NDS that was capable of running with Windows NT not just NetWare br And still another was NetWare released in October with hopes for it accelerating Novell s improved fortunes under Schmidt NetWare leveraged and built upon eDirectory and introduced new functions such as Novell Cluster Services NCS a replacement for SFT III and Novell Storage Services NSS a replacement for the traditional Turbo FAT filesystem used by earlier versions of NetWare While NetWare introduced native TCP IP support into the NOS IPX was still supported allowing for smooth transitions between environments and avoiding the forklift upgrades frequently required by competing environments Similarly the traditional Turbo FAT file system remained a supported option br br br Decline of marketshare br br The inclusion of networking as a core system component in all mainstream PC operating systems after led to a steep decline in Novell s market share Unlike Windows and its predecessors Windows NT Windows Linux and OS all included network functionality which greatly reduced demand for third party products in this segment For instance one mid survey of a thousand corporate users conducted by Forrester Research showed that percent of them owned NetWare but only percent said they had upgraded to the latest NetWare version and less than half of the users thought they would still be using NetWare three years hence By March the company s stock price had fallen from a high of a share in to a new low of under Revenue declined from on By Windows NT was winning percent of new network operating system installations versus percent for NetWare and it was on the verge of overtaking NetWare even when upgrade sales were included Overall NetWare s market share had fallen to percent and had been passed by Windows NT s percent Unix also had a significant share and the free software Linux operating system had started to appear and make inroads as well br With revenues in decline Schmidt took actions to control costs and some percent of Novell employees were laid off during the first few months of his tenure In addition he was forced to halt NetWare shipments to resellers because unsold inventory levels were so high By the end of summer Schmidt was saying I took the job on the presumption that we would not have to do this If I d known what shape the company was in I might not have taken it While there was some speculation that Novell might relocate much of the company to its San Jose facility Novell instead recommitted to Provo building a new headquarters tower that opened in br But Novell s decline and loss of market share accelerated under Schmidt s leadership with Novell experiencing an across the board decline in sales and purchases of NetWare and a drop in share price from US share to US share Analysts commented that the primary reason for Novell s demise was linked to its channel strategy and mismanagement of channel partners under Schmidt br Schmidt embarked on a channel strategy to undo Noorda s look the other way approach and thereby remove the upgrades as whole box products then directed Novell s general counsel to initiate litigation against a large number of Novell resellers who were routinely selling upgrades as newly purchased NetWare versions br Although this move bolstered Novell s revenue numbers for several quarters Novell s channels subsequently collapsed with the majority of Novell s resellers dropping NetWare for fear of litigation br br By Novell had lost its dominant market position and was continually being out marketed by Microsoft as resellers dropped NetWare allowing Microsoft to gain access to corporate data centers by bypassing technical staff and selling directly to corporate executives Most resellers then re certified their Novell CNE employees the field support technicians who were Novell s primary contact in the field with direct customers as Microsoft MCSE technicians and were encouraged to position NetWare as inferior to Windows features such as Group Policy and Microsoft s GUI which was considered to be more modern than the character based Novell interfaces With falling revenue the company focused on net services and platform interoperability Products such as eDirectory and GroupWise were made multi platform br By some large NetWare enterprise customers such as Chase Manhattan Bank United Parcel Service and the University of Southern California were in the process of migrating most or all of their NetWare systems to alternatives Revenue warnings during the second quarter of resulted in a percent drop in the company s stock price In October Novell released a new product dubbed DirXML which was designed to synchronize data typically user information between disparate directory and database systems This product leveraged the speed and functionality of eDirectory to store information and would later become the Novell Identity Manager forming the foundation of a core product set within Novell br During Schmidt s tenure during the late s Novell developed and delivered a series of Internet centric products that were well reviewed But these new products did not sell as well as the company had hoped in part due to Novell channel issues with training lead generation and support Indeed there were reports of channel stuffing taking place So despite its efforts in these other spaces Novell was increasingly becoming irrelevant within the industry Of Schmidt s efforts with Novell News com wrote He had traversed a rocky road as chief executive at Novell briefly laying a smooth path for a renaissance at the aging network software provider before succumbing to strategy issues that have plagued it for years br br br Cambridge Technology Partners br br In March it was announced that Novell was acquiring the consulting company Cambridge Technology Partners CTP founded in Cambridge Massachusetts by John J Donovan to expand offerings into services Novell felt that the ability to offer solutions a combination of software and services was key to satisfying customer demand The merger was apparently against the firm s software development culture and the finance personnel at the firm also recommended against it br The CEO of CTP Jack Messman engineered the merger using his position as a board member of Novell since its inception and as part of the deal became CEO of Novell Chris Stone who had left in was rehired as vice chairman to set the course for Novell s strategy into open source and enterprise Linux With the acquisition of CTP which closed in July Novell moved its headquarters to Massachusetts As for Schmidt he departed Novell soon after the CTP announcement and headed for Google where he became chair of the board and soon after that CEO br In July Novell acquired SilverStream Software a leader in web services oriented applications but a laggard in the marketplace Renamed to Novell exteNd the platform comprised XML and web service tools based on Java EE br br br Linux br br br SuSE and Open Enterprise Server br br In August Novell acquired Ximian a developer of open source Linux applications Evolution Red Carpet and Mono This acquisition signaled Novell s plans to move its collective product set onto a Linux kernel br In November Novell acquired Linux OS developer SuSE which led to a major shift of power in Linux distributions IBM also invested US million to show support of the SuSE acquisition br In mid Novell released Novell Enterprise Linux Services NNLS which ported some of the services traditionally associated with NetWare to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server SLES version NetWare released in would prove to be the last version of that product br In November Novell released the Linux based enterprise desktop Novell Linux Desktop based on Ximian Desktop and SUSE Linux Professional This was Novell s first attempt to get into the enterprise desktop market br The successor product to NetWare Novell Open Enterprise Server OES was released in March OES offers all the services previously hosted by NetWare and added the choice of delivering those services using either a NetWare or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server kernel The release was aimed to persuade NetWare customers to move to Linux br In August Novell created the openSUSE project based on SUSE Professional openSUSE can be downloaded freely and is also available as boxed retail product br br br Stagnation br br From through Novell released many products across its portfolio with the intention of arresting falling market share and to move away from dependencies on other Novell products but the launches were not as successful as Novell had hoped In late Chris Stone again left the company after an apparent control issue with then CEO Jack Messman In an effort to cut costs Novell announced a round of layoffs in late While revenue from its Linux business continued to grow the growth was not fast enough to offset the decrease in revenue of NetWare While the company s revenue was not falling rapidly it wasn t growing either Lack of clear direction or effective management meant that Novell took longer than expected to complete its restructuring br In June chief executive Jack Messman and chief finance officer Joseph Tibbetts were fired with Ronald Hovsepian Novell s president and chief operating officer appointed chief executive and Dana Russell vice president of finance and corporate controller appointed interim CFO br br br Your Linux is Ready br br In August Novell released the SUSE Linux Enterprise SLE series SUSE Linux Enterprise Server was the first enterprise class Linux server to offer virtualization based on the Xen hypervisor SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop popularly known as SLED featured a new user friendly GUI and XGL based D display capabilities The release of SLE was marketed with the phrase Your Linux is Ready meant to convey that Novell s Linux offerings were ready for the enterprise In late September Novell announced a real time version of SLES called SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time SLERT based on technology from Concurrent Computer Corporation br br br Legal actions and reactions br Beginning in Novell became a key player in the SCO Linux disputes The case SCO Group Inc v Novell Inc revolved around the interpretation of the asset transfer agreements between Novell and the Santa Cruz Operation a predecessor company to The SCO Group when Novell got out of the Unix business as part of abandoning its effort to take on Microsoft on all fronts and a amendment that had attempted to clarify that agreement The SCO Group believed that the transfer included ownership of and copyrights for the source code for the Unix operating system which they in turn claimed Linux had infringed upon Novell counter sued claiming that the asset transfer agreements did not in fact transfer the intellectual property rights SCO sought br The case attracted considerable industry and media attention with the free and open source software FOSS community solidly on the side of Novell There were a series of court rulings most of which went in Novell s favor and which sent The SCO Group into bankruptcy The matter was settled finally in when a jury trial in Utah ruled that the copyrights belonged to Novell Novell made no material use of the Unix ownership once it was ruled theirs as by then their interests were with SuSE Linux br In Novell sued Microsoft asserting it had engaged in antitrust violations regarding Novell s WordPerfect business in through Novell s lawsuit was subsequently dismissed by the United States District Court in July after it concluded that the claims were without merit br On November the two companies announced a joint collaboration agreement including coverage of their respective products for each other s customers They also promised to work more closely to improve compatibility of software setting up a joint research facility Executives of both companies expressed the hope that such cooperation would lead to better compatibility between Microsoft Office and OpenOffice org and better virtualization techniques br Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said of the deal This set of agreements will really help bridge the divide between open source and proprietary source software br The deal involved upfront payment of US million from Microsoft to Novell for patent cooperation and SLES subscription Additionally Microsoft agreed to spend around US million yearly over the next years for marketing and selling a combined SLES Windows Server offering and related virtualization solutions while Novell paid at least US million yearly to Microsoft in the same period br One of the first results of this partnership was Novell adapting the OpenXML ODF Translator for use in OpenOffice org br Microsoft released two public covenants not to sue users of the open source Moonlight runtime a workalike for the Microsoft Silverlight rich media platform for patent infringement One condition common to each covenant was that no Moonlight implementation be released under the GPLv free software license br br In contrast to the SCO case here initial reaction from members of the free and open source software community over the patent protection was mostly critical with expressions of concern that Novell had sold out and doubt that the GNU GPL would allow distribution of code including the Linux kernel under this exclusive agreement br In a letter to the FOSS development community on November Bradley M Kuhn CTO of the Software Freedom Law Center SFLC described the agreement as worse than useless In a separate development the chairman of the SFLC Eben Moglen reported that Novell had offered cooperation with the SFLC to permit a confidential audit to determine the compliance of the agreement with the GPL version Richard Stallman founder of the Free Software Foundation said in November that changes coming with version of the GPL would preclude such deals When the final revision of the third version of the GPL license was decided the deal between Microsoft and Novell was grandfathered in A clause within GPLv allows companies to distribute GPLv software even if they have made such patent partnerships in the past as long as the partnership deal was made before March GPLv Section paragraph br On November the Samba team expressed strong disapproval of the announcement and asked Novell to reconsider The team included an employee of Novell Jeremy Allison who confirmed in a comment on Slashdot that the statement was agreed on by all members of the team and later quit his job at Novell in protest br In early February Reuters reported that the Free Software Foundation had announced that it was reviewing Novell s right to sell Linux versions and was considering banning Novell from selling Linux However spokesman Eben Moglen later said that he was quoted out of context and was only noting that GPL version would be designed to block similar deals in the future br br br Intelligent workload management br In December Novell announced its intention to lead the market in intelligent workload management with products designed to manage diverse workloads in a heterogeneous data center Seeing this approach as a key to giving customers confidence in the area of cloud computing security Novell restructured its business around the new initiative Technologies from Novell s acquisition of Canadian company PlateSpin were involved Key to this also was the use of SUSE Studio an online Linux software creation tool through which users could develop their own Linux distribution software appliance or virtual appliance Hovsepian said Cloud computing is a megatrend that matches the company s core competencies We ve developed our Suse appliance tool for application vendors who have brand new applications being written or built for the cloud This product allows them to create a virtual appliance They won t have to rewrite and retest the application once it is in the cloud and it allows firms to host their application on other clouds too But Novell s approach would also support other cloud environments such as those based around Hyper V VMware and Xen br Partnerships in connection with intelligent workload management were announced with SAP Citrix Systems Ingres and others Reaction of industry analysts to the move varied with some positive and some more mixed Among the more skeptical was Dan Kusnetzky of ZDNet who wrote that Novell clearly hopes that putting its products together in new ways and invoking today s catch phrases and buzz words will appear fresh and new While Novell did have strong technologies in this computing realm it struggled to attract the same market attention that competing product lines from the likes of Microsoft or VMware held br br br Acquisition by The Attachmate Group br br Novell had long been rumored to be a target for acquisition by a variety of other companies In March Elliott Associates L P an institutional investor with approximately stock ownership of Novell offered to acquire the company for US per share in cash or US billion The company declined the offer saying that the proposal was inadequate and that it undervalued the company s franchise and growth prospects br Novell announced in November that it had agreed to be acquired by The Attachmate Group for US billion and planned to operate Novell as two units one being SUSE As part of the deal patents owned by Novell were sold to CPTN Holdings LLC a consortium of companies led by Microsoft and including Apple EMC and Oracle According to Novell s SEC filing the patents relate primarily to enterprise level computer systems management software enterprise level file management and collaboration software in addition to patents relevant to our identity and security management business although it is possible that certain of such issued patents and patent applications read on a range of different software products The Attachmate Group expressed in advance of the deal closing that there would no change to the relationship between the SUSE business and the openSUSE project The merger completed in April with US per share in cash being paid to acquire Novell Novell became a wholly owned subsidiary of The Attachmate Group br Concurrent with the closing of the acquisition some of Novell s products and brands were transferred to another of the Attachmate Group business units NetIQ and the SUSE Linux brand was spun off as its own business unit The fourth business unit Attachmate was not directly affected by the acquisition br Immediately prior to merger being finalized Novell completed the patent sale to CPTN Holdings for US million The U S Department of Justice announced that as originally proposed the deal with CPTN would jeopardize the ability of open source software such as Linux to continue to innovate and compete in the development and distribution of server desktop and mobile operating systems middleware and virtualization products to address the department s antitrust concerns CPTN and its owners had altered their original agreement br br All of the Novell patents would be acquired subject to the GPLv open source license and the Open Invention Network OIN license br CPTN does not have the right to limit which of the patents if any are available under the OIN license br Neither CPTN nor its owners will make any statement or take any action with the purpose of influencing or encouraging either Novell or Attachmate Group to modify which of the patents are available under the OIN license br With the acquisition Novell s headquarters were moved back to Provo But by then considerable consolidation had occurred and the original six buildings of the Provo campus were sold br During April and May The Attachmate Group announced layoffs for the Novell workforce including hundreds of employees from the Provo location raising questions about the future of some open source projects such as Mono br br br Acquisition by Micro Focus and OpenText br In September mainframe software company Micro Focus announced it was buying The Attachmate Group including Novell for US billion The acquisition closed on November and the SUSE organization was split out separately from the rest of the former Novell organization within Micro Focus SUSE was sold to EQT AB in br The Novell products themselves were relabeled and dispersed among the file and networking services collaborations and security product lines of Micro Focus such that offerings like Open Enterprise Server GroupWise and ZENworks became billed as Micro Focus products with no mention of their Novell past The one page at the Micro Focus website listing former Novell products does not even mention NetWare In Micro Focus was in turn acquired by Canadian software company Opentext br br br Companies acquired br br br Certification br Novell was one of the first computer companies to provide proficiency certification for users of its products They included br br br Legacy br br Novell had a difficult time being associated for anything other than NetWare And as The Register has written NetWare was almost uniquely a thing of its time Whereas the PC has transcended its roots and Windows has grown into a sophisticated bit OS NetWare never escaped as its niche When Windows was just a client OS Novell s proprietary IPX SPX protocol and simple fast semi dedicated file servers were a compelling offering As Windows grew into a server OS too though NetWare couldn t compete br But the effects of Novell have been long lasting While information technology had been present along the Wasatch Front since the s in the form of work done at Utah State University the first two software giants in the field in Utah were Novell and WordPerfect in the early s To that point the Deseret News has stated WordPerfect and Novell put Utah Valley on the high tech industry map in the s Moreover even when employees left the two companies or were downsized they often stayed in the Utah Valley area and started their own companies This began a culture of entrepreneurship that led to the Wasatch Front becoming known by some as Silicon Slopes Silicon Slopes Magazine has credited the rise of
