id: 34080462
The PlayStation Vita system software is the official firmware and operating system for the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation TV video game consoles It uses the LiveArea as its graphical shell The system is built on a Unix base which is derived from FreeBSD and NetBSD br br br User interface br The LiveArea is the name of the graphical user interface of the PlayStation Vita system software developed by Sony Computer Entertainment The interface features a new touch based screen and acts like a hub page and allows users to hop between different parts of the game space The eighth generation PlayStation Vita and PlayStation TV consoles use LiveArea as the graphical shell instead of the previous XrossMediaBar XMB interface which was used by Sony s seventh generation video game consoles such as PlayStation Portable and PlayStation The PlayStation Sony s eighth generation home video game console however uses neither LiveArea nor XrossMediaBar as its graphical shell but rather utilizes a user interface called PlayStation Dynamic Menu br The PlayStation Vita system software uses LiveArea as its user interface which includes various social networking features via the PlayStation Network PSN Users can select the icon for a game or an application on the home screen to open the LiveArea screen for that game or application in PlayStation Vita or PlayStation TV As a new feature of PlayStation Vita and PlayStation TV s LiveArea latest game information such as downloadable contents are shown on the LiveArea screen for that game In addition by scrolling down the game s LiveArea the Activity of other users who are playing the same game can be checked instantly br br br Cooperation with home consoles br The PlayStation Vita and the PlayStation TV which uses the same system software as the PlayStation Vita supports a feature called Remote Play with the PlayStation and the PlayStation It allows the PlayStation and PlayStation to transmit its video and audio output to a PlayStation Vita However unlike Remote Play between the PlayStation Vita and the PlayStation which is well integrated Remote Play between the PlayStation Vita and the PlayStation is only supported by a select few PS titles and results were often laggy In a similar vein the PlayStation Vita can be used as a second screen device for the PS and for PS but only supported by very few games such as Class of Heroes G for streaming content directly from the console to the PlayStation Vita br Also for users having both the PlayStation Vita and the PlayStation it is possible to share media files videos music and images between them by transferring multimedia files directly from the PlayStation Vita to the PlayStation or vice versa Updates of the PlayStation Vita system software can also be downloaded to PS Vita devices via a PS system Furthermore a service called Cross Buy can be used which allows players to buy certain games that support this feature one time and play them in both Sony platforms Minecraft and Terraria are examples of such games and their saved worlds are transferable between the consoles Minecraft is no longer cross buy as of February br There is also a feature called Cross Play or Cross Platform Play covering any PlayStation Vita software title that can interact with a PlayStation or a PlayStation software title Different software titles use Cross Play in different ways For example Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom is a title supporting the Cross Play feature and the PS version of the game can be controlled using the PS Vita system br br br Internet features br With an Internet connection the PlayStation Vita system allows users to access a variety of PSN services such as the PlayStation Store and the PlayStation Plus subscription service and games and other content may be purchased from these services Applications such as the Live from PlayStation app as well as various video streaming apps also require an Internet connection to function properly br The Browser is a preinstalled app on the PlayStation Vita for browsing the World Wide Web Although not very different from web browsing on a PlayStation Portable the browser itself has been improved over the PSP s version which is intended to result in a less difficult experience The browser application does not have tabs but users can have up to separate browser windows open at once and can also save images from websites to the PS Vita memory card by touching and holding on the image until a menu appears However while users can use the web browser while playing a game or watching a video the display of some content will be limited as a result it is recommended to exit any open game or video before performing more intensive browsing tasks Furthermore while the PS Vita s web browser supports HTML cookies and JavaScript it does not support Adobe Flash unlike the PSP s web browser br Another application preinstalled on the PlayStation Vita at launch was Maps which displayed online maps when an Internet connection was available However it was removed by Sony via a system update along with the near feature in br br br Multimedia features br Like many other game consoles the PlayStation Vita is capable of photo audio and video playback in a variety of formats and the built in cameras can be used to take photos or videos However unlike the PlayStation and the PlayStation it is not possible to play Blu ray or DVD movies on the PlayStation Vita since it lacks of an optical disc drive or a UMD drive as with the PlayStation Portable However users can transfer movies in a supported format from and to a PlayStation Vita system and there are videos for download at the PlayStation Store Also users can transfer content that is playing or displayed on a PlayStation Vita system to a PlayStation TV system allowing them to view the content on their televisions instead of PS Vita screens The following multimedia formats are supported on a PS Vita or a PS
