OpenGL for Embedded Systems OpenGL ES or GLES is a subset of the OpenGL computer graphics rendering application programming interface API for rendering D and D computer graphics such as those used by video games typically hardware accelerated using a graphics processing unit GPU It is designed for embedded systems like smartphones tablet computers video game consoles and PDAs OpenGL ES is the most widely deployed D graphics API in history br The API is cross language and multi platform The GLU library and the original GLUT are not available for OpenGL ES freeglut however supports it OpenGL ES is managed by the non profit technology consortium Khronos Group Vulkan a next generation API from Khronos is made for simpler high performance drivers for mobile and desktop devices br br br Versions br Several versions of the OpenGL ES specification now exist OpenGL ES is drawn up against the OpenGL specification OpenGL ES is defined relative to the OpenGL specification and OpenGL ES is defined relative to the OpenGL specification This means that for example an application written for OpenGL ES should be easily portable to the desktop OpenGL as the OpenGL ES is a stripped down version of the API the reverse may or may not be true depending on the particular features used br OpenGL ES comes with its own version of shading language OpenGL ES SL which is different from OpenGL SL br Version and both have common CM and common lite CL profiles the difference being that the common lite profile only supports fixed point instead of floating point data type support whereas common supports both br br br OpenGL ES br OpenGL ES was released publicly July OpenGL ES is based on the original OpenGL API with much functionality removed and a little bit added One significant difference between OpenGL and OpenGL ES is that OpenGL ES removed the need to bracket OpenGL library calls with glBegin and glEnd Other significant differences are that the calling semantics for primitive rendering functions were changed in favor of vertex arrays and fixed point data types were introduced for vertex coordinates Attributes were also added to better support the computational abilities of embedded processors which often lack a floating point unit FPU Many other functions and rendering primitives were removed in version to produce a lightweight interface including br br quad and polygon rendering primitives br texgen line and polygon stipple br polygon mode and antialiased polygon rendering are not supported although rendering using multisample is still possible rather than alpha border fragments br ARB Image pixel class operations bitmaps and D textures are not supported br several of the more technical drawing modes are eliminated including frontbuffer and accumulation buffer br bitmap operations for copying pixels individually evaluators and user selection operations are not allowed br display lists and feedback are removed as are push and pop operations for state attributes br and some material parameters were removed including back face parameters and user defined clip planes br The actual version is br br br OpenGL ES br OpenGL ES added features such as mandatory support for multitexture better multitexture support including combiners and dot product texture operations automatic mipmap generation vertex buffer objects state queries user clip planes and greater control over point rendering br Actual Version is br br br OpenGL ES br OpenGL ES was publicly released in March It is roughly based on OpenGL but it eliminates most of the fixed function rendering pipeline in favor of a programmable one in a move similar to the transition from OpenGL to Control flow in shaders is generally limited to forward branching and to loops where the maximum number of iterations can easily be determined at compile time Almost all rendering features of the transform and lighting stage such as the specification of materials and light parameters formerly specified by the fixed function API are replaced by shaders written by the graphics programmer As a result OpenGL ES is not backward compatible with OpenGL ES Some incompatibilities between the desktop version of OpenGL and OpenGL ES persisted until OpenGL which added the GL ARB ES compatibility extension br Actual version is br The Khronos Group has written a document describing the differences between OpenGL ES and ordinary OpenGL br br br OpenGL ES br The OpenGL ES specification was publicly released in August It is backwards compatible with OpenGL ES and partially compatible with WebGL as WebGL was designed to have a high degree of interoperability with OpenGL ES br The current version of the OpenGL ES standard is released in November br New functionality in the OpenGL ES specification includes br br multiple enhancements to the rendering pipeline to enable acceleration of advanced visual effects including occlusion queries transform feedback instanced rendering and support for four or more rendering targets br high quality ETC EAC texture compression as a standard feature eliminating the need for a different set of textures for each platform br a new version of the GLSL ES shading language with full support for integer and bit floating point operations br greatly enhanced texturing functionality including guaranteed support for floating point textures D textures depth textures vertex textures NPOT textures R RG textures immutable textures D array textures swizzles LOD and mip level clamps seamless cube maps and sampler objects br an extensive set of required explicitly sized texture and render buffer formats reducing implementation variability and making it much easier to write portable applications br br br OpenGL ES br The OpenGL ES specification was publicly released in March br New functionality in OpenGL ES includes br br Compute shaders br Independent vertex and fragment shaders br Indirect draw commands br OpenGL ES is backward compatible with OpenGL ES and thus enabling applications to incrementally incorporate new features Actual Version is November br br br OpenGL ES br The OpenGL ES specification was publicly released in August br New capabilities in OpenGL ES include br br Geometry and tessellation shaders to efficiently process complex scenes on the GPU br Floating point render targets for increased flexibility in higher precision compute operations br ASTC compression to reduce the memory footprint and bandwidth used to process textures br Enhanced blending for sophisticated compositing and handling of multiple color attachments br Advanced texture targets such as texture buffers multisample D array and cube map arrays br Debug and robustness features for easier code development and secure execution br Actual State is July br br Some more extensions are developed or in Development in Mesa for next OpenGL ES Version see Mesamatrix br Next generation API is Vulkan br br br Platform
