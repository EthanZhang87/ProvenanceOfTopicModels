or GB of storage In North America connectivity options were Wi Fi only Wi Fi G LTE on Verizon AT T Telus Rogers or Bell For the rest of the world outside North America connectivity options are Wi Fi only on the Wi Fi model or Wi Fi G on the Wi Fi Cellular model with the latter unavailable in some countries as G LTE connectivity for the device is not available outside North America The Wi Fi Cellular model includes GPS capability br Initially the cellular version was titled and marketed worldwide as the Wi Fi G model but due to regional differences in classification of G LTE connectivity outside of North America Apple later rebranded and altered their marketing to call this the Wi Fi Cellular model br The tablet was released in ten countries on March It gained mostly positive reviews

Game Center Photo Booth and Contacts Like all iOS devices the iPad can sync content and other data with a Mac or PC using iTunes although iOS and later can be managed and backed up without a computer Although the tablet is not designed to make phone calls over a cellular network users can use a headset or the built in speaker and microphone and place phone calls over Wi Fi or cellular using a VoIP application such as Skype The device has dictation using the same voice recognition technology as the iPhone S The user speaks and the iPad types what they say on the screen provided that the iPad is connected to a Wi Fi or cellular network br The third generation device has an optional iBooks application which displays books and other EPUB format content downloaded from the iBookstore Several

while the Wi Fi Cellular models run iOS The third generation iPad does not support iOS due to hardware limitations and performance issues br br br GPS rollover update br On July Apple released iOS for the WiFi Cellular models of the third generation iPad to fix issues caused by the GPS Week Number Rollover The issues would impact accuracy of GPS location and set the device s date and time to an incorrect value preventing connection to HTTPS servers and consequently Apple s servers for activation iCloud and the iTunes and App stores The WiFi model is not affected by the rollover as it lacks a GPS chipset br br br Jailbreaking br br Researchers demonstrated within hours of the product release that the third generation iPad can be jailbroken to use applications and programs that are not authorized by Apple The third generation iPad can be jailbroken with Redsn w or Absinthe Jailbreaking violates the factory warranty One of the main reasons for jailbreaking is to expand the feature set limited by Apple and its App Store Most jailbreaking tools automatically install Cydia a native iOS APT client used for finding and installing software for jailbroken iOS devices Many apps unapproved by Apple are extensions and customizations for iOS and other apps Users install these programs to personalize and customize the interface adding desired features and fixing annoyances and simplify app development by providing access to the filesystem and command line tools br br br Hardware br br The device has an Apple A X SoC with a GHz dual core bit Cortex A CPU and a quad core PowerVR SGX MP GPU GB of RAM a megapixel rear facing camera capable of p video recording and a VGA front facing videophone camera designed for FaceTime The display resolution is by QXGA with million pixels four times more than the iPad providing even scaling from the prior model br The new iPad is thicker than its predecessor by mm and is heavier by grams for the Wi Fi model grams br The Wi Fi Cellular models both at grams are grams heavier for the AT T model and grams heavier for the Verizon model compared to the respective iPad G models AT T G iPad is grams and Verizon G iPad is grams br There are four physical switches on the third generation iPad including a home button near the display that returns the user to the home screen and three plastic switches on the sides wake sleep and volume up down plus a software controlled switch whose function varies with software update The display responds to other sensors an ambient light sensor to adjust screen brightness and a axis accelerometer to sense orientation and to switch between portrait and landscape modes Unlike the iPhone and iPod Touch s built in applications which work in three orientations portrait landscape left and landscape right the iPad s built in applications support screen rotation in all four orientations including upside down Consequently the device has no intrinsic native orientation only the relative position of the home button changes br The tablet is manufactured either with or without the capability to communicate over a cellular network all models can connect to a wireless LAN The third generation iPad optionally has or GB of internal flash memory with no expansion option Apple sells a camera connection kit with an SD card reader but it can only be used to transfer photos and videos br The audio playback of the third generation iPad has a frequency response of Hz to Hz Without third party software it can play the following audio formats HE AAC AAC Protected AAC MP MP VBR Audible formats AEA AAX and AAX ALAC AIFF and WAV A preliminary tear down of the third generation iPad by IHS iSuppli showed the likely costs for a GB Wi Fi Cellular model at GB at and GB at respectively br This iPad uses an internal rechargeable lithium ion polymer LiPo battery The batteries are made in Taiwan by Simplo Technology and Dynapack International Technology The iPad is designed to be charged with a high current of amps using the included W USB power adapter and USB cord with a USB connector at one end and a pin dock connector at the other end While it can be charged by an older USB port from a computer these are limited to milliamps amps As a result if the iPad is in use while powered by a computer it may charge very slowly or not at all High power USB ports found in newer computers and accessories provide full charging capabilities br Apple claims that the battery can provide up to hours of video hours of audio playback or one month on standby people say the battery lasts about hours doing normal tasks Like any rechargeable battery the iPad s battery loses capacity over time However the iPad s battery is not user replaceable In a program similar to iPod and iPhone battery replacement programs Apple promised to replace an iPad that does not hold an electrical charge with a refurbished unit for a fee of US plus shipping User data is not preserved transferred The refurbished unit comes with a new case The warranty on the refurbished unit may vary between jurisdictions br br br Accessories br br The Smart Cover introduced with the iPad is a screen protector that magnetically attaches to the face of the iPad The cover has three folds which allow it to convert into a stand which is also held together by magnets The Smart Cover can also assume other positions by folding it While original iPad owners could purchase a black case that included a similarly folding cover the Smart Cover is simpler easily detachable and protects only the screen Smart Covers have a microfiber bottom that cleans the front of the iPad and wakes up the unit when the cover is removed It comes in five colors of both polyurethane and the more expensive leather br br Apple offers several other accessories most of which are adapters for the proprietary pin dock connector the only port besides the headphone jack A dock holds the iPad upright at an angle and has a dock connector and audio line out port The iPad can use Bluetooth keyboards that also work with Macs and PCs The iPad can be charged by a standalone power adapter wall charger compatible with iPods and iPhones and a watt charger is included br br br Critical reception br The third generation iPad received positive reviews receiving praise for its Retina display camera processor and LTE capabilities According to Walt Mossberg of All Things Digital the new model has the most spectacular display seen in a mobile device and holds the crown as the best tablet on the planet Jonathan Spira writing in Frequent Business Traveler claimed that it seems to make everything sharper and clearer br br br Issues br br br Cellular problems br Criticism followed the news that in markets outside the US the tablet cannot communicate with LTE due to its use of MHz and MHz frequencies respectively versus MHz GHz and GHz used elsewhere Soon after the launch the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ACCC took Apple to court for breaking four provisions of Australian consumer law They alleged that Apple s promotion of the tablet in Australia as the iPad Wi Fi G misled customers as the name indicates that it would work on Australia s then current G network Apple responded to this by offering a full refund to all customers in Australia who purchased the Wi Fi Cellular model when it was previously named Wi Fi G of the iPad br On April Apple stated that HSPA networks in Australia are G even though the speeds are slower than that of LTE A month later on June Apple was sued for A million for false advertising in Australia In its advertisements Apple claimed that the new iPad was G LTE compatible However it didn t work with the Telstra LTE mobile data network in Australia Apple was fined A million and was ordered to pay A in costs br Apple agreed to remove all references to G LTE capability in its UK advertising but as of August had not done so There was no widespread G LTE network in the UK at the time and the third generation iPad would also be incompatible with future G LTE networks when they did roll out there The Advertising Standards Authority received consumer complaints on the matter Apple offered to refund customers who bought the device after being misled by the advertising The result of numerous complaints and lawsuits against Apple regarding the use of the term G in their advertisements prompted Apple to rename its G service to Cellular with this change appearing on Apple s website on May br br br Overheating br Many users reported abnormally high temperatures on the casing of the unit especially after running D games If used while plugged in the rear of the new iPad became as much as F C hotter than an iPad The difference unplugged was F C Thermal imaging tests revealed that the iPad can reach F C At this temperature it was warm to touch but not uncomfortable when held for a brief period In a follow up report Consumer Reports said they don t believe the temperatures we recorded in our tests of the new iPad represent a safety concern br br br Performance br The claimed superiority of the A X over the Tegra processor was questioned around launch time by competitor Nvidia some benchmarks later confirmed the iPad s superiority in graphics performance while other benchmarks show that the Tegra has greater performance in some areas br br br Criticism br Consumer Reports gave the third generation iPad a top rating and recommendation claiming that the tablet was superb very good and very fast and that the G network the Retina display and overall performance were positive attributes They elaborated on the display quality stating that the third generation iPad was the best we ve seen The iPad s new display was a large enough improvement to prompt Consumer Reports to rate it excellent and consequently downgraded the display of other tablets including the iPad from excellent to very good br As with the preceding models see the parent article on the iPad iOS closed and proprietary nature garnered criticism particularly by digital rights advocates such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation computer engineer and activist Brewster Kahle Internet law specialist Jonathan Zittrain and the Free Software Foundation who protested the iPad s introductory event and have targeted the iPad with their Defective by Design campaign br br br Commercial reception br Pre orders were so high for the third generation iPad that later orders were quoted shipping times of two to three weeks after the order was placed Apple said that customer response to the new iPad has been off the charts and the quantity available for pre order has been purchased Despite the delayed shipping many users chose to purchase the iPad online instead of waiting in line at the Apple Store According to an Apple press release three million units were sold in the first three days The iPad was purchased mainly by a younger male demographic Most of the buyers were either die hard Apple fans or had previously purchased an iPad An Apple retailer in Dayton Ohio claimed that the demand for the tablet was chaotic and claimed that its launch was drastically more significant than the iPad launch By Q of Apple would hit an all time high claiming percent of the global tablet market br br br Timeline br br Source Apple
