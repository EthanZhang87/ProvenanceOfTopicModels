In Apple s macOS operating system Quartz is the Quartz D and Quartz Compositor part of the Core Graphics framework Quartz includes both a D renderer in Core Graphics and the composition engine that sends instructions to the graphics card Because of this vertical nature Quartz is often synonymous with Core Graphics br In a general sense Quartz or Quartz technologies can refer to almost every part of the macOS graphics model from the rendering layer down to the compositor including Core Image and Core Video Other Apple graphics technologies that use the Quartz prefix include these br br Quartz Extreme br QuartzGL originally Quartz D Extreme br QuartzCore br Quartz Display Services br Quartz Event Services br br br Quartz D and Quartz Compositor br Quartz D is the primary two dimensional D text and graphics rendering library It directly supports Aqua by displaying two dimensional graphics to create the user interface including on the fly rendering and anti aliasing Quartz can render text with sub pixel precision graphics are limited to more traditional anti aliasing which is the default mode of operation but can be turned off In Mac OS X Tiger Apple introduced Quartz D Extreme enabling Quartz D to offload rendering to compatible GPUs However GPU rendering was not enabled by default due to potential video redraw issues or kernel panics br In Mac OS X v Quartz D Extreme was renamed to QuartzGL br The Quartz Compositor is the compositing engine used by macOS In Mac OS X Jaguar and later the Quartz Compositor can use the graphics accelerator GPU to vastly improve composition performance This technology is known as Quartz Extreme and is enabled automatically on systems with supported graphics cards br br br See also br Quartz Composer br br br br br br External links br Quartz D Programming Guide at developer apple com br Core Graphics API Reference at developer apple com br Quartz in Tiger from a review of Mac OS X in Ars Technica br Introduction to OS X graphics APIs br Cocoa Graphics with Quartz Part br Cocoa Graphics with Quartz Part
