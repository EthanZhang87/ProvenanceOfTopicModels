Items br With the release of iOS third party Bluetooth items and accessories with support for the Find My network accessory program can also be tracked under a separate Items tab If something is lost but out of Bluetooth range the app will display the last known location until another iOS iPadOS or macOS device is nearby Similar to Apple s own devices third party items can be placed into a lost mode which prevents others from pairing to the device Lost items can be identified from within the Find My app allowing a user to see a message or contact information from the owner of the lost item br AirTags also use ultra wideband technology to find lost items if the Apple device used for searching supports it br br br Privacy concerns br Find My as well as its predecessor Find My Friends has raised potential privacy issues arising from the tracking of a user s exact location without users being notified that they are being tracked Several safety features allowed a user to share their location only with people they choose and to turn off the permission at any time Friends could track only users who had accepted an access request The user could remove a person from access at any time or make the tracking only temporary br The introduction of item tracking has further prompted concern from some with fears that the device could be used to potentially track someone s location without that person s knowledge by placing an AirTag among the person s belongings In an attempt to prevent using the device for stalking Apple has since introduced notifications which alert users if they are being followed by an unknown device br br br See also br Find My Device br Life br iBeacon br br br br br br External links br Overview of the Find My network architecture br How To Enable
