id: 205635
Mac OS is the ninth and final major release of Apple s classic Mac OS operating system which was succeeded by Mac OS X in starting the Mac OS X family of operating systems Introduced on October it was promoted by Apple as The Best Internet Operating System Ever highlighting Sherlock s Internet search capabilities integration with Apple s free online services known as iTools and improved Open Transport networking While Mac OS lacks protected memory and full pre emptive multitasking lasting improvements include the introduction of an automated Software Update engine and support for multiple users br Apple discontinued development of Mac OS in late transitioning all future development to Mac OS X The final updates to Mac OS addressed compatibility issues with Mac OS X while running in the Classic Environment and compatibility with Carbon applications At the Worldwide Developers Conference Steve Jobs began his keynote address by staging a mock funeral for OS br br br Features br Apple billed Mac OS as including new features and heavily marketed its Sherlock software which introduced a channels feature for searching different online resources and introduced a QuickTime like metallic appearance Mac OS also featured integrated support for Apple s suite of Internet services known as iTools later re branded as Mac then MobileMe which was replaced by iCloud and included improved TCP IP functionality with Open Transport br Other features new to Mac OS include br br Integrated support for multiple user accounts without using At Ease br Support for voice login through VoicePrint passwords br Keychain a feature allowing users to save passwords and textual data encrypted in protected keychains br A Software Update control panel for automatic download and installation of Apple system software updates br A redesigned Sound control panel and support for USB audio br Speakable Items also known as PlainTalk featuring improved speech synthesis and recognition along with AppleScript integration br Improved font management through FontSync br Remote Access Personal Server including support for TCP IP clients over Point to Point Protocol PPP br An updated version of AppleScript with support for TCP IP br Personal File Sharing over TCP IP br USB Printer Sharing a control panel allowing certain USB printers to be shared across a TCP IP network br bit file encryption in the Finder br Support for files larger than GB br Unix volume support br CD Burning in the Finder introduced in Mac OS br Addition of a Window menu to the Finder introduced in Mac OS br br br Mac OS and the Classic Environment br br PowerPC versions of Mac OS X prior to include a compatibility layer called Classic enabling users to run applications and hardware requiring Mac OS from within OS X This is achieved through running Mac OS without access to its Finder inside OS X This requires Mac OS to be installed on the computer even though most computers that can run the Classic environment are not necessarily able to boot into Mac OS natively Some Mac OS applications do not run well in Classic They demonstrate screen redraw problems and lagging performance In addition some drivers and other software which directly interact with the hardware fail to work properly br In May at Apple s Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose California Steve Jobs accompanied by a coffin held a mock funeral to announce that Apple had stopped the development of Mac OS The final version of Mac OS and the classic Mac OS was Mac OS released in December br In June Jobs announced that the Macintosh platform would be transitioning to Intel x microprocessors Developer documentation of the Rosetta PowerPC emulation layer revealed that applications written for Mac OS or would not run on x based Macs The Classic Environment remains in the PowerPC version of however x versions of OS X do not support the Classic environment br Mac OS can be emulated by using SheepShaver a PowerPC emulator available on multiple operating systems including Intel based Macs However SheepShaver cannot run Mac OS versions newer than as there is no support for a memory management unit The PearPC PowerPC emulator does not support Mac OS QEMU has experimental support for running Mac OS using PowerPC G emulation br The final Macs that were able to boot into Mac OS natively without resorting to the Classic environment were the GHz and GHz Mirrored Drive Doors Power Mac G released in August which was re released in June due to a perceived demand for Mac OS machines and the MHz and GHz Antimony titanium PowerBook G TiBook released in November These machines were released around the time when Mac OS was still offered on some Macs up until even though development had stopped in late br Both the Mirrored Drive Doors Power Mac G and the Antimony titanium PowerBook G came preinstalled with both Mac OS and Mac OS X in a dual boot configuration with Mac OS X being selected as the default The Mirrored Drive Doors Power Mac G was one of the last Mac models overall to officially boot into Mac OS while the Antimony titanium PowerBook G was the last PowerBook model able to run Mac OS natively While these final models of the Macs and PowerBooks have G processors with faster clock speeds of up to GHz and GHz respectively on some models they were able to boot into Mac OS natively without any issues br The majority of G Macs released in onwards that have a GHz or higher processor never had their Mac OS ROM boot files updated to allow those Macs to officially boot into Mac OS natively outside of the Classic environment All G Macs are unable to boot directly into Mac OS at all because there was no support for PowerPC G processors on Mac OS Mac OS only supports G and G processors as of Mac OS Therefore those Macs can only run Mac OS under the Classic environment or other emulation software br In recent years unofficial patches for Mac OS and the Mac OS ROM have been made to allow unsupported G Macs to boot into Mac OS natively however this is not officially supported by Apple br br br Other uses br br Aside from Apple branded hardware that is still maintained and operated Mac OS can be operated in other environments such as Windows and Unix The aforementioned SheepShaver software was initially not designed for use on x platforms and requires the use of an actual PowerPC processor present in the machine it was running on similar to a hypervisor Support for x platforms was added later Although it provides PowerPC processor support it can only run up to Mac OS because it does not emulate a memory management unit br br br Version history br br Updates to Mac OS include and Mac OS was a collection of bug fixes primarily relating to USB and FireWire support Mac OS included integrated CD burning support in the Macintosh Finder and added a new Window menu in the Finder for switching between open windows Mac OS increased performance noticeably and improved Classic Environment support br br br Compatibility br br Some newest G and most G Macs can only run at least Mac OS and some only run at least Mac OS This is because the late development of G Macs and the mid development of G Macs was during the development of Mac OS and only the versions the G Macs support were designed to be compatible with those G Macs br Some newest G and all G Macs can only run at least Mac OS and can only run its compatible versions of Mac OS in OS X s Classic Environment because the Mac OS ROM was never updated to allow those Macs which were developed during the OS X era to directly boot it but probably continued to run in userspace with the restriction that it would only run at least Mac OS so it was still supported in the Classic Environment br Although Mac OS to officially requires a G processor as a minimum certain second generation Power Macs can be made to run it using a third party program called OS Helper which allows for such benefits like support for the latest ATI classic Mac OS drivers full iPod compatibility and the ability to run DVD Studio Pro or and Final Cut Pro among other things br br br See also br List of Apple operating
