title: Classic Mac OS
id: 46728817
Mac OS originally System Software retronym Classic Mac OS is the series of operating systems developed for the Macintosh family of personal computers by Apple Computer Inc from to starting with System and ending with Mac OS The Macintosh operating system is credited with having popularized the graphical user interface concept It was included with every Macintosh that was sold during the era in which it was developed and many updates to the system software were done in conjunction with the introduction of new Macintosh systems br Apple released the original Macintosh on January The first version of the system software which had no official name was partially based on the Lisa OS which Apple previously released for the Lisa computer in As part of an agreement allowing Xerox to buy shares in Apple at a favorable price it also used concepts from the Xerox PARC Alto computer which former Apple CEO Steve Jobs and other Lisa team members had previewed This operating system consisted of the Macintosh Toolbox ROM and the System Folder a set of files that were loaded from disk The name Macintosh System Software came into use in with System Apple rebranded the system as Mac OS in starting officially with version due in part to its Macintosh clone program That program ended after the release of Mac OS in The last major release of the system was Mac OS in br Initial versions of the System Software ran one application at a time With the Macintosh K a system extension called the Switcher was developed to use this additional memory to allow multiple programs to remain loaded The software of each loaded program used the memory exclusively only when activated by the Switcher did the program appear even the Finder s desktop With the Switcher the now familiar Clipboard feature allowed copy and paste between the loaded programs across switches including the desktop br With the introduction of System a cooperative multitasking extension called MultiFinder was added which allowed content in windows of each program to remain in a layered view over the desktop and was later integrated into System as part of the operating system along with support for virtual memory By the mid s however contemporary operating systems such as Windows NT OS NeXTSTEP BSD and Linux had all brought pre emptive multitasking protected memory access controls and multi user capabilities to desktop computers The Macintosh s limited memory management and susceptibility to conflicts among extensions that provide additional functionality such as networking or support for a particular device led to significant criticism of the operating system and was a factor in Apple s declining market share at the time br After two aborted attempts at creating a successor to the Macintosh System Software called Taligent and Copland and a four year development effort spearheaded by Steve Jobs s return to Apple in Apple replaced Mac OS with a new operating system in named Mac OS X It retained most of the user interface design elements of the Classic Mac OS and there was some overlap of application frameworks for compatibility but the two operating systems otherwise have completely different origins and architectures br The final updates to Mac OS released in provided interoperability with Mac OS X The name Classic that now signifies the historical Mac OS as a whole is a reference to the Classic Environment a compatibility layer that helped ease the transition to Mac OS X now macOS br br br Initial concept br br The Macintosh project started in late with Jef Raskin who envisioned an easy to use low cost computer for the average consumer In September Raskin began looking for an engineer who could put together a prototype Bill Atkinson a member of the Apple Lisa team introduced Raskin to Burrell Smith a service technician who had been hired earlier that year br Apple s concept for the Macintosh deliberately sought to minimize the user s awareness of the operating system Many basic tasks that required more operating system knowledge on other systems could be accomplished by mouse gestures and graphic controls on a Macintosh This would differentiate it from its contemporaries such as MS DOS which use a command line interface consisting of terse abbreviated textual commands br In January Steve Jobs completely took over the Macintosh project Jobs and a number of Apple engineers visited Xerox PARC in December three months after the Lisa and Macintosh projects had begun After hearing about the pioneering GUI technology being developed at Xerox PARC from former Xerox employees like Raskin Jobs negotiated a visit to see the Xerox Alto computer and Smalltalk development tools in exchange for Apple stock options The final Lisa and Macintosh operating systems use concepts from the Xerox Alto but many elements of the graphical user interface were created by Apple including the menu bar pull down menus and the concepts of drag and drop and direct manipulation br Unlike the IBM PC which uses kB of system ROM for power on self test POST and basic input output system BIOS the Mac ROM is significantly larger kB and holds key OS code Much of the original Mac ROM code was written by Andy Hertzfeld a member of the original Macintosh team He was able to conserve precious ROM space by writing routines in assembly language code optimized with hacks or clever programming tricks In addition to the ROM he also coded the kernel the Macintosh Toolbox and some of the desktop accessories DAs The icons of the operating system which represent folders and application software were designed by Susan Kare who later designed the icons for Microsoft Windows Bruce Horn and Steve Capps wrote the Macintosh Finder as well as a number of Macintosh system utilities br Apple aggressively advertised their new machine After its release the company bought all pages of advertisement space in the November December edition of Newsweek magazine The Macintosh quickly outsold its more sophisticated but much more expensive predecessor the Lisa Apple quickly developed MacWorks a product that allowed the Lisa to emulate Macintosh system software through System by which time it had been discontinued as the rebranded Macintosh XL Many of the Lisa s operating system advances would not appear in the Macintosh operating system until System or later br br br Architecture br br br Compatibility br Early versions of Mac OS are compatible only with Motorola family Macintoshes As Apple introduced computers with PowerPC hardware the OS was ported to support this architecture Mac OS is the last version that could run on a k processor the br In systems prior to PowerPC G based systems significant parts of the system are stored in physical ROM on the motherboard The initial purpose of this is to avoid having the OS use up most of the KiB RAM of the initial Macintosh the initial ROMs were KiB This architecture also allows for a completely graphical OS interface at the lowest level without the need for a text only console or command line mode boot time errors such as finding no functioning disk drives are communicated to the user graphically usually with an icon or the distinctive Chicago bitmap font and a Chime of Death or a series of beeps This is in contrast to MS DOS and CP M computers of the time which display such messages in a mono spaced font on a black background and require the use of the keyboard rather than a mouse for input To provide such niceties at a low level early Mac OS depends on core system software in ROM on the motherboard which also ensured that only Apple computers or licensed clones with the copyright protected ROMs from Apple can run Mac OS br br br Mac clones br br Several computer manufacturers over the years made Macintosh clones that were capable of running Mac OS From to Apple licensed Macintosh ROMs to several companies notably Power Computing UMAX and Motorola These machines normally ran various versions of Classic Mac OS Steve Jobs ended the clone licensing program after returning to Apple in br Support for Macintosh clones was first exhibited in System which was the first version to include the Mac OS logo a variation on the original Happy Mac startup icon and Mac OS was the first to be named Mac OS instead of System These changes were made to disassociate the operating system from Apple s own Macintosh models br br br File systems br The Macintosh originally used the Macintosh File System MFS a flat file system with only one level of folders This was quickly replaced in by the Hierarchical File System HFS which had a true directory tree Both file systems are otherwise compatible An improved file system named HFS Plus HFS or Mac OS Extended was announced in and implemented in br Files in most file systems used with DOS Windows Unix or other operating systems have only one fork By contrast MFS and HFS give files two different forks The data fork contains the same sort of information as a file in other file systems such as the text of a document or the bitmaps of an image file The resource fork contains other structured data such as menu definitions graphics sounds or code segments that would be incorporated into a program s file format on other systems An executable file might consist only of resources including code segments with an empty data fork while a data file might have only a data fork with no resource fork A word processor file could contain its text in the data fork and styling information in the resource fork so that an application that does not recognize the styling information can still read the raw text br On the other hand these forks would challenge interoperability with different operating systems In copying or transferring a Mac OS file to a non Mac system the default implementations would strip the file of its resource fork Most data files contained only nonessential information in their resource fork such as window size and location but program files would be inoperative without their resources This necessitated such encoding schemes as BinHex and MacBinary which allowed a user to encode a dual forked file into a single stream or inversely take a single stream so encoded and reconstitute it into a dual forked file usable by Mac OS br br br Release history br br br System and br br As part of Apple s goal of creating a computer with appliance like simplicity there is no explicit distinction made between the operating system software and the hardware it runs on Because of this early versions of the operating system do not have a distinct name The software consists of two user visible files the System file and the Finder an application used for file management that also displays the Desktop The two files are contained in a folder directory labeled System Folder which contains other resource files like a printer driver needed to interact with the System Version numbers of the operating system are based on the version numbers of these two files br br System and use a flat file system named Macintosh File System MFS The Finder provides virtual folders that could be used to organize files but these folders are not visible from any other application and do not exist on the disk br System added support for AppleTalk and the newly introduced LaserWriter to use it br System Finder introduced the Hierarchical File System HFS which has real directories This version was specifically to support the Hard Disk and only implements HFS in RAM startup and most floppy disks remain MFS K volumes br System Finder was introduced with the Macintosh Plus officially implementing HFS K startup drives support for several new technologies including SCSI and AppleShare and Trash bulging i e when the Trash contains files it gains a bulged appearance br System was released with the Macintosh SE and System first shipped with the Macintosh II these new machines required additional support for the first expansion slots the Apple Desktop Bus ADB internal hard drives and on the Macintosh II external color displays and the first Motorola processor System was the first release to support color graphics previous releases did not support color br These releases can only run one application at a time except for desk accessories though special application shells such as Multi Mac or Switcher discussed under MultiFinder could work around this Visible changes are best reflected in the version number of the Finder where major leaps are found between x x x and x br In the late s Apple retroactively gave these older releases a single name br br br System Software br Towards the end of Apple introduced a package titled Apple Macintosh System Software Update For the first time the Macintosh operating system was offered as a distinct retail product that included four K disks and three manuals at a cost of US The software itself was still freely available through user groups and bulletin board services While the product box presented this update to the operating system as version this number does not appear in the software itself Three of the four disks System Tools System Tools and Utilities are all bootable and the user can boot off whichever floppy contains the tools the user needs For instance System Tools is the only disk with printer drivers and Utilities is the only disk with Disk First Aid and Apple HD SC Setup Because the disks are named System Tools users and the press commonly referred to this version as System Tools br The primary new feature of System is MultiFinder an extension that lets the system run several programs at once The system uses a cooperative multitasking model meaning that time is given to the background applications only when the foreground application yields control A change in system functions that applications were already calling to handle events make many existing applications share time automatically as well as being allowed to perform tasks in the background Users can also choose not to use MultiFinder thereby using a single application at a time In InfoWorld tested four multitasking options for PC and Mac viewing MultiFinder positively overall but noting that its presence halved the speed of file transfer and printing compared to the single tasking System without MultiFinder br br br System Software br br System Software also referred to as System is a consolidation release of the Macintosh system software producing a complete stable and long lasting operating system Two major hardware introductions requiring additional support under System are the processor and MB SuperDrive debuting with the Macintosh IIx and Macintosh SE Later updates include support for the first specialized laptop features with the introduction of the Macintosh Portable From System forward the Finder has a unified version number closely matching that of the System alleviating much of the confusion caused by the often considerable differences between earlier Systems br br br System Mac OS br br On May System was released It was a major upgrade over System adding a significant user interface overhaul new applications stability improvements and many new features Its introduction coincides with the release of and provided support for the Macintosh line The System era saw numerous changes in the Macintosh platform including a proliferation of Macintosh models the k to Power Macintosh transition as well as the rise of Microsoft Windows increasing use of computer networking and the explosion in the popularity of the Internet br One of the most significant features of System is virtual memory support an essential subsystem anticipated for years which only exists for previous Systems in a third party extension named Virtual from Connectix Accompanying this was a move to bit memory addressing necessary for the ever increasing amounts of RAM available to the Motorola CPU and CPUs with a PMMU This process involves making all of the routines in OS code use the full bits of a pointer as an address prior systems used the upper bits as flags This change is known as being bit clean While System itself is bit clean many existing machines and thousands of applications were not so it was some time before the process was completed To ease the transition the Memory control panel contains a switch to disable this feature allowing for compatibility with older applications br Another notable System feature is built in cooperative multitasking In System Software this function was optional through the MultiFinder System also introduced aliases similar to symbolic links on Unix shortcuts that were introduced in later versions of Microsoft Windows and shadows in IBM OS System extensions were enhanced by being moved to their own subfolder a subfolder in the System Folder was also created for the control panels In System Apple includes the Extensions Manager a previously third party program which simplified the process of enabling and disabling extensions br The Apple menu home only to desk accessories in System was made more general purpose the user could now make often used folders and applications or anything else they desired appear in the menu by placing aliases to them in an Apple Menu Items subfolder of the System Folder System also introduced the following AppleScript a scripting language for automating tasks bit QuickDraw supporting so called true color imaging previously available as a system extension and TrueType an outline font standard br The Trash under System and earlier empties itself automatically when shutting down the computer or if MultiFinder is not running when launching an application System reimplements the Trash as a special hidden folder allowing files to remain in it across reboots until the user deliberately chose the Empty Trash command br br br System br System is mainly a bugfix release with a few minor features added One of the major new features of System was moving fonts out of the System file into the Fonts folder in the System Folder Previously a resource copying utility such as ResEdit or Font D A Mover was required for installing fonts System is not only the first Macintosh operating system to cost money all previous versions were free or sold at the cost of the floppies but also received a Pro sibling version with extra features System was the first version to support PowerPC based Macs System also introduces the System Enablers as a method to support new models without updating the actual System file This leads to extra files inside the system folder one per new model supported br br br System br System introduces a large number of new features many of which are based on shareware applications that Apple bought and included into the new system On the newer PowerPC machines System may have stability problems partly due to a new memory manager which can be turned off and issues with the handling of errors in the PowerPC code all PowerPC exceptions map to Type These issues do not affect k architecture machines System is contemporary with Apple s failed Copland effort as well as the release of Windows br br br Mac OS br Stability improved in PowerPC based Macs with Mac OS which dropped the System moniker as a more trademarkable name was needed in order to license the OS to the growing market of third party Macintosh clone manufacturers Mac OS required bit clean ROMs and so it dropped support for every Mac with a processor as well as the Mac II Mac IIx Mac IIcx and Mac SE br br br Mac OS br br Mac OS was released on July the same month Steve Jobs became the de facto CEO of Apple It was mainly released to keep the Mac OS moving forward during a difficult time for Apple Initially planned as Mac OS it was renumbered to exploit a legal loophole and accomplish Jobs s goal of terminating third party manufacturers licenses to System and shutting down the Macintosh clone market br Mac OS added a number of features from the abandoned Copland project while leaving the underlying operating system unchanged A multi threaded Finder was included files could now be copied in the background The GUI was changed in appearance to a new shaded greyscale look named Platinum and the ability to change the appearance themes also known as skins was added with a new control panel though Platinum was the only one shipped This capability was provided by a new appearance API layer within the OS one of the few significant changes br Apple sold million copies of Mac OS in its first two weeks of availability and million within six months In light of Apple s financial difficulties at the time there was a large grassroots movement among Mac users to upgrade and help save Apple Even some pirate groups refused to redistribute the OS br br br Mac OS br Mac OS introduced an updated version of the Hierarchical File System named HFS which fixed many of the limitations of the earlier system and continued to be used in macOS up until macOS High Sierra when it was replaced with the Apple File System There are some other interface changes such as separating network features from printing and some improvements to application switching However in underlying technical respects Mac OS is not very different from System br br br Mac OS br Mac OS focuses on speed and stability with most k code replaced by modern code native to the PowerPC It also improved the appearance of the user interface although the theming feature was cut late in development br br br Mac OS br br Mac OS the last major revision of the Classic Mac OS was released on October It is generally a steady evolution from Mac OS Early development releases of Mac OS were numbered br Mac OS added improved support for AirPort wireless networking It introduced an early implementation of multi user support Though not a true multi user operating system Mac OS does allow multiple desktop users to have their own data and system settings An improved Sherlock search engine added several new search plug ins Mac OS also provides a much improved memory implementation and management AppleScript was improved to allow TCP IP and networking control Mac OS also makes the first use of the centralized Apple Software Update to find and install OS and hardware updates br Other new features included its on the fly file encryption software with code signing and Keychain technologies Remote Networking and File Server packages and much improved list of USB drivers br Mac OS also added some transitional technologies to help application developers adopt some Mac OS X features before the introduction of the new OS to the public to help ease the transition These included new APIs for the file system and the bundling of the Carbon library that apps could link against instead of the traditional API libraries apps that were adapted to do this could be run natively on Mac OS X as well Other changes were made beginning with the Mac OS update to allow it to be launched in the Classic Environment within Mac OS X br The final update to the Classic Mac OS was version released on December br br br Transition to Mac OS X br br macOS originally Mac OS X and then OS X is Apple s current Mac operating system that officially succeeded the Classic Mac OS in Although it was originally marketed as simply version of Mac OS it has a history that is largely independent of the earlier Mac OS releases br The macOS architectural legacy is the successor to Mac OS and the Classic Mac OS legacy However unlike the Classic Mac OS it is a Unix based operating system built on NeXTSTEP and technology developed at NeXT from the late s until early when Apple purchased the company and its CEO Steve Jobs returned to Apple macOS also makes use of the BSD codebase and the XNU kernel and its core set of components is based upon Apple s open source Darwin operating system br An early version of the operating system Mac OS X Server was released in It retains the Platinum appearance from the Classic Mac OS and even resembles OPENSTEP in places with the first version to arrive with the new Aqua user interface The first consumer version Mac OS X was released on March supporting the new Aqua user interface Mac OS X was renamed OS X in and macOS in br Users of the Classic Mac OS generally upgraded to Mac OS X but it was criticized in its early years as more difficult and less user friendly than the original Mac OS for the lack of certain features that had not yet been reimplemented in the new OS for being slower on the same hardware especially older hardware and for incompatibilities with the older OS Because drivers for printers scanners tablets etc written for the older Mac OS were not compatible with Mac OS X inconsistent program support with the Classic Environment program used to run the older operating system s programs on Mac OS X and the lack of Mac OS X support for older Apple computers before late some Macintosh users continued using the older Classic Mac OS for a few years after the original release of Mac OS X Steve Jobs encouraged people to upgrade to Mac OS X by staging a mock funeral for Mac OS at WWDC br br br Classic br br PowerPC versions of Mac OS X up to and including Mac OS X Tiger include a compatibility layer for running older Mac applications the Classic Environment Originally codenamed the blue box the environment runs a nearly complete Mac OS operating system version or later as a Mac OS X application This allows applications that have not been ported to the Carbon API to run on Mac OS X This is reasonably seamless though classic applications retain their original Mac OS appearance and do not gain the Mac OS X Aqua appearance br Early New World ROM PowerPC based Macs shipped with Mac OS as well as Mac OS X Mac OS had to be installed by the user it was not installed by default on hardware revisions released after Mac OS X Most well written classic Mac OS applications function properly under this environment but compatibility is assured only if the software was written to be unaware of the actual hardware and to interact solely with the operating system The Classic Environment is not available on Intel based Mac systems or the latest Apple silicon Macs due to the incompatibility of Mac OS with both the x and ARM hardware br br br Emulation br br br k emulators br br Third party Macintosh emulators such as vMac Basilisk II and Executor eventually made it possible to run the Classic Mac OS on Intel based PCs These emulators were restricted to emulating the k series of processors and as such most could not run versions of the Mac OS that succeeded which required PowerPC processors Most also required a Mac ROM image or a hardware interface supporting a real Mac ROM chip those requiring an image are of dubious legal standing as the ROM image may infringe on Apple s intellectual property br A notable exception was the Executor commercial software product from Abacus Research Development the only product that used reverse engineered code without the use of Apple technology It ran extremely quickly but never achieved more than a minor subset of functionality Few programs were completely compatible and many were extremely crash prone if they ran at all Executor filled a niche market for porting k Mac applications to x platforms development ceased in and the source code was released by the author in late Emulators using Mac ROM images offered near complete Mac OS compatibility and later versions offered excellent performance as modern x processor performance increased exponentially br Apple included its own Mac k emulator that ran seamlessly on all PowerPC based versions of the Classic Mac OS Apple also sold a Mac k emulator for SPARC based Solaris and PA RISC based HP UX systems called Macintosh Application Environment MAE which could run variants of System x inside an X window br br br PowerPC emulators br As of the most capable PowerPC emulator is QEMU br In comparison with k emulator development PowerPC emulation is more complex and requires more CPU power The emulator is capable of running Classic Mac OS and OS X at full speed with networking and sound in most cases QEMU has official support for Classic Mac OS version through and Mac OS X up to and including QEMU has several advantages over other PowerPC emulators namely supporting a wide range of platforms from Linux to Mac and Windows on current CPU architectures br Another PowerPC emulator is SheepShaver which has been around since for BeOS on the PowerPC platform but in was open sourced and efforts began to port it to other platforms Originally it was not designed for use on x platforms and required an actual PowerPC processor present in the machine it was running on similar to a hypervisor Although it provides PowerPC processor support it can run only up to Mac OS because it does not emulate a memory management unit br Other examples include ShapeShifter by the same developer that created SheepShaver Fusion PearPC and iFusion The latter ran Classic Mac OS with a PowerPC coprocessor accelerator card Using this method has been said to equal or better the speed of a Macintosh with the same processor especially with respect to the k series due to real Macs running in MMU trap mode hampering performance br Apple s initial version of Rosetta is a PowerPC emulator allowing Intel based Macs to run PowerPC Mac OS X applications but is unable to run non Carbon Classic Mac OS or earlier applications Rosetta was available for all Intel releases of OS X until version Lion br br br Timeline br br br See also br List of Apple operating systems br
