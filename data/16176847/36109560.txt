expressed her concern that in spite of the new Advertising Identifier Apple didn t disclose details on what the identifier was actually based on She stated I need them to tell me why it s not identifying because as we ve seen from a lot other non identifying pieces of data they can identify you quite easily and that If you re using the opt out Apple may no longer gather information to serve you targeted ads To me that says they may still collect your information to do things other than serve you targeted ads like build databases about you to send you marketing or to sell to third parties br br br Abnormal data usage br Many users reported a higher than normal data usage after upgrading to iOS causing some to be heavily billed for data largely exceeding their data plan Steve
