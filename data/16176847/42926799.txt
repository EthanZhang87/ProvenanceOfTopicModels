interface emphasizing flat graphic design over skeuomorphism following the aesthetic introduced with iOS It is the first major redesign of the OS X user interface since Leopard Other changes include thinner fonts and blurred translucency effects Some icons have been changed to correspond with those of iOS and iOS Yosemite maintains the OS X desktop metaphor br Other design changes include new icons light and dark color schemes and the replacement of Lucida Grande with Helvetica Neue as the default system typeface Yosemite is the only macOS version to use Helvetica Neue as the default typeface as in El Capitan it was again changed this time to Apple s own newly designed San Francisco typeface In Yosemite the Dock is a D translucent rectangular strip instead of a skeuomorphic glass shelf reminiscent of the Dock design used in early versions of OS X through Tiger and in iOS since iOS br br br Continuity br br Many of Yosemite s new features focus on the theme of continuity increasing its integration with other Apple platforms and services such as iOS and iCloud The Handoff functionality allows the operating system to integrate with iOS devices over Bluetooth LE and Wi Fi users can place and answer phone calls using their iPhone as a conduit send and receive text messages activate personal hotspots or load items being worked on in a mobile app such as Mail drafts or Numbers spreadsheets directly into their desktop equivalent br br br Notification Center br Notification Center features a new Today view similar to that in iOS The Today view can display information and updates from various sources along with widgets The widgets in the Today view are similar to those of iOS br br br Photos br As of OS X Photos replaces both iPhoto and Aperture It uses iCloud Photo Library to upload all the user s photos across their devices br br br Other br Spotlight is a more prominent part of the operating system it now displays its search box in the center of the screen and can include results from online sources including Bing Maps and Wikipedia Stock applications such as Safari and Mail have been updated In particular many security features have been added to Safari such as a custom history clearing option that lets users clear history cookies and other data from the previous hour day or two days In addition Apple added DuckDuckGo to its search offerings a non tracking search engine that doesn t store users data Safari allows you to remotely close tabs from an iOS device Safari now supports browsing in private browsing mode with certain windows as opposed to all the windows having to be either in or out of private browsing br The green zoom button on windows now has a different function in applications that support full screen mode Instead of simply enlarging the window the button now enters full screen mode eliminating the full screen button at the top right corner of windows that has been present since Mac OS X Lion However holding the Option key while clicking the zoom button or double clicking on the window chrome continues to invoke the original behavior br JavaScript for Automation JXA is the new system wide support for scripting with JavaScript built upon JavaScriptCore and the Open Scripting Architecture It features an Objective C bridge which enables entire Cocoa applications to be programmed in JavaScript br Along with other framework changes CloudKit was integrated in this release CloudKit functions as a Mobile Backend as a Service MBaaS and is one method for app developers to integrate access to Apple s iCloud servers into their apps br There is a dark mode in System Preferences which makes the Dock and menu bar darker br br br Beta testing br Apple initiated a new public beta program for OS X a practice not seen with its operating systems since s US Mac OS X Public Beta which had preceded the release of Mac OS X v Yosemite is part of the OS X Beta Seed Program a public program that allows the first million users to download and test the Yosemite beta at no charge Beta testers are required to acknowledge the potential risks involved with prerelease software and sign a non disclosure agreement NDA The program began releasing Public Betas on July Six public betas of Yosemite were released br br br Reception br On release Yosemite received positive reviews with users praising the simplified user interface Programmer John Siracusa who had reviewed every OS release wrote for Ars Technica that Yosemite is an aesthetic one way valve switching back to Mavericks after a week or two in Yosemite is like returning to iOS Everything looks embarrassingly chunky glossy and gaudy Macworld s review generally praised Yosemite for its design but noted that it had found WiFi network issues and that Continuity had proved unreliable br Yosemite faced problems with network stability and the discoveryd DNS program Because of this Apple replaced discoveryd with the mDNSResponder system used in Mavericks in Another notable bug experienced on Yosemite was the Unicode of death problem following a similar bug in in which a meaningless Arabic text string could crash applications using the system text display APIs Some users who upgraded to Yosemite complained that the Finder fails to show the contents of folders br Spotlight on Yosemite by default reports the user s current location at the city level and all their search queries to Apple and third parties Reporting by Spotlight can be disabled by the user although even if this is done the Safari web browser will continue to send search terms to Apple unless the function is separately disabled br br br Release history br br br Timeline of Mac operating systems br br br br br br External links br OS X Yosemite at the Wayback
