location for macOS Sierra s default wallpaper Its major new features concern Continuity iCloud and windowing as well as support for Apple Pay and Siri br The first beta of macOS Sierra was released to developers shortly following the WWDC keynote on June The first public beta release followed on July It was released to end users on September as a free upgrade through the Mac App Store and it was succeeded by macOS High Sierra on September br br br System requirements br macOS Sierra requires at least GB of RAM and GB of storage space and is designed to run on the following products br br iMac Late or later br MacBook Late or later br MacBook Air Late or later br MacBook Pro Mid or later br Mac Mini Mid or later br Mac Pro Mid or later br Sierra dropped support for various Macs released from mid to mid the first version of macOS since OS X Mountain Lion released in to do so Support for Xserve was also dropped in Sierra br br br Workarounds for unsupported systems br Developers have created workarounds to install macOS Sierra on some Mac computers that are no longer officially supported as long as they are packed with a CPU that supports SSE This requires using a patch to modify the install image br br br Changes br br br Default wallpaper br The default desktop picture is an image of Lone Pine Peak br br br System features br br br Siri br br The user can access the Siri intelligent assistant via the Dock the menu bar or a keyboard shortcut and results are shown in a window in the upper right corner Siri can send messages search the web find files and adjust settings

br iCloud Drive can upload the user s documents and desktop directories and sync them to other devices The System Information application has a new section that gives the user detailed information about space usage per application or file and provides tools and suggestions for freeing up space For instance the user can let the system upload old files to iCloud Drive and remove their local copies keeping them available on demand in Finder It can also remove old files from trash automatically iTunes can delete watched purchased films and TV programs from its library br br br Auto Unlock and Universal Clipboard br Building upon Continuity an umbrella term for features that facilitate the communication between Apple devices using Bluetooth and Wi Fi Sierra adds two features With Auto Unlock the user can unlock their user account by holding a paired Apple Watch close to the device Time of flight is used to prevent relay attacks Auto Unlock requires a Mac that was introduced in or later With Universal Clipboard the user can share the clipboard for cut copy and paste between macOS Sierra and iOS devices including text and rich content such as pictures or videos br br br Tabs and Picture in Picture br Applications that support multiple windows can support multiple tabs within a single window allowing the user to keep windows organized similarly to Safari With Picture in Picture videos can be played in a window that follows the user across the system br br br Apple File System br Apple released a preview of a new file system in Sierra called Apple File System APFS to overcome the limitations of HFS Plus APFS is intended for solid state drives and flash memory and adopts several features found in modern file systems such as snapshots and cloning as well as native support for features that Apple already provides in HFS Plus through supplementary software such as file system encryption and TRIM support The file system was released in macOS High Sierra br br br Night Shift br br Night Shift is new in macOS with the same functionality as its iOS counterpart Night Shift reduces blue light at night to aid sleep This can be scheduled in the System Preferences app in the Displays menu and can be toggled on or off in the Notification Center or using Siri br Since this feature relies on the Metal framework Night Shift is not available on all systems that support macOS Sierra br br br Application features br br br Photos br Apple says it has improved the face recognition of the Photos application adding object and scene recognition It groups similar pictures together using faces locations and object recognition to create memories Memories contain picture slideshows with transitions and music selected by the algorithm which can be modified to the user s liking The People album organizes photos by the people in them and Places shows all photos on a world map br br br Safari and Apple Pay br Safari provides an extension point which enables developers to bundle Safari extensions within their Cocoa applications and communicate with them directly from the applications Safari conceals the presence of installed legacy plug ins such as Adobe Flash Player Java applets Microsoft Silverlight and QuickTime from websites and requires the user to enable a specific plug in on a per use or per website basis br Apple Pay allows vendors to embed an Apple Pay button on their websites In Safari users can click the Apple Pay button to check out then complete a purchase using an iPhone or Apple Watch Apple Pay requires a Mac that supports Continuity or later models and either an iPhone or later with iOS or an Apple Watch with watchOS br br br Messages br The Messages app adds aesthetic effects to messages such as three times bigger emojis and click back with hearts or thumbs up on a message bubble The ability to play YouTube videos and preview links in a conversation was introduced Users can view interactive content added to iMessage in iOS The app also allows you to turn on or off read receipts on a conversation by conversation basis br br br iTunes br Apple Music within iTunes has been redesigned making it simpler to find favorite songs and discover new ones A new For You tab has been added which suggests new music the user might like similar to the existing Genius A refined MiniPlayer with the ability to view lyrics while listening has also been introduced br br br Notes br The Notes app allows the user to share and collaborate on notes This is done by clicking on a share button at the top of the window br br br Other changes br Disk Utility regains the ability to format and manage RAID sets after it was removed in El Capitan br Finder has an option to show folders always at the top of the view hierarchy for instance in list views br Mail adds a control to the top of email lists to quickly filter them for instance by read status or the presence of attachments br inch Retina MacBook Pros now default to integer scaled over nearest neighbor scaled resolutions to fit more content br br br Security improvements br br br Gatekeeper br macOS Sierra slightly changes the Gatekeeper user interface and adds two new mechanisms A new default in System Preferences hides the Anywhere option which allows the user to disable the mechanism and execute programs from any source without needing to approve each new one individually br The first new mechanism allows developers to code sign disk images that can be verified as a unit by the system This allows developers to guarantee the integrity of external files that are distributed alongside the application bundle on the same disk image An attacker could infect these external files with malicious code and with them exploit a vulnerability in the application without having to break the signature of the application bundle itself By signing the disk image the developer can prevent tampering and force an attacker to repackage the files onto a new disk image requiring a valid developer certificate to pass Gatekeeper without a warning br The second new mechanism is path randomization which executes application bundles from a random hidden path and prevents them from accessing external files relative to their location To avoid this the developer has to distribute the application bundle and its external files on a signed disk image or in a signed installer package The user can avoid this mechanism by moving the application bundle without its external files to a new location br br br Directory permissions and sudo br The Unix permissions for writing to the Volumes directory are now restricted to root and no longer world writable Apple expanded System Integrity Protection to Library Application Support com apple TCC a directory that contains a list of applications that are allowed to control the computer and restricts write access to programs which were signed with an Apple private entitlement The file hosting service Dropbox has been criticized for manipulating the directory to add their Dropbox application to the list rather than asking the user to do it for them explicitly in System Preferences br The sudo command line utility with which a user can execute a command as another user typically as root is configured with the tty tickets flag by default restricting the session timeout to the terminal session such as a window or tab in which the user authenticated the program br br br Removed functionality br Sierra removes support for garbage collection from the Objective C runtime a memory management system that was added in Mac OS X Leopard version and declared deprecated in favor of Automatic Reference Counting in OS X Mountain Lion version Applications that have been compiled with garbage collection will no longer run br Apple removed native support for the VPN protocol PPTP and made recommendations for alternatives that it considers more secure br The battery s time remaining estimate was removed in the update after complaints of the battery life of MacBook Pros br The Game Center app has been removed However the service still exists br br br Reinstallation br Following the download of macOS Sierra from the Mac App Store the installer does not show under a user s Purchased tab in the Mac App Store app Users can still re download the Sierra installer by visiting the macOS Sierra page on the Mac App Store br br br Reception br macOS Sierra has received generally positive reviews Users and critics have praised its functionality including the addition of Siri and support for Apple Pay in Safari Macworld gave it stars out of Engadget gave it a rating of out of praising the new features such as Siri integration Universal Clipboard and Apple Pay while criticizing the unreliability of Auto Unlock that Siri isn t always smart enough and that some of the Messages features are only available on iOS Developers of apps that rely on the PDFKit library built into macOS have complained that radical changes to PDFKit introduced in Sierra are causing instability and potential data corruption br br br Release history br br br Timeline of Mac operating systems br br br br br br External
