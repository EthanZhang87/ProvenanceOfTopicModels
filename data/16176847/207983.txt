The PowerOpen Environment POE created in from the AIM alliance is an open standard for running a Unix based operating system on the PowerPC computer architecture br br br History br The AIM alliance was announced on October yielding the historic first technology partnership between Apple and IBM One of its many lofty goals was to somehow eventually merge Apple s user friendly graphical interface and desktop applications market with IBM s highly scalable Unix server market allowing the two companies to enter what Apple believed to be an emerging general desktop open systems market This was touched upon by Apple s November announcement of A UX The upcoming A UX never actually released would target the PowerOpen Environment ABI merge features of IBM s AIX variant of Unix into A UX and use the OSF kernel from the Open Software Foundation A UX would serve as an important migration path to this new system making Unix and System applications compliant with PowerOpen A UX and AIX were intended to run on a variety of IBM s POWER and PowerPC hardware and on Apple s PowerPC based hardware br br PowerOpen will be the operating system for PowerPC Mac owners who need to run Unix based applications Apple agreed to provide IBM with the technology needed to allow standard Macintosh applications starting with the Finder to run under the new AIX much as they do under A UX today Apple will apply the PowerOpen label to the new version of A UX that results from the deal IBM will do likewise with the new AIX br The need for the POE reduced due to the increasing availability of Unix like operating systems on PowerPC such as Linux distributions and AIX The PowerOpen Association was formed to promote the POE and test for conformance and disbanded in That year other AIM elements disbanded br br br Overview br The POE contains API and ABI specifications The presence of the ABI specification in the POE distinguishes it from other open systems such as POSIX and XPG since it allows platform independent binary compatibility which is otherwise typically limited to particular hardware Derived from AIX the POE conforms to industry open standards including POSIX XPG and Motif br The POE is hardware bus independent System implementations can range from laptop computers to supercomputers It requires a multi user multitasking operating system It provides networking support an X Window System extension a Macintosh Application Services extension and Motif br Macintosh Application Services MAS was an Apple software product intended to run existing Mac applications alongside other applications in the X environment including those written for the x architecture Also supporting Mac applications that had been ported to PowerPC MAS was described as Apple s key contribution to the PowerOpen alliance and was demonstrated running Mac applications including a QuickTime movie on three different workstation platforms It was an optional component in the PowerOpen architecture br br br See also br PowerPC Reference Platform br br br br br PowerOpen ABI specification br This article was originally based on material from the Free On line Dictionary of Computing and is used under the GFDL
