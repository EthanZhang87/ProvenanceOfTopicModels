GS OS is an operating system developed by Apple Computer for its Apple IIGS personal computer It provides facilities for accessing the file system controlling input output devices loading and running program files and a system allowing programs to handle interrupts and signals It uses ProDOS as its primary filing system GS OS is a component of Apple IIGS System Software versions through and was the first true bit operating system for the IIGS br br br Features br br br Speed optimization br The advantage of GS OS over its predecessor the ProDOS operating system is that it was written entirely in bit code for the processor used in the IIGS rather than primarily in bit machine code that does not take advantage of the IIGS s unique features This in turn allows GS OS to offer vast speed optimizations loading time disk access screen updates compared with the previous OS and provided room to incorporate many features of other Apple operating systems including Apple III Apple SOS the Macintosh System as well as concepts and features that would later appear in future Macintosh System Software releases e g proportional scrollbars thermometer progress bars br br br New features and enhancements br In addition to continued enhancements to the IIGS Finder and loadable fonts GS OS offered plug in device drivers modem printer etc a thermometer progress display AppleShare support File System Translators for accessing foreign file formats disk caching and support for storage devices up to Gigabytes It also extends the ProDOS file system to provide for resource forks on files similar to those used on the Apple Macintosh which allows for programs to be written in a more flexible way The newly included Apple Advanced Disk Utilities and Apple IIGS Installer helped facilitate partitioning formatting and installing software and drivers with visual ease A command line development environment called APW Apple Programmer s Workshop is available much like the Macintosh Programmer s Workshop br br br File System Translators br GS OS includes a facility known as file system translators FSTs which allows it to support multiple on disk file systems in a manner transparent to application programs and to the user a feature not found in ProDOS or most other microcomputer operating systems at the time While GS OS natively uses the ProDOS file system from which it must be booted it also fully supports HFS used by Mac OS Other file system translators include those for MS DOS High Sierra ISO Apple DOS and Pascal albeit read only full read write support had been planned but was never completed br br br Releases br Source br br br ProDOS GS OS predecessor br System ProDOS v System ProDOS v br System ProDOS v System ProDOS v br System ProDOS v br br br GS OS br System GS OS v br System GS OS v System GS OS v System GS OS v br System GS OS v br System GS OS v br System GS OS v br System GS OS v br br br Unofficial versions br System GS OS v System GS OS v br System GS OS v br br br See also br Apple DOS br Apple II br Apple IIGS br Juiced GS The last remaining Apple II publication br KansasFest An annual convention for Apple II users br Macintosh Finder br ProDOS br br br br br br External links br Apple IIgs GS OS Screenshots and details br GS OS at the Apple II History Museum br A Central com Archived at the Wayback Machine Apple II news and downloads
