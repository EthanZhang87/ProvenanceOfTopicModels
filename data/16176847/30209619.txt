The iPad is a tablet designed developed and marketed by Apple Inc Compared to the first iPad as the second model in the iPad line it gained a faster dual core A processor a lighter build structure with a flat rather than curved back and was the first iPad to feature VGA front facing and p rear facing cameras designed for FaceTime video calling br The device was available initially with three storage sizes and GB and two varying connectivity options Wi Fi only or Wi Fi and cellular Each variation of the device is available with either a black or white front glass panel However upon the release of the rd generation iPad in March only the GB variation remained available br The product became available in March through May br The device received generally positive reception from various blogs and publications Although it was praised for its hardware improvement such as the new Apple A chip the software restriction on the iPad and iOS in general drew criticism from various technology commentators The device sold well in its first month of sales with million units sold and million units were sold in the third quarter of br A popular product with a lower screen resolution and performance than the two Retina models that followed it but a lighter build and longer battery life it remained in the Apple line up as an entry level iPad model for three years until March latterly with a silent upgrade to a die shrunk version of the A processor Its basic design formed the core of the first iPad Mini which had the same screen pixel count and similar features at a smaller size br Originally shipped with iOS with the release of iOS the iPad became the only device powered by the Apple A to have received six major versions of iOS br br br History br br Apple sent invitations to journalists on February for a media event on March On March CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the device at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts despite being on medical leave Upon the announcement of the iPad the original iPad was discontinued from sales online and at Apple authorized retail stores br Apple began selling the iPad on its website on March and in its U S retail stores at pm local time on that date Many stores in major cities such as New York sold out within hours Online shipping delays had increased to three to four weeks on Sunday and four to five weeks by Tuesday br The iPad was released internationally in other countries on March The countries included Australia Austria Belgium Canada Czech Republic Denmark Finland France Germany Greece Iceland Italy Ireland Hungary Luxembourg Mexico Netherlands New Zealand Norway Poland Portugal Spain Sweden Switzerland and the United Kingdom br The April release date for Japan was postponed due to the earthquake and tsunami which struck the nation on March The iPads were delayed due to the NAND flash storage chip used in the iPads being created by Toshiba which was affected by the earthquake and tsunami thus resulting in the suspension of operations for an indefinite period of time The slowdown caused analysts to downgrade Apple s stock br The iPad was later released in Hong Kong India South Korea Singapore Philippines Malaysia and other countries including Japan on April It was then released in numerous other nations which include China Estonia Thailand Brazil Russia and Taiwan on two major release dates May and br The and GB models were discontinued on March upon the introduction of the third generation iPad The GB Wi Fi and GB Wi Fi G models were discontinued on March br br br Features br br br Software br br In late March the iPad was released alongside iOS which primarily introduced Airplay Mirroring and Home Sharing among other features On October upon the release of the iPhone s the iPad was upgradable to the iOS firmware update which brought over new user features to iOS compatible devices including Notification Center iMessage Reminders and an updated notifications system using a new banner style instead of the previously used pop up alert style br The iPad comes with several applications by default including Safari Mail Photos Video Music iTunes Store Maps Notes Calendar Photo Booth and Contacts The App Store is also available as a default application it enables users to download from a database of applications the price of these applications is set by the developers Like all iOS devices the iPad can sync music videos apps and photos with a Mac or PC using iTunes although when using iOS and later the user does not have to connect the iPad to the computer iCloud also allows users to backup and sync their data with other compatible iOS devices via the internet Game Center is available as a native social gaming platform on iOS games downloaded via the App Store that have this feature enabled are able to integrate their achievement points high scores and bonus system across all iOS devices into a single accumulative points and social platform Although the tablet is not designed to make phone calls over a cellular network a user can use a wired headset or the built in speaker and microphone and place phone calls over Wi Fi or cellular using a VoIP application br The iPad also adds the ability to run GarageBand iMovie and the iWork apps Pages Keynote and Numbers These applications do not come with the iPad but are instead official applications from Apple sold within the App Store On March after the unveiling of the third generation iPad the firmware of the iPad was upgradable to iOS Scott Rohde a senior Sony executive described the iPad as a game console disguised as a device that can be appropriated in the business workplace br On September almost a week after the announcement of the iPhone iOS was released for numerous iOS devices including the iPad and iPhone s However on iOS not all features are available on the iPad The software upgrade was downloadable as an over the air OTA update package and contains two hundred new features including a mapping software designed by Apple dubbed Apple Maps a Clock app which features a timer stopwatch and alarm and Facebook integration among other new features and tweaks br The iPad is compatible with iOS which was released on September However some features are not available For example like the iPhone the Notification Center and the Control Center use the transparent style instead of the translucent style in later iOS models Also AirDrop which was first released in iOS required the iPad th generation or later br The iPad can run iOS which was released on September making it the first iOS device to run five major versions of iOS including iOS and While the OS runs on the device most of its new features do not work because of relatively aged hardware and therefore its performance is limited Users have also reported numerous problems after receiving the update including the accessibility features and battery related issues Many users speculated that the iPad was going to be dropped from updating to iOS along with the iPhone the same process that happened with the iPhone GS and the iPod Touch fourth generation and earlier models considering that the model was more than years old br It was confirmed on June at Apple s WWDC that the iPad would run iOS making it one of the only iOS devices to run six major versions of iOS As with previous releases though several features were unavailable on the iPad including Siri translucency effects split view slide over and picture in picture multitasking and the Health app iOS is said to feature performance improvements that may help the aging device function more smoothly and initial tests suggest that it did not significantly impact available space Other A based devices will also run iOS including the iPhone s five major iOS versions the iPad Mini four major iOS versions and iPod Touch th generation four major iOS versions br On June with the announcement of iOS Apple dropped support for the iPad due to hardware limitations and performance issues making iOS Wi Fi or iOS Wi Fi Cellular the final version that will run on the device br br br Broadpwn exploit vulnerability br The iPad is one of many computers tablets and mobile devices susceptible to the Broadpwn exploit which was publicized in July Apple quickly released an update for iOS to fix the problem but a fix was never released for iOS or earlier versions of iOS As a result older Apple devices incompatible with iOS including the iPad were left vulnerable indefinitely This has raised concerns of potentially widespread attacks using the exploit particularly in locations of concentrated iPad deployment such as certain primary and secondary schools br br br GPS rollover update br On July Apple released iOS for the CDMA model of the iPad to fix issues caused by the GPS week number rollover The issues would impact accuracy of GPS location and set the device s date and time to an incorrect value preventing connection to HTTPS servers and consequently Apple s servers for activation iCloud and the iTunes and App stores The WiFi model and the GSM model are not affected by the rollover as the WiFi model lacks a GPS chipset and the GSM model uses a different chipset br br br Hardware br br The iPad features an Apple A package on package PoP System on chip SoC which comprises a GHz dual core bit Cortex A CPU MB of RAM and a dual core PowerVR SGX MP GPU Other features include front and rear cameras a three axis gyroscope headset controls proximity and ambient light sensors microphone magnetometer accelerometer and a inch multi touch screen with a maximum resolution of hence resulting in ppi The iPad has four physical switches including a home button near the display that returns the user to the home screen and three plastic physical switches on the sides wake sleep volume up down and a third switch for either screen rotation lock or mute The home button on the iPad is easier to double tap than the previous generation of the iPad Apple reduced the size of the iPad by eliminating the stamped sheet metal frame from the display integrating new thinner glass technology for the touch screen overlay and slightly reducing the space between the display and battery The iPad s screen is thinner lighter and yet stronger than the original iPad s The iPad also supports screen mirroring via the digital AV adapter and through AirPlay as of iOS br The iPad has a W h rechargeable lithium ion polymer battery that lasts hours like the original iPad It is charged via USB or included W A power adapter The battery is mm thick smaller than the original and has three cells instead of two The improvements allowed the injection molded plastic support frame to be omitted The W USB power adapter provides x the power of a conventional USB port The tablet has an audio frequency response of Hz to kHz Without third party software it can play the following audio formats HE AAC AAC Protected AAC MP MP VBR Audible formats AEA AAX and AAX ALAC AIFF and WAV br The revised tablet adds front and rear facing cameras which allow FaceTime video calls with other iPad s the third generation iPad iPhone and s fourth generation iPod Touch and Macintosh computers running Mac OS X or later with a webcam The MP front camera shoots VGA quality frame s video and VGA quality still photos The MP back camera can shoot p HD video at frame s and has a times digital zoom Both shoot photo in a fullscreen aspect ratio The rear camera shoots video in widescreen to match the p standard although only the central part of the recording is shown on the screen during recording The forward facing camera shoots in br The Apple A chip doubles processing speed and has graphics processing that is up to nine times faster than the previous iPad However benchtests and hardware assessments performed by various third party news sources and technology blogs indicate that those claims are exaggerated the benchmark assessment conducted by Anandtech showed that the GPU of the iPad is only times faster than that of the original iPad CPU benchmarks conducted on the iPad by iOSnoops indicate a performance increase compared to the original iPad br G versions of the iPad offer CDMA support for customers using the device on a CDMA network or GSM UMTS support for customers using the device on a GSM UMTS network The iPad Wi Fi G model includes an A GPS receiver for tracking the user s location given permission Also the iPad G model includes a plastic cap like band at the top on the back for the G antenna The metallic grille for the microphone is replaced with a matching plastic black grille on the G model br GSM models of iPad use a SIM card while CDMA models use an ESN to connect to the cellular network br The device is lighter and thinner than the original iPad it is thinner than the iPhone by mm The Wi Fi version is lb g Both the GSM and CDMA versions known respectively as the AT T and Verizon versions in the US differ in weight slightly due to the mass difference between the GSM and CDMA cellular radios with the GSM model at lb g and the CDMA model at lb g br The size of the iPad is also less than the original iPad at only in in in mm mm mm compared to the original iPad s size at in in in mm mm mm br After the announcement and release of the third generation iPad the iPad which continued to be available for purchase received a hardware upgrade The upgraded variant of the iPad features a smaller version of the Apple A SoC which is able to reduce battery consumption Benchmark tests conducted by Anandtech concluded that the upgraded variant is able to last longer by at least an hour and a half depending on the task that is conducted on the device The maximum temperature that the device heated up to was also less than original iPad tests conducted by the same organisation revealed that the upgraded variant was able to operate at degree lower when performing intensive tasks Performance difference between the two variants according to Anandtech is negligible br br br Accessories br br The Smart Cover first introduced with the iPad is a screen protector that magnetically attaches to the face of the iPad The cover has three folds which allow it to convert into a stand which is also held together by magnets While original iPad owners could purchase a black case that included a similarly folding cover the Smart Cover is meant to be more minimal easily detachable and protects only the screen Smart Covers have a microfiber bottom that cleans the front of the iPad and wakes up the iPad when the cover is removed There are five different colors of both polyurethane and leather with leather being more expensive than the polyurethane version br Apple offered several more accessories for the iPad most of which were adapters for the proprietary pin dock connector the iPad s only port besides the headphone jack A dock holds the iPad upright at an angle and has a dock connector and audio line out port The iPad can use Bluetooth keyboards that also work with Macs and PCs The iPad can be charged by a standalone power adapter wall charger also used for contemporary iPods and iPhones and a W charger was included with the iPad br br br Reception br The iPad received generally positive reviews praising its Apple A processor and p camera Joshua Topolsky of Engadget said that for those of you who haven t yet made the leap feel free to take a deep breath and dive in the iPad is as good as it gets right now And it s really quite good Jason Snell of Macworld said the following br br Though the iPad is an improvement on the original iPad in numerous ways it s still an evolutionary product not a revolutionary one If you re happy with your current iPad there s no reason to dump it just because there s a shinier newer one This is not to say that millions of people won t do just that I mean shiny If you ve invested in iPad accessories such as a dock or case keep in mind that you probably won t be able to use them with the new iPad br br TechCrunch s MG Siegler stated Let me sum all of this up in a simple way the iPad should you buy one Maybe it depends on a few factors Will you want to buy one Yes Use that information wisely br br br Criticism br The closed and proprietary nature of iOS has garnered criticism particularly by digital rights advocates such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation computer engineer and activist Brewster Kahle Internet law specialist Jonathan Zittrain and the Free Software Foundation who protested the iPad s introductory event and have targeted the iPad with their Defective by Design campaign Competitor Microsoft via a PR spokesman has also criticized Apple s control over its platform br br br Technical problems br At issue are restrictions imposed by the design of iOS namely DRM intended to lock purchased media to Apple s platform the development model requiring a yearly subscription to distribute apps developed for the iOS the centralized approval process for apps as well as Apple s general control and lockdown of the platform itself Particularly at issue is the ability for Apple to remotely disable or delete apps at will Some in the tech community have expressed concern that the locked down iOS represents a growing trend in Apple s approach to computing particularly Apple s shift away from machines that hobbyists can tinker with and note the potential for such restrictions to stifle software innovation br Some iPad users reported performance issues when running iOS Apple improved performance on the iPad and the iPhone S on the iOS update br br br Commercial reception br During the first weekend of sale more than one million units were sold Soon after the first weekend Ashok Kumar a technology analyst for a financial firm predicted that Apple would sell million iPad s in Investment banking firm Piper Jaffray monitored the initial sales of the iPad and reported that of all iPad sales were to first time iPad buyers with of buyers owning a PC compared to the initial buyers of the original iPad where only of buyers owned a PC units were sold on auction site eBay in its first two weeks of release When the iPhone S was released rumors about the third generation iPad caused a decline in iPad sales Official figures released in the fourth quarter of indicate that Apple sold million iPads in the third quarter a increase from the third quarter of The product helped create newer larger markets for Apple in south east Asia br br br In space br In two iPad tablets were taken to the International Space Station after being approved Other Apple products that were taken to ISS include the iPod and also two iPhone phones The other personal computing system aboard ISS were various versions of the ThinkPad laptop IBM later Lenovo brand br Some of the applications the iPads were used for include Angry Birds
