Palm OS also known as Garnet OS was a mobile operating system initially developed by Palm Inc for personal digital assistants PDAs in Palm OS was designed for ease of use with a touchscreen based graphical user interface It was provided with a suite of basic applications for personal information management Later versions of the OS were extended to support smartphones The software appeared on the company s line of Palm devices while several other licensees have manufactured devices powered by Palm OS br Following Palm s purchase of the Palm trademark the operating system was renamed Garnet OS In ACCESS introduced the successor to Garnet OS called Access Linux Platform additionally in the main licensee of Palm OS Palm Inc switched from Palm OS to webOS for their forthcoming devices br br br Creator and ownership br Palm OS was originally developed under the direction of Jeff Hawkins at Palm Computing Inc Palm was later acquired by U S Robotics Corp which in turn was later bought by Com which made the Palm subsidiary an independent publicly traded company on March br In January Palm set up a wholly owned subsidiary to develop and license Palm OS which was named PalmSource PalmSource was then spun off from Palm as an independent company on October Palm then called palmOne became a regular licensee of Palm OS no longer in control of the operating system br In September PalmSource announced that it was being acquired by ACCESS br In December Palm gained perpetual rights to the Palm OS source code from ACCESS With this Palm can modify the licensed operating system as needed without paying further royalties to ACCESS Together with the May acquisition of full rights to the Palm brand name only Palm can publish releases of the operating system under the name Palm OS br As a consequence on January ACCESS announced a name change to their current Palm OS operating system now titled Garnet OS br br br OS overview br Palm OS was a proprietary mobile operating system Designed in for Palm Computing Inc s new Pilot PDA it has been implemented on a wide array of mobile devices including smartphones wrist watches handheld gaming consoles barcode readers and GPS devices br Palm OS versions earlier than run on Motorola Freescale DragonBall processors From version onwards Palm OS runs on ARM architecture based processors br The key features of the current Palm OS Garnet are br br Simple single tasking environment to allow launching of full screen applications with a basic common GUI set br Monochrome or color screens with resolutions up to x pixel br Handwriting recognition input system called Graffiti br HotSync technology for data synchronization with desktop computers br Sound playback and record capabilities br Simple security model Device can be locked by password arbitrary application records can be made private br TCP IP network access br Serial port USB infrared Bluetooth and Wi Fi connections br Expansion memory card support br Defined standard data format for personal information management applications to store calendar address task and note entries accessible by third party applications br Included with the OS is also a set of standard applications with the most relevant ones for the four mentioned PIM operations br br br Version history and technical background br Manufacturers are free to implement different features of the OS in their devices or even add new features This version history describes the officially licensed version from Palm PalmSource ACCESS br All versions prior to Palm OS are based on top of the AMX kernel licensed from KADAK Products Ltd While this kernel is technically capable of multitasking the terms and conditions of that license specifically state that Palm may not expose the API for creating manipulating tasks within the OS br br br Palm OS br Palm OS is the original version present on the Pilot and It was introduced in March br Version features the classic PIM applications Address Date Book Memo Pad and To Do List Also included is a calculator and the Security tool to hide records for private use br Palm OS does not differentiate between RAM and file system storage Applications are installed directly into RAM and executed in place As no dedicated file system is supported the operating system depends on constant RAM refresh cycles to keep its memory The OS supports x monochrome output displays User input is generated through the Graffiti handwriting recognition system or optionally through a virtual keyboard The system supports data synchronization to another PC via its HotSync technology over a serial interface The latest bugfix release is version br br br Palm OS br Palm OS was introduced on March with the PalmPilot Personal and Professional This version adds TCP IP network network HotSync and display backlight support The last bugfix release is version br Two new applications Mail and Expense are added and the standard PIM applications have been enhanced br br br Palm OS br Palm OS was introduced on March with the launch of the Palm III series This version adds IrDA infrared and enhanced font support This version also features updated PIM applications and an update to the application launcher br Palm OS adds only minor new features like network HotSync support It was introduced with the Palm IIIx and Palm V The last bugfix release is version br Palm OS adds Web Clipping support which is an early Palm specific solution to bring web content to a small PDA screen It was introduced with the Palm VII organizer br Palm OS adds faster HotSync speeds and the ability to do infrared hotsyncing It was introduced with the Palm Vx organizer br Palm OS is the first version to include native bit color support It also adds major convenience features that simplify operation like a context sensitive icon bar or simpler menu activation The datebook application is extended with an additional agenda view This version was first introduced with the Palm IIIc device The latest bugfix release is version br As a companion Palm later offered a Mobile Internet Kit software upgrade for Palm OS This included Palm s Web Clipping software MultiMail which was later renamed to VersaMail Version e mail software handPHONE Version SMS software and Neomar Version WAP browser br br br Palm OS br Palm OS was released with the new Palm m series on March This version adds a standard interface for external file system access such as SD cards External file systems are a radical change to the operating system s previous in place execution Now application code and data need to be loaded into the device s RAM similar to desktop operating system behavior A new Universal Connector with USB support is introduced The previous optional Mobile Internet Kit is now part of the operating system Version adds an attention manager to coordinate information from different applications with several possibilities to get the user s attention including sound LED blinking or vibration bit color screens and different time zones are supported This version also has security and UI enhancements br Palm OS is a bugfix release It was introduced with the launch of the Palm i The later minor OS update to version includes a backport of Graffiti from Palm OS br Palm OS Simplified Chinese Edition is targeted especially for the Chinese market with fully Simplified Chinese support co released with Palm OS No device has been manufactured with this version up to now br br br Palm OS br Palm OS was unveiled by the Palm subsidiary PalmSource in June and first implemented on the Palm Tungsten T It is the first version to support ARM devices and replaced the Kadak AMX kernel with the custom MCK kernel named for its developer that was written in house by Palm Applications written for the prior OS versions use the older DragonBall K instruction set and are supported via the Palm Application Compatibility Environment PACE emulator in Garnet Even with the additional overhead of PACE Palm applications usually run faster on ARM devices than on previous generation hardware New software can take advantage of the ARM processors with small units of ARM code referred to as ARMlets br With a more powerful hardware basis Palm OS adds substantial enhancements for multimedia capabilities High density x screens are supported together with a full digital sound playback and record API Palm s separate Bluetooth stack is added together with an IEEE b Wi Fi stack Secure network connections over SSL are supported The OS can be customized with different color schemes br For Palm OS PalmSource developed and licensed a web browser called PalmSource Web Browser based on ACCESS NetFront browser br Palm OS is mainly a bugfix release first implemented in the Samsung SGH i in March It added support for x resolutions and introduced the new handwriting input system called Graffiti the new input system was prompted by Xerox lawsuit win against Palm Graffiti is based on Jot from CIC The last bugfix release is version br Palm OS Simplified Chinese Edition released in September added full Simplified Chinese support further support for QVGA resolutions and a standard API for virtual Graffiti called Dynamic Input Area This version first shipped on Lenovo s P and P handhelds br Palm OS Garnet added updated Bluetooth libraries and support for multiple screen resolutions ranging from x up to x It first shipped on the Treo in November This version also introduced the Garnet moniker to distinguish it from Palm OS Cobalt The last bugfix release is version br Garnet OS dropped the Palm moniker and as of is the current version developed by ACCESS This version is dedicated for use inside the Garnet VM virtual machine br Garnet VM was announced and released by ACCESS in November as a core part of the Access Linux Platform and as an emulator allowing Nokia Internet Tablets to run applications written for the Garnet OS In June ACCESS release Garnet VM version a k a Garnet VM Beta b br br br Palm OS Cobalt br Palm OS Cobalt was the designated successor for Palm OS It was introduced on February but is no longer offered by ACCESS see next section Palm OS was renamed to Palm OS Cobalt to make clear that this version was initially not designated to replace Palm OS which adopted the name Palm OS Garnet at the same time br Palm OS Cobalt introduced modern operating system features to an embedded operating system based on a new kernel with multitasking and memory protection a modern multimedia and graphic framework derived from Palm s acquired BeOS new security features and adjustments of the PIM file formats to better cooperate with Microsoft Outlook br Palm OS Cobalt presented standard communication libraries for telecommunication Wi Fi and Bluetooth connectivity Despite other additions it failed to interest potential licensees to Palm OS Cobalt br br br Third party OS enhancements br Several licensees have made custom modifications to the operating system These are not part of the official licensed version br br Palm developed a Bluetooth API for external Bluetooth SDIO Cards for Palm OS devices The Bluetooth stack was later included in Palm OS br Palm added a virtual graffiti input area API especially for their Tungsten T device This API was later superseded by the official Dynamic Input Area API in Palm OS br Palm added the Non Volatile File System in Palm OS and used Flash for storage instead of DRAM preventing data loss in the event of battery drain However this fundamentally changed the way programs were executed from the Execute in Place system that Palm OS traditionally used and has been the source of many compatibility problems requiring many applications to add explicit NVFS support for correct operation br For their camera equipped devices Palm added the CameraLib API br Sony added a library to support JogDial input available on their CLI organizers br br br Modernization br For several years PalmSource had been attempting to create a modern successor for Palm OS and have licensees implement it Although PalmSource shipped Palm OS Cobalt to licensees in January none adopted it for release devices PalmSource made major improvements to Palm OS Cobalt with the release of Palm OS Cobalt in September to please licensees but even the new version did not lead to production devices br In December PalmSource announced a new OS strategy With the acquisition of the mobile phone software company China Mobilesoft PalmSource planned to port Palm OS on top of a Linux kernel while still offering both Palm OS Garnet and Palm OS Cobalt This strategy was revised in June when still no device with Palm OS Cobalt was announced PalmSource announced it was halting all development efforts on any product not directly related to its future Linux based platform br With the acquisition of PalmSource by ACCESS Palm OS for Linux was changed to become the Access Linux Platform which was first announced in February The initial versions of the platform and software development kits for the Access Linux Platform were officially released in February As of January the Access Linux Platform had then yet to ship on any devices however development kits then existed and public demonstrations had been showcased br Palm Inc the main licensee of Palm OS Garnet did not license Access Linux Platform for their own devices Instead Palm developed another Linux based operating system called Palm webOS On February Palm CEO Ed Colligan said there would be no additional Palm OS devices excepting the Centro being released to other carriers Palm was focusing on Palm webOS and Windows Mobile devices On April Palm announced the availability of a Palm OS emulator for its webOS br br br Built in applications br Palm OS licensees decide which applications are included on their Palm OS devices Licensees can also customize the applications br br br Standard Palm OS applications br Note On the newer models the standard PIM apps Address Date Book Memo Pad and ToDos were replaced by their improved counterparts Contacts Calendar Memos and Tasks br The Palm s Address program stores contact information keyed by any of several user definable categories Entries are displayed and sorted in last name first name order this can be changed only to Company Last Name order There are five slots for phone or e mail each of which may be designated Work Home Fax Other E mail Main Pager or Mobile the slot designations cannot be changed The newer Contacts app adds the following features several addresses new fields Website Birthday More phone numbers Instant Messaging with quick connect br br Calc turns the Palm into a standard function pocket calculator with three shades of purple and blue buttons contrasting with the two red clear buttons It supports square root and percent keys and has one memory br It also has an option to display a running history of the calculations much like the paper tape calculators that were once common br br Date Book shows a daily or weekly schedule or a simple monthly view The daily schedule has one line per hour between user selected begin and end times Clicking on an empty line creates a new event Empty lines are crowded out by actual events whose start and stop times are shown by default bracketed in the left margin The newer Calendar app adds the following features New Day view use of categories for events event location event can span midnight event details birthdays as timeless events It supports time zone designation for events a feature lacking in some more recent competitors br An event or appointment can be heralded by an alarm any number of minutes hours or days before it begins These alarms sound even when the unit is switched off br Appointments can recur in a specified number of days weeks months or years and can contain notes br Expense tracks common business expenses No totals are calculated on the Palm The user must sync with a host computer and view the expense data in a worksheet templates for Microsoft Excel are supplied br br HotSync integrates with the user s PC Usually activated by a press of the physical HotSync button on the Palm s cradle a dock station this application communicates with various conduits on the desktop PC to install software backup databases or merge changes made on the PC or the handheld to both devices It can communicate with the PC through a physical connection USB on newer models Bluetooth or IrDA wireless connections and direct network connections on devices with networking capability br In addition to the conduits provided by the licensee developers can create their own conduits for integration with other Palm OS applications and desktop products For example a time tracking package could provide a conduit to communicate information between Palm OS and Windows executables br A Backup conduit included with the HotSync software backs up and restores if necessary most of the data on a Palm OS device This allows users to hard reset their Palm thus clearing all of the data with few noticeable consequences This also allows users to migrate to new Palm devices of the same Palm OS version a feature that is helpful to those who lose or damage their device br Some models of Palm keep their data storage in volatile memory and require constant power to maintain their memory Although these handhelds attempt to save the contents of memory in low battery situations by not turning on leaving a dead handheld for an extended period of time can cause this reserve power to be used up and the contents of storage memory to be lost Some later Palms use NVRAM or microdrive for storage br Memo Pad can hold notes of up to characters each the newer Memos app increases field size from to kB Memos are ordered in two ways alphabetically and manually which allows the user to choose the order of the memos and memos can be grouped in user configurable categories Memo Pad is for text only not for drawings and text can be entered using the Graffiti alphabet using hardware or software keyboards or using the paste function When Palm devices first became available some Palm users started to create and exchange Memo Pad documents containing generally useful information which came to be known as Memoware br br To do list creates personal reminders and prioritizes the things the user has to do br Each To Do List item may also have a priority categories to organize and view items in logical groups attached Note to add more description and clarification of the task To Do List item can be sorted by due date priority or category The newer Tasks app features the following improvements new interface repeating tasks alarms etc br Preferences also referred to as Prefs shows program files with a special preference panel type which are not shown by the normal launcher Programs can be changed by switching the appl type to panl and vice versa Palm OS contains approximately preference panels by default and new preference panels can be added just like any other application br Preference panels allow users to manage a number of settings including Graffiti settings sound settings text shortcuts network settings and the system time br Security which is a panel on newer Palm OS devices is used to configure Palm OS s security settings These include the password needed to display hidden records and unlock the device when locked as well as set up an automatic lockdown time or inactivity threshold On the PC only Palm Desktop honors this password but other PC programs can view everything in other words all the data protected by this password can be seen by anyone opening the dat files using a text editor or word processor br br br Common third party core OS applications br Starting with Palm OS version Palm created customized versions of the common PIM application Some new features have been added e g support for Address categories Ringtone associations to users longer memo texts etc They were also renamed to reflect designations from Microsoft Outlook thus Address became Contacts Datebook became Calendar Memo Pad became Memos and To do list became Tasks br Blazer is a web browser for Palm handhelds The versions and run on Palm OS or higher handhelds but they needed a proxy server which has been shut down so they can no longer be used Version is used on the Treo smartphone The current version of Blazer is Blazer which is compliant with most major standards It is generally bundled with newer smartphones and newer Palm devices capable of accessing the Internet br br Palm s Note Pad can be used for quick drawings With neat handwriting words will fit on one page for more text Memo Pad is the better choice There are three sizes of pen width plus an eraser and a background color change feature in some models It is possible to draw a very simple map The more advanced desktop version saves the Memo pad drawings to the desktop br As of most new Palm handhelds include Photos which creates a digital photo album used to view pictures on a Palm OS device As with all the other photo programs photos can be beamed to other mobile devices Each photo can be labeled and organized into separate photo albums A slideshow can also be shown for a specific album and each photo in the album will be shown full screen br Photos can be edited with the Palm Photos PC software Windows only and when the photos are transferred to the handheld they will contain all changes made to the photo br The Palm Photos software is available in the Zire Tungsten C Tungsten E Tungsten T Tungsten T and several others br With the support for Video Palm Photos was later renamed to Media and even later to Pics Videos br Some models feature the ability to make voice recordings which are synced using the Voice conduit and can be viewed on a desktop with the Voice Memo application which is part of the Palm Desktop Suite br br br Third party applications br There are many successful applications that can be installed on a Palm OS device As of there were more than third party applications available for the Palm OS platform which have various licensing types including open source and various closed licensing schemes such as freeware shareware and traditional pay up front purchase br HackMaster is an extension manager for Palm OS that includes several patches improving OS features Other third party OS extensions also require HackMaster to work br In November the Internet Archive launched Palm OS applications in its archives that can be accessed through a browser The applications also launch CloudpilotEmu an emulator for the PalmPilot Palm OS when accessed br br br Application development br Palm OS Garnet applications are primarily coded in C C Two officially supported compilers exist a commercial product CodeWarrior Development Studio for Palm OS and an open source tool chain called prc tools based on an old version of gcc CodeWarrior is criticized for being expensive and is no longer being developed whereas PRC Tools lacks several of CodeWarrior s features A version of PRC Tools is included in a free Palm OS Developer Suite PODS br OnBoardC is a C compiler assembler linker and programming editor that runs on the Palm itself br Palm OS Cobalt applications are also coded in a variation of gcc but the Cobalt compilers have fewer limitations br There are development tools available for Palm programming that do not require low level programming in C C such as PocketC PocketC Architect CASL AppForge Crossfire which uses Visual Basic Visual Basic NET or C Handheld Basic Pendragon Forms Satellite Forms and NSBasic Palm Visual Basic like languages A Java Virtual Machine was previously available for the Palm OS platform however on January Palm Inc announced that it would no longer be available Palm Inc further said There is no alternate Java Virtual Machine that we are aware of for Palm OS Waba and a derivative of it SuperWaba provide a Java like virtual machine and programming language A version of the Lua language called Plua is also available for Palm however due to the fact that it requires an additional runtime to be installed along with the application it is only used for mainstream applications by a minority of software companies Quartus Forth is an ISO ANSI Standard Forth compiler that runs on the Palm itself It also has an interactive console for dynamic development and debugging br Three environments allow programming in Pascal for Palm OS The free PP Compiler runs directly on the handheld computer while PocketStudio is a Delphi like IDE for Windows Computers that has a visual form designer and generates PRC files for being transferred to handhelds via HotSync The third option was HSPascal developed by Danish developer Christen Fihl based on his experience with the High Speed Pascal compiler for various bit computer systems including the Commodore Amiga br As Palm has no connection drivers that enable the transfer of data with a server DBMS Oracle mySQL MS SQL Server the programmer can use Middleware software that enables this connectivity br A roughly R RS compatible implementation of Scheme LispMe provides the Palm platform with a GPL licensed onboard Lisp REPL with some Palm OS specific adaptations but although it is functionally a compiler it does not produce code that operates outside the development environment so its use is restricted to prototyping br br br Legal issues br Palm OS has been involved in various lawsuits over the years br br Xerox vs Palm Computing In Xerox was granted U S patent covering the Unistroke input system developed by David Goldberg Xerox PARC in Xerox filed suit against Palm then U S Robotics alleging that Palm s Graffiti infringed on this patent The Palm OS switch from Graffiti to Graffiti was triggered in part by Palm losing this lawsuit to Xerox The patent was invalidated in May due to prior art developed at Bell Laboratories in br Pilot Pen Corporation vs Palm Computing The original name for Palm OS handhelds was Pilot However a lawsuit from Pilot Pen Corporation forced a name change to PalmPilot then eventually to Palm br Palm vs Microsoft In Microsoft planned to name the next version of their handheld computing platform Palm PC Palm filed suit against Microsoft forcing the name change to first Palm sized PC and later Pocket PC br E Pass Technologies vs Palm Microsoft and HP In E Pass Technologies filed suit against Palm alleging that its handhelds infringed on an E Pass s patent for a multi function credit card sized computer that allows users to securely store account numbers PIN codes etc br NCR vs Handspring and Palm In NCR was granted a patent for a portable e commerce terminal In NCR sued Handspring and Palm This case was ruled without merit in a decision that was upheld on appeal br RIM vs Handspring In Research In Motion makers of the BlackBerry sued Handspring By year end both Handspring and Palm licensed the patents and the suit was dropped br Peer to Peer Systems vs Palm Also in Peer to Peer systems filed lawsuit against Palm that alleges Palm infringed on its patent for wireless gaming This lawsuit was settled as of February br Forgent Networks vs HP Toshiba palmOne etc etc Starting in Forgent Networks began offering licenses for a patent that encumbers JPEG In it filed suit against various companies including palmOne The JPEG or patent has been reviewed by the U S Patent and Trademark Office which has rejected of the claims based on prior art br br br See also br Access Linux Platform planned successor of the Palm OS br Graffiti Palm OS br List of Palm OS devices includes emulators br Memoware br Palm Inc br
