Adobe GoLive br Creative Suite helped InDesign become the dominant publishing software replacing QuarkXPress because customers who purchased the suite for Photoshop and Illustrator received InDesign at no additional cost br Adobe shut down the activation servers for CS in December making it impossible for licensed users to reinstall the software if needed In response to complaints Adobe then made available for download a version of CS that did not require online activation and published a serial number to activate it offline Because there was no mechanism to prevent people who had never purchased a CS license from downloading and activating it it was widely thought that the aging software had become freeware despite Adobe s later explanation that it was intended only for people who had legitimately purchased CS The later shutdown of the CS and CS activation servers was handled differently with registered users given the opportunity to get individual serial numbers for offline activation rather than a published one br br br Creative Suite Production Studio br Adobe Creative Suite Production Studio previously Adobe Video Collection was a suite of programs for acquiring
