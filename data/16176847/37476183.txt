kludge as Apple Mail already implemented the IMAP mailbox synchronization protocol it could also sync notes with minimal additional work In Mountain Lion notes were moved to a separate Notes application Created notes are synced through all the user s Apple devices through the iCloud service Notes can be arranged in folders and pinned to the user s desktop When the application is closed the pinned note still remains Additionally unlike the iPad iPhone and iPod touch versions the OS X Mountain Lion Notes application allows for images to be embedded within notes Originally notes could be created in three different default fonts Noteworthy Marker Felt and Helvetica Users could also add custom fonts by visiting the Show Fonts menu The menu allows users to change text size and format lists choose the alignment left center justify or right assign a writing direction and indent text Attachments images and hyperlinks can also be added to a note Attachments cannot be viewed on iOS devices br Due to the proprietary nature of the data storage mechanism for the Apple Notes apps users of this software may be locked into it without a convenient way to export all Notes data to a
