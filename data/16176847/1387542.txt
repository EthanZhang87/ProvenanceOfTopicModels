a word processor and page layout application When Pages is first opened users are presented with a template chooser which allows them to start with a blank document or with a predesigned template including a basic report letter r sum envelope business card flyers posters cards miscellaneous and a newsletter section of templates that contains placeholder text and images which can be replaced by dragging and dropping photos from the Media Browser The Media Browser provides quick access to media from iTunes iMovie and Photos Users can drag and drop music movies and photos directly into Pages documents from the Media Browser window br Each document window contains a toolbar which gives one click access to commonly used functions such as inserting objects text boxes shapes tables charts and comments uploading the document to iWork com and adding additional pages In addition the document window contains a contextual format bar that allows one click formatting of text and adjustments to images When text is selected the format bar enables users to choose fonts text size and color and to adjust line spacing and alignment When an image is selected the format bar displays tools to adjust opacity show and hide shadow and reflection effects and mask the image A separate Inspector window provides almost all formatting options available for any element in the open document br Beginning in iWork word processing and page layout are two distinct modes In word processing mode Pages supports headers and footers footnotes and outline and list creation Users can collaborate with others on a document Pages tracks changes by users by displaying each person s edits in different colors Users can also add comments alongside the document In page layout mode users have complete control over the position of objects on the page Images and text can be placed anywhere on the canvas br Pages used to feature several other advanced writing tools Many of these have been stripped out of the current version The Full Screen mode introduced in Mac OS X Lion and supported in Pages hid the menubar and toolbars allowing users to focus on a single document without being distracted by other windows on the screen however after Pages full screen mode requires the user to manually hide various panes for focused writing and the page thumbnails pane does not automatically open when the cursor is moved to the left screen edge Earlier versions featured mail merge which automatically populated custom fields with contact data from the Address Book or Numbers apps to create personalized documents For example if a user wanted to send one letter to three people mail merge allowed the user to create a single document with placeholder fields that were populated when printing The mail merge feature was completely removed in version and it did not return until version Tables and charts pasted from Numbers are automatically updated if the original spreadsheet is changed br br br Compatibility br Pages can import some Microsoft Word documents including Word s Office Open XML format Pages and earlier could also import AppleWorks word processing documents and export documents to rich text but those features were removed in Pages and not restored until Pages Pages can still export to PDF EPUB and Microsoft Word DOC formats br Simple and complex mathematical equations can be written for a Pages document with macOS s Grapher offering similar capabilities to Microsoft Equation Editor plus D and D rendering tools only Grapher can use br As of January Pages does not support OpenDocument file format br The only known software other than Pages which can open its files are Apple s iWork productivity suite through Apple s iCloud LibreOffice and Jumpshare Windows users can view and edit Pages files using iWork for iCloud via a web browser The iCloud system can also read Microsoft Word files and convert Pages files to Microsoft Word format Jumpshare can view Pages files br Other than accessing iCloud through a browser no program can officially view or edit a Pages file using Windows or Linux Some content can be retrieved from a document created in Pages because a pages file is a bundle A user can open a pages file in an unpackaging program or by renaming files as zip files in Windows XP and onwards and will find either a jpg or pdf preview in its entirety for viewing and printing although this is only possible if the creator of the pages files elected to include a preview The user will also find a xml file with unformatted text This process can also be used for users of the version of Pages to open documents saved in the version of Pages which are not backward compatible br Pages can also export documents into several formats formatting is generally retained
