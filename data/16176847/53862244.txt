Settings app br br br Reception br iOS received mixed reviews Critics praised the application dock and new multitasking interface on the iPad crediting them for renewing the user experience Further praise was directed at the redesigned Control Center offering customizable toggles criticism was widely focused on its lack of third party app support lack of Wi Fi network selection ability and for difficult usage on small screen sizes along with its instability Critics also noted the new augmented reality development tools but said their impact would depend on third party apps and how fast developers embraced them Praise was also directed at the App Store s redesign and the new file management tools Shortly after release it was discovered that disabling Wi Fi and Bluetooth connections through the Control Center does not disable the respective chips in the device in order to remain functional for background connectivity a design decision sparking criticism for misleading users and reducing security due to potential vulnerabilities in inactive open connections The iOS update added warning messages and a new toggle color to explain the new functions iOS has also received continuous criticism from critics and end users for its perceived stability and performance issues particularly on older devices Apple has issued numerous software updates to address such issues and has dedicated iOS mainly toward stability and performance improvements in response br Two months after release of iOS devices were running iOS a slower adoption rate than previous iOS versions The number increased to of devices by September br Dieter Bohn of The Verge liked the new Control Center setup including customizable toggles and D Touch expandable options writing that there are a few panels that I m really impressed with specifically highlighting the Apple TV remote as a possible replacement of the normal remote He did however note the lack of third party access to Control Center with a hope for support in the future and a lack of Wi Fi network selection ability He praised the screen recording functionality calling it super neat Bohn severely criticized the notifications view writing that he has a very serious disagreement with Apple on how to manage it elaborating that he prefers to use that screen as much as possible while stating that Apple s philosophy is that I m trying way too hard to control speedy notifications Bohn liked the new Files app new drag and drop functionality on the home screen enabling users to drag multiple apps at once and significantly praised multitasking on iPad Writing that Multitasking on the iPad is a near revelatory experience he enjoyed the application dock and the ability to place up to three apps on the screen at once with more freedom on placement Bohn conceded that It s not as intuitive nor as simple nor sic as easy to manipulate as a traditional windowing system like you ll get on a Mac PC or Chromebook but still praised it for being radically more powerful than what has ever been available on an iPad before Finally Bohn praised Siri for improvements to the voice highlighted augmented reality allowing for incredible games and reiterated an earlier sentiment that iOS is the most ambitious software update from Apple in a very very long time br Macworld s Jason Snell wrote that the hype surrounding iOS is justified Snell praised the new smoother transfer mode of data and settings between an old iPhone and a new iPhone referring to the previous experience of doing it manually as a frustrating exercise in entering in passwords repeatedly while tapping through a long series of questions about activating or deactivating numerous iOS features He also praised the Control Center design calling it a great upgrade though also highlighting the inability to easily switch Wi Fi networks Snell noted that the App Store s design had been unchanged for years but received a full redesign in iOS and wrote that Apple s commitment to editorial pages was impressive making the App Store a richer more fun experience Regarding the introduction of augmented reality he stated that most apps using it were bad though some also mind blowingly good adding that the huge potential depended on how third party apps were using it Snell also praised improvements to the iPad experience including multitasking and drag and drop across apps the latter of which he stated actually surpasses my expectations due to ease of use His review summarization states that iOS is Apple s most ambitious and impressive upgrade in years br Romain Dillet of TechCrunch focused mostly on the iPad in his review writing that iOS turns your iPad into a completely different machine with much more efficient multitasking and improved ease of access with the application dock He also praised the design overhaul of the App Store calling it a huge improvement compared to the previous App Store and also highlighted design changes in other apps including a huge bold header with the name of the app or section Although he acknowledged that Many tech friends have told me that they hate this change Dillet stated that I think most people will like it It s visually pleasing and distinctive He stated that augmented reality will become more relevant in the days following the iOS release as third party developers incorporate features into their apps and praised Apple for creating the ARKit development tools as it makes it much easier to implement augmented reality features In conclusion Dillet wrote that Ten years ago iOS started as a constrained operating system It is now one of the biggest digital playgrounds br Devindra Hardawar of Engadget stated that the focus of iOS was all about transforming iOS into something more desktop like with many enhancements for iPad while leaving the iPhone a bit behind He had mixed feelings about the Control Center writing that on small phone screen sizes it feels like a jumbled mess and adding that true comfort may only be present with larger screens a troubling situation for owners of non Plus devices However he praised the ability to customize the buttons including removing those the user never uses and the ability to quickly record the screen or enable accessibility features He called the new app designs attractive and favorably pointed out the new app drawer at the bottom of conversations in the Messages app referring to it as a big improvement over the messy interface of last year He praised Siri for an improved voice the Photos app for creating better Memories and new social features in Apple Music though noting the lack of people in his social circle using the service Referencing IKEA s IKEA Place app which uses augmented reality to virtually place objects in a room he significantly praised the performance of the augmented reality technology on iPhone writing that It did a great job of rendering furniture in physical spaces using both the iPhone and even more impressively it ran smoothly on my iPhone S Finally Hardawar also enjoyed new functionality on iPad calling multitasking the application dock and drag and drop dramatic changes and highlighting the particularly useful experience of dragging Internet content directly from the web into the new Files app In summarization he recognized the significant strides made for iPad with iOS writing that it s a shame that iOS doesn t bring more to the table on the iPhone though acknowledging the rise of augmented reality br In November Apple s App Store support page was updated to reflect that of iOS devices were running iOS a slower migration rate than for the release of iOS the year prior which saw user adoption by October The number increased to of devices by December br br br Design inconsistencies and software bugs br In September Jesus Diaz of Fast Company criticized design details in iOS and Apple s built in apps not adhering to Apple s user interface guidelines Headers not being aligned properly between different apps elements not being centered and different colors and sizing caused Diaz to write that When it comes to software Apple s attention to detail is crumbling away However he also looked back in history mentioning that Apple Music s original design a lack of optical typography alignment in the Calendar app and previously fixed iOS design mistakes being ported to the macOS software had established that This inconsistency and lack of attention to detail are not new at Apple He firmly stated Perhaps this is inevitable given the monumental task of having to update the operating system every year But for a company that claims to have an obsessive attention to detail this is not acceptable br In November Gizmodo s Adam Clark Estes wrote extensively on software bugs and product imperfections experienced while using iOS Estes pointed to issues such as keyboard covering up messages and a disappearing reply field in the Messages app the letter i converting to a Unicode symbol and the screen becoming unresponsive writing that The new operating system has turned my phone into a bug infested carcass of its former self and the frustration of trying to use it sometimes makes me want to die too He also wrote on the aspect of technology becoming more advanced and sophisticated explaining that back when the iPhone came out smartphones were a lot simpler The cameras were joyfully crappy The screens were small The number of apps we could download and things we could connect to was paltry compared to today We should expect some bugs I guess More complex pieces of technology contain more points of failure and I m oversimplifying the issue He concluded by theorizing on technological development writing However I am trying to understand exactly how my life with computers veered so dramatically from the days of Windows when nothing worked right to the golden age of the iPhone when everything seemed perfect to now when just a handful of iOS bugs make me feel like the world is falling apart Maybe I m the annoying thing the whiny one who s upset that nothing seems perfect any more Or maybe just maybe Apple is slipping and we were wrong to trust it all along br br br Problems br br br Wi Fi and Bluetooth Control Center toggles br Shortly after iOS was released Vice s Motherboard discovered new behaviors by the Wi Fi and Bluetooth toggles in the Control Center When users tap to turn off the features iOS only disconnects the chips from active connections but does not disable the respective chips in the device The report further states that it s a feature not a bug referencing documentation pages by Apple confirming the new toggle behaviors as a means to disconnect from connections but remain active for AirDrop transfers AirPlay streaming Apple Pencil input handoff and other features Security researcher Andrea Barisani told Motherboard that the new user interface was not obvious at all making the user experience more uncomfortable In October the Electronic Frontier Foundation published an article calling the interface misleading and bad for user security due to a higher risk of security vulnerabilities with Wi Fi and Bluetooth chips activated while not in active use The Foundation recommended that Apple fix the loophole in connectivity writing that It s simply a question of communicating better to users and giving them control and clarity when they want their settings off not off ish br iOS changes this behavior slightly by turning the toggles white and showing a warning message that explains the functions of the toggles in the Control Center when the toggles are turned off br br br Battery drain issues br Some users have experienced battery drain problems after updating to iOS In a poll on its website of to Mac visitors reported decreased battery life after updating to the new operating system However in an article featuring Twitter complaints of battery life Daily Express wrote that honestly this is to be expected It happens every year and it s completely normal Major iOS releases will hammer the battery on your device much faster during the first few days of use with Forbes stating in an article that The days after you install a new version of iOS your iDevice is busy doing all sorts of housekeeping Practically all of your apps have updates so iOS is busy downloading and installing them in the background Additionally after you install a new version of iOS it has to do something called re indexing During this process iOS will comb through all of the data on your device so that it can be cataloged for quick Spotlight searching The article further states that The good news is that both of these things are temporary br Within a week of the launch of the update users began reporting continued issues with this update regarding battery drainage Some of these reports indicated drains from down to in just minutes Even users with the health of the battery measuring noticed iPhones draining at around per minute In addition to battery drains some iPhone users noticed their devices having excessive heat buildup br It has been recommended by technology experts that users not upgrade their software until the release of a version subsequent to unless specifically plagued by the third party display issue br br br Calculator bug br In October users reported on Reddit that quickly typing in an equation in the built in iOS Calculator app gives incorrect answers most notably making the query result in rather than Analysts have blamed an animation lag caused during the redesign of the app in iOS The problem can be worked around by typing the numbers slowly or by downloading alternative calculator apps from the App Store that do not have this problem With a large amount of bug reports filed Apple employee Chris Espinosa indicated on Twitter that the company was aware of the issue iOS fixed the issue br br br Keyboard autocorrect bugs br In November users reported a bug in the default iOS keyboard in which pressing I resulted in the system rendering the text as or A along with an incomprehensible symbol featuring a question mark in a box The symbol is known as Variation Selector for its intended purpose of merging two characters into an emoji Apple acknowledged the issue in a support document advising users to set up a Text Replacement feature in their device s keyboard settings as a temporary workaround The company confirmed to The Wall Street Journal that devices using older iOS versions as opposed to just the latest version at the time of the publication were affected by the issue and an Apple spokesperson announced that A fix will be released very soon iOS was released on November fixing the issue br At the end of the month another keyboard autocorrection bug was reported this time replacing the word It with I T MacRumors suggested users set up the Text Replacement feature the same way they did for the earlier autocorrection issue though its report notes that some users insist this solution does not solve the problem It was fixed with the release of iOS br br br December crashes br In early December users wrote on Twitter and Reddit that at exactly a m local time on December any App Store app that sends local notifications would cause the device to repeatedly restart Reddit users reported that disabling notifications or turning off background app refresh would stop the issue while Apple staff on Twitter reported that it was a bug in date handling recommending users to manually set the date prior to December MacRumors wrote that the issue looks like it s limited to devices running iOS with users on the beta release not affected iOS released on the same day fixed the issue br br br iOS HomeKit vulnerability br In December to Mac uncovered a security vulnerability in iOS within Apple s HomeKit smart home system allowing unauthorized access to smart locks and garage door openers It noted that Apple had already issued a server side fix that while preventing unauthorized access also limited HomeKit functionality with an upcoming software fix for the iOS operating system intended to restore the lost functionality On December Apple released iOS which fixed the limitation on remote access br br br Supported devices br iOS requires devices with an Apple A or higher SoC Apple A and A X devices are no longer supported including the iPhone iPhone c and iPad th generation making it the first version of iOS to run exclusively on devices with bit processors iOS is the first version of iOS to drop support for devices with a Lightning connector br br br Version history br br br See also br macOS High Sierra br tvOS br watchOS br br br br br br External links
