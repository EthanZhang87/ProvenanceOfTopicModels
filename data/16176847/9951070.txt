title: Fedora Linux
id: 9951070
Fedora Linux is a Linux distribution developed by the Fedora Project It was originally developed in as a continuation of the Red Hat Linux project It contains software distributed under various free and open source licenses and aims to be on the leading edge of open source technologies It is now the upstream source for CentOS Stream and Red Hat Enterprise Linux br Since the release of Fedora in December three editions have been made available personal computer server and cloud computing This was expanded to five editions for containerization and Internet of Things IoT as of the release of Fedora in November A new version of Fedora Linux is released every six months br As of February Fedora Linux has an estimated million users and is also the distribution used by Linus Torvalds creator of the Linux kernel as of May br br br Features br Fedora has a reputation for focusing on innovation integrating new technologies early on and working closely with upstream Linux communities Making changes upstream instead of specifically for Fedora Linux ensures that the changes are available to all Linux distributions br Fedora Linux has a relatively short life cycle Each version is usually supported for at least months where version X is supported only until month after version X is released and with approximately months between most versions Fedora users can upgrade from version to version without reinstalling br The default desktop environment is GNOME and the default user interface is the GNOME Shell Other desktop environments are available including KDE Plasma Xfce LXQt LXDE MATE Cinnamon i Budgie and Sway br A live media drive can be created using Fedora Media Writer or the dd command allowing users to try Fedora Linux without writing any changes to their hard drives br br br Package management br Most Fedora Linux editions use the RPM package management system using DNF as a tool to manage the RPM packages DNF uses libsolv an external dependency resolver Flatpak is also included by default and support for Snap packages can be added br The Fedora CoreOS and Silverblue editions use rpm ostree a hybrid transactional image package system to manage the host Traditional DNF or other systems should be used in containers br br br Security br Fedora Linux uses Security Enhanced Linux by default which implements a variety of security policies including mandatory access controls which Fedora adopted early on Fedora provides a hardening wrapper and does hardening for all of its packages by using compiler features such as position independent executable PIE Fedora also ships with firewalld as a default firewall br br br Software br Fedora Workstation comes preinstalled with a wide range of software such as LibreOffice and Firefox Additional software is available from the software repositories and can be installed using the DNF package manager or GNOME Software br Additionally extra repositories can be added to the system so that software not available in Fedora Linux can be installed easily Software that is not available via official Fedora repositories either because it does not meet Fedora s definition of free software or because its distribution may violate US law can be installed using third party repositories Popular third party repositories include RPM Fusion free and non free repositories Fedora also provides users with an easy to use build system for creating their own repositories called Copr br Since the release of Fedora the operating system defaults to the Wayland display server protocol which replaced the X Window System br br br System installer br br Fedora Linux uses Anaconda as the system installer br br br Editions br Beginning with Fedora it is available in three editions expanded to five editions as of version br br br Workstation br br It targets users who want a reliable user friendly and powerful operating system for their laptop or desktop computer It comes with GNOME by default but other desktops can be installed or can be directly installed as Spins br br br Silverblue br br Silverblue is a variant of Fedora Workstation It is an atomic desktop operating system Every Silverblue installation is identical to every other installation of the same version and it never changes as it is used The immutable design is intended to make the operating system more stable less prone to bugs easier to test and develop and create a platform for containerized applications as well as container based software development Applications and containers are kept separate from the host system OS updates are fast and there is no installation stage With Silverblue it is also possible to roll back to the previous version of the operating system if something goes wrong br Fedora Silverblue was previously known as Fedora Atomic Workstation The descriptive name for this product is image mode container based Fedora Workstation based on rpm ostree which is clear but unsuitable for branding The team preferred the project name Silverleaf but could not secure that name for various reasons Therefore it was named Silverblue though the logo still retains the impression of a leaf br The long term goal for this effort is to transform Fedora Workstation into an image based system where applications are separate from the OS and updates are atomic Red Hat engineers along with independent free software contributors have built most of the pieces for this new desktop over the last few years OSTree Flatpak Flathub rpm ostree and GNOME Software br The ultimate goal of this effort always was to create an image based variant of the Workstation that is at feature parity and better suited for certain use cases than the traditional variant Until the end of the Silverblue team slowly completed the necessary pieces for the vision of an immutable image based OS with independent applications Wayland flatpak and rpm ostree support in GNOME Software etc During the same time Project Atomic has added new features like package layering to rpm ostree and added rpm ostree support to Anaconda Fedora also supports more immutable editions including Sway Atomic Budgie Atomic and Kinoite for KDE Plasma br br br Server br Its target usage is for servers It includes the latest data center technologies This edition does not come with a desktop environment but one can be installed From Fedora Server Edition will deliver Fedora Modularity adding support for alternative update streams for popular software such as Node js and Go br br br IoT br Images of Fedora Linux tailored to running on Internet of Things devices It supports x aarch and armhfp processors br br br CoreOS br The successor of Fedora Atomic Host Project Atomic and Container Linux after Fedora it provides a minimal image of Fedora Linux which includes just the bare essentials This is not to be confused with Fedora Core It is meant for deployment in cloud computing It provides Fedora CoreOS images which are optimized minimal images for deploying containers CoreOS replaced the established Container Linux when it was merged with Project Atomic after its acquisition by Red Hat in January br br br Labs br Similar to Debian blends the Fedora Project also distributes custom variations of Fedora Linux called Fedora Labs These are built with specific sets of software packages targeting specific interests such as gaming security design robotics and scientific computing that includes SciPy Octave Kile Xfig and Inkscape br The Fedora AOS Appliance Operating System was a specialized spin of Fedora Linux with reduced memory footprint for use in software appliances Appliances are pre installed pre configured system images This spin was intended to make it easier for anyone developers independent software vendors ISV original equipment manufacturers OEM etc to create and deploy virtual appliances br br br Spins and Remixes br br The Fedora project officially distributes different variations called Fedora Spins which are Fedora Linux with different desktop environments GNOME is the default desktop environment The current official spins as of Fedora are KDE Plasma Xfce LXQt MATE with Compiz Cinnamon LXDE SoaS i Phosh for use on PinePhone Budgie and Sway In addition the KDE Sway and Budgie spins are provided as OSTree backed immutable spins named Kinoite Sway Atomic and Budgie Atomic respectively br In addition to Spins which are official variants of the Fedora system the project allows unofficial variants to use the term Fedora Remix without asking for further permission although a different logo provided is required br br br Architectures br x and ARM AArch are the primary architectures supported by Fedora As of release Fedora also supports IBM Power le IBM Z s x MIPS el MIPS el and RISC V as secondary architectures br Fedora was the last release that supported ppc and users are advised to move to the little endian ppc le variant Fedora was the last release with support for ARM hfp br br br Alternatives br The Fedora Project also distributes several other versions with less use cases than mentioned above like network installers and minimal installation images They are intended for special cases or expert users that want to have custom installations or configuring Fedora from scratch br In addition all acceptable licenses for Fedora Linux including copyright trademark and patent licenses must be applicable not only to Red Hat or Fedora but also to all recipients downstream This means that any Fedora only licenses or licenses with specific terms that Red Hat or Fedora meets but that other recipients would not are not acceptable and almost certainly non free as a result br br br History br The name of Fedora derives from the original Fedora Linux a volunteer project that provided extra software for the Red Hat Linux distribution and from the characteristic fedora hat used in Red Hat s Shadowman logo Warren Togami began Fedora Linux in as an undergraduate project at the University of Hawaii intended to provide a single repository for well tested third party software packages so that non Red Hat software would be easier to find develop and use The key difference between Fedora Linux and Red Hat Linux was that Fedora s repository development would be collaborative with the global volunteer community The original Fedora Linux was eventually absorbed into the Fedora Project carrying with it this collaborative approach The Fedora Project is sponsored primarily by Red Hat with additional support and sponsors from other companies and organizations br Fedora Linux then known as Fedora Core was a fork of Red Hat Linux launched in when Red Hat Linux was discontinued so the team could focus on their paid version for servers Red Hat Enterprise Linux Red Hat Enterprise Linux was to be Red Hat s only officially supported Linux distribution while Fedora was to be a community distribution Red Hat Enterprise Linux branches its releases from versions of Fedora br Before Fedora Fedora Linux was called Fedora Core after the name of one of the two main software repositories Core and Extras Fedora Core contained all the base packages that were required by the operating system as well as other packages that were distributed along with the installation CD DVDs and was maintained only by Red Hat developers Fedora Extras the secondary repository that had been included since Fedora Core was community maintained and not distributed along with the installation CD DVDs Upon the release of Fedora the distinction between Fedora Core and Fedora Extras was eliminated br Since the release of Fedora as an effort to bring modularization to the Fedora distribution and make development more agile three different versions are available Workstation focused on the personal computer Server and Atomic for servers Atomic being the version meant for cloud computing br Fedora is a trademark of Red Hat Inc Red Hat s application for trademark status for the name Fedora was disputed by Cornell University and the University of Virginia Library creators of the unrelated Fedora Commons digital repository management software The issue was resolved and the parties settled on a co existence agreement that stated that the Cornell UVA project could use the name when clearly associated with open source software for digital object repository systems and that Red Hat could use the name when it was clearly associated with open source computer operating systems br In April project leader Matthew Miller announced that Fedora Workstation would be shipping on select new ThinkPad laptops thanks to a new partnership with Lenovo br br br Development and community br br Development of the operating system and supporting programs is headed by the Fedora Project which is composed of a community of developers and volunteers and also Red Hat employees The Council is the top level community leadership and governance body Other bodies include the Fedora Engineering Steering Committee responsible for the technical decisions behind the development of Fedora and Fedora Mindshare Committee which coordinates outreach and non technical activities including representation of Fedora Worldwide e g Ambassadors Program CommOps team and Marketing Design and Websites Team br br br Releases br br Red Hat Linux to Fedora Core br br Fedora has a relatively short life cycle version X is supported only until month after version X is released and with approximately months between most versions meaning a version of Fedora is usually supported for at least months possibly longer Fedora users can upgrade from version to version without reinstalling br The current release is Fedora which was released on April br br br Rawhide br Rawhide is the development tree for Fedora This is a copy of a complete Fedora distribution where new software is added and tested before inclusion in a later stable release As such Rawhide is often more feature rich than the current stable release In many cases the software is made of CVS Subversion or Git source code snapshots which are often actively developed by programmers Although Rawhide is targeted at advanced users testers and package maintainers it is capable of being a primary operating system Users interested in the Rawhide branch often update on a daily basis and help troubleshoot problems Rawhide users do not have to upgrade between different versions as it follows a rolling release update model br br br See also br br Fedora Media Writer br AlmaLinux br Rocky
