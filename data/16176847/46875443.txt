id: 46875443
iOS is the ninth major release of the iOS mobile operating system developed by Apple Inc being the successor to iOS It was announced at the company s Worldwide Developers Conference on June and was released on September It was succeeded by iOS on September br iOS incorporated many feature updates to built in apps Most notably Notes received the ability to draw sketches with different tools image insertion prominent visual appearance for website links and map locations and advanced list formatting an all new Apple News app aggregates articles from different sources and Apple Maps received mass transit support although in a limited number of locations at launch Major new system updates include proactivity where Siri and advanced search are combined to make the operating system more contextually aware of information such as time and location and can provide the user with information ahead of time For searching the proactive intelligence can display instant results in a widget like format including weather sports news and more iOS also added multiple forms of multitasking to the iPad In iOS Apple added a Night Shift mode that changes the color of the device s display to a warmer less blue light containing shade to reduce any negative eye health effects on users circadian rhythms Additionally iOS brought new user experience functions including Quick Actions and Peek and Pop based on the touch sensitive display technology in the iPhone s Quick Actions are shortcuts on home screen app icons Users can preview Peek at content without moving away from the current screen before they enter Pop the previewed content into full view br Reception of iOS was positive Critics praised proactivity and Siri for making the Notification Center a central location for all information and the potential for future updates to improve the functionality The new multitasking features for the iPad were complimented as were drawing and photo insertion in the Notes app However Apple News was criticized for a low number of decent looking articles and Apple Maps was criticized for the limited geographical availability of mass transit support br Five days after release Apple announced that iOS had been installed on more than of active iOS devices which Apple described as the fastest adoption rate ever for a new operating system br iOS is the final version of iOS to feature the classic slide to unlock With the release of iOS Apple introduced the Today view which was accessed on the lock screen by swiping to the right Apple removed slide to unlock in iOS because it would create confusion when users were trying to unlock their phone by sliding the screen but instead of unlocking the phone it took them to the new Today view br iOS is the final version of iOS compatible with devices with the pin dock connector including the iPhone s iPad and iPad rd generation It is also the final version of iOS that supports the iPad Mini st generation and the last bit iPod Touch the iPod Touch th generation iOS s successor iOS drops support for devices with either the A or A X chip br br br Overview br iOS was introduced at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference on June with the first beta version made available to registered developers after the keynote and a public beta made available in July br This marked the first time that the general public had been able to test new versions of iOS before official release with Eddy Cue Apple s Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services telling Fast Company that the public beta program was started because of Maps referring to the company s Apple Maps launch that had significant issues in its early days br iOS was officially released on September br br br System features br br br D Touch br On the iPhone s and iPhone s Plus a touch sensitive display feature called D Touch is incorporated into iOS It is similar to Force Touch which can be found on the trackpad of some Apple MacBook computers Quick Actions and shortcuts are added to apps that support the D Touch feature and are triggered by pressing slightly harder on the app icon It also introduces actions known as Peek and Pop which lets users firmly hold to preview Peek any kind of content in a hovering window before they optionally apply more pressure to enter Pop the content into full view br The taptic engine in the iPhone S provides haptic feedback each time users press the screen harder br br br Battery br iOS comes with two important battery saving updates When a phone has been placed face down the screen will not light up upon receiving notifications Apple has also added Low Power Mode which modifies the amount of energy dedicated to background services and animations For example background app refresh and push email are paused during Low Power Mode When a phone reaches battery level users are automatically prompted to turn on Low Power Mode which changes the color of the battery icon in the top row status bar on the screen to yellow When the battery goes higher than the level Low Power Mode automatically turns back off br br br Design br San Francisco a new system font replaced Helvetica Neue as the system typeface of iOS br iOS added a new battery widget to the Notification Center that displays the battery life and charging status of any connected Bluetooth device br When the shift button is inactive lowercase letters are displayed on the keyboard instead of the all caps representation on previous iOS versions br br br Installation br iOS is a smaller update than iOS requiring just GB of space compared to GB for iOS Additionally iOS includes an option to temporarily delete apps to allow the update to install Once the update has been installed the apps will be automatically reinstalled from the App Store iOS also features app thinning functionality whereby only the necessary assets needed to run apps on each individual device is downloaded rather than the entire app potentially saving space For example with the new app thinning technology when a user downloads a new app onto their new iPhone S the download would only include the images and data that are required on that device so that no space is required for the images and data that would not be used on the device br br br Multitasking br For the first time iOS adds a number of features to the iPad to improve productivity These include Slide Over Split Screen and Picture in Picture for enhanced multitasking similar to the experience found on OS X El Capitan Slide Over allows the user to pull in a second app with a swipe from the right edge of the display This app takes up of the screen and sticks to the right side of the screen while interactivity within the full screen app is disabled while left inactive in the background The feature allows users to perform quick tasks and then dismiss the app again br If the user taps on the handle next to the Slide Over window or extends the window further towards the left of the screen the user enters Split Screen which allows them to interact with two apps simultaneously side by side in a split Users can also switch to another app in either Slide Over mode or Split Screen view by pulling down on the handle on top of either app and selecting another app from the list to replace the existing one br Picture in Picture mode allows users to minimize FaceTime calls or supported videos to a smaller window and continue watching them while doing other tasks on the iPad br The Split Screen multitasking feature is only available for iPad Air iPad mini and iPad Pro while the Slide Over and Picture in Picture features are available on the iPad Air iPad Air iPad mini and newer and the iPad Pro br When banner notifications are tapped causing another app to open a back button at the top left corner of the screen has been added bringing the user back to the previous app br On iPhone iOS changed appearance of its app switcher from side by side view in iOS to card like view br br br Night Shift br br Night Shift is a display mode introduced in iOS The mode shifts the colors of the device s display to be warmer similar to F lux a popular program for Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS computers When enabled it uses the device s clock and geographic location to determine when to turn the feature on or off Optionally the user can set a manual schedule or not have a schedule at all For ease of access there is a new Night Shift toggle in the Control Center The settings for Night Shift are located under Display and Brightness in the Settings app and on top of enabling the feature and setting a schedule the user can also set the warmth of the display br Despite being introduced in iOS in March it wasn t possible to use Night Shift and Low Power Mode simultaneously until the release of iOS two months later Night Shift requires a bit processor only found in the Apple A or newer chips which means older iOS devices including the iPhone S iPhone iPhone C iPad iPad iPad first generation iPad Mini and th generation iPod Touch do not receive Night Shift mode br br br Performance br iOS includes performance and speed improvements thanks to the expanded use of the Metal API Metal was introduced in iOS and was previously limited to game developers In iOS the use of Metal is expanded to let it handle many of the core user interface elements and graphics br br br Proactivity br Intelligence is one of the main features in iOS consisting of the newly integrated Siri and Search previously known as Spotlight as well as proactivity throughout the operating system iOS is now more aware of contextual information such as time and location and proactively provides the user with what they may need in advance to save them time and effort When typing Search has also been improved to display instant answers in an at a glance widget like format similar to that provided in the Siri interface Search can display current weather sports scores news and more The Search screen with proactive suggestions can be accessed either by pulling down the notifications window in the Safari web browser through the search bar and to the left on the home screen br The intelligence also extends into apps For instance in Mail events can be automatically added to Calendar if details are found in the message content and likely additional recipients are suggested during message composition Siri is also aware of what is currently on screen when it is engaged by holding down the home button br br br Security br iOS introduces multiple security enhancements It introduces a digit passcode as a default an extra two digits from the previous digit default as well as support for two factor authentication digit passcodes were much more secure because there were now million possible passcode combinations compared to just for digit passcodes br The original iOS release in September fixed a security issue within previous iOS versions where a flaw allowed anyone within range of an AirDrop user to install malware on a target device and tweak iOS settings so the exploit would still work if the victim rejected an incoming AirDrop file br br br Settings br The Settings app in iOS includes a new search bar that makes it easier to find settings and options The user also has options to have notifications be grouped by which app they came from and the ability to turn on or off Shake to Undo br br br Other changes br On iPad a two finger drag on the keyboard moves the cursor freely like a traditional trackpad making positioning the cursor and selecting text easier The keyboard to trackpad feature is also extended to iPhone S and S Plus in which users can D Touch force press the keyboard to enable the trackpad Also on the iPad a shortcut bar has been added for cut copy paste undo and redo functions and folders display apps per page in a by arrangement compared to on the iPhone allowing for an increased total of apps in a single folder br iOS introduced Wi Fi Assist a feature on by default that automatically switches the phone to cellular data when the Wi Fi connection is spotty br Whenever the user is presented with flight information the user can click on a link to view a preview for that flight br br br App features br br br iBooks br With iOS and later PDFs saved to the iBooks application via Safari or iTunes

tracks sleep exercise and weight from the Apple Watch br br br Messages br Messages now allows the user to search for text and have that text be highlighted and scrolled br br br Maps br Apple Maps adds support for transit directions in Baltimore Berlin Chicago London Los Angeles Mexico City New York City Paris Philadelphia San Francisco Toronto and Washington D C along with over locations in China br The Maps app now also has enhanced location details including a Nearby feature that recommends shops restaurants and places to drink in close proximity to the user For places serving food users can specify exactly what type of food they want br br br News br iOS includes a new Apple News app replacing the Newsstand app which aggregates news from different sources in a similar style as Flipboard The app features a mobile formatted layout that loads quickly and has informative animations and full bleed images Additionally News supports RSS feeds from the Safari web browser At launch the News app was only available in the United States but it was expanded to the United Kingdom and Australia with the iOS update br In March Apple opened the News platform to all news agencies including independent bloggers br br br Notes br The Notes app has received a number of enhancements in iOS including the ability to draw sketches with a number of different tools including a ruler for straight lines Images can also be added and links to websites and Map locations get a more prominent visual appearance when added to notes On the iPad and on iPhone in landscape mode Notes has a

blocking apps Safari also allows users to customize the appearance of the Reader mode with options for font and background color br A few days after the release of iOS ad blocking software had topped the App Store charts with Marco Arment developer of a Peace app saying that web advertising and behavioral tracking is out of control They re unacceptably creepy bloated annoying and insecure and they re getting worse at an alarming pace br br br Watch br The Apple Watch app was renamed to simply Watch br br br Wallet br The Passbook application was renamed Wallet in iOS and includes many new changes such as support for store loyalty cards gift cards Discover credit debit cards and Apple Pay in the UK The Wallet app can also be accessed from the lock screen br br br Developer APIs br In iOS a Music API allows developers to integrate apps into the Apple Music streaming service br br br Reception br iOS received mostly positive reviews Dan Seifert of The Verge praised the improvements in Proactivity and Siri highlighting how the notification drop down contains most if not all the information the user needs Although he pointed out that Google s Google Now and Microsoft s Cortana personal assistants offer similar services sometimes with better and more varied ways of achieving results the improvements to iOS lay the foundation for even more capabilities in the future Chris Velazco of Engadget liked the small thoughtful design changes but was most impressed by the new multitasking features for the iPad referring to Split Screen as a lovely little feature He did however criticize the low number of decent looking articles in Apple News writing that you ll notice a discrepancy in how some articles are handled most are just formatted text on a white background with the outlet s logo up top and also noted the limited number of locations in Apple Maps that at launch supported mass transit directions Matt Swider of TechRadar wrote that Siri and Proactivity lists were robust and enjoyed that notifications were sorted chronologically rather than by app Samuel Gibbs of The Guardian welcomed the changes to the built in apps such as drawing and photo insertion in Notes unknown number identification from emails through Phone and Siri automatically launching the Music app upon plugging in headphones He also praised the updates to the keyboard calling it much easier to use br Apple faced a lawsuit over allegedly slowing the iPhone S with iOS br On September Apple announced that iOS had been installed on more than of active iOS devices as measured by the App Store According to Apple this was the fastest adoption rate ever for a new operating system br br br Problems br br br Error bricking issue br In February news outlets reported that users who updated to iOS on a particular device that had components repaired by a third party notably the Touch ID fingerprint recognition sensor rendered their phone unusable The issue named Error was according to iFixIt limited to iPhone and Plus devices Apple stated br br We protect fingerprint data using a secure enclave which is uniquely paired to the Touch ID sensor When iPhone is serviced by an authorised Apple service provider or Apple retail store for changes that affect the Touch ID sensor the pairing is re validated This check ensures the device and the iOS features related to Touch ID remain secure Without this unique pairing a malicious Touch ID sensor could be substituted thereby gaining access to the secure enclave When iOS detects that the pairing fails Touch ID including Apple Pay is disabled so the device remains secure br br Apple released a new version of iOS later in February to fix the issue br br br Date reboot issue br In February a bug was discovered that could render bit devices unusable The bug caused by setting the date to January would cause the device to get stuck in a reboot process until the battery died or the time setting shifted past January A similar bug also applies to bit devices where the battery would report of charge and the Wi Fi would be disabled iOS released on March fixed the issue br br br inch iPad Pro bricking issue br In May Apple released iOS The update was followed by reports that it bricked some inch iPad Pros with a Connect to iTunes message and an Error message in iTunes that it couldn t restore the tablet br Apple temporarily stopped offering the update until a re release of the version in June fixed the issue br br br iBooks crash br The release of iOS in July was followed by reports that the iBooks store crashed However Apple explained in August that the timing was a coincidence and the iBooks app crash was a result of a server issue not the software update br br br Spyware attack br br The release of iOS in August fixed three critical security vulnerabilities The vulnerabilities could be exploited to silently enable a jailbreak and allow the malicious installation of a spyware called Pegasus Pegasus could intercept and read text messages emails track calls trace phone location activate the microphone and gather information from apps including but not limited to iMessage Gmail Viber Facebook WhatsApp Telegram and Skype br The discovery of the vulnerabilities dated days before the update was released Arab human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor received a suspicious text message with a link and sent it to Citizen Lab An investigation ensued with collaboration from Lookout that revealed that if Mansoor clicked the link it would have jailbroken his phone and implanted it with the spyware Citizen Lab linked the attack to an Israeli surveillance company known as NSO Group that sells Pegasus to governments for lawful interception br Regarding how widespread the issue was Lookout explained in a blog post We believe that this spyware has been in the wild for a significant amount of time based on some of the indicators within the code and pointed out that the code shows signs of a kernel mapping table that has values all the way back to iOS br News of the spyware received significant media attention particularly for being called the most sophisticated smartphone attack ever and for being the first time in iPhone history that a remote jailbreak exploit has been detected br br br Broadpwn Wi Fi vulnerability br In July information on a critical Wi Fi security vulnerability affecting billion iOS and Android devices was published The issue named Broadpwn allows an attacker to remotely take control of nearby vulnerable devices and turn affected devices into rogue access points further spreading the infection to other nearby devices Apple released a security patch for the issue as part of its iOS update though older devices running iOS including the iPad rd generation iPad iPhone S the first generation iPad Mini and the th generation iPod Touch were left without an available update causing concerns over the safety of the iPad the rd generation iPad and the first generation iPad Mini in schools br br br iPhone S lawsuit br br On December Apple faced a class action lawsuit for crippling the iPhone S with the iOS update with some people even going so far as to say that iOS rendered their devices unusable The S only had MB of RAM so it could not handle the iOS update A settlement was reached in such that users who downloaded iOS onto an iPhone s while living in New York or New Jersey could receive each from a fund of paid by Apple br br br Activation Error bricking issue br Around early some users who still had devices running iOS with the A chip reported being prompted by an Activation Error screen that occurred at any random time Attempting to get out of this error screen would only send the user back to the said screen unless they restored their device to the latest iOS version in iTunes which also meant data loss was possible if the device had content in it as restoring the device wipes everything off it This bug still persists as of the present day for certain users currently running iOS on their A devices and the cause of it happening is currently unknown As of January Apple has made no public comment regarding the issue br br br
