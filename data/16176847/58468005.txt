rating of giving the title Top ranked single lens phone Despite the rear single camera setup a modified version of Portrait Mode is included It works unaltered while using the TrueDepth front camera but with the rear camera it attempts to calculate the depth of field using a combination of the focus pixels on the image sensor and AI resulting in more limitations including lower resolution depth

part of an environmental initiative removed the EarPods and power adapter from all new iPhone boxes starting in October including the iPhone XR It is claimed that removing these items will reduce e waste and permit a smaller iPhone box allowing more devices to be shipped simultaneously to decrease carbon footprint Apple only included a USB C to Lightning cable which was compatible with increasingly prevalent USB C charging sources but incompatible with the previous and then more common USB A power adapter that Apple included with its devices leading to Apple recommending users who don t have a USB C based charging source to use existing USB A to Lightning cables or buying a USB C power adapter separately br br br Notes br br br See also br List of iPhone models br History of
