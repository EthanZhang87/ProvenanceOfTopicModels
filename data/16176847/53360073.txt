id: 53360073
The Nintendo Switch system software also known by its codename Horizon is an updatable firmware and operating system used by the Nintendo Switch video game console It is based on a proprietary microkernel The UI includes a HOME screen consisting of the top bar the screenshot viewer Album Icons and shortcuts to the Nintendo eShop News and Settings br br br Technology br br br OS br Nintendo has released only limited information about the Switch s internals to the public However computer security researchers homebrew software developers and the authors of emulators have all analyzed the operating system in great depth br Notable findings include that the Switch operating system is codenamed Horizon that it is an evolution of the Nintendo DS system software and that it implements a proprietary microkernel architecture All drivers run in userspace including the Nvidia driver which the security researchers described as kind of similar to the Linux driver The graphics driver features an undocumented thin API layer called NVN which is kind of like Vulkan but exposes most hardware features like OpenGL compatibility profile with Nvidia extensions All userspace processes are sandboxed and use Address Space Layout Randomization ASLR a computer security technique involved in preventing exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities br Nintendo made efforts to design the system software to be as minimalist as possible with the home menu s graphical assets using less than kilobytes This minimalism is meant to improve system performance and launch games faster br As early as July Nintendo has been trying to counter Switch homebrewing and piracy Measures include an online ban and on the hardware side patching of the Tegra to prevent exploits On December Nintendo sued Mikel Euskaldunak for selling a Switch modification that can play pirated games Since August the difficulty of homebrewing has gone up as the new Mariko chip replaced the old Erista chip After the release of the Lite in late tools for hacking all Switch consoles were announced In September Gary Bowser was arrested in the Dominican Republic and later appeared in court in the USA afterwards The prosecution alleges that Bowser was a piracy group leader br br br Open source components br Despite popular misconceptions to the contrary Horizon is not largely derived from FreeBSD code nor from Android although the software licence and reverse engineering efforts have revealed that Nintendo does use some code from both in some system services and drivers For example the networking stack in the Switch OS is derived at least in part from FreeBSD code Nintendo s use of FreeBSD networking code is legal as it is made available under the permissive BSD licence and not even particularly unusual for instance and interface the Microsoft Windows TCP IP stack used since at least and XP was originally derived from BSD code in a similar fashion using part of its TCP IP code for its implementation of TCP IP which was legal br Components derived from Android code include the Stagefright multimedia framework as well as components of the graphics stack including the display server derived from SurfaceFlinger and the graphics driver which seems to be derived from Nvidia s proprietary Linux driver br Although a full web browser intended for general browsing is not available on the console as of April several so called applets are included which utilise the WebKit rendering engine to display web content within a stripped back interface A WebKit powered applet is used to allow users to log in to captive portals when connecting to certain wireless networks as well as for operating system features such as the Nintendo eShop social media integrations and digital manuals br br br User interface br br br Home screen br The Nintendo Switch home screen has battery internet and time information in the top right corner and below it is a grid showing all software on the system downloaded or physical Underneath that it has shortcuts to OS functions such as Nintendo Switch Online the News eShop Album Controller settings System Settings and a Sleep Mode button Unlike previous Nintendo systems the Nintendo Switch home screen currently lacks an internet browser and a messaging system br br br News br The News function of the Nintendo Switch software allows users to read gaming news and advertisements provided by Nintendo and third party developers News is also displayed when the system is locked br The News interface was originally available in the version of the software however new headlines were not transmitted until the update was released The update revamped the News system adding multiple news channels for different games that users can subscribe to The news headlines that appear depend on which channels are subscribed to The update further improved the News screen updating its layout The update added search support to the News channel allowing users to narrow the list via filters or free text The update added a Bookmark feature allowing users to save their favorite News articles br br br Nintendo eShop br br The Nintendo eShop option on the Home menu opens a WebKit based interface that allows games to be purchased and downloaded from the Nintendo eShop br As well as games the eShop offers select non gaming apps Niconico a popular Japanese video service launched for the Switch in Japan on July and was the Switch s first third party media app in any market Hulu was the first video streaming application released for the Switch in the United States on November In June Fils Aim said that conversations to bring Netflix to the Switch were on going A YouTube application was released on November On November a trial version app of the Tencent Video streaming service was launched exclusively for Nintendo Switch consoles officially distributed by Tencent in mainland China An official version app will be launched at a later date Funimation launched their own streaming app for the Nintendo Switch featuring a reworked layout and new functions The app became available via eShop in the United States and Canada on December and will launch in various other countries at a later date such as the United Kingdom and Ireland on March A version of the Twitch app launched for the Nintendo Switch on November in most regions worldwide The eShop version of the app allows users to watch or follow any live or recorded content on Twitch but does not support any native ability for Switch players to contribute content br Korg Gadget a music production app was released for the Nintendo Switch on April InkyPen a comics and manga subscription app launched exclusively on the Switch worldwide in December Izneo another comics and manga subscription service was released for the Switch in February FUZE a text based programming language app was released in August br br br Album br The Album stores captured screenshots and videos Pressing the Capture button on the controller in supported software will save a screenshot either to the microSD card or to the system memory The Album allows users to view screenshots that have been taken Screenshots can be edited by adding text and they can be shared to Facebook or Twitter In addition in supported games holding down the Capture button briefly will save the last seconds of video to the Album It can then be trimmed and posted online br The update added the ability to post screenshots to Facebook or Twitter from within the system UI making it easier to share screenshots The update added support for saving second videos in compatible games The updated added the ability to download screenshots and videos to a PC via a USB cable or to a Mobile device via a webpage hosting the files generated by the Switch br Regardless of the amount of free space on the systems internal memory or microSD card there is a hard limit on the number of screenshots and videos that can be stored br On May it was announced that as of June that it would no longer be possible to post screenshots and videos on Twitter br br br Controllers br The Controllers menu allows controllers to be paired disconnected or reconnected The update added the Find Controllers option which allows any nearby controllers that have been paired to be remotely turned on and vibrated to help find lost controllers br br br Settings br The Settings option allows for system settings to be changed and includes other functionality such as creating Miis br br br Recovery Mode br The Nintendo Switch has a hidden Recovery Mode RCM feature which can be accessed by powering off the unit then using a specially constructed jig to short circuit two pins on the right hand Joy Con connector and then holding down the volume up button while powering on the unit The unit would then boot without the Nintendo logo indicating that Recovery Mode has been successfully activated The feature is also used as an exploit on unpatched Switch V units to run homebrew software br br br History of updates br The initial version of the system software for Nintendo Switch on the launch day consoles was updated as a day one patch on March the console s launch date The update added online features that were previously missing from the original software before its official launch date Some notable features of this update are access to the Nintendo eShop as well as the ability to add friends to a friends list similar to that of the Nintendo DS On June patch was released but was removed hours later for problems with network connections as well as issues with MicroSDXC cards br The April firmware update was found by dataminers to have added rudimentary support for Bluetooth audio This support was expanded and made available to regular users on September when patch was released Patch also added the ability to apply software updates to the Switch Dock only applicable for docks released with the Switch OLED Model which have a built in LAN port and a new setting for Sleep Mode that allows the Switch to maintain an Internet connection when the Switch is asleep to download updates When disabled the console will only connect to the Internet occasionally when asleep in order to save power Additionally Patch changed the method to initiate a control stick calibration and allowed users to view their wireless internet frequency band GHz or GHz on the Internet Connection Status page br In November the version update added support for Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack br The update in March added a Groups feature allowing users to sort games into groups as a means to declutter the game collection screen br br br
