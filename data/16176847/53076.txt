title: Darwin (operating system)
id: 53076
Darwin is the core Unix like operating system of macOS previously OS X and Mac OS X iOS watchOS tvOS iPadOS audioOS visionOS and bridgeOS It previously existed as an independent open source operating system first released by Apple Inc in It is composed of code derived from NeXTSTEP FreeBSD other BSD operating systems Mach and other free software projects code as well as code developed by Apple br Darwin is mostly POSIX compatible but has never by itself been certified as compatible with any version of POSIX Starting with Leopard macOS has been certified as compatible with the Single UNIX Specification version SUSv br br br History br br The heritage of Darwin began with Unix derivatives supplemented by aspects of NeXT s NeXTSTEP operating system later since version known as OPENSTEP first released in After Apple bought NeXT in it announced it would base its next operating system on OPENSTEP This was developed into Rhapsody in Mac OS X Server in Mac OS X Public Beta in and Mac OS X in br In Apple announced it would release the source code for the Mach microkernel BSD Unix OS and the Apache Web server components of Mac OS X Server At the time interim CEO Steve Jobs alluded to British naturalist Charles Darwin by announcing because it s about evolution In the core operating system components of Mac OS X were released as open source software under the Apple Public Source License APSL as Darwin the higher level components such as the Cocoa and Carbon frameworks remained closed source br Up to Darwin released in April Apple released a binary installer as an ISO image after each major Mac OS X release that allowed one to install Darwin on PowerPC and Intel x systems as a standalone operating system Minor updates were released as packages that were installed separately Darwin is now only available as source code As of January Apple no longer mentions Darwin by name on its Open Source website and only publishes an incomplete collection of open source projects relating to macOS and iOS br br br Design br br br Kernel br br The kernel of Darwin is XNU a hybrid kernel which uses OSFMK Open Software Foundation Mach Kernel from the OSF various elements of FreeBSD including the process model network stack and virtual file system and an object oriented device driver API called I O Kit The hybrid kernel design provides the flexibility of a microkernel and the performance of a monolithic kernel br br br Hardware and software support br The last bootable full release of Darwin supported bit and bit Apple PowerPC systems and bit Intel PCs br Darwin currently includes support for the bit x variant of the Intel x processors used in Intel based Macs and the bit ARM processors used in the iPhone S and later the th generation iPod Touch the th generation iPad and later the iPad Air family the iPad Mini and later the iPad Pro family the fourth generation and later Apple TVs the HomePod family and Macs with Apple silicon such as the Apple M Macs as well as the Raspberry Pi B An open source port of the XNU kernel exists that supports Darwin on Intel and AMD x platforms not officially supported by Apple though it does not appear to have been updated since An open source port of the XNU kernel also exists for ARM platforms though it has not been updated since Older versions supported some or all of bit PowerPC bit PowerPC bit x and bit ARM br It supports the POSIX API by way of its BSD lineage largely FreeBSD userland so a large number of programs written for various other UNIX like systems can be compiled on Darwin with no changes to the source code br Darwin does not include many of the defining elements of macOS such as the Carbon and Cocoa APIs or the Quartz Compositor and Aqua user interface and thus cannot run Mac applications It does however support a number of lesser known features of macOS such as mDNSResponder which is the multicast DNS responder and a core component of the Bonjour networking technology and launchd an advanced service management framework br br br License br In July Apple released Darwin under version of the Apple Public Source License APSL which the Free Software Foundation FSF classifies as a free software license incompatible with the GNU General Public License Previous versions were released under an earlier version of the APSL license which did not meet the FSF definition of free software although it did meet the requirements of the Open Source Definition br br br Release history br The following is a table of major Darwin releases with their dates of release and their derivative operating system releases Note that the corresponding releases may have been released on a different date br br br Darwin and corresponding Mac OS X releases br br The jump in version numbers from Darwin to with the release of Mac OS X v was designed to tie Darwin to the Mac OS X version and build numbering system which in turn is inherited from NeXTSTEP In the build numbering system of macOS every version has a unique beginning build number which identifies what whole version of macOS it is part of Mac OS X v had build numbers starting with had build numbers starting with and so forth earlier build numbers represented developer releases br br br Darwin iPhone OS introduced br br br Darwin iPhone OS rebranded to iOS br br br Darwin Mac OS X rebranded into OS X br br br Darwin OS X rebranded into macOS br br br Darwin onwards br br Note the tables above contain the release dates of the corresponding OS releases Build dates for Darwin versions are not publicly available the commands below only give the build date for the XNU kernel br The command uname r in Terminal will show the Darwin version number and the command uname v will show the XNU build version string which includes the Darwin version number br The command sw vers will show the corresponding ProductName macOS the ProductVersion number and the BuildVersion string D br br br Derived projects br Due to the free software nature of Darwin there have been projects that aim to modify or enhance the operating system br br br OpenDarwin br br OpenDarwin was a community led operating system based on the Darwin system It was founded in April by Apple Inc and Internet Systems Consortium Its goal was to increase collaboration between Apple developers and the free software community Apple benefited from the project because improvements to OpenDarwin would be incorporated into Darwin releases and the free open source community benefited from being given complete control over its own operating system which could then be used in free software distributions such as GNU Darwin br On July the OpenDarwin team announced that the project was shutting down as they felt OpenDarwin had become a mere hosting facility for Mac OS X related projects and that the efforts to create a standalone Darwin operating system had failed They also state Availability of sources interaction with Apple representatives difficulty building and tracking sources and a lack of interest from the community have all contributed to this The last stable release was version released on July br br br PureDarwin br PureDarwin is a project to create a bootable operating system image from Apple s released source code for Darwin Since the halt of OpenDarwin and the release of bootable images since Darwin x it has been increasingly difficult to create a full operating system as many components became closed source In the project created a preview release based on Darwin with an X GUI followed by a command line only Beta based on Darwin br br br Other derived projects br br XQuartz is a component of the X Window System that runs on macOS Darwin XDarwin before the introduction of Apple s X app br GNUstep is a free software implementation of the Cocoa formerly OpenStep Objective C frameworks widget toolkit and application development tools for Unix like operating systems br Window Maker a window manager designed to emulate the NeXT GUI as part of the wider GNUstep project br WebKit is a browser engine primarily used in Apple s Safari web browser as well as all web browsers on iOS and iPadOS br MacPorts formerly DarwinPorts Fink and Homebrew are projects to port UNIX programs to the Darwin operating system and provide package management In addition several standard UNIX package managers such as RPM pkgsrc and Portage have Darwin ports Some of these operate in their own namespace so as not to interfere with the base system br GNU Darwin was a project that ports packages of free software to Darwin They package OS images in a way similar to a Linux distribution br The Darwine project was a port of Wine that allows one to run Microsoft Windows software on Darwin br SEDarwin was a port of TrustedBSD mandatory access control framework and portions of the SELinux framework to Darwin It was incorporated into Mac OS X br The Darbat project was an experimental port of Darwin to the L microkernel family It aims to be binary compatible with existing Darwin binaries br The Darling project is a compatibility layer for running macOS binaries on Linux systems It uses some Darwin source code br There are various projects that focus on driver support e g wireless drivers wired NIC drivers modem drivers card readers and the ext and ext file systems br DarwinBSD Project is a Darwin project using pkgsrc for packages It is an open source project br br br See also br br A UX br mkLinux br OSF br br br br br br External links br Darwin
