br Gaming br Alongside macOS Sonoma Apple announced developer tools for porting Windows games to macOS The Game Porting Toolkit GPTK derived from Wine and released in beta translates Windows application programming interface API calls to equivalent macOS APIs allowing developers to run unmodified versions of their x Windows DirectX games on macOS Mac users have been able to use the Game Porting Toolkit to run a number of DirectX games tech news outlets have compared the tool to Valve Corporation s Proton compatibility layer for Linux Apple also released a Metal Shader Converter that converts shaders to Apple s Metal graphics API br A DigitalFoundry review of the first beta of Game Porting Toolkit found it impressive with few graphical glitches and full support for console controllers instead of the keyboard though they found that frame rates were around half of what they would be on Windows and that many games were not supported During the Sonoma beta updates to the Game Porting Toolkit brought support for bit games and around better performance br According to reporter Peter Cohen Game Mode and the Game Porting Toolkit are improvements but do not indicate the kind of sea change in Apple s priorities and culture that are needed to build a true Mac gaming ecosystem Cohen says that the problem with Mac gaming is not in the ability to port games but in a lack of a business case for game publishers to do so due to the Mac s low market share the cost of supporting a port and uncertain demand for Mac games when many Mac users also own consoles or gaming PCs YouTuber Snazzy Labs issued similar criticisms which journalist John Siracusa agreed with br br br Removed features br Support for legacy Mail plug ins has been removed br System API support for
