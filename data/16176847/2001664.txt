id: 2001664
Mac OS X Leopard version is the sixth major release of macOS Apple s desktop and server operating system for Macintosh computers Leopard was released on October as the successor of Mac OS X Tiger and is available in two editions a desktop version suitable for personal computers and a server version Mac OS X Server It retailed for for the desktop version and for Server Leopard was superseded by Mac OS X Snow Leopard version in Mac OS X Leopard is the last version of macOS that supports the PowerPC architecture as its successor Mac OS X Snow Leopard functions solely on Intel based Macs br According to Apple Leopard contains over changes and enhancements compared to its predecessor Mac OS X Tiger covering core operating system components as well as included applications and developer tools Leopard introduces a significantly revised desktop with a redesigned Dock Stacks a semitransparent menu bar and an updated Finder that incorporates the Cover Flow visual navigation interface first seen in iTunes Other notable features include support for writing bit graphical user interface applications an automated backup utility called Time Machine support for Spotlight searches across multiple machines and the inclusion of Front Row and Photo Booth which were previously included with only some Mac models br Apple missed Leopard s release time frame as originally announced by Apple s CEO Steve Jobs When first discussed in June Jobs had stated that Apple intended to release Leopard at the end of or early A year later this was amended to Spring however on April Apple issued a statement that its release would be delayed until October because of the development of the iPhone br Mac OS X Leopard is the first version of Mac OS X to run on the MacBook Air br br br New and changed features br br br User interface br Mac OS X Leopard made many changes to the user interface This includes a more detailed transparent menu bar skeuomorphic system icons and a glossy reflective D Dock Windows lost their metallic lined look they had previously As well as this the Apple icon is now black instead of blue This is notably very similar to IPhone OS s user interface Rory Prior on the ThinkMac blog criticized a number of changes to Leopard s user interface including the transparent menu bar and the new folder icons Decreased transparency of the menu bar along with the ability to disable the menu bar transparency were added with the release on February br br br End user features br Apple advertised that Mac OS X Leopard has new features including br br A new and improved Automator with easy starting points to easily start a workflow It also can quickly create or edit workflows with new interface improvements Now it can use a new action called Watch Me Do that lets users record a user action like pressing a button or controlling an application without built in Automator support and replay as an action in a workflow It can create more useful Automator workflows with actions for RSS feeds iSight camera video snapshots PDF manipulation and much more br Back to My Mac a feature for MobileMe users that allows users to access files on their home computer while away from home via the internet br Boot Camp a software assistant allowing for the installation of other operating systems such as Windows XP SP or later or Windows Vista on a separate partition or separate internal drive on Intel based Macs br Dashboard enhancements including Web Clip a feature that allows users to turn a part of any Web page displayed in Safari into a live Dashboard widget and Dashcode to help developers code widgets br New Desktop comprises a redesigned D dock with a new grouping feature called Stacks which displays files in either a fan style grid style or since a list style Rory Prior on the ThinkMac blog criticized the shelf like Dock along with a number of other changes to the user interface br Dictionary can now search Wikipedia and a dictionary of Apple terminology as well Also included is the Japanese language dictionary Daijisen Progressive E J and Progressive J E dictionaries and the word thesaurus Tsukaikata no Wakaru Ruigo Reikai Jiten all of which are provided by the Japanese publisher Shogakukan br A redesigned Finder with features similar to those seen in iTunes including Cover Flow and a Source list like sidebar br Front Row has been reworked to closely resemble the interface of the original Apple TV br iCal calendar sharing and group scheduling as well as syncing event invitations from Mail The icon also reflects the current date even when the application is not running In previous versions of Mac OS X the icon would show July in the icon any time the application was not running but the current date when the application was running br iChat enhancements including multiple logins invisibility animated icons and tabbed chats similar to features present in Pidgin Adium and the iChat plugin Chax iChat Theater allowing users to incorporate images from iPhoto presentations from Keynote videos from QuickTime and other Quick Look features into video chats and Backdrops which are similar to chroma keys but use a real time difference matte technique which does not require a green or blue screen iChat also implements screen sharing a feature previously available with Apple Remote Desktop br Mail enhancements including the additions of RSS feeds Stationery Notes and to dos To dos use a system wide service that is available to all applications br Network file sharing improvements include more granular control over permissions consolidation of AFP FTP and SMB sharing into one control panel and the ability to share individual folders a feature that had not been available since Mac OS br Parental controls now include the ability to place restrictions on use of the Internet and to set parental controls from anywhere using remote setup br Photo Booth enhancements including video recording with real time filters and blue green screen technology br Podcast Capture an application allowing users to record and distribute podcasts It requires access to a computer running Mac OS X Server with Podcast Producer br Preview adds support for annotation graphics extraction search markup Instant Alpha and size adjustment tools br Quick Look a framework allowing documents to be viewed without opening them in an external application and can preview it in full screen Plug ins are available for Quick Look so that users can also view other files such as Installer Packages br br Safari which includes Web Clip br Spaces an implementation of virtual desktops individually called Spaces allows multiple desktops per user with certain applications and windows in each desktop Users can organize certain Spaces for certain applications e g one for work related tasks and one for entertainment and switch between them Expos works inside Spaces allowing the user to see at a glance all desktops on one screen Users can create and control up to spaces and applications can be switched between each one creating a very large workspace The auto switching feature in Spaces has annoyed some of its users Apple added a new preference in which disabled this feature but there were still bugs found while switching windows In this problem was addressed and was no longer an issue br Spotlight incorporates additional search capabilities such as Boolean operators as well as the ability to search other computers with appropriate permissions br Time Machine an automated backup utility which allows the user to restore files that have been deleted or replaced by another version of a file Though generally lauded in the press as a step forward for data recovery Time Machine has been criticized in multiple publications for lacking the capabilities of third party backup software Analyzing the feature for TidBITS Joe Kissell pointed out that Time Machine does not create bootable copies of backed up volumes does not back up to AirPort Disk hard drives and will not back up FileVault encrypted home directories until the user logs out concluding that the feature is pretty good at what it does but he will only use it as part of a broader backup strategy One of these issues has been resolved however On March updates were released for AirPort and Time Machine allowing for Time Machine to use a USB hard disk which has been connected to an AirPort Extreme Base Station br Universal Access enhancements significant improvements to applications including VoiceOver along with increased support for Braille closed captioning and a new high quality Speech synthesis voice br Russian language support bringing the total to languages br Leopard removes support for Classic applications br Introduced the Alex voice to VoiceOver br br br Developer technologies br Native support by many libraries and frameworks for bit applications allowing bit Cocoa applications Existing bit applications using those libraries and frameworks should continue to run without the need for emulation or translation br Leopard offers the Objective C runtime which includes new features such as garbage collection Xcode supports the updated language and was itself rewritten with it br A new framework Core Animation allows a developer to create complex animations while specifying only a start and a goal space The main goal of Core Animation is to enable the creation of complex animations with small amounts of program code br Apple integrates DTrace from the OpenSolaris project and adds a graphical interface called Instruments previously Xray DTrace provides tools that users administrators and developers can use to tune the performance of the operating system and the applications that run on it br The new Scripting Bridge allows programmers to use Python and Ruby to interface with the Cocoa frameworks br Ruby on Rails is included in the default install br Leopard s OpenGL stack has been updated to version and uses LLVM to increase its vertex processing speed Apple has been working to get LLVM integrated into GCC LLVM s use within other operating system facilities has not been announced br The Graphics and Media State of the Union address confirmed many other features are possible because of Core Animation such as live desktops improvements to Quartz Composer with custom patches a new PDF Kit for developers and improvements to QuickTime APIs br The FSEvents framework allows applications to register for notifications of changes to a given directory tree br Leopard includes a read only implementation of the ZFS file system br In mid December a pre release version of Leopard appeared to include support for Sun s ZFS Jonathan Schwartz CEO and President of Sun Microsystems boasted on June that ZFS had become the file system for Leopard However the senior project marketing director for Mac OS X stated on June that the existing HFS not ZFS would be used in Leopard Apple later clarified that a read only version of ZFS would be included br Leopard includes drivers for UDF necessary for reading HD DVD and Blu ray discs using third party drives but the included DVD Player software can only play HD DVDs authored by DVD Studio Pro br Leopard includes a framework implementing latent semantic mapping for classifying e g textual data br Leopard is the first operating system with open source BSD code to be certified as fully UNIX compliant Certification means that software following the Single UNIX Specification can be compiled and run on Leopard without the need for any code modification The certification only applies to Leopard when run on Intel processors br Leopard includes J SE br br br Security enhancements br New security features intend to provide better internal resiliency to successful attacks in addition to preventing attacks from being successful in the first place br br Library Randomization br Leopard implements library randomization which randomizes the locations of some libraries in memory Vulnerabilities that corrupt program memory often rely on known addresses for these library routines which allow injected code to launch processes or change files Library randomization is presumably a stepping stone to a more complete implementation of address space layout randomization at a later date br Application Layer Firewall br Leopard ships with two firewall engines the original BSD IPFW which was present in earlier releases of Mac OS X and the new Leopard Application Layer Firewall Unlike IPFW which intercepts and filters IP datagrams before the kernel performs significant processing the Application Layer Firewall operates at the socket layer bound to individual processes The Application Layer Firewall can therefore make filtering decisions on a per application basis Of the two firewall engines only the Application Layer Firewall is fully exposed in the Leopard user interface The new firewall offers less control over individual packet decisions users can decide to allow or deny connections system wide or to individual applications but must use IPFW to set fine grained TCP IP header level policies It also makes several policy exceptions for system processes neither mDNSResponder nor programs running with superuser privileges are filtered br Sandboxes br Leopard includes kernel level support for role based access control RBAC RBAC is intended to prevent for example an application like Mail from editing the password database br Application Signing br Leopard provides a framework to use public key signatures for code signing to verify in some circumstances that code has not been tampered with Signatures can also be used to ensure that one program replacing another is truly an update and carry any special security privileges across to the new version This reduces the number of user security prompts and the likelihood of the user being trained to simply clicking OK to everything br Secure Guest Account br Guests can be given access to a Leopard system with an account that the system erases and resets at logout br Security features in Leopard have been criticized as weak or ineffective with the publisher Heise Security documenting that the Leopard installer downgraded firewall protection and exposed services to attack even when the firewall was re enabled Several researchers noted that the Library Randomization feature added to Leopard was ineffective compared to mature implementations on other platforms and that the new secure Guest account could be abused by Guests to retain access to the system even after the Leopard log out process erased their home directory br br br System requirements br Apple states the following basic Leopard system requirements although for some specific applications and features such as iChat backdrops an Intel processor is required br br Processor any Intel processor or PowerPC G or G MHz and faster processor br Optical drive internal or external DVD drive for installation of the operating system br Memory minimum MB of RAM additional RAM GB is recommended for development purposes br Hard drive capacity Minimum GB of disk space available br Leopard s retail version was not released in separate versions for each type of processor but instead consisted of one universal release that could run on both PowerPC and Intel processors However the install discs that ship with Intel based Macs only contain Intel binaries br Processor type and speed are checked during installation and installation halted if insufficient however Leopard will run on slower G processor machines e g a MHz Quicksilver if the installation is performed on a supported Mac and its hard drive then moved to a slower unsupported one the drive may either be an internal mechanism or a Firewire external br br br Supported machines br Mac OS X Leopard can run on the later flat panel iMac G s the iMac G iMac Intel Core Duo and iMac Intel Core Duo PowerBook G Power Mac G Power Mac G iBook G MacBook MacBook Pro MacBook Air Mac Pro Mac Mini Xserve Xserve G Xserve RAID Macintosh Server G and later eMac models Leopard can run on older hardware as long as they have a G upgrade installed running at the MHz or faster have at least GB free of hard drive space MB RAM and have a DVD drive Leopard however will not run on the MHz iBook G models even though they exceed the minimum MHz requirement This is due to the lack of AltiVec support in the G line of processors Leopard can be hacked see below to install on these G and pre MHz G machines but the system may behave erratically and many of the programs features and functions may not work properly or at all As of mid some Apple computers have firmware factory installed which will no longer allow installation of Mac OS X Leopard These computers only allow installation of Mac OS X Snow Leopard However some computers such as the model of the Mac mini can have Leopard installed on them without hacking br br br Usage on unsupported hardware br Some ways of running Leopard on certain unsupported hardware primarily PowerPC G computers with CPU speeds lower than the official requirement of MHz have been discovered A common way is use of the program LeopardAssist which is a bootloader similar in some respects to XPostFacto used for installing earlier releases of Mac OS X on unsupported G and pre G Macs that uses the Mac s Open Firmware to tell Leopard that the machine does have a CPU meeting the MHz minimum requirement that the Installer checks for before installation is allowed to commence when in reality the CPU is slower Currently LeopardAssist only runs on slower G s and many people have installed Leopard successfully on these older machines br Users who have access to supported hardware have installed Leopard on the supported machine then simply moved the hard drive to the unsupported machine Alternatively the Leopard Installation DVD was booted on a supported Mac then installed on an unsupported Mac via Firewire Target Disk Mode Leopard is only compiled for AltiVec enabled PowerPC processors G and G though as well as Intel so both of these methods will only work on Macs with G or later CPUs While some of the earlier beta releases were made to run on some later G machines mostly later MHz iBooks no success with the retail version has been officially reported on G Macs except for some later iMacs and Pismo PowerBook G s with G processor upgrades installed br For a number of months after Leopard s release it appeared that the only G Macs on which Leopard could be run were those with both an aftermarket G processor and an AGP graphics card as failures with the OS partially booting before crashing were reported on older Macs such as the original tray loading iMacs and the Beige and Blue White Power Mac G all with G upgrades as Leopard will not even begin to load without one whereas it would boot fine on newer Macs where the Installer restriction had been circumvented However more recently it has been reported that with some more work and use of kernel extensions from XPostFacto Tiger and beta builds of Leopard the OS can be made to run on G upgraded Macs as old as the Power Macintosh despite the lack of AGP based graphics While Leopard can be run on any Mac with a G or later processor some functionality such as Front Row or Time Machine fails to work without a Quartz Extreme capable graphics card which many of the earlier G s did not include in their factory specification br Since Apple moved to using Intel processors in their computers the OSx community has developed and now also allows Mac OS X Tiger and later releases to be installed and run successfully on non Apple x based computers albeit in violation of Apple s licensing agreement for Mac OS X br br br Packaging br The retail packaging for Leopard is significantly smaller than it was for previous versions of Mac OS X although later copies of OS X Tiger also came in a similar small box It also includes a lenticular cover making the X appear to float above a purple galaxy somewhat resembling the default Leopard desktop wallpaper br br br Release history br br br Timeline of Macintosh operating systems br br br Compatibility br After Leopard s release there were widely reported incidents of new Leopard installs hanging during boot on the blue screen that appears just before the login process starts Apple attributed these problems to an outdated version of an unsupported add on extension called Application Enhancer APE from Unsanity which had been incompatible with Leopard Some users were unaware that APE had been silently installed during installation of Logitech mouse drivers However only the users who did not have the latest version of APE installed at that time were affected Apple published a knowledge base article on how to solve this problem br Google announced that the Chrome browser will be dropping support for Leopard starting with Chrome By that time Chrome will no longer auto update and new Chrome installations are not allowed Their rationale for removal of support is that Leopard is an OS X version also no longer being updated by Apple br Firefox also dropped support for Leopard after it shipped Firefox in October TenFourFox is a port of Firefox for the PPC architecture released after Firefox
