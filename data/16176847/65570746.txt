is the first major redesign since the iPhone X similar to that of iPad Pros since and the th generation iPad Air The iPhone Pro and Pro Max feature a flat chassis a design seen with the iPhone through the iPhone S and the first generation iPhone SE The notch size is similar to previous models The bezels are around thinner than the iPhone Pro and previous models The new design also comes with Corning Inc s custom ceramic hardened i e glass ceramic front glass Ceramic Shield while the back retains the previous generation of Corning Inc s custom Dual Ion Exchange strengthened glass On the back is the same three camera configuration found on the iPhone Pro but with larger apertures and an added LiDAR scanner br The iPhone Pro and Pro Max is available in four colors Silver Graphite Gold and Pacific Blue Pacific Blue is a new color replacing Midnight Green while Graphite is a renamed version of Space Gray and Gold is now updated in new yellow gold introduced with the Apple Watch Series br br br Specifications br br br Hardware br The iPhone Pro uses Apple s six core A Bionic processor which contains a core neural engine It has three internal storage options and GB The iPhone Pro has an IP water and dust resistant rating along with dirt and grime and is water resistant up to six meters feet for minutes However the manufacturer warranty does not cover liquid damage to the phone br The iPhone Pro like the iPhone is not supplied with EarPods except in France or the power adapter included with prior iPhone models Apple claims this will reduce carbon emissions and that most users already own these items Apple still supplies the USB C to Lightning cable that was introduced with the iPhone Pro In addition to Lightning and Qi wireless charging the phones introduce MagSafe wireless charging a new magnet based charging and accessory system that allow accessories such as chargers and cases to snap onto the back of the phones MagSafe wireless charging supports up to watts is fast charge capable and is a reimagining of the MagSafe brand that was introduced in with the original MacBook Pro The MagSafe Charger can be purchased separately along with a variety of

dynamic range Dolby Vision K video at up to frames per second br br br Sensors br The iPhone Pro and iPhone Pro Max include mostly the same sensors found on prior iPhone models going back to the iPhone X These include an accelerometer gyroscope barometer proximity sensor ambient light sensor and a digital compass The devices also include the Face ID facial recognition system this is made up of several sensors mainly a dot projector flood illuminator and an infrared camera allowing a user s face to be scanned and stored by the Secure Enclave br A lidar scanner is the new sensor included in the Pro and Pro Max similar to that of the fourth generation iPad Pro allowing additional augmented reality AR features to be supported such as the ability to measure a user s approximate height from the Measure app br br br Software br br The iPhone Pro and iPhone Pro Max feature iOS Apple s mobile operating system The user interface of iOS is based on the concept of direct manipulation using multi touch gestures Interface control elements consist of sliders switches and buttons Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe tap pinch and reverse pinch all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi touch interface Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device one common result is the undo command or rotating it vertically one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode br The iPhone Pro was first supplied with iOS alongside the iPhone while the iPhone Pro Max was supplied with iOS alongside the iPhone Mini The devices come with the stock iOS apps such as Safari Weather and Messages and they also include Siri the personal assistant included in iOS since iOS with the release of the iPhone S br These devices support the current public release of iOS which is iOS These devices receive full support for some new features introduced in the update It will be compatible with the upcoming iOS due to be released in late br br br Reception br The iPhone Pro received generally positive reviews The Verge called it a beautiful powerful and incredibly capable device praising the new design reminiscent of the iPhone the speed of the A Bionic processor and its G capabilities but noted the decrease in battery life compared to the iPhone Pro and the low number of upgrades compared to the iPhone Engadget also gave the iPhone Pro a positive review praising the MagSafe wireless charging and accessory system as well as the improved camera system but noted the lack of upgrade motivation if users had already purchased a new iPhone in br Apple was criticized for the continued reliance on Face ID as the sole biometric option to unlock the device which is incompatible with face masks This limitation was lifted with the introduction of the fifth revision of the iOS which allows the user to unlock the device while wearing a face mask using the paired and password unlocked Apple Watch as its alternative authenticator The iPhone SE rd generation is the only phone that Apple currently produces that supports Touch ID an alternative option that is compatible with face masks All models can still use a passcode to log in br br br OLED gate br Within two weeks of its public release a thread was started at Apple Support Communities describing a problem with pixels on the iPhone and iPhone Pro OLED displays not shutting off completely in black scenes resulting in what was described as an ugly glowing over other users have since clicked the I have this question too button in the thread Other users have shared photos and videos online that demonstrate the issue one of whom whose video amassed over views claims Apple responded that they were working on the problem However Apple has not officially acknowledged the issue which persists despite multiple software updates leading users and pundits to fear a hardware issue br br br Removal of the power adapter and EarPods br Apple through an environmental initiative has removed the EarPods except in France until January and power adapter except in S o Paulo from all new iPhone boxes including the iPhone and iPhone Pro According to Apple removing the power adapter permitted Apple to avoid metric tons of CO in fiscal year thanks to a shift in the mode of transport and product weight Apple now includes a USB C to Lightning cable incompatible with the existing USB A power adapters that Apple previously supplied with its devices Users can still use their existing USB A power adapters and Lightning cables to charge and sync but must purchase or use an existing USB C power adapter to utilize the included USB C to Lightning cable Starting with the iPhone a USB Power Delivery USB PD compliant charger is required to enable fast charging when using the USB C to Lightning cable with Apple suggesting the use of a W or greater USB PD compliant charger to fast charge the iPhone br br br Environmental data br br br Carbon footprint br The iPhone Pro has a carbon footprint of kg lb of CO emissions which is kilograms pounds more than the preceding iPhone Pro The iPhone Pro Max has a footprint of kg lb of carbon emissions a kilograms pounds increase compared to the iPhone Pro Max Of all emissions and released by producing the iPhone Pro and iPhone Pro Max respectively are caused by device production and primary resource use with the remaining emissions released by means of first use transportation and end of life processing br br br Repairability br br Several weeks after its release it was discovered by iFixit and Australian tech YouTuber Hugh Jeffreys that a number of key components such as the cameras malfunction or display warnings if they are replaced with new ones or those taken from an otherwise identical donor unit Internal Apple documents also mention that beginning with the iPhone and continuing with subsequent models authorized technicians would have to run the phones through an internal System Configuration tool to reprogram repaired units in order to account for hardware changes While Apple has yet to comment on the issue the inability to replace key system components have raised concerns about repairability and planned obsolescence br br br See also br Comparison of smartphones br History of the iPhone br List of iPhone models br
