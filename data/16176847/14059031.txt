id: 14059031
Mac OS X Snow Leopard version also referred to as OS X Snow Leopard is the seventh major release of macOS Apple s desktop and server operating system for Macintosh computers br Snow Leopard was publicly unveiled on June at Apple s Worldwide Developers Conference On August it was released worldwide and was made available for purchase from Apple s website and retail stores at the price of US for a single user license As a result of the low price initial sales of Snow Leopard were significantly higher than that of its predecessors whose price started at US The release of Snow Leopard came nearly two years after the launch of Mac OS X Leopard the second longest time span between successive Mac OS X releases the time span between Tiger and Leopard was the longest br The goals of Snow Leopard were improved performance greater efficiency and the reduction of its overall memory footprint unlike previous versions of Mac OS X which focused more on new features Apple famously marketed Snow Leopard as having zero new features Its name signified its goal to be a refinement of the previous OS X version Leopard Much of the software in Mac OS X was extensively rewritten for this release in order to take full advantage of modern Macintosh hardware and software technologies bit Cocoa etc New programming frameworks such as OpenCL were created allowing software developers to use graphics cards in their applications It was also the first Mac OS release since System to not support Macs using PowerPC processors as Apple dropped support for them and focused on Intel based products As support for Rosetta was dropped in Mac OS X Lion Snow Leopard is the last version of Mac OS X that is able to run PowerPC only applications br Snow Leopard was succeeded by OS X Lion version on July For several years Apple continued to sell Snow Leopard at its online store for the benefit of users that required Snow Leopard in order to upgrade to later versions of OS X Snow Leopard was the last version of Mac OS X to be distributed primarily through optical disc as all further releases were mainly distributed through the Mac App Store introduced in the Snow Leopard update br Snow Leopard is the last version of Mac OS X that supports the bit Intel Core Solo and Intel Core Duo CPUs Because of this Snow Leopard still remained somewhat popular alongside OS X Lion despite its lack of continued support mostly because of its ability to run PowerPC based applications br Snow Leopard is also the last release of Mac OS X to ship with a welcome video at first boot after installation Reception of Snow Leopard was positive see the section below br br br System requirements br Apple states the following basic Snow Leopard system requirements are br br Mac computer with an Intel processor IA Yonah processors such as Core Solo and Core Duo can run only bit applications later x architecture processors such as Core Duo Core i and i are also able to run bit applications br Mac OS X or later is recommended br GB of RAM br GB of free disk space br DVD drive also accessible via Remote Disc or external USB or FireWire DVD drive for installation br Additional requirements to use certain features br br QuickTime H hardware acceleration support requires an Nvidia GeForce M M or GT M graphics card br OpenCL requires a supported Nvidia or ATI graphics card br Snow Leopard drops support for PowerPC based Macs e g Power Macs PowerBooks iBooks iMacs G and G all eMacs plus pre February Mac Minis and the Power Mac G Cube although PowerPC applications are supported via Rosetta which is now an optional install In two developer previews of Snow Leopard that are universal appeared on the Internet that can be booted on select G and G Power Macs with modification and patching br br br License br Snow Leopard is available as an upgrade for Intel based Macintosh computers Single user licenses and family pack licenses for up to five computers are available For qualifying Mac computers bought after June Apple offered a discounted price through its up to date program provided that customers orders were faxed or postmarked by December The standalone retail version of Snow Leopard is marketed as being restricted to users of Mac OS X Leopard while the recommended upgrade path from Apple for Mac OS X Tiger is through the Mac Box Set which includes Mac OS X Snow Leopard and the current versions of iLife and iWork br There are three licenses available These licenses differ in their requirements for pre installed versions of Mac OS X br br Leopard Upgrade requires that Mac OS X Leopard already be installed br If you have purchased an Upgrade for Mac OS X Leopard license then subject to the terms and conditions of this License you are granted a limited non exclusive license to install use and run one copy of the Apple Software on a single Apple branded computer as long as that computer has a properly licensed copy of Mac OS X Leopard already installed on it br A Family Pack Upgrade for Mac OS X Leopard license is also mentioned as a subset of the Leopard Upgrade br Single Use places no restriction on which if any version of Mac OS X should already be installed Used for the non upgrade and Mac Box Set versions of Snow Leopard br Subject to the terms and conditions of this License you are granted a limited non exclusive license to install use and run one copy of the Apple Software on a single Apple branded computer at a time br Family Pack identical to the Single Use license in this respect br It is not entirely clear which license is offered with the retail version of Snow Leopard As noted above Apple s website advertised this version as an upgrade from Mac OS X Leopard for and suggest that others upgrade using the Mac Box Set implying the stand alone retail version to be a Leopard Upgrade license On the other hand some Apple press materials appear to indicate that this version is in fact the Single Use license br br The Snow Leopard single user license will be available for a suggested retail price of US emphasis added br However even if the retail edition of Snow Leopard is in fact a Leopard Upgrade the company has acknowledged that there is no technical barrier in that edition preventing a direct upgrade from Mac OS X Tiger br The Leopard Upgrade license explicitly applies to the Up To Date Program US for Macs bought between June and December and the installation discs provided through this program are clearly marked as upgrades unlike either of the retail editions br br br New or changed features br Mac OS X Snow Leopard is a release that refined the existing feature set expanded the technological capabilities of the operating system and improved application efficiency Many of the changes involve how the system works in the background and are not intended to be seen by the user For example the Finder application was completely rewritten in the Cocoa application programming interface from its previous Carbon codebase Despite significant changes in the software users will experience almost no changes in the user interface Snow Leopard includes the following changes br br Mac App Store An app marketplace built in the image of the iOS App Store Released in version br Boot Camp now allows Windows partitions to read and copy files from HFS partitions The new version also adds support for advanced features on Cinema Displays and a new command line version of the Startup Disk Control Panel br The Finder has been completely rewritten in Cocoa to take advantage of the new technologies introduced in Snow Leopard br A much smaller OS footprint taking up about GB less space than Mac OS X Leopard Some of the recovered disk space MB is because printer drivers are now downloaded or installed only as needed rather than being pre installed The default install only contains those drivers needed for existing printers and a small subset of popular printers br iChat enhancements include greater resolution video chats in iChat Theater and lowered upload bandwidth requirements br Microsoft Exchange support is now integrated into the Mail Address Book and iCal applications However only Microsoft Exchange is supported and customers using prior versions of Exchange must either upgrade or use Microsoft Entourage br Full multi touch trackpad support has been added to notebooks prior to those introduced in October While the original MacBook Air and other early multi touch trackpad enabled notebooks had support for some gestures they were unable to use four finger gestures This limitation has now been removed in Snow Leopard br Preview can infer the structure of a paragraph in a PDF document br QuickTime X version the next release of QuickTime player and multimedia framework has been completely rewritten into a full bit Cocoa application and builds on the media technologies in Mac OS X such as Core Audio Core Video and Core Animation to deliver playback Apple has redesigned the QuickTime user interface to resemble the full screen QuickTime view in prior versions where the entire window displays the video The titlebar and playback controls fade in and out as needed QuickTime X also supports HTTP live streaming and takes advantage of ColorSync to provide high quality color reproduction If Snow Leopard is installed on a Mac with an nVidia GeForce M M or GT M graphics card QuickTime X will be able to use its video decoding capabilities to reduce CPU load br Safari features Top Sites Cover Flow VoiceOver expanded standards support and built in crash resistance which prevents browser crashes caused by plug ins by running them in separate processes Safari is bundled with Snow Leopard Safari is also available for free for Mac OS X Tiger Leopard and Windows br Time Machine connection establishment and backups are now much faster br VoiceOver has also been greatly enhanced in Snow Leopard Reading of web pages is improved with Auto Web Spots areas of a page automatically designated for quick access On newer Apple portables trackpad gestures can be used to control VoiceOver functions including the rotor gesture first seen in VoiceOver for the iPhone GS allowing for the changing of certain VoiceOver navigation options by rotating fingers on the trackpad Braille Display support is also improved with Bluetooth displays supported for the first time br br br Refinements to the user interface br While the Finder was completely rewritten in Cocoa it did not receive a major user interface overhaul Instead the interface has been modified in several areas to promote ease of use These changes include br br The traffic light titlebar controls are now slightly lighter in appearance and have less depth than they did in Mac OS X br Expos can now display windows for a single program by left clicking and holding its icon in the dock Windows are arranged in a new grid pattern br Contextual menus which come out of Dock icons now have more options and have a new look with a semi transparent charcoal background and white text br An option has been added to the Finder preferences that allows the user to modify search behavior The default setting can be selected to search the entire computer search only the current folder from which the search was initiated or perform the search based on the previously used scope br Dock Stacks when viewed as a grid allow viewing of a subfolder as a new stack rather than launching a Finder window in a manner similar to tunnelling When viewed as grids or lists scroll bars are provided to navigate folders with more items than the current screen resolution will accommodate as the program does not scale the icons to show as many as possible the way it did in OS X br The default gamma has been changed from to to better serve the color needs of digital content producers and consumers br Windows can now be minimized directly onto their application s icon in the dock br Faster PDF and JPEG icon refreshes br When searching for a network the AirPort menu bar icon animates until it finds a network and shows network strength of available networks in the drop down menu br Prefixes for bytes are now used in strictly decimal meaning as opposed to their binary meaning when describing disk space such that an indicated file size of MB corresponds to million bytes as commonly used by hard disk manufacturers br Snow Leopard shuts down and goes to sleep faster br br br New wallpapers br As with most upgrades of Mac OS X new wallpapers are available There are new wallpapers in the Nature two of which are of snow leopards Plants and Black and White sub folders under the Apple folder Furthermore there are new Apple wallpaper sub folders with multiple wallpapers br br Art Dancer on the Stage Nighthawks Poppies Blooming A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte Suprematism The Great Wave off Kanagawa and Water Lilies br Patterns Pinstripe and Saree br New solid colors can be used as wallpapers as well There is a new blue and gray as well as a solid kelp which serves as the green wallpaper The default space nebula wallpaper has been updated as well br br br Removed features br AppleTalk a network protocol suite that was introduced in is no longer supported Apple Filing Protocol over TCP IP is still supported in Snow Leopard br It is no longer possible to change an application s language using the Finder s Get Info dialogue While there are workarounds for some applications others such as Adobe After Effects CS will not be able to be run in a different language than the one selected in the system without using Terminal commands or third party software The option to change language for individual apps was added back in macOS Catalina in br Creator codes have had their priority in the application selection process reduced Creator codes are per file metadata attributes that define for a file that has a creator code what application should open that file regardless of its extension br Creating or updating Hierarchical File System HFS Plus predecessor volumes is no longer supported br br br Developer technologies br br br bit architecture br Mac OS X Tiger added limited support for bit applications on machines with bit processors Leopard extended the support for bit applications to include applications using most of Mac OS X s libraries and frameworks br In Snow Leopard most built in applications have been rebuilt to use the bit x architecture excluding iTunes Front Row Grapher and DVD Player applications They will run in bit mode on machines with bit processors and in bit mode on machines with bit processors br In addition the Mac OS X kernel has been rebuilt to run in bit mode on some machines On those machines Snow Leopard supports up to terabytes of RAM Newer Xserve and Mac Pro machines will run a bit kernel by default newer iMac and MacBook Pro machines can run a bit kernel but will not do so by default Users wishing to use the bit kernel on those machines must hold down the numbers and on the keyboard while booting to get the bit kernel to load A change to the com apple Boot plist will also enable users with compatible computers to permanently boot into bit for those wishing to do so br Stuart Harris software product marketing manager at Apple Australia said For the most part everything that they experience on the Mac from the bit point of view the applications the operating system is all going to be bit but that at this stage there were very few things such as device drivers that required bit mode at the kernel level br With Mac OS X Snow Leopard only the following Apple computers run or are capable of running the bit kernel br br Amit Singh has reported that the early Mac Mini and MacBook may be capable of running the bit kernel however Apple has set these models to boot into the bit kernel With some tweaking the Unibody MacBook can be set to boot the bit kernel br br br Grand Central Dispatch br Grand Central Dispatch GCD uses the multiple processor cores now in every new Macintosh for more efficient performance Due to the complexity of multithreaded programming and technical difficulties traditionally involved in making applications optimized for multicore CPUs the majority of computer applications do not effectively use multiple processor cores As a result additional processing power compared to single core machines often goes unused Grand Central Dispatch includes APIs to help programmers efficiently use these cores for parallel programming br Grand Central Dispatch abstracts the notion of threads away and instead provides developers with the concept of queues lists of jobs blocks of code that need to be executed GCD takes the responsibility of distributing the jobs among actual threads and cores and clearing up unused memory created by inactive or old threads to achieve maximum performance Apple is also releasing APIs for Grand Central Dispatch for developers to use in their applications and also to analyze specific blocks of code running on Grand Central Dispatch br A new C and Objective C language feature named Blocks facilitates creation of code that will easily optimize to take advantage of Grand Central Dispatch br br br OpenCL br OpenCL Open Computing Language addresses the power of graphics processing units GPUs to leverage them in any application and not just for graphics intensive applications like D games OpenCL automatically optimizes for the kind of graphics processor in the Mac adjusting itself to the available processing power OpenCL provides consistent numeric precision and accuracy fixing a problem that has hampered GPU based programming in the past br OpenCL includes a C based programming language with a structure that is already familiar to Mac OS X programmers who can use Xcode developer tools to adapt their programs to work with OpenCL Only the most process intensive parts of the application need to be written in OpenCL C without affecting the rest of the code OpenCL is an open standard that has been supported by AMD Intel and Nvidia it is maintained by Khronos Group br It serves a similar purpose to Nvidia s C for CUDA and Microsoft s Direct D compute shaders br It only works with the following Mac GPUs NVIDIA GeForce M GT M M M GT M GT GT GT GTX GT GS Quadro FX FX and ATI Radeon HD HD HD HD HD HD HD HD M HD M HD M HD M If the system does not possess one of these compatible GPUs OpenCL code will instead execute on the system s CPU br br br CUPS br CUPS the printing system used in many Unix like operating systems has been updated to version which provides improved driver networking and Kerberos support along with performance improvements CUPS is also the first implementation of the Internet Printing Protocol version br br br Power management br Power management has been improved with implementation of a new wake on demand feature supported on more recent Macintosh hardware Wake on demand takes advantage of the sleep proxy service implemented in AirPort and Time Capsule routers so that the computer can sleep while the router responds to mDNS queries Should the request require the host computer to wake up the router sends the necessary special wake up packet to the sleeping computer br br br Security br Apple strengthened Mac OS X by implementing stack protection and sandboxing more Mac OS X components such as the H decoder in QuickTime and browser plug ins as a separate process in Safari Secure virtual memory was an option in earlier releases on Snow Leopard but the checkbox to disable it was removed later An anti malware feature was also added to the system that alerts the user if malware is detected Mac OS X added regular malware definition updates br Computer security researcher Charlie Miller claims that OS X Snow Leopard is more vulnerable to attack than Microsoft Windows for lacking full address space layout randomization ASLR since Mac OS X Leopard a technology that Microsoft started implementing in Windows Vista br The Safari web browser has received updates to version in Lion and Mountain Lion but not in Snow Leopard br br br Compatibility br Snow Leopard breaks compatibility with several older versions of some applications such as Parallels Desktop versions of Aperture before and versions of Keynote before among other software Apple has also published a list of applications with known compatibility issues with Snow Leopard br Printer and scanner drivers used by previous versions of Mac OS X are not compatible with Snow Leopard and will be replaced during Snow Leopard installation Since the initial release of Snow Leopard many manufacturers have provided compatible drivers that are available via Software Update If a native driver is not available Snow Leopard also includes CUPS and Gutenprint open source drivers that may provide limited functionality br introduced a bug that frequently prevented DNS queries from returning IPv addresses This was resolved in br br br Reception br At the WWDC in Apple stated that Snow Leopard features no new major visual changes Instead the release focuses on refining the operating system to enable better performance br OSNews reported that Mac OS X Snow Leopard was well received by critics br Engadget reviewed Snow Leopard and pointed out that the price of Snow Leopard dropped from the Apple charged for previous versions of Mac OS X to Engadget s opinion was that this could be largely because most users would not see a noticeable change in the look and feel of the system However most reviews commented on the large improvement in speed of the native Mac OS X applications Finder iCal Mail etc br CNET editors gave it stars out of stating Intel Mac users will like Snow Leopard s smartly designed interface enhancements and its Exchange support is a must have especially with Outlook for Mac on the way With a ton of technological improvements Snow Leopard is worth the upgrade fee br On October SFGate blogger Yobie Benjamin wrote that the MacBook Pro that came preloaded with Snow Leopard kicks butt and is a screaming fast machine but when I tried to upgrade one of my older MacBooks it was a fricking disaster from hell Apart from upgrading Benjamin also tried a clean install But he complained of slowness even after his clean install He wrote I ended up downgrading back to OSX then he concluded by writing I might try to do it again but it won t be till Apple releases at least major fix updates If you want to roll the dice and try go ahead your upgrade might work however random installs not working is not good for me Lesson learned I ll wait br The single user upgrade and Family Pack units of Snow Leopard ranked and respectively on Amazon com s software bestseller charts when Apple announced it would release it within the week br Testmac com highlighted other unexpected improvements including the release of a new version of Boot Camp version a cleaner popup software update process and screen and video recording in the new QuickTime Player br The BBC reported that a bug in Mac OS X versions and which in rare cases caused loss of user account data after use of a previously existing guest account by users who had upgraded from a previous version of Mac OS X received wide publicity The bug was fixed as of version br br br Release history br Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced Snow Leopard at WWDC on June and it was privately demonstrated to developers by Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Bertrand Serlet On Monday May after build A Apple issued a code freeze on Snow Leopard s APIs The first public demonstration was given at WWDC by Serlet and Vice President of Mac OS Engineering Craig Federighi br br Mac OS X Server includes these features and other server related features Apple initially stated that Server would include ZFS support but mention of this feature later disappeared from Apple s website and it was not included in the final release due to licensing issues br On January Apple released an update for the Mac App Store on Mac OS X The update was titled Mac App Store Update for OS X Snow Leopard The download was MB br br br See also br List of Macintosh software br br br br br br External links br Mac OS X Snow Leopard at Apple com br Mac OS X
