macOS Mojave mo HAH vee version is the fifteenth major release of macOS Apple Inc s desktop operating system for Macintosh computers Mojave was announced at Apple s Worldwide Developers Conference on June and was released to the public on September The operating system s name refers to the Mojave Desert and is part of a series of California themed names that began with OS X Mavericks It succeeded macOS High Sierra and was followed by macOS Catalina macOS Mojave is the last version of macOS that features the iTunes and Dashboard apps br macOS Mojave brings several iOS apps to the desktop operating system including Apple News Voice Memos and Home It also includes a more comprehensive dark mode is the final version of macOS to support bit application software is the last version of the macOS capable of being booted from an HFS partition without third party patching and is also the last version of macOS to support the iPhoto app which had already been superseded in OS X Yosemite by the newer Photos app br Mojave was well received and was supplemented by point releases after launch br br br Overview br macOS Mojave was announced on June at Apple s annual Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose California Apple pitched Mojave named after the California desert as adding pro features that would benefit all users The developer preview of the operating system was released for developers the same day followed by a public beta on June The retail version of was released on September br br br System requirements br Mojave requires a GPU that supports Metal and the list of compatible systems is more restrictive than the previous version macOS High Sierra Mojave drops support for various Macs released from late to Compatible models are the following Macintosh computers running OS X Mountain Lion or later br br iMac Late or later br iMac Pro br MacBook Early or later br MacBook Air Mid or later br MacBook Pro Mid or later br Mac Mini Late or later br Mac Pro supported with a Metal capable graphics card br macOS Mojave requires at least GB of RAM as well as GB of available disk space to upgrade from OS X El Capitan macOS Sierra or macOS High Sierra or GB of disk space to upgrade from OS X Yosemite and earlier releases Some features are not available on all compatible models Mojave installations convert the installation volume to Apple File System APFS if the volume had not previously been converted from HFS br It is possible to install Mojave on many older Macintosh computers that are not officially supported by Apple This requires using a patch to modify the install image br br br Changes br br br System updates br macOS Mojave deprecates support for several legacy features of the OS The graphics frameworks OpenGL and OpenCL are still supported by the operating system but will no longer be maintained developers are encouraged to use Apple s Metal library instead br OpenGL is a cross platform graphics framework designed to support a wide range of processors Apple chose OpenGL in the late s to build support for software graphics rendering into the Mac after abandoning QuickDraw D At the time moving to OpenGL allowed Apple to take advantage of existing libraries that enabled hardware acceleration on a variety of different GPUs As time went on Apple has shifted its efforts towards building its hardware platforms for mobile and desktop use Metal makes use of the homogenized hardware by abandoning the abstraction layer and running on the bare metal Metal reduces CPU load shifting more tasks to the GPU It reduces driver overhead and improves multithreading allowing every CPU thread to send commands to the GPU br macOS does not natively support Vulkan the Khronos group s official successor to OpenGL The MoltenVK library can be used as a bridge translating most of the Vulkan API into the Metal API br Continuing the process started in macOS High Sierra which issued warnings about compatibility with bit applications Mojave issues warnings when opening bit apps that they will not be supported in future updates In macOS Mojave this alert appears once every days when launching the app as macOS will not support bit applications br When Mojave is installed it will convert solid state drives SSDs hard disk drives HDDs and Fusion Drives from HFS Plus to APFS On Fusion Drives using APFS files will be moved to the SSD based on the file s frequency of use and its SSD performance profile APFS will also store all metadata for a Fusion Drive s file system on the SSD br New data protections require applications to get permission from the user before using the Mac camera and microphone or accessing system data like user Mail history and Messages database br br br Removed features br Mojave removes integration with Facebook Twitter Vimeo and Flickr which was added in OS X Mountain Lion br Mojave also removes support for sub pixel rendering of text The feature was previously used on non Retina displays to improve the appearance of text on screen br The only supported Nvidia graphics cards are the Quadro K and GeForce GTX Mac Edition br br br Applications br Mojave features changes to existing applications as well as new ones Finder now has metadata preview accessed via View Show Preview and many other updates including a Gallery View replacing Cover Flow that lets users browse through files visually After a screenshot is taken the image appears in the corner of the display as with iOS The screenshot software can now record video choose where to save files and be opened via Shift Command br Safari s Tracking Prevention features now prevent social media Like or Share buttons and comment widgets from tracking users without permission The browser also sends less information to web servers about the user s system reducing the chance of being tracked based on system configuration It can also automatically create autofill and store strong passwords when users create new online accounts it also flags reused passwords so users can change them br A new Screenshot app was added to macOS Mojave to replace the Grab app Screenshot can capture a selected area window or the entire screen as well as screen record a selected area or the entire display The Screenshot app is located in the Applications Utilities folder as was the Grab app Screenshot can also be accessed by pressing Shift Command br br br FaceTime br macOS released on October adds Group FaceTime which lets users chat with up to people at the same time using video or audio from an iPhone iPad or Mac or audio from Apple Watch Participants can join in mid conversation br br br App Store br The Mac App Store was rewritten from the ground up and features a new interface and editorial content similar to the iOS App Store A new Discover tab highlights new and updated apps Create Work Play and Develop tabs help users find apps for a specific project or purpose br br br iOS apps ported to macOS br Four new apps News Stocks Voice Memos and Home are ported to macOS Mojave from iOS with Apple implementing a subset of UIKit on the desktop OS Third party developers would be able to port iOS applications to macOS in br With Home Mac users can control their HomeKit enabled accessories to do things like turn lights off and on or adjust thermostat settings Voice Memos lets users record audio e g personal notes lectures meetings interviews or song ideas and access them from iPhone iPad or Mac Stocks delivers curated market news alongside a personalized watchlist with quotes and charts br br br User interface br br br Dark mode and accent colors br br Mojave introduces Dark Mode a Light on dark color scheme that darkens the user interface to make content stand out while the interface recedes Users can choose dark or light mode when installing Mojave or any time thereafter from System Preferences br Apple s built in apps support Dark Mode App developers can implement Dark mode in their apps via a public API br A limited dark mode that affected only the Dock menu bar and drop down menus was previously introduced in OS X Yosemite br br br Desktop br Stacks a feature introduced in Mac OS X Leopard now lets users group desktop files into groups based on file attributes such as file kind date last opened date modified date created name and tags This is accessed via View Use Stacks br macOS Mojave features a new Dynamic Desktop that automatically changes specially made desktop backgrounds two of which are included to match the time of day br br br Dock br The Dock has a space for recently used apps that have not previously been added to the Dock br br br Preferences br macOS update functionality has been moved back to System Preferences from the Mac App Store In OS X Mountain Lion system and app updates moved to the App Store from Software Update br br br Reception br Mojave was generally well received by technology press The Verge s Jacob Kastrenakes considered Mojave a relatively minor update and typical of s macOS releases but Kastrenakes and Jason Snell thought the release hinted at the future direction of macOS In contrast Ars Technica s Andrew Cunningham felt that Mojave feels if not totally transformative at least more consequential than the last few macOS releases have felt Cunningham highlighted productivity improvements and continued work on macOS s foundation TechCrunch s Brian Heater dubbed Mojave arguably the most focused macOS release in recent memory playing an important role in reassuring professional users that it was still committed to them br Mojave s new features were generally praised Critics welcomed the addition of Dark Mode although some noted that its effect was inconsistent MacWorld s Karen Haslam noted that it did not affect the bright white background in Pages for instance Others noted that Dark Mode s utility was curtailed by the lack of third party developer support at release br br br Release history br br br
