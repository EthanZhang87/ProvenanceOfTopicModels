AirPrint is a feature in Apple Inc s macOS and iOS operating systems for printing br without installing printer specific drivers br Connection is via a local area network often via Wi Fi either directly to AirPrint compatible printers or to non compatible shared printers by way of a computer running Microsoft Windows Linux or macOS br br br History and printer compatibility br Following the iPad s introduction in user concerns were raised about the product s inability to print at least through a supported Apple solution Apple founder and CEO Steve Jobs reportedly replied It will come in May to a user request for printing br AirPrint s Fall introduction as part of iOS gave iPhones and iPads printing capability for the first time AirPrint for Mac computers was introduced in the Mac OS X Lion release br At launch twelve printers were AirPrint compatible all of them from the HP Photosmart Plus e All in One series As of July that number had grown to about compatible printer models from two dozen different manufacturers The current list can be found on Apple s support site The related technology is covered by US patent A Printer that supports driverless printing br AirPrint was originally intended for iOS devices and connected via a Wi Fi network only and thus required a Wi Fi access point However with the introduction of AirPrint to the macOS desktop platform in Macs connected to the network via Ethernet connection could also print using the AirPrint protocol not just those connected via Wi Fi Direct Wi Fi connection between the device and the printer is not supported by default but has appeared as the HP ePrint Wireless Direct AirPrint feature It uses a proprietary page description language called Apple Raster br br br Non AirPrint printer support br A number of software solutions allow for non AirPrint printers to be used with iOS devices by configuring support on an intermediary system accessible via Wi Fi connected to the printer Since AirPrint is driverless such a configuration compensates for the printer s lack of native AirPrint support by using the drivers on the intermediary system instead br The simplest solution for all platforms is to create a new Bonjour service that tricks iOS clients into believing they re talking to an AirPrint device Many blog posts and commercial software products exist to accomplish this as well as open source solutions in Linux This works in many cases because AirPrint is an extension of the Internet Printing Protocol IPP which many printers already support either directly or as a result of being shared through an intermediary system typically CUPS the Mac Linux printing system This approach is limited however as the AirPrint specific components of the protocol are missing This can lead to compatibility issues and unexpected results Some software packages address this completely by translating between the two dialects of IPP avoiding compatibility issues while most just re share printers using the AirPrint service name br For Microsoft Windows there are free and paid solutions br On macOS a Bonjour service exists that enables AirPrint support for non AirPrint printers Commercial macOS software for this purpose includes Netputing handyPrint and Ecamm Printopia br In most Linux distributions AirPrint support should be automatic with the CUPS default printing subsystem since version which has been released on January e g in Ubuntu and later or in Fedora and later CUPS servers before version with DNS based Service Discovery can also be configured manually by adding DNS SD printer service discovery records to a name server br br br Apps and utilities br There are a number of third party solutions available on the Apple App Store and elsewhere that allow printing to non AirPrint printers directly or via an application helper Netgear Genie for both Mac OS X or above and Windows XP Vista and Genie permits any shared network attached printer to be made accessible via AirPrint The application is free for customers of current Netgear routers Printopia Pro is a commercial solution designed to allow AirPrint to work on large business and education networks It offers features useful to large organizations including centralized management directory integration and allows AirPrint to operate across subnets It requires a server running Mac OS X or later and one server can potentially serve an entire organization br br br See also br Google Cloud Print br Internet Printing Protocol br Mopria Alliance br br br External links br About AirPrint Apple Support br br br
