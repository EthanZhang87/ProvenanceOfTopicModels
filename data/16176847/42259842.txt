The iPhone and iPhone Plus are smartphones that were designed developed and marketed by Apple Inc They are the eighth generation of the iPhone succeeding the iPhone iPhone c and iPhone s and were announced on September and released on September The iPhone and iPhone Plus jointly were themselves replaced as the flagship devices of the iPhone series by the iPhone s and iPhone s Plus on September The iPhone and Plus include larger and inches and mm displays a faster processor upgraded cameras improved LTE and Wi Fi connectivity and support for a near field communications based mobile payments offering br The iPhone and Plus received positive reviews with critics regarding their redesign specifications camera and battery life as being improvements over previous iPhone models However aspects of the design of iPhone were also criticized including plastic strips on the rear of the device for its antenna that disrupted the otherwise metal exterior and the screen resolution of the standard sized iPhone being lower than other devices in its class The iPhone sold extremely well making it the best selling iPhone model and the most successful smartphone to date br The iPhone and Plus have been the subject of several hardware issues including most prominently being susceptible to bending under hard pressure dubbed Bendgate and as a byproduct of this lack of rigidity the touchscreen s internal hardware being susceptible to losing its connection to the phone s logic board nicknamed Touch Disease Additionally some iPhone Plus models were the subject of camera issues including some with malfunctioning optical image stabilization or otherwise defects on rear cameras br The iPhone and Plus were moved to the midrange spot in Apple s iPhone lineup when the iPhone S and S Plus were released in September The iPhone and Plus were discontinued in most markets on September when Apple announced the iPhone and iPhone Plus Their spot as the entry level iPhone was replaced by the first generation iPhone SE which was released earlier on March The iPhone was relaunched with GB of storage in Asian markets in February as a midrange budget iPhone It was later expanded to Europe before hitting the US markets in May and Canada in July The iPhone and Plus supported iOS and before being dropped by iOS and they are the third to support five versions of iOS after the iPhone s and the iPhone br br br History br From the launch of the original iPhone to the iPhone s iPhones used inch displays which are smaller than screens used by flagship phones from competitors The iPhone and its immediate successors featured a display that was taller but the same width as prior models measuring at inches diagonally Following Apple s loss in smartphone market share to companies producing phones with larger displays reports as early as January suggested Apple was preparing to launch new iPhone models with larger inch and inch displays Reports prior to its unveiling also speculated Apple might use a new iPhone model to introduce a mobile payments platform using near field communications a technology that was incorporated into many Android phones but had experienced a low adoption rate among users br The iPhone and iPhone Plus were officially unveiled during a press event at the Flint Center for Performing Arts in Cupertino California on September and released on September pre orders began on September with the iPhone starting at US and the iPhone Plus starting at US In China where the iPhone c and s were the first models in the iPhone series to be released in the country on the same day as their international launch Apple notified local wireless carriers it would be unable to release the iPhone and iPhone Plus on the th there were details which are not ready local media reported the devices had not yet been approved by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and earlier in the year a news report by state broadcaster China Central Television alleged iPhone devices were a threat to national security because iOS s frequent locations function could expose state secrets br In August Apple initiated a replacement program for some early iPhone Plus models that were found to have potentially faulty cameras that could be causing photos to appear blurry br On September with the release of the iPhone s and iPhone s Plus the iPhone and Plus were moved to the mid range of the iPhone lineup The GB versions of the iPhone and iPhone Plus was discontinued along with the gold version of both phones but the GB and GB versions of the iPhone and iPhone Plus in silver and space gray remained available for sale at a reduced price br In June Apple faced a potential sales ban in China as Shenzhen Baili a Chinese device maker alleged the iPhone and iPhone Plus infringed on its design patent br The iPhone was temporary discontinued on September and the Plus was permanently discontinued on same date when Apple announced the iPhone and iPhone Plus and the iPhone and Plus spot as the entry level iPhone was taken by the first generation iPhone SE As the iPhone SE has more powerful internal hardware than the midrange iPhone largely the same as the S and had been released earlier on March this created an unusual situation when it was sold alongside the iPhone and Plus until September despite being marketed as a lower tier iPhone br In February the iPhone was quietly relaunched in carrier stores and online this time the storage has been changed to GB In India it was sold on Amazon s website in Space Grey In Taiwan it was sold through Taiwan Mobile on March in gold color In mid March it was released in the EU to Belarus via the i Store webshop It also makes an appearance in North America with Sprint based US prepaid carriers Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile along with AT T GoPhone These are not being distributed by Apple on their website or their retail stores br br br Specifications br br br Hardware br br br Design br The design of the iPhone and iPhone Plus is influenced by that of the iPad Air with a glass front that is curved around the edges of the display and an aluminum rear that contains two plastic strips for the antenna The back is built of series aluminum Both models come in gold silver and space gray finishes The iPhone has a thickness of millimetres in while the iPhone Plus is mm in in thickness both are thinner than the iPhone c and iPhone s with the iPhone being Apple s thinnest phone to date br br br Displays br br The most significant changes to the iPhone and iPhone Plus are its displays both branded as Retina HD Display and ion strengthened the iPhone display is inches in size with a resolution of x ppi minus one row of pixels while the iPhone Plus includes a inch x p display PPI The displays use a multiple domain LCD panel dubbed dual domain pixels the RGB pixels themselves are skewed in a pattern so every pixel is seen from a different angle This technique helps improve the viewing angles of the display br To accommodate the larger physical size of the iPhone and iPhone Plus the top button was renamed to side button and moved to the side of the phone instead of the top to improve its accessibility br br br Batteries br The iPhone features a Wh mAh battery while the iPhone Plus features an Wh mAh battery neither of which are user replaceable br br br Chipsets br Both models include an Apple A system on chip and an M motion co processor an update of the M chip from the iPhone s The primary difference between the M and the original M coprocessor is the M also includes a barometer to measure altitude changes Phil Schiller said the A chip would provide in comparison to the s a increase in CPU performance a increase in graphics performance and less heat output Early hands on reports said the A s GPU performance might indeed break away from previous generations doubling of performance at each yearly release scoring in Base mark X compared to and on respectively the s and s br br br Connectivity br The expanded LTE connectivity on the iPhone and iPhone Plus is improved to LTE Advanced with support for over LTE bands seven more than the iPhone s for up to Mbit s download speed and VoLTE support Wi Fi performance has been improved with support for ac specifications providing speeds up to Mbit s which is up to three times faster than n along with Wi Fi Calling support where available The iPhone and iPhone Plus adds support for near field communications NFC It is initially used exclusively for Apple Pay a new mobile payments system which allows users to store their credit cards in Passbook for use with online payments and retail purchases over NFC iOS added limited use of near field communications besides Apple Pay for rd party apps br br br Camera br br The iPhone s rear facing camera now has the ability to shoot p Full HD video at either or frames per second and p HD slow motion video at either or frames per second while the iPhone s could only record at and frames per second respectively Unlike the previous models the rear facing camera is not flush with the rear of the device but instead protrudes slightly br Still photos can be captured during video recording Those have a resolution of four megapixels br The camera also includes phase detection autofocus The iPhone Plus camera is nearly identical but also includes optical image stabilization The front facing camera was also updated with a new sensor and f aperture along with support for burst and HDR modes br However the optical image stabilization of the iPhone Plus is only available for photography and deactivated during video recording br The front camera has Megapixels and records video up to p at frames per second br br br Sensors br The iPhone and Plus are the first iPhones to be equipped with a barometer sensor br Like the predecessor the iPhone and Plus are equipped with an accelerometer gyroscope front facing proximity sensor and a digital compass br br br Software br br When first released the iPhone and iPhone Plus were supplied pre loaded with iOS Apps are able to take advantage of the increased screen size in the iPhone and Plus to display more information on screen for example the Mail app uses a dual pane layout similar to its iPad version when the device is in landscape mode on the iPhone Plus As it uses an identical aspect ratio apps designed for the iPhone iPhone c and s can be upscaled for use on the iPhone and Plus To improve the usability of the devices larger screens an additional Reachability gesture was added double tapping the Home button will slide the top half of the screen s contents down to the bottom half of the screen This function allows users to reach buttons located near the top of the screen such as a Back button in the top left corner In June Apple announced that it would drop support for the iPhone and Plus with the release of iOS br br br Reception br Both iPhone models received positive reviews Re code called it the best smartphone you can buy TechRadar praised the iPhone s brilliant design improved battery life over the s iOS for being smarter and more intuitive than ever along with the quality of its camera However the plastic antenna strips on the rear of the phone were criticized for resulting in poor aesthetics the display for having lower resolution and pixel density in comparison to other recent smartphones including those with the same physical screen size as the iPhone such as the HTC One and for not having a sufficient justification for its significantly higher price in comparison to similar devices running Android or Windows Phone The Verge considered the iPhone to be simply and cleanly designed in comparison to the s noting the phone still felt usable despite its larger size but criticized the antenna plastic the protruding camera lens which prevents the device from sitting flat without a case and the lack of additional optimization in the operating system for the bigger screen Improvements such as performance battery life VoLTE support and other tweaks were also noted In conclusion the iPhone was considered good even great but there s little about it that s truly ambitious or truly moving the needle It s just a refinement of a lot of existing ideas into a much more pleasant package br In regards to the Plus Engadget panned its design for being uncomfortable to hold and harder to grip in comparison to other devices such as the Galaxy Note and LG G but praised its inclusion of optical image stabilization and slightly better battery life than the br The iPhone and Plus have been criticized by Forbes Magazine for the lack of p pixels video recording due to the insufficient image sensor resolution of pixels However third party software is able to record footage at pixels upscaled to p br br br Issues br The iPhone and Plus were affected by a number of notable hardware related issues including but not limited to concerns surrounding their rigidity which led to incidents surrounding chassis bending as well as degradation or outright loss of touchscreen functionality performance issues on models with larger storage capacity camera problems on the Plus model as well as an initially undocumented error that appeared under certain circumstances br br br Bendgate chassis bending br Shortly after its public release it was reported the iPhone and iPhone Plus chassis was susceptible to bending under pressure such as when carried tightly in a user s pocket While such issues are not exclusive to the iPhone and Plus the design flaw came to be known among users and the media as Bendgate br Apple responded to the bending allegations stating they had only received nine complaints of bent devices and that the damage occurring due to regular use is extremely rare The company maintained the iPhone and Plus went through durability testing to ensure they would stand up to daily use The company offered to replace phones that were bent if it is determined the bending was unintentional br In May as part of a lawsuit against Apple regarding touchscreen failure it was revealed via internal documents that Apple knew the iPhone and Plus phones were more likely to bend than previous models According to the court documents Apple s internal tests found the iPhone was times more likely to bend than the iPhone s while the larger iPhone Plus was times more likely to bend br br br Hair ripping br On October to Mac released a post claiming certain iPhone and iPhone Plus users complained on social networking sites the phone ripped off their hair when they held the phone close to their ears when making phone calls Twitter users claimed the seam between the glass screen and aluminum back of the iPhone was to blame with hair becoming caught within it br br br Flash storage performance br Some users reported the and GB iPhone models had experienced performance issues and that some GB iPhone Plus models would in rare cases randomly crash and reboot Business Korea reported the issues were connected to the triple level cell NAND storage of the affected models Triple level NAND flash can store three bits of data per cell of flash and are cheaper than dual level cell solutions but at the cost of performance It was reported Apple had planned to switch the affected model lines back to multi level cell flash and address the performance issues on existing devices in a future iOS update br br br iPhone Plus camera issues br It was reported the optical image stabilization systems on some iPhone Plus models were faulty failing to properly stabilize when the phone is being held perfectly still leading to blurry photos and wavy looking videos The optical image stabilization system was also found to have been affected by accessories that use magnets such as third party lens attachments Apple issued advisories to users and its licensed accessory makers warning magnetic or metallic accessories can cause the OIS to malfunction br On August Apple instituted a repair program for iPhone Plus models released between September and January citing faulty rear cameras on affected models may produce blurry pictures br Some iPhone and iPhone Plus models have an issue in which the front facing camera is somehow shifted or out of place Apple stated they would replace most affected iPhone models with this issue free of charge Despite numerous complaints regarding this issue it does not seem to affect the camera itself It is said the camera is not what has shifted but a piece of protective foam around the camera module itself that has gone out of place br br br Error br If the iPhone home button is repaired or modified by a third party the device will fail security checks related to Touch ID as the components have not been re validated for security reasons a process that can only be performed by an authorized Apple outlet Failing these checks disables all features related to Touch ID Such effects have sometimes happened as a result of damage as well br It was reported these same hardware integrity checks would trigger an unrecoverable loop into Recovery Mode if iOS is updated or restored with attempts to restore the device via iTunes software resulting in an error message Beyond the explanation this is related to hardware integrity errors regarding Touch ID components Apple provided no official explanation of what specifically triggers error or how it can be fixed without replacing the entire device br On February Apple released an iOS patch through iTunes which addresses this issue and admitted error was actually related to a diagnostic check for inspecting the Touch ID hardware before an iPhone is shipped from its factories br br br Touchscreen failure touch disease br br Touchscreen control components on iPhone logic boards have insufficient support including a lack of underfill which strengthens and stabilizes integrated circuits and a lack of rigid metal shielding on the logic board unlike previous iPhone models the touchscreen controller is instead shielded by a flexible sticker Normal use of the device can cause the logic board to flex internally which strains the touchscreen IC connectors and leads to a degradation or outright loss of touchscreen functionality A symptom that has been associated with this type of failure is a flickering grey bar near the top of the display iFixit reported this issue nicknamed touch disease was a byproduct of the previous Bendgate design flaw because of the device s demonstrated lack of rigidity As such the larger iPhone Plus is more susceptible to the flaw but it has also been reported on a small percentage of iPhone models The devices successor the iPhone s is not afflicted by this flaw due to changes to their internal design which included the strengthening of key points in the rear casing and the re location of the touchscreen controllers to the display assembly from the logic board br Initially Apple did not officially acknowledge this issue The issue was widely discussed on Apple s support forum where posts discussing the issue have been subject to censorship The touchscreen can be repaired via microsoldering Apple Stores are not equipped with the tools needed to perform the logic board repair which had led to affected users sending their devices to unofficial third party repair services An Apple Store employee interviewed by Apple Insider reported six months after they first started noticing the problem Apple had issued guidance instructing them to tell affected users this was a hardware issue that could not be repaired and that their iPhone had to be replaced However some in stock units have also been afflicted with this issue out of the box leading to an employee stating they were tired of pulling service stock out of the box and seeing the exact same problem the customer has on the replacement The issue received mainstream attention in August when reported by iFixit On August Apple Insider reported based on data from four high traffic Apple Store locations there was a spike in the number of iPhone devices brought into them for repairs following mainstream reports of the touch disease problem br On August a group of three iPhone owners sued Apple Inc in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and filed for a proposed class action lawsuit alleging Apple was engaging in unfair business practices by having long been aware of the defective design yet refusing to acknowledge or repair it br On November Apple officially acknowledged the issue and announced a paid repair program for affected iPhone Plus models stating some iPhone Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device br br br Sales br Apple Inc announced within hours of availability over million pre orders of the iPhone and Plus were made exceeding the supply available an Apple record million iPhone and iPhone Plus devices were sold in the first three days marking another Apple record The iPhone S S Plus were introduced in September selling million units which set the record for sales in the first three days from last years release Three months after its release the iPhone generated million unit sales br As of June the iPhone and Plus have sold million units worldwide making them the most popular iPhone models and the best selling smartphones of all time br br br See
