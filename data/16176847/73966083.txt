The Apple Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset developed by Apple It was announced on June at Apple s Worldwide Developers Conference and pre orders began on January It became available for purchase on February in the United States It is set for release in China Japan Italy and Singapore on June and in Australia Canada France Germany and the UK on July Apple Vision Pro is Apple s first new major product category since the release of the Apple Watch in br Apple markets Apple Vision Pro as a spatial computer where digital media is integrated with the real world Physical inputs such as motion gestures eye tracking and speech recognition can be used to interact with the system Apple has avoided marketing the device as a virtual reality headset when discussing the product in presentations and marketing br The device runs visionOS a mixed reality operating system derived from iPadOS frameworks using a D user interface it supports multitasking via windows that appear to float within the user s surroundings as seen by cameras built into the headset A dial on the top of the headset can be used to mask the camera feed with a virtual environment to increase immersion The OS supports avatars officially called Personas which are generated by scanning the user s face a screen on the front of the headset displays a rendering of the avatar s eyes EyeSight which are used to indicate the user s level of immersion to bystanders and assist in communication br br br History br br br Development br In May Apple acquired the German augmented reality AR company Metaio originally spun off from Volkswagen That year Apple hired Mike Rockwell from Dolby Laboratories Rockwell formed a team called the Technology Development Group including Metaio co founder Peter Meier and Apple Watch manager Fletcher Rothkopf The team developed an AR demo in but was opposed by chief design officer Jony Ive and his team Augmented reality and virtual reality VR expert and former NASA specialist Jeff Norris was hired in April Rockwell s team helped deliver ARKit in with iOS Rockwell s team sought to create a headset and worked with Ive s team the decision to reveal the wearer s eyes through a front facing eye display was well received by the industrial design team br The headset s development experienced a period of uncertainty with the departure of Ive in His successor Evans Hankey left the company in Senior engineering manager Geoff Stahl who reports to Rockwell led the development of its visionOS operating system after previously working on games and graphics technology at Apple Apple s extended reality headset is meant as a bridge to future lightweight AR glasses which are not yet technically feasible In November Apple acquired Canadian MR company Vrvana for million The Vrvana Totem was able to overlay fully opaque true color animations on top of the real world rather than the ghost like projections of other AR headsets which cannot display the color black It was able to do this while avoiding the often noticeable lag between the cameras capturing the outside world while simultaneously maintaining a degree field of view at Hz The Totem also used IR illuminators and infrared cameras to perform spatial and hand tracking br According to leaker Wayne Ma Apple was originally going to allow macOS software to be dragged from the display to the user s environment but was scrapped early on due to the limitations of being based on iOS and noted that the hand tracking system was not precise enough for games Workers also discussed collaborations with brands such as Nike for working out with the headset and others investigated face cushions that were better suited for sweaty high intensity workouts but was scrapped due to the battery pack and the fragile screen A feature called co presence a projection of a FaceTime user s full body was also scrapped due to unknown reasons br br br Unveiling and release br In May Apple executives previewed the device including CEO Tim Cook The company began recruiting directors and creatives to develop content for the headset in June One such director Jon Favreau was enlisted to bring the dinosaurs on his Apple TV show Prehistoric Planet to life By April Apple was also attempting to attract developers to make software and services for the headset Apple filed over patents for technologies which contributed to the development of Apple Vision Pro br Apple Vision Pro was announced at Apple s Worldwide Developers Conference WWDC on June to launch in early in the United States at a starting price of US br On June the day after the announcement Apple acquired the AR headset startup Mira whose technology is used at Super Nintendo World s Mario Kart ride The company has a contract with the United States Air Force and Navy Eleven of the company s employees were onboarded br On January Apple announced that the release date of Apple Vision Pro in the United States would be on February Estimates of initial shipments ranged from units Pre orders began on January at a m PST and the launch shipments sold out in minutes Apple sold up to units in the two week pre order period a majority of which were to be shipped five to seven weeks after launch day br br br Specifications br br br Hardware br br Apple Vision Pro comprises approximately components It has a curved laminated glass display on the front an aluminum frame on its sides a flexible cushion on the inside and a removable adjustable headband The frame contains five sensors six microphones and cameras Users see two x pixel inch cm micro OLED displays with a total of megapixels usually running at FPS through the lens but can automatically adjust to or FPS based on the content being shown The eyes are tracked by a system of LEDs and infrared cameras which form the basis of the device s iris scanner named Optic ID used for authentication like the iPhone s Face ID Horizontally mounted motors adjust lenses for individual eye positions to ensure clear and focused images that precisely track eye movements Sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes track facial movements minimizing discrepancies between the real world and the projected image Custom optical inserts are supported for users with prescription glasses which will attach magnetically to the main lens and are developed in partnership with Zeiss The device s bone conduction speaker is inside the headband and is placed directly over the user s ears It can also virtualize surround sound Two cooling fans about cm in in diameter are placed near the eye positions to help with heat dissipation due to high speed processing of data An active noise control function counters distracting noises including the fan sounds During the ordering process users must scan their face using an iPhone or iPad with Face ID for fitting purposes this can be done via the Apple Store app or at an Apple Store retail location br Apple Vision Pro uses the Apple M system on a chip It is accompanied by a co processor known as Apple R which is used for real time sensor input processing The device can be purchased with three internal storage configurations GB GB and TB It can be powered by an external power supply a USB C port on a Mac or a battery pack rated for two and a half hours of use The battery pack connects to the headset using an unremovable pin locking variant of the Lightning connector br The user s face is scanned by the headset during setup to generate a persona a realistic avatar used by OS features One such feature is EyeSight an outward facing screen which displays the eyes of the user s persona Its eyes appear dimmed when in AR and obscured when in full immersion to indicate the user s environmental awareness When someone else approaches or speaks even if the user is fully immersed EyeSight shows their persona s virtual eyes normally and makes the other person visible br A digital crown dial on the headset is used to control the amount of virtual background occupying the user s field of view ranging from a mixed reality view where apps and media appear to float in the user s real world surroundings to completely hiding the user s surroundings br br br Accessories br br First party consumer accessories for Apple Vision Pro include a US travel case Apple manufactured Zeiss optical inserts for users with farsightedness a light seal and a light seal cushion The only official third party accessory available at launch is a battery holder made by Belkin br A first party adapter costing is available and can only be purchased by registered paid Apple Developer accounts that replaces the right head strap connection and adds a USB C port for use by developers Code from diagnostics tools have revealed that the adapter is capable of interacting with Apple Vision Pro in a diagnostic mode br br br Software br br Apple Vision Pro runs visionOS internally called xrOS before a last minute change ahead of WWDC which is derived primarily from iOS core frameworks including UIKit SwiftUI and ARKit and MR specific frameworks for foveated rendering and real time interaction br The operating system uses a D user interface navigated via finger tracking eye tracking and speech recognition Users can select elements by looking at it and pinching two fingers together move the element by moving their pinched fingers and scroll by flicking their wrist Apps are displayed in floating windows that can be arranged in D space visionOS supports a virtual keyboard for text input the Siri virtual assistant and external Bluetooth peripherals including Magic Keyboard Magic Trackpad and gamepads visionOS supports screen mirroring to other Apple devices using AirPlay visionOS can mirror the primary display of a macOS device via the Mac Virtual Display feature the Mac can also be controlled using peripherals paired with the headset br visionOS supports vision apps from App Store and is backward compatible with selected iOS and iPadOS apps developers are allowed to opt out from visionOS compatibility Netflix Spotify and YouTube notably announced that they would not release visionOS apps at launch nor support their iOS apps on the platform and directed users to use their web versions in Safari Analysts suggested that this may have resulted from the companies strained relationships with Apple over App Store policies such as mandatory revenue sharing including associated antitrust allegations In an interview Netflix co CEO Greg Peters stated that Apple Vision Pro was too niche to for the company to support at this time but that we re always in discussions with Apple to try and figure that out A YouTube spokesperson later stated to The Verge that the service had plans to develop a visionOS app in the future br br br Reception br br br Pre release and unveiling br br Before the official release of Apple Vision Pro Samuel Axon of Ars Technica said that Apple Vision Pro was truly something I had never seen before noting the intuitiveness of its user interface in a choreographed demo given by Apple and praising a dinosaur tech demo for its immersive ness Axon said that its displays were dim but much better than other headsets I ve used on this front even if it still wasn t perfect and that the personas looked surreal but conveyed body language better than a more stylized avatar such as Animoji or Horizon Worlds He argued that Apple Vision Pro was not a virtual reality VR platform nor a competitor to Meta Platforms s Quest formerly Oculus product line due to its positioning as primarily an AR device that just happens to have a few VR features and not as a mass market consumer product Media outlets observed that Meta had announced the Meta Quest shortly before WWDC seemingly in anticipation of Apple s announcement Following its release Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated he had demoed the headset and liked its display resolution and eye tracking but still believed the Quest was the better product due to its lower price and Apple s closed ecosystem br Jay Peters of The Verge similarly noted that Apple did not present Apple Vision Pro as a VR platform or refer to the device as a headset and described it as an AR device and spatial computer and only demonstrated non VR games displayed in windows and controlled using an external gamepad rather than fully immersive experiences such as games and social platforms including motion controllers He suggested that this positioning leaves wiggle room for the likely future of this technology that looks nothing like a bulky VR headset AR glasses App Store guidelines for visionOS similarly state that developers should refer to visionOS software as spatial computing experiences or vision apps and avoid the use of terms such as augmented reality and mixed reality br After the initial announcement of Apple Vision Pro it was criticized due to its high cost as too high to go mainstream the three priciest components in Apple Vision Pro are its camera and sensor array its dual Apple silicon chips and the twin K micro OLED virtual reality displays Apple is reportedly working on a cheaper model that is scheduled sometime for release for the end of and a second generation model with a faster processor Apple Vision Pro also faced criticism over its short battery life appearing distracting to others and its lack of HDMI input and haptic feedback br br br Reviews br br Apple Vision Pro received mixed to positive reviews Nilay Patel of The Verge praised the headset s design as being more premium and less goofy looking than other existing VR headsets felt that its displays were generally incredible in their sharpness and brightness it had the highest quality video passthrough he had seen on an MR headset yet even while having a field of view narrower than the Meta Quest and that its speakers had a convincing spatial audio effect However he felt that there was so much technology in this thing that feels like magic when it works and frustrates you completely when it doesn t citing examples such as the passthrough cameras which cannot overcome the inherent nature of cameras and displays eye and hand tracking that was inconsistent and frustrating to use with parts of the visionOS interface demanding precision that couldn t be met by the eye tracking system visionOS lacking a window management tool similar to Expose or Stage Manager and that the personas and EyeSight features were uncanny with the latter s visibility hampered by a dim low resolution display covered by reflective glass Patel felt that Apple Vision Pro was meant to be a development kit for future AR glasses as the device s current form was from technological and philosophical standpoints too limiting for Apple s ambitions and may have inadvertently revealed that some of these core ideas are actually dead ends br Joanna Stern of The Wall Street Journal echoed this sentiment arguing that it was the best mixed reality headset I ve ever tried and so much of what the Vision Pro can do feels sci fi but that these companies know these aren t really the devices we want They re all working toward building virtual experiences into something that looks more like a pair of regular eyeglasses Until then they re just messing with our heads br br br Public response br Reviews from buyers of Apple Vision Pro have been mixed One person attempted to drive while using the device which Apple warns against in the Apple Vision Pro user manual Other users posted videos of themselves using the device while walking a feature not officially supported at launch br Some have experimented with cooking while wearing the headset which is not recommended by Apple This allows users to easily see step by step instructions while cooking Its use has also been documented as a potential tool in the operating room additional use cases include education productivity sales collaboration and digital twins br br br Defects br Shortly after launch some owners reported hairline cracks spontaneously appearing on the front display above the nose bridge br br br See also br List of virtual reality headsets br
