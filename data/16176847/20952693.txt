title: IOS jailbreaking
id: 20952693
iOS jailbreaking is the use of a privilege escalation exploit to remove software restrictions imposed by Apple on devices running iOS and iOS based operating systems It is typically done through a series of kernel patches A jailbroken device typically permits root access within the operating system and provides the right to install software unavailable through the App Store Different devices and versions are exploited with a variety of tools Apple views jailbreaking as a violation of the end user license agreement and strongly cautions device owners not to try to achieve root access through the exploitation of vulnerabilities br While sometimes compared to rooting an Android device jailbreaking bypasses several types of Apple prohibitions for the end user Since it includes modifying the operating system enforced by a locked bootloader installing non officially approved not available on the App Store applications via sideloading and granting the user elevated administration level privileges rooting the concepts of iOS jailbreaking are therefore technically different from Android device rooting br br br Motivation br Expanding the feature set that Apple and its App Store have restricted is one of the motivations for jailbreaking Apple checks apps for compliance with its iOS Developer Program License Agreement before accepting them for distribution in the App Store However the reasons for Apple to ban apps are not limited to safety and security and may be regarded as arbitrary and capricious In one case Apple mistakenly banned an app by a Pulitzer Winning cartoonist because it violated its developer license agreement which specifically bans apps that contain content that ridicules public figures To access banned apps users rely on jailbreaking to circumvent Apple s censorship of content and features Jailbreaking permits the downloading of programs not approved by Apple such as user interface customization and tweaks br br br Device customization br Software programs that are available through APT or Installer app legacy are not required to adhere to App Store guidelines Most of them are not typical self contained apps but instead are extensions and customizations for iOS or other apps commonly called tweaks Users can install these programs for purposes including personalization and customization of the interface using tweaks developed by developers and designers adding desired features such as access to the root file system and fixing annoyances and making development work on the device easier by providing access to the file system and command line tools Many Chinese iOS device owners also jailbreak their phones to install third party Chinese character input systems because they are easier to use than Apple s br In some cases jailbreak features are adopted by Apple and used as inspiration for features that are incorporated into iOS and iPadOS br br br Carrier unlocking br Jailbreaking also opens the possibility for using software to unofficially unlock carrier locked iPhones so they can be used with other carriers Software based unlocks have been available since September with each tool applying to a specific iPhone model and baseband version or multiple models and versions This includes the iPhone S iPhone iPhone GS and iPhone G models An example of unlocking an iPhone through a Jailbreak utility would be Redsn w Through this software iPhone users will be able to create a custom IPSW and unlock their device Moreover during the unlocking process there are options to install Cydia the iPad baseband br br br Installation of malware br Cybercriminals may jailbreak an iPhone to install malware or target jailbroken iPhones on which malware can be installed more easily The Italian cybersecurity company Hacking Team which sells hacking software to law enforcement agencies advised police to jailbreak iPhones to allow tracking software to be installed on them br br br Software piracy br On iOS devices the installation of consumer software is generally restricted to installation through the App Store Jailbreaking therefore allows the installation of pirated applications It has been suggested that a major motivation for Apple to prevent jailbreaking is to protect the income of its App Store including third party developers and allow the buildup of a sustainable market for third party software However the installation of pirated applications is also possible without jailbreaking taking advantage of enterprise certificates to facilitate the distribution of modified or pirated releases of popular applications br br br Package managers br A package manager or package management system is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing upgrading configuring and removing computer programs For jailbreaks this is essential for the installation of third party content There are a few package managers specifically for jailbroken iOS devices of which the most popular are Cydia Sileo Zebra and Installer br br br Security of the device br Once a device is jailbroken the built in security is compromised due to the vast amount of kernel patches that go into building the tool Security structures like Apple Mobile File Integrity Sandbox Read Only Root File system and trusted apps get disabled or otherwise tampered with to achieve the goals of the jailbreaking tool This in turn creates potential security issues for the user of a jailbroken device br Users of a jailbroken device are also often forced to stay on an inferior iOS version that is no longer supported by Apple because newer versions usually cannot be jailbroken right away This has the potential to introduce security issues because for these older versions there are known security vulnerabilities exploits and exploit proof of concepts published br In March jailbreak developer GeoSn w released a tweak called iSecureOS which can alert the users of security issues found on their devices The application works akin to antivirus software in that it scans the files on the user s device and checks them against a database of known malware or unsafe repos br In June ESET Research confirmed that malware did exist on one of the piracy repositories in the jailbreak community The malware actively targeted iSecureOS to try to bypass the detection but updates to the security app were quickly released and have mitigated the malware br br br Comparison to Android rooting br Jailbreaking of iOS devices has sometimes been compared to rooting of Android devices Although both concepts involve privilege escalation they do differ in scope br Where Android rooting and jailbreaking are similar is that both are used to grant the owner of the device superuser system level privileges which may be transferred to one or more apps However unlike iOS phones and tablets nearly all Android devices already offer an option to allow the user to sideload rd party apps onto the device without having to install from an official source such as the Google Play store Many Android devices also provide owners the capability to modify or even replace the full operating system after unlocking the bootloader although doing this requires a factory reset br In contrast iOS devices are engineered with restrictions including a locked bootloader which can not be unlocked by the owner to modify the operating system without violating Apple s end user license agreement And on iOS until while corporations could install private applications onto corporate phones sideloading unsanctioned rd party apps onto iOS devices from sources other than the App Store was prohibited for most individual users without a purchased developer membership After the ability to install rd party apps became free for all users however doing so requires a basic understanding of Xcode and compiling iOS apps br Jailbreaking an iOS device to defeat all these security restrictions presents a significant technical challenge Similar to Android alternative iOS app stores utilizing enterprise certificates are available offering modified or pirated releases of popular applications and video games some of which were either previously released through Cydia or are unavailable on the App Store due to these apps not complying with Apple developer guidelines br br br Tools br br br Types br Many different types of jailbreaks have been developed over the years differing in how and when the exploit is applied br br br Untethered br When a jailbroken device is booting it loads Apple s own boot software initially The device is then exploited and the kernel is patched every time it is turned on An untethered jailbreak is a jailbreak that does not require any assistance when it reboots up The kernel will be patched without the help of a computer or an application br br br Tethered br A tethered jailbreak is the opposite of an untethered jailbreak in the sense that a computer is required to boot the device Without a computer running the jailbreaking software the iOS device will not be able to boot at all While using a tethered jailbreak the user will still be able to restart kill the device s SpringBoard process without needing to reboot Many early jailbreaks were offered initially as tethered jailbreaks br br br Semi tethered br This type of jailbreak allows a user to reboot their phone normally but upon doing so the jailbreak and any modified code will be effectively disabled as it will have an unpatched kernel Any functionality independent of the jailbreak will still run as normal such as making a phone call texting or using App Store applications To be able to have a patched kernel and run modified code again the device must be booted using a computer br br br Semi untethered br This type of jailbreak is like a semi tethered jailbreak in which when the device reboots it no longer has a patched kernel but the key difference is that the kernel can be patched without using a computer The kernel is usually patched using an application installed on the device without patches This type of jailbreak has become increasingly popular with most recent jailbreaks classified as semi untethered br br br History of tools br br br JailbreakMe and AppSnapp br A few days after the original iPhone became available in July developers released the first jailbreaking tool for it and soon a jailbreak only game app became available In October JailbreakMe also called AppSnapp allowed people to jailbreak iPhone OS on both the iPhone and iPod Touch and it included Installer app as a way to get software for the jailbroken device br br br ZiPhone br In February Zibri released ZiPhone a tool for jailbreaking iPhone OS and iPhone OS br br br PwnageTool br The iPhone Dev Team which is not affiliated with Apple has released a series of free desktop based jailbreaking tools In July it released a version of PwnageTool to jailbreak the then new iPhone G on iPhone OS as well as the iPod Touch newly including Cydia as the primary third party installer for jailbroken software PwnageTool continues to be updated for untethered jailbreaks of newer iOS versions br br br QuickPwn br In November the iPhone Dev Team released QuickPwn to jailbreak iPhone OS on iPhone and iPod Touch with options to enable past functionality that Apple had disabled on certain devices br br br redsn w br After Apple released iPhone OS in June the Dev Team published redsn w as a simple jailbreaking tool for Mac and Windows and also updated PwnageTool primarily intended for expert users making custom firmware and only for Mac It continues to maintain redsn w for jailbreaking most versions of iOS and iOS on most devices br br br purplera n blackra n br George Hotz developed the first iPhone unlock which was a hardware based solution Later in he released a jailbreaking tool for the iPhone G and iPhone GS on iPhone OS called purplera n and blackra n for iPhone OS version on the rd generation iPod Touch and other devices br br br limera n br In October George Hotz released limera n a low level boot ROM exploit that permanently works to jailbreak the iPhone and is used as a part of tools including redsn w br br br Spirit and JailbreakMe br Nicholas Allegra better known as comex released a program called Spirit in May Spirit jailbreaks devices including iPhones running iPhone OS and iPad running iPhone OS In August comex released JailbreakMe the first web based tool to jailbreak the iPhone on iOS br In July he released JailbreakMe a web based tool for jailbreaking all devices on certain versions of iOS including the iPad for the first time on iOS It used a flaw in PDF file rendering in mobile Safari br br br Greenpois n br Chronic Dev Team initially released Greenpois n in October a desktop based tool for untethered jailbreaking iOS and later iOS on most devices including the Apple TV as well as iOS on CDMA Verizon iPhones br br br ultrasn w br As of December redsn w included the Corona untether by pod g for iOS for iPhone GS iPhone iPad st generation and iPod Touch rd and th generation As of June redsn w also includes the Rocky Racoon untether by pod g for iOS on all iPhone iPad and iPod Touch models that support iOS br br br Absinthe br The iPhone Dev Team Chronic Dev Team and pod g collaborated to release Absinthe in January a desktop based tool to jailbreak the iPhone S for the first time and the iPad for the second time on iOS for both devices and also iOS for iPhone S In May it released Absinthe which can jailbreak iOS untethered on all iPhone iPad and iPod Touch models that support iOS including jailbreaking the third generation iPad for the first time br br br evasi n br An iOS X untethered jailbreak tool called evasi n was released for Linux OS X and Windows on February Due to the high volume of interest in downloading the jailbreak utility the site initially gave anticipating users download errors When Apple upgraded its software to iOS it permanently patched out the evasi n jailbreak br br br TaiG br On November TaiG team released their untethered jailbreak tool called TaiG for devices running iOS On December the app was updated to include support for iOS On July TaiG was released which includes support for iOS br br br Pangu br On October Pangu Team released Pangu their untethered jailbreak tool for iOS through On March Pangu Team updated their tool to support iOS for bit devices br br br Table of tools br br br History of exploit disabling patch releases br Apple has released various updates to iOS that patch exploits used by jailbreak utilities this includes a patch released in iOS to software exploits used by the original evasi n iOS jailbreak in iOS patching the Evasi n jailbreak for iOS beta Boot ROM exploits exploits found in the hardware of the device cannot be patched by Apple system updates but can be fixed in hardware revisions such as new chips or new hardware in its entirety as occurred with the iPhone GS in br On July Apple released a new iOS version that closed the exploit used in JailbreakMe The German Federal Office for Information Security had reported that JailbreakMe uncovered the critical weakness that information could be stolen or malware unwillingly downloaded by iOS users clicking on maliciously crafted PDF files br On August Apple updated iOS to patching the TaiG exploit Pangu and Taig teams both said they were working on exploiting iOS and Pangu demonstrated these chances at the WWDC br On September iOS was announced and made available it was released with a new Rootless security system dubbed a heavy blow to the jailbreaking community br On October seven days after the Pangu iOS Jailbreak release Apple pushed the iOS update which contained a patch that rendered it nonfunctional br On January Apple released iOS to patch jailbreak exploits released by Google for the Yalu iOS jailbreak created by Luca Todesco br On December Apple used DMCA takedown requests to remove posts from Twitter The tweet contained an encryption key that could potentially be used to reverse engineer the iPhone s Secure Enclave Apple later retracted the claim and the tweet was reinstated br On June Apple released the update patching the day exploit used by the Unc ver jailbreak br On September Apple released iOS iPadOS which introduced signed system volume security to iOS iPadOS meaning that any changes to the root file system would revert to the latest snapshot on a reboot and changes to the snapshot would make the device unbootable As a result jailbreak development slowed considerably and for the first time in jailbreaking history the latest iPhone did not get a jailbreak before a new model was released br On September Apple released iOS which introduced a new firmware component known as Cryptex New Cryptex versions are almost never compatible with old iOS versions making downgrading impossible except within patch versions i e and br br br Legality br The legal status of jailbreaking is affected by laws regarding circumvention of digital locks such as laws protecting digital rights management DRM mechanisms Many countries do not have such laws and some countries have laws including exceptions for jailbreaking br International treaties have influenced the development of laws affecting jailbreaking The World Intellectual Property Organization WIPO Copyright Treaty requires nations party to the treaties to enact laws against DRM circumvention The American implementation is the Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA which includes a process for establishing exemptions for non copyright infringing purposes such as jailbreaking The European Copyright Directive implemented the treaty in Europe requiring member states of the European Union to implement legal protections for technological protection measures The Copyright Directive includes exceptions to allow breaking those measures for non copyright infringing purposes such as jailbreaking to run alternative software but member states vary on the implementation of the directive br While Apple technically does not support jailbreaking as a violation of its EULA jailbreaking communities have generally not been legally threatened by Apple At least two prominent jailbreakers have been given positions at Apple albeit in at least one case a temporary one Apple has also regularly credited jailbreak developers with detecting security holes in iOS release notes br Apple s support article concerning jailbreaking claims that they may deny service for an iPhone iPad or iPod Touch that has installed any unauthorized software which includes jailbreaking br br br Australia br In Electronic Frontiers Australia said that it is unclear whether jailbreaking is legal in Australia and that anti circumvention laws may apply These laws had been strengthened by the Copyright Amendment Act br br br Canada br In November Canada amended its Copyright Act with new provisions prohibiting tampering with DRM protection with exceptions including software interoperability Jailbreaking a device to run alternative software is a form of circumventing digital locks for the purpose of software interoperability br There had been several efforts from to amend the Copyright Act Bill C Bill C and Bill C to prohibit tampering with digital locks along with initial proposals for C that were more restrictive but those bills were set aside In Michael Geist a Canadian copyright scholar cited iPhone jailbreaking as a non copyright related activity that overly broad Copyright Act amendments could prohibit br br br India br India s copyright law permits circumventing DRM for non copyright infringing purposes Parliament introduced a bill including this DRM provision in and passed it in as Copyright Amendment Bill India is not a signatory to the WIPO Copyright Treaty that requires laws against DRM circumvention but being listed on the US Special Report Priority Watch List applied pressure to develop stricter copyright laws in line with the WIPO treaty br br br New Zealand br New Zealand s copyright law allows the use of technological protection measure TPM circumvention methods as long as the use is for legal non copyright infringing purposes This law was added to the Copyright Act as part of the Copyright New Technologies Amendment Act br br br Singapore br Jailbreaking might be legal in Singapore if done to provide interoperability and not circumvent copyright but that has not been tested in court br br br United Kingdom br The law Copyright and Related Rights Regulations makes circumventing DRM protection measures legal for the purpose of interoperability but not copyright infringement Jailbreaking may be a form of circumvention covered by that law but this has not been tested in court Competition laws may also be relevant br br br United States br The main law that affects the legality of iOS jailbreaking in the United States is the Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA which says no person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under the DMCA since this may apply to jailbreaking Every three years the law allows the public to propose exemptions for legitimate reasons for circumvention which last three years if approved In and the U S Copyright Office approved exemptions that allowed smartphone users to jailbreak their devices legally and in the Copyright Office approved an expanded exemption that also covers other all purpose mobile computing devices such as tablets It is still possible Apple may employ technical countermeasures to prevent jailbreaking or prevent jailbroken phones from functioning It is unclear whether it is legal to traffic in the tools used to make jailbreaking easy br In Apple announced that jailbreaking can violate the warranty br br br Digital Millennium Copyright Act exemptions br In Tim Wu a professor at Columbia Law School argued that jailbreaking Apple s superphone is legal ethical and just plain fun Wu cited an explicit exemption issued by the Library of Congress in for personal carrier unlocking which notes that locks are used by wireless carriers to limit the ability of subscribers to switch to other carriers a business decision that has nothing whatsoever to do with the interests protected by copyright and thus do not implicate the DMCA Wu did not claim that this exemption applies to those who help others unlock a device or traffic in software to do so br In in response to a request by the Electronic Frontier Foundation the U S Copyright Office explicitly recognized an exemption to the DMCA to permit jailbreaking in order to allow iPhone owners to use their phones with applications that are not available from Apple s store and to unlock their iPhones for use with unapproved carriers Apple had previously filed comments opposing this exemption and indicated that it had considered jailbreaking to be a violation of copyright and by implication prosecutable under the DMCA Apple s request to define copyright law to include jailbreaking as a violation was denied as part of the DMCA rulemaking In their ruling the Library of Congress affirmed on July that jailbreaking is exempt from DMCA rules with respect to circumventing digital locks DMCA exemptions must be reviewed and renewed every three years or else they expire br On October the US Copyright Office released a new exemption ruling The jailbreaking of smartphones continued to be legal where circumvention is accomplished for the sole purpose of enabling interoperability of lawfully obtained software applications with computer programs on the telephone handset However the U S Copyright office refused to extend this exemption to tablets such as iPads arguing that the term tablets is broad and ill defined and an exemption to this class of devices could have unintended side effects The Copyright Office also renewed the exemption for unofficially unlocking phones to use them on unapproved carriers but restricted this exemption to phones purchased before January In these exemptions were extended to include other devices including tablets br br br Risks br br br Security privacy and stability br The first iPhone worm iKee appeared in early November created by a year old Australian student in the town of Wollongong He told Australian media that he created the worm to raise awareness of security issues jailbreaking allows users to install an SSH service which those users can leave in the default insecure state In the same month F Secure reported on a new malicious worm compromising bank transactions from jailbroken phones in the Netherlands similarly affecting devices where the owner had installed SSH without changing the default password br Restoring a device with iTunes removes a jailbreak However doing so generally updates the device to the latest and possibly non jailbreakable version due to Apple s use of SHSH blobs There are many applications that aim to prevent this by restoring the devices to the same version they are currently running whilst removing the jailbreaks Examples are Succession Semi Restore and Cydia Eraser br In Forbes staff analyzed a UCSB study on free programs available from Apple and a third party source Of the free apps investigated were downloaded from Apple s App Store using the website App Tracker and from BigBoss Cydia s default repository of official apps tested leaked device ID and leaked location Unofficial apps leaked and respectively of apps from Cydia leaked photos and browsing history while the App Store leaked none Unauthorized apps tended to respect privacy better than official ones Also a program available in Cydia called PrivaCy allows user to control the upload of usage statistics to remote servers br In August the KeyRaider malware was discovered affecting only jailbroken iPhones br br br Fake scam jailbreaks br In recent years due to the technical complexity and often rarity of legitimate jailbreaking software especially untethered jailbreaks there has been an increase in websites offering fake iOS jailbreaks These websites often ask for payment or make heavy use of advertising but have no actual jailbreak to offer Others install a fake lookalike version of the Cydia package manager In some cases users have been asked to download free to play apps or fill out surveys to complete a non existent jailbreak br br br See also br Hacking of consumer electronics br iOS version
