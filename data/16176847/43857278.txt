HomeKit also known as Apple Home is a software framework and communication protocol developed by Apple Inc that lets users configure communicate with and control smart home appliances using Apple devices It provides users with a way to automatically discover such devices and configure them By designing rooms items and actions in HomeKit users can enable automations in the home through a voice command to Siri or through the Home app With HomeKit developers are able to create complex applications in order to manage accessories at a high level br br br Overview br HomeKit was first introduced on iPhones and iPads on September with iOS The framework allowed third party apps to interface with HomeKit devices using Siri and allow remote access through home hubs br HomeKit was created to make tasks inside the home easier and provide users with methods and tools to change and adapt certain home capabilities to their specific desires HomeKit manages connected home appliances through the HomeKit Accessory Protocol HAP Messages from HomeKit are continuously sent to powered devices which incorporate fields which recognize the specific accessory and what category it is under Each category has a code that is used to identify what the device is It also identifies with the Global State Number GSN This number is increased each time that the state of the accessory is altered Like most Apple devices Apple Continuity Protocols are used Continuity protocols consist of wireless technologies such as Bluetooth and Wi Fi They can be conducted through device to device connection br HomeKit uses Bluetooth and Wi Fi protocols On HomePods and some Apple TVs Thread is also used to connect and communicate with devices Manufacturers of HomeKit enabled devices are required to enroll in the MFi Program Apple also used to provide documentation for creating non commercial HomeKit accessories to any member of the Apple Developer Programme Initially all HomeKit based products were required to include an encryption co processor The latter requirement was later changed in iOS which added support for software based authentication Equipment manufactured without HomeKit support can be enabled for use through a gateway product such as a bridge that connects those devices to the HomeKit service br HomeKit primarily competes with smart home standards from Amazon and Google As of October Apple lists devices compatible with HomeKit compared to for Google and for Amazon br br br Home app br The Home app which unifies all devices into one app was introduced on iPhones and iPads on September with iOS and on Apple Watches with watchOS The app also added support for automations using a home hub and preprogrammed scenes which can set multiple devices using a single command With iOS Home received a major redesign which aimed to make the app easier to navigate and the architecture of the program was rebuilt from the ground up to be more efficient for users with multiple HomeKit enabled devices HomeKit toggles can also be added to the Control Center allowing control over connected devices without having to use Siri or open the Home app iOS brings guest access hands free unlocking of locks in app electricity usage integration and the ability to unlock locks using Express Mode with an iPhone that is out of battery br The Home app was introduced on Macs with macOS Mojave which was released on September br br br Apple TV HomePod br Fourth generation and newer Apple TVs can control HomeKit devices using Siri voice commands tvOS which was released on September added direct control of HomeKit devices in Control Center and camera feeds and picture in picture monitoring for HomeKit enabled security cameras Neither the HomePod nor Apple TV can unlock or open secure appliances like locks br The HomePod supported HomeKit at launch in February as did the HomePod Mini in They lack a graphical user interface to control HomeKit devices and instead uses Siri voice commands br br br Home hubs br As of iOS Apple TVs th generation or newer and HomePods are fully supported as home hubs to control HomeKit appliances remotely grant guest access and set up automations Support for Thread is included in the HomePod Mini second generation HomePod and Apple TV K nd generation and later Automations based on temperature and humidity are supported by the HomePod Mini and second generation HomePod br iPads supporting iOS or later can be used as a home hub but were deprecated with iPadOS iPads do not support Matter and new architectures that were extended to Apple TV and HomePod but retain all functionality introduced before iPadOS The third generation Apple TV only supports remote access and supported automations before iOS br Coming in iOS users will be able to choose which device is their home hub br br br Device categories br HomeKit currently supports the following device categories an extended list br br Garage doors locks security systems and windows are categorized as secure appliances and require a device with authentication such as an iPhone or iPad to unlock br br br Matter support br On December Apple announced that it will be working closely with Samsung Amazon and Google to create an open standard for smart home automation called Matter Matter aims to reduce fragmentation across different vendors and achieve interoperability among smart home devices and Internet of things IoT platforms from different providers The project was delayed to fall due to unprecedented interest by the Connectivity Standards Alliance CSA Version of Matter was published on the October Matter has been supported by Apple devices since iOS and its forks br br br See also br HomePod br Apple TV br IFTTT br Matter standard br
