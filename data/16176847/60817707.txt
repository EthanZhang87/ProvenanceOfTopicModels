HarmonyOS HMOS Chinese pinyin H ngm ng is a distributed operating system developed by Huawei for smartphones tablets smart TVs smart watches personal computers and other smart devices It has a multi kernel design with dual frameworks the operating system selects suitable kernels from the abstraction layer in the case of devices that use diverse resources br HarmonyOS was officially launched by Huawei and first used in Honor smart TVs in August It was later used in Huawei wireless routers IoT in followed by smartphones tablets and smartwatches from June br The operating system was initially based on code from the Android Open Source Project AOSP and the Linux kernel many Android apps can be sideloaded on HarmonyOS br The next iteration of HarmonyOS known as HarmonyOS NEXT was announced on August It replaces the OpenHarmony multi kernel system with its own HarmonyOS microkernel at its core removes all Android code and supports only apps in its native App format It is currently in beta testing and is expected to launch in the fourth quarter of br br br Architecture br HarmonyOS is designed with a layered architecture which consists of four layers the kernel layer at the bottom provides the upper three layers i e the system service layer framework layer and application layer with basic kernel capabilities such as process and thread management memory management file system network management and peripheral management br The kernel layer incorporates a subsystem that accommodates multiple kernels such as the Linux kernel LiteOS and HarmonyOS microkernel catering to diverse smart devices Depending on the device type different kernels can be selected for instance LiteOS is chosen for low power devices like watches and IoT devices to execute lightweight HarmonyOS apps whereas large memory devices like mobile phones tablets and PCs utilize the Linux kernel alongside the OpenHarmony framework for running HarmonyOS apps and the AOSP source code for Android apps This dual app framework was replaced with a single app framework in HarmonyOS Next supporting only native HarmonyOS apps br The system includes a communication base called DSoftBus for integrating physically separate devices into a virtual Super Device allowing one device to control others and sharing data among devices with distributed communication capabilities To address security concerns arising from varying devices the system provides a hardware based Trusted Execution Environment TEE microkernel to prevent leakage of sensitive personal data when they are stored or processed br It supports several forms of apps including native apps that can be installed from AppGallery installation free Quick apps and lightweight Meta Services accessible by users on various devices br br br History br br br Early development br Reports surrounding an in house operating system being developed by Huawei date back as far as in R D stages with HarmonyOS NEXT system stack going back as early as These reports intensified during the Sino American trade war after the United States Department of Commerce added Huawei to its Entity List in May under an indictment that it knowingly exported goods technology and services of U S origin to Iran in violation of sanctions This prohibited U S based companies from doing business with Huawei without first obtaining a license from the government Huawei executive Richard Yu described an in house platform as a plan B in case it is prevented from using Android on future smartphone products due to the sanctions br Prior to its unveiling it was originally speculated to be a mobile operating system that could replace Android on future Huawei devices In June an Huawei executive told Reuters that the OS was under testing in China and could be ready in months but by July some Huawei executives described the OS as being an embedded operating system designed for IoT hardware discarding the previous statements for it to be a mobile operating system br Some media outlets reported that this OS referred to as Hongmeng could be released in China in either August or September with a worldwide release in the second quarter of On May Huawei registered Hongmeng as a trademark in China The name Hongmeng Chinese lit Vast Mist came from Chinese mythology that symbolizes primordial chaos or the world before creation The same day Huawei registered trademarks surrounding Ark OS and variants with the European Union Intellectual Property Office In July it was reported that Huawei had also registered trademarks surrounding the word Harmony for desktop and mobile operating system software indicating either a different name or a component of the OS br br br Framework transitions br Early versions of HarmonyOS starting from version employed a kernel abstraction layer KAL subsystem to support a multi kernel architecture This allowed developers to choose different operating system kernels based on the resources available on each device For low powered devices such as wearables and Huawei s GT smartwatches HarmonyOS utilized the LiteOS kernel instead of Linux It also integrated the LiteOS SDK for TV applications and ensured compatibility with Android apps through the Ark Compiler and a dual framework approach HarmonyOS s original L L source code branch was contributed to the OpenAtom Foundation to accelerate system development br HarmonyOS introduced a modified version of OpenHarmony s L L source code expanding its compatibility across smartphones and tablets Underneath the kernel abstraction layer KAL subsystem HarmonyOS used the Linux kernel and the AOSP codebase This setup enabled Android APK files and App Bundles AAB to run natively similar to older Huawei EMUI based devices without needing root access br Additionally HarmonyOS supported native apps packaged for Huawei Mobile Services through the Ark Compiler leveraging the OpenHarmony framework within its dual framework structure at the System Service Layer This configuration allowed the operating system to run apps developed with restricted HarmonyOS APIs br Until the release of HarmonyOS known as HarmonyOS NEXT using its microkernel within a single framework the operating system employed a dual framework approach for Huawei s HarmonyOS devices with the AOSP codebase br br br Release br br On August three months after the Entity List ban Huawei publicly unveiled HarmonyOS which Huawei said it had been working on since at its inaugural developers conference in Dongguan Huawei described HarmonyOS as a free microkernel based distributed operating system for various types of hardware The company focused primarily on IoT devices including smart TVs wearable devices and in car entertainment systems and did not explicitly position HarmonyOS as a mobile OS br HarmonyOS launched at the Huawei Developer Conference on September Huawei announced it intended to ship the operating system on its smartphones in The first developer beta of HarmonyOS was launched on December Huawei also released the DevEco Studio IDE which is based on IntelliJ IDEA and a cloud emulator for developers in early access br Huawei officially released HarmonyOS and launched new devices shipping with the OS in June and started rolling out system upgrades to Huawei s older phones for users gradually br On July Huawei launched HarmonyOS providing an improved experience across multiple devices such as smartphones tablets printers cars and TVs It also launched Petal Chuxing a ride hailing app running on the new version of the operating system br On June Huawei launched the first developer beta of HarmonyOS On August Huawei officially announced and released HarmonyOS as a public beta On August it rolled the operating system out on different existing Huawei smartphone and tablet devices albeit as a public beta build Alongside HarmonyOS Huawei also announced the launch of HarmonyOS NEXT which is a pure HarmonyOS version without Android libraries and therefore incompatible with Android apps post software convergence br On January Huawei announced commercialisation of HarmonyOS NEXT with Galaxy stable version rollout which will begin in Q based on OpenHarmony API version after OpenHarmony API based Q Developer Beta after release of public developer access of HarmonyOS NEXT Developer Preview that has been in the hands of closed cooperative developers partners since August debut The new system of upcoming HarmonyOS version that replaced HarmonyOS multi kernel dual frame system convergence for unified system stack of the unified app ecosystem for commercial Huawei consumer devices br On March Huawei announced the early recruitment for the new test experience version of Huawei HarmonyOS firmware update that includes performance improvements purer and better user experiences HarmonyOS version C E R P of the firmware was gradually rolled out on March br On April it has been reported that Huawei opened the registration and rolled out public beta of HarmonyOS for devices On the same day the company announced its incoming HarmonyOS operating system version of Galaxy Edition version under HarmonyOS NEXT system that will first be released as open beta program for developers and users at its annual Huawei Developer Conference in June before Q commercial consumer release with upcoming Mate flagship among other ecosystem devices br On April Huawei Pura flagship series lineup received HarmonyOS update after release br On April Huawei s chairman Eric Xu revealed plans to push native HarmonyOS NEXT system for next gen HarmonyOS in global markets as the company s focus at Huawei s Analyst Summit HAS to Chinese and international press which was reported in various international outlets on April br On May during the HarmonyOS Developer Day HDD event Huawei announced HarmonyOS upgrade with the new HarmonyOS NEXT base will begin commercial use by September with over million units of devices and apps in use for a target of apps at launch br On June during Huawei Developer Conference HDC keynote Huawei announced HarmonyOS NEXT Developer Beta for registered developers and pioneer users on limited models such as Huawei Mate Series Huawei Mate X Series and Huawei MatePad Pro tablet The consumer beta version is expected to be released in August while the stable build to be made available in Q During the conference Huawei formerly announced in house Cangjie programming language for the new native system alongside releasing the Developer Preview Beta recruitment program br br br Features br br br User interface br The HarmonyOS interface is overhauled with native HarmonyOS Design system for the native launcher system that has an emphasis on vivid system colours and reflective spatial visual of light blur glow with glassmorphism and neumorphism soft UI that is a medium between skeuomorphism and flat design In addition to standard folders that require tapping on them to display their contents folders can be enlarged to always show their contents without text labels directly on the home screen br Apps can support snippets which expose a portion of the app s functionality such as a media player s controls or a weather forecast via an iOS style pop up window by swiping left after holding the app icon in context menu and can be pinned to the home screen as a widget Apps and services can provide cards as of HarmonyOS cards can also be displayed as widgets with different sizes and shapes to adapt to the home screen layout and can also be stacked br The user interface font of HarmonyOS on HarmonyOS Next base is HarmonyOS Sans It is designed to be easy to read unique and universal The system font was used throughout the operating system alongside previous Android based EMUI and up including third party HarmonyOS and former Android apps br br br Software br br br Traditional apps br Unlike Meta Services that are installation free traditional apps need installation They are available to users through Huawei AppGallery which serves as the application store for HarmonyOS with HarmonyOS native apps HarmonyOS native apps have access to capabilities such as distributed communications and cards br br br Quick apps br Similar to applets Quick apps were single page apps written using JavaScript and CSS with code volume about one fifth of that of a traditional app They are developed based on the industry standards formulated by the Quick App Alliance comprising mainstream mobile phone manufacturers in China br Quick apps are available to users through the AppGallery Quick App Center Huawei Assistant etc on supported devices They are installation free updated automatically and their shortcuts can be added by users to the

play back media saved inside a smartphone through a paired PC smart TV or speakers share PC screen recordings back to a smartphone run multiple phone apps in a PC window share files between a paired smartphone and PC share application states between the paired devices etc br br br NearLink br Incorporated into HarmonyOS NearLink previously known as SparkLink is a set of standards that combine the strengths of traditional wireless technologies like Bluetooth and Wi Fi while emphasizing improved performance in areas like response time energy efficiency signal range and security It consists of two access modes SparkLink Low Energy SLE and SparkLink Basic SLB SLE is designed for low power consumption low latency and high reliability applications with a data transmission rate reportedly up to times that of Bluetooth SLB is tailored for high speed high capacity and high precision applications with a data transmission rate reportedly around times that of Wi Fi br br br Hardware br HarmonyOS platform was not designed for a single device at the beginning but developed as a distributed operating system for various devices with memory sizes ranging from KB to over GB Hence the hardware requirements are flexible for the operating system and it may only need KB of memory for a variety of smart terminal devices br br br Devices supported at launch br br Huawei stated that HarmonyOS would initially be used on devices targeting the Chinese market The company s former subsidiary brand Honor unveiled the Honor Vision line of smart TVs as the first consumer electronics devices to run HarmonyOS in August The HarmonyOS beta launched on December and supported the P series P series Mate series Mate series P series and the MatePad Pro br Stable HarmonyOS was released for smartphones and tablets as updates for the P and Mate X in June New Huawei Watch MatePad Pro and PixLab X desktop printer models shipping with HarmonyOS were also unveiled at the time In October HarmonyOS had over million users br br br Development br The primary IDE known as DevEco Studio for developing HarmonyOS apps was released by Huawei on September based on IntelliJ IDEA and Huawei s SmartAssist The IDE includes DevEco Device Tool an integrated development tool for customizing HarmonyOS components coding compiling and visual debugging similar to other third party IDEs such as Visual Studio Code for Windows Linux and macOS br Applications for HarmonyOS are mostly built using components of ArkUI a Declarative User Interface framework ArkUI elements are adaptable to various devices and include new interface rules with automatic updates along with HarmonyOS updates br HarmonyOS uses App Pack files suffixed with app also known as APP files for distribution of software via AppGallery Each App Pack has one or more HarmonyOS Ability Packages HAP containing code for their abilities resources libraries and a JSON file with configuration information br HarmonyOS as a universal single IoT platform allows developers to write apps once and run everywhere across devices such as phones tablets personal computers TVs cars smartwatches single board computers under OpenHarmony and screen less IoT devices such as smart speakers br As of August there were reportedly over million developers participated in developing HarmonyOS apps br br br HarmonyOS ecosystem br br br HarmonyOS Connect br On May Huawei revealed a plan to upgrade its HarmonyOS Connect brand with a standard badge during a summit in Shanghai to help industrial partners in producing selling and operating products with third party OEMs as part of the HarmonyOS system framework and the Huawei Smart Life formerly Huawei AI Life app br Allowing for fast and low cost connections to users smart devices like speakers fridges and cookers of different brands powered by HarmonyOS can be connected and merged into a super device with a single touch of smartphone without the need to install apps Also HiLink protocols for mesh and wireless routers connectivity with devices alongside other smart devices that are platform agnostic that connects to HarmonyOS devices br The HarmonyOS Connect sets the platform apart from traditional mobile and computing platforms and the company s previous ecosystem attempts with its Android based EMUI and LiteOS connectivity in the past br br br HarmonyOS Cockpit br On April Huawei launched a smart cockpit solution powered by HarmonyOS for electric and autonomous cars powered by its Kirin line of a system on chip SoC solution Huawei opened up APIs to help automobile OEMs suppliers and ecosystem partners in developing features to meet user requirements br Huawei designed a modular SoC for cars that will be pluggable and easy to upgrade to maintain the peak performance

Huawei announced the launch of MineHarmony OS a customized operating system by Huawei based on its in house HarmonyOS for industrial use MineHarmony is compatible with about types of underground coal mining equipment providing the equipment with a single interface to transmit and collect data for analysis Wang Chenglu President of Huawei s consumer business AI and smart full scenario business department indicated that the launch of MineHarmony OS signified that the HarmonyOS ecology had taken a step further from B C to B B br br br Market share br On December Richard Yu CEO of Huawei Consumer Business Group claimed that HarmonyOS had reached million smartphones and other smart devices including million devices in the ecosystem and million third party consumer products from industry partners br Market research conducted in China by Strategy Analytics showed that Harmony OS was the third largest smartphone platform after Apple iOS and Google Android reaching a record high of market share in China during the first quarter of up from zero just a year earlier This increase in market share took place after the operating system was also launched for smartphone devices in June br The research claimed that in the first quarter of the platform outgrew its rivals such as Android and Apple iOS from a low install base of about million smart devices overall particularly due to the good support in China and the HarmonyOS software upgrades that Huawei made available for its older handset models and its former sub brands such as Honor br On August after the soft launch of HarmonyOS Sina Finance part of Sina Corporation and Huawei Central reported that the number of Huawei HarmonyOS Connect devices had exceeded million units By summer OpenHarmony distributions had been launched br In the third quarter of HarmonyOS captured a share of the global smartphone market and within China despite Huawei s limitation to LTE at the time At the launch of HarmonyOS in August it was noted that the operating system had been integrated into over million devices By January during Huawei s HarmonyOS Ecology Conference in China this number had risen to over million devices as reported by Huawei br In the first quarter of HarmonyOS reached a market share globally and captured of the Chinese market surpassing iOS to become the second largest mobile platform domestically as reported by Counterpoint Research on May During the HDC keynote conference it was announced that HarmonyOS had reached million active users as of June br br br Relationship with OpenEuler br br In terms of architecture HarmonyOS has close relationship with OpenEuler which is a community edition of EulerOS as they have implemented the sharing of kernel technology as revealed by Deng Taihua President of Huawei s Computing Product Line The sharing is reportedly to be strengthened in the future in the areas of the distributed software bus system security app framework device driver framework and new programming language br br br Relationship between HarmonyOS and OpenHarmony br br OpenHarmony is an open source version of HarmonyOS donated by Huawei to the OpenAtom Foundation built around a LiteOS kernel descended from original LiteOS operating system It supports devices running a mini system such as printers speakers smartwatches and any other smart device with memory as small as KB or running a standard system with memory greater than MB The open source operating system contains the basic capabilities of HarmonyOS and does not depend on the Android Open Source Project AOSP code br br br HarmonyOS NEXT br br On August at Huawei Developers Conference HDC Huawei officially announced HarmonyOS NEXT the next iteration system version of HarmonyOS supporting only native APP apps via Ark Compiler with Huawei Mobile Services HMS and ending the support for Android apk apps br Built on a custom version of OpenHarmony and Oniro OS HarmonyOS NEXT proprietary system has the HarmonyOS microkernel at its core with a single framework departing from the common Linux kernel and aimed to replace the current multi kernel HarmonyOS br Among the first batch of over developers McDonald s and KFC in China became two of the first multinational food companies to adopt HarmonyOS Next br On September it was reported on Weibo social media in China that a former Huawei executive had claimed that HarmonyOS for PC would be released in br br br Controversies and issues br br br Trademarks br In May Huawei applied for registration of the trademark Hongmeng through the Chinese Patent Office CNIPA but the application was rejected in pursuance to Article of the PRC Trade Mark Law citing the trademark was similar to that of CRM Hongmeng in graphic design and Hongmeng in Chinese word br In less than a week before launching HarmonyOS and new devices by Huawei the Beijing Intellectual Property Court announced the first instance judgement in May to uphold the decision by CNIPA as the trademark was not sufficiently distinctive in terms of its designated services br However it was reported that the trademark had officially been transferred from Huizhou Qibei Technology to Huawei by end of May br br br Android fork br br When it launched the operating system Huawei stated that HarmonyOS plans to become a microkernel based distributed OS that was completely different from Android and iOS in terms of target market towards Internet of things A Huawei spokesperson subsequently stated that HarmonyOS supported multiple kernels and used a Linux kernel if a device had a large amount of RAM and that the company had taken advantage of a large number of third party open source resources including Linux kernel with POSIX APIs on OpenHarmony base as a foundation to accelerate the development of its unified system stack as a future proof microkernel based and distributed OS running on multiple devices which became the iterative HarmonyOS NEXT system br At its launch as an operating system for smartphones in HarmonyOS was however rumored by Ars Technica simply to be rebranded version of Android and EMUI with nearly identical code bases Following the release of the HarmonyOS beta Ars Technica and XDA Developers speculated that the smartphone version of the OS had been forked from Android Ars Technica alleged that it resembled the existing EMUI software used on Huawei devices but with all references to Android replaced by HarmonyOS which mobile version of the ecosystem branded operating system used customised EMUI that consists of both Android and up to including Android builds to build up the mobile userland base for legacy Huawei Android handsets The first DevEco Studio IDE version added both EMUI and HarmonyOS development that support for the new native app framework platform on September after a year in half on the Entity list by United States of May that restricted Huawei from accessing Google s proprietary GMS on Android prompting Huawei short term development on AOSP with EMUI for long term HarmonyOS migration It was also noted that the DevEco Studio software based on JetBrains open source IntelliJ IDEA IDE shared components and tool chains with Android Studio using Gradle for migration of Android development to the native app framework system newer basic HarmonyOS API infertile development in imperative Java programming with similar basic applications elements in API names with the custom OpenHarmony L L branch codebase that includes AOSP framework in the dual framework for Android Java developers during public domestic convergence OS development stages before moving to declarative ArkUI with primary customised TypeScript based ArkTS programming language and its own Hvigor build automation tool for its evolved DevEco Studio IDE in the later versions with apps packaged as APP outside of Android APK packaged apps br When testing the new MatePad Pro in June Android Authority and The Verge similarly observed similarities in behavior including that it was possible to install apps from Android APK files on the HarmonyOS based tablet and to run the Android easter egg apk app reaffirming earlier
