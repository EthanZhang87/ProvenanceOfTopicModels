title: Image file format
id: 2679981
An image file format is a file format for a digital image There are many formats that can be used such as JPEG PNG and GIF Most formats up until were for storing D images not D ones The data stored in an image file format may be compressed or uncompressed If the data is compressed it may be done so using lossy compression or lossless compression For graphic design applications vector formats are often used Some image file formats support transparency br Raster formats are for D images A D image can be represented within a D format as in a stereogram or autostereogram but this D image will not be a true light field and thereby may cause the vergence accommodation conflict br Image files are composed of digital data in one of these formats so that the data can be displayed on a digital computer display or printed out using a printer A common method for displaying digital image information has historically been rasterization br br br Image file sizes br The size of raster image files is positively correlated with the number of pixels in the image and the color depth bits per pixel Images can be compressed in various ways however A compression algorithm stores either an exact representation or an approximation of the original image in a smaller number of bytes that can be expanded back to its uncompressed form with a corresponding decompression algorithm Images with the same number of pixels and color depth can have very different compressed file size Considering exactly the same compression number of pixels and color depth for two images different graphical complexity of the original images may also result in very different file sizes after compression due to the nature of compression algorithms With some compression formats images that are less complex may result in smaller compressed file sizes This characteristic sometimes results in a smaller file size for some lossless formats than lossy formats For example graphically simple images i e images with large continuous regions like line art or animation sequences may be losslessly compressed into a GIF or PNG format and result in a smaller file size than a lossy JPEG format br For example a pixel image with bit color would occupy almost a megabyte of space br br bits bytes KiB br With vector images the file size increases only with the addition of more vectors br br br Image file compression br There are two types of image file compression algorithms lossless and lossy br Lossless compression algorithms reduce file size while preserving a perfect copy of the original uncompressed image Lossless compression generally but not always results in larger files than lossy compression Lossless compression should be used to avoid accumulating stages of re compression when editing images br Lossy compression algorithms preserve a representation of the original uncompressed image that may appear to be a perfect copy but is not a perfect copy Often lossy compression is able to achieve smaller file sizes than lossless compression Most lossy compression algorithms allow for variable compression that trades image quality for file size br br br Major graphic file formats br br Including proprietary types there are hundreds of image file types The PNG JPEG and GIF formats are most often used to display images on the Internet Some of these graphic formats are listed and briefly described below separated into the two main families of graphics raster and vector Raster images are further divided into formats primarily aimed at web delivery i e supporting relatively strong compression versus formats primarily aimed at authoring or interchange uncompressed or only relatively weak compression br In addition to straight image formats Metafile formats are portable formats which can include both raster and vector information Examples are application independent formats such as WMF and EMF The metafile format is an intermediate format Most applications open metafiles and then save them in their own native format Page description language refers to formats used to describe the layout of a printed page containing text objects and images Examples are PostScript PDF and PCL br br br Raster formats D br br br Delivery formats br br br JPEG br JPEG Joint Photographic Experts Group is a lossy compression method JPEG compressed images are usually stored in the JFIF JPEG File Interchange Format or the Exif Exchangeable image file format file format The JPEG filename extension is JPG or JPEG Nearly every digital camera can save images in the JPEG format which supports eight bit grayscale images and bit color images eight bits each for red green and blue JPEG applies lossy compression to images which can result in a significant reduction of the file size Applications can determine the degree of compression to apply and the amount of compression affects the visual quality of the result When not too great the compression does not noticeably affect or detract from the image s quality but JPEG files suffer generational degradation when repeatedly edited and saved JPEG also provides lossless image storage but the lossless version is not widely supported br br br GIF br The GIF Graphics Interchange Format is in normal use limited to an bit palette or colors while bit color depth is technically possible GIF is most suitable for storing graphics with few colors such as simple diagrams shapes logos and cartoon style images as it uses LZW lossless compression which is more effective when large areas have a single color and less effective for photographic or dithered images Due to GIF s simplicity and age it achieved almost universal software support Due to its animation capabilities it is still widely used to provide image animation effects despite its low compression ratio compared to modern video formats br br br PNG br The PNG Portable Network Graphics file format was created as a free open source alternative to GIF The PNG file format supports bit colors paletted images with optional transparency for all palette colors and bit truecolor million colors or bit truecolor with and without alpha channel while GIF supports only bit palettes with a single transparent color br Compared to JPEG PNG excels when the image has large uniformly colored areas Even for photographs where JPEG is often the choice for final distribution since its lossy compression typically yields smaller file sizes PNG is still well suited to storing images during the editing process because of its lossless compression br PNG provides a patent free replacement for GIF though GIF is itself now patent free and can also replace many common uses of TIFF Indexed color grayscale and truecolor images are supported plus an optional alpha channel The Adam interlacing allows an early preview even when only a small percentage of the image data has been transmitted useful in online viewing applications like web browsers PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data as well as ICC profiles for accurate color matching on heterogeneous platforms br Animated formats derived from PNG are MNG and APNG which is backwards compatible with PNG and supported by most browsers br br br JPEG br JPEG is a compression standard enabling both lossless and lossy storage The compression methods used are different from the ones in standard JFIF JPEG they improve quality and compression ratios but also require more computational power to process JPEG also adds features that are missing in JPEG It is not nearly as common as JPEG but it is used currently in professional movie editing and distribution some digital cinemas for example use JPEG for individual movie frames br br br WebP br WebP is an open image format released in that uses both lossless and lossy compression It was designed by Google to reduce image file size to speed up web page loading its principal purpose is to supersede JPEG as the primary format for photographs on the web WebP is based on VP s intra frame coding and uses a container based on RIFF br In Google added an Extended File Format allowing WebP support for animation ICC profile XMP and Exif metadata and tiling br The support for animation allowed for converting older animated GIF to animated WebP br The WebP container i e RIFF container for WebP allows feature support over and above the basic use case of WebP i e a file containing a single image encoded as a VP key frame The WebP container provides additional support for br br Lossless compression An image can be losslessly compressed using the WebP Lossless Format br Metadata An image may have metadata stored in EXIF or XMP formats br Transparency An image may have transparency i e an alpha channel br Color Profile An image may have an embedded ICC profile as described by the International Color Consortium br Animation An image may have multiple frames with pauses between them making it an animation br br br HDR raster formats br Most typical raster formats cannot store HDR data bit floating point values per pixel component which is why some relatively old or complex formats are still predominant here and worth mentioning separately Newer alternatives are showing up though RGBE is the format for HDR images originating from Radiance and also supported by Adobe Photoshop JPEG HDR is a file format from Dolby Labs similar to RGBE encoding standardized as JPEG XT Part br JPEG XT Part includes support for encoding floating point HDR images in the base bit JPEG file using enhancement layers encoded with four profiles A D Profile A is based on the RGBE format and Profile B on the XDepth format from Trellis Management br br br HEIF br The High Efficiency Image File Format HEIF is an image container format that was standardized by MPEG on the basis of the ISO base media file format While HEIF can be used with any image compression format the HEIF standard specifies the storage of HEVC intra coded images and HEVC coded image sequences taking advantage of inter picture prediction br br br AVIF br AV Image File Format AVIF standardized by the video consortium Alliance for open media AOMedia creator of the video format Av to take advantage of modern compression algorithms and a completely royalty free image format It uses the image format with AVIF coding and recommends using the HEIF container see AV in HEIF br br br JPEG XL br JPEG XL is a royalty free raster graphics file format that supports both lossy and lossless compression It supports reversible recompression of existing JPEG files as well as high precision HDR up to bit floating point values per pixel component It is designed to be usable for both delivery and authoring use cases br br br Authoring Interchange formats br br br TIFF br The TIFF Tag Image File Format format is a flexible format usually using either the TIFF or TIF filename extension The tag structure was designed to be easily extendible and many vendors have introduced proprietary special purpose tags with the result that no one reader handles every flavor of TIFF file TIFFs can be lossy or lossless depending on the technique chosen for storing the pixel data Some offer relatively good lossless compression for bi level black white images Some digital cameras can save images in TIFF format using the LZW compression algorithm for lossless storage TIFF image format is not widely supported by web browsers but it remains widely accepted as a photograph file standard in the printing business TIFF can handle device specific color spaces such as the CMYK defined by a particular set of printing press inks OCR Optical Character Recognition software packages commonly generate some form of TIFF image often monochromatic for scanned text pages br br br BMP br The BMP file format Windows bitmap is a raster based device independent file type designed in the early days of computer graphics It handles graphic files within the Microsoft Windows OS Typically BMP files are uncompressed and therefore large and lossless their advantage is their simple structure and wide acceptance in Windows programs br br br PPM PGM PBM and PNM br Netpbm format is a family including the portable pixmap file format PPM the portable graymap file format PGM and the portable bitmap file format PBM These are either pure ASCII files or raw binary files with an ASCII header that provide very basic functionality and serve as a lowest common denominator for converting pixmap graymap or bitmap files between different platforms Several applications refer to them collectively as PNM Portable aNy Map br br br Container formats of raster graphics editors br These image formats contain various images layers and objects out of which the final image is to be composed br br
