The Nike iPod Sports Kit is an activity tracker device developed by Nike Inc which measures and records the distance and pace of a walk or run The Nike iPod consists of a small transmitter device attached to or embedded in a shoe which communicates with either the Nike Sportband a receiver plugged into an iPod Nano It can also work directly with a nd Generation iPod Touch or higher iPhone GS iPhone iPhone S iPhone br The Nike iPod was announced on May On September Nike released the Nike Running App originally called Nike GPS on the App Store which used a tracking engine powered by MotionX that does not require the separate shoe sensor or pedometer This application works using the accelerometer and GPS of the iPhone and the accelerometer of the iPod Touch which does not have a GPS chip Nike Running is compatible with the iPhone and iPhone Plus down to iPhone GS and iPod touch On June Nike released Nike Running App for Android The current app is compatible with all Android phones running and up br br br Overview br The sensor and iPod kit were revealed on May The kit stores information such as the elapsed time of the workout the distance traveled pace and calories burned by the individual Nike was a collaboration between Nike and Apple the platform consisted of an iPod a wireless chip Nike shoes that accepted the wireless chip an iTunes membership and a Nike online community iPods using Nike iPod require a sensor and remote br The next upgraded product was the Sportband kit which was announced in April The kit allows users to store run information without the iPod Nano The Sportband consists of two parts a rubber holding strap which is worn around the wrist and a receiver which resembles a USB key disk The receiver displays information comparable to that of the iPod kit on the built in display After a run the receiver can be plugged straight into a USB port and the software will upload the run information automatically to the Nike website br As of August Nike iPod for the Gym launched allowing users to record their cardio workouts directly to their iPods No Sport kit or shoe sensor is required all that is needed is a compatible iPod st th generation iPod Nano or nd rd gen iPod Touch and an enabled piece of cardio equipment As of March the seven largest commercial equipment providers were shipping enabled equipment Life Fitness Technogym Precor USA Star Trac Cybex International Matrix Fitness and Free Motion The models of compatible cardio equipment include treadmills stationary bicycles stair climbers ellipticals and others such as Precor s Adaptive Motion Trainer Once the user syncs an iPod with iTunes the cardio workouts are automatically stored at Nikeplus com where each workout is visualized and tracked based on the number of calories burned The calories are converted to CardioMiles at a ratio of allowing cardio users to take full advantage of all the tools and features of Nikeplus com and allow them to engage in challenges with other runners walkers and cardio users using a common currency br With the release of the second generation iPod Touch in Apple Inc included a built in ability to receive Nike signals which allowed the iPod to connect directly to the wireless sensor thus eliminating the need for an external receiver to be connected Apple also added this capability to the iPhone GS released iPhone and third generation iPod Touch Those devices use their Broadcom Bluetooth chipset to receive the signals br On June Polar and Nike introduced the Polar WearLink that works with Nike This new product works with the Nike SportBand and the fifth generation iPod nano in conjunction with the Nike iPod Sport Kit Polar WearLink that works with Nike communicates directly with the fifth generation iPod nano and Nike SportBand using a proprietary digital protocol but it is dual mode so it is also compatible with most Polar training computers all those using kHz analog transmission technology br Nike had million global users as of April One year later Nike updated the number of global users to million br In iOS and possibly higher a hole in the compatibility for the app has allowed jailbroken iPad users to use the native Nike iPod iPhone and iPod app by moving the app bundle and setting permissions for the app br br On April Nike retired services for legacy Nike wearable devices such as the Nike FuelBand and the Nike SportWatch GPS and previous versions of apps including Nike Run Club and Nike Training Club version X and lower Likewise Nike no longer supported the Nike Connect software that transferred data to a NikePlus Profile or the Nike Fuel FuelBand and Nike Move apps br br br Sports kit equipment br The kit consists of two pieces a piezoelectric sensor with a Nordic Semiconductor nRF transmitter that is mounted under the inner sole of the shoe and a receiver that connects to the iPod They communicate using a GHz wireless radio and use Nordic Semiconductor s ShockBurst network protocol The wireless data is encrypted in transit but some uniquely identifying data is sent in the plain The wireless protocol was reverse engineered and documented by Dmitry Grinberg in br Nike recommends that the shoe be a Nike model with a special pocket in which to place the device Nike has released the sensor for individual sale meaning that consumers no longer have to purchase the whole set the iPod receiver and sensor As the sensor battery cannot be replaced a new one must be purchased every time the battery runs out br Aftermarket solutions are available to users who do not want to use shoes with built in or hand made pockets for the foot sensor such as shoe pouches and containment devices designed to affix the sensor against the shoe laces No matter how the sensor is integrated with the user s shoes care must be taken that it is firmly fixed in place and will not jerk around while in use which would degrade the accuracy br br br Sports kit usage br br The Sports Kit can be used to track running which it refers to as workouts New workouts are started by plugging the receiving unit into the iPod then navigating through the iPod menu system The user chooses a goal for the workout which might be to cover a specific distance or burn a number of calories or work out for a specified time A workout can also be started without a goal which is called a Basic Workout When the workout goal has been set the receiver seeks the sensor possibly asking the user to walk around to activate the sensor The user then must press the center button on the iPod to begin the workout br Audio feedback is provided in the user s choice of generic male or female voice by the iPod over the course of the workout depending on the type of workout chosen For goal oriented workouts the feedback will correspond to significant milestones toward the goal In a distance workout for example the audio feedback will inform the user as each mile or kilometer has been completed as well as the half way point of the workout and a countdown of four meter increments at the end of the workout br The iPod s control wheel functions change slightly during a workout The Pause button now not only pauses the music but also the workout Similarly the Menu button is used to access the controls to end the workout The Forward and Back buttons are unchanged performing audio track skip and reverse functions The Center button has two functions audio feedback about the current distance time and pace are provided when the button is tapped once while if the button is held down the iPod skips to the PowerSong an audio track chosen by the user generally intended for motivation br In addition to the in workout audio feedback there are pre recorded congratulations provided by Lance Armstrong Tiger Woods Joan Benoit Samuelson and Paula Radcliffe whenever a user achieves a personal best such as fastest mile fastest K fastest K longest run yet or reaches certain long term milestones such as miles kilometers This celebrity feedback is heard after the usual end of run statistics br While the Sports Kit can be used immediately after purchase it will report more accurate results if it is calibrated before the first usage and then regularly afterwards For calibration the user finds a fixed known distance of at least mile or meters and then sets the Nike to calibration mode for the walk or run over that distance When the walk or run is complete the device calibrates itself and future workout reporting will reflect statistics closer to that individual user s workout style Consumer Reports magazine tested the device and found it accurate as long as you keep an even pace In workouts with varied pace accuracy was sometimes less than As walking and running strides can vary significantly the device should be calibrated for each br br br Hardware br Foot sensor br br Nordic Semiconductor nRF wireless transmitter br Microchip Technology PIC F microcontroller br V Lithium battery br mm diameter piezoelectric sensor br iPod receiver br br Texas Instruments MSP series microcontroller br Nordic Semiconductor nRF transceiver br br br Wireless protocol data and privacy concerns br The shoe sensor broadcasts a packet once a second while the user is walking or running and for ten seconds after the user stops moving Any other shock also causes the sensor to broadcast data The protocol is not connection oriented and can be easily sniffed While most of the data is encrypted a piece of the device s serial number is sent without encryption This unique bit number has been successfully used to identify specific Nike foot sensors Uses of this technique include remote operating a car lock customer tracking and stalking br The data sent by the device every second is cumulative since the device was first used and thus can be very revealing of a user s exercise habits and life in general The data is number of steps run number of steps walked distance run distance walked and number of hours device has been on br br br Online integration br br In addition to tracking personal workout statistics the Nike integrates directly with the Nike website Workout data can be automatically uploaded to the website during an iPod sync with iTunes or through another program via the website s public API The uploaded information is mostly not personally identifying but does also contain some personal statistics such as weight if configured Workout data is stored in XML files on the iPod which has led some web and applications programmers to offer alternatives to the official Nike reports br On October new features were added to the Nike website including the ability to name runs Forums were also added which they refer to as talk some trash allowing users to meet and challenge other runners ask questions and give feedback Recently there have been several more additions to the Nike website including but not limited to a challenge gallery where all user created challenges are viewable the ability to name the route taken when running or walking compatibility with the new iPod Nano fifth generation a distance club to view everyone s total distance
