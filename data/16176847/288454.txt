with the iMac DV With version iMovie became part of Apple s now defunct iLife suite alongside other multimedia apps iMovie was a complete rewrite and lacked many of the features of previous versions which returned in iMovie and iMovie The iOS version of iMovie came out in br iMovie is pre installed on all new Macs iPhones and iPads and is available for free on the App Store br br br History br br br iMovie br The first version of iMovie was released in as a Mac OS application bundled with the first FireWire enabled consumer Mac model the iMac DV Both iMovie and the iMac DV were announced at Apple s special event on October at the Flint Center br br br iMovie br iMovie added the ability to interleave video and audio tracks on the timeline br br br iMovie br iMovie was plagued by performance issues and bugs br br br iMovie br iMovie introduced nondestructive video editing In prior versions of iMovie trimming a clip removed the trimmed portion permanently Beginning in version iMovie introduced Direct Trimming implementing editing functionality closer to professional grade editing software br br br iMovie HD br br Beginning with version iMovie was renamed to iMovie HD to highlight its new support for HDV p and i camcorders It gained features to integrate it with the rest of the iLife suite with toolbox buttons allowing the importing of images from iPhoto music from iTunes and the setting of chapter markers ready for exporting to iDVD iMovie HD imported MJPEG files as DV by default which introduces noise MJPEG files are cryptically lumped with iSight files in this version br It gained the Magic iMovie feature which attempted to automate the whole process of video editing by allowing a common transition to be added between scenes a music track to be synchronised with the video and a DVD to be created with the accompanying iDVD software br Later versions added support for footage from AVCHD camcorders and H compressed video from MPEG or QuickTime File Format files mov as generated by a number of digital photo cameras with HD video recording feature To facilitate this iMovie includes the Apple Intermediate Codec on the system as a QuickTime component iMovie transcodes HD video upon import using this codec and stores it in the QuickTime file format br br br iMovie HD br iMovie was released in January as part of the iLife suite and was also originally optionally included with iLife as a substitution for iMovie due to the new version s incompatibility with older Power PC Macintosh computers However this option was removed after iLife was released It was integrated with iPhoto iTunes iDVD GarageBand and iWeb iMovie HD was designed for ease of use and included new themes Themes allow the user to drop movie clips or photos into professionally designed backdrops Each theme included full motion graphic bumpers and transitions iMovie HD also added real time effects which took advantage of the computer s graphics processing unit to perform some effects without rendering It also introduced real time titling enhanced audio tools and effects the ability to have multiple projects open at once video podcasts and blogs using integration with iWeb and a refined look based on iTunes and br br br iMovie br iMovie version was released in August as a part of the iLife suite iMovie was a complete redesign and rewrite of iMovie It had much better HD output and more formats to convert to This was limited however by an undocumented restriction on supported codecs iPhoto uses the QuickTime library and can create thumbnails for all QuickTime supported formats but most of these cannot be used by iMovie Some of the formats that iMovie was able to import will not be recognized when they are added to an iPhoto library Motion JPEG encoded AVI files were recognized and were the most common format used by digital cameras A new feature called skimming for quickly previewing video in the library at a user controlled speed was added and so was a feature that allows the user to highlight parts of video clips just like highlighting text iMovie also had the ability to add more than two layers of background sound including multiple music narration and sounds previous versions could play multiple tracks but could display only two extra audio tracks It included more exportation formats including iPhone sized video It also supported non tape based HD video such as AVCHD and footage from DVD and HDD camcorders iMovie also had the ability to export movies to the YouTube video sharing website br iMovie was criticized due to its drastic abandonment of some iMovie HD features Former New York Times reviewer David Pogue said iMovie is an utter bafflement incapable of the more sophisticated editing that the old iMovie made so enjoyable All visual effects are gone even basic options like slow motion reverse motion fast motion and black and white And you can t have more than one project open at a time Features removed included the classic timeline the ability to create DVD chapter markers support for plugins and in timeline audio adjustment and control iMovie imported a much more limited set of video codecs and metadata formats than previous versions of iMovie or the then current version QuickTime Player For example QuickTime Player could be extended to support the FLIP Video ivx MPEG codec but iMovie could not iMovie also removed the ability to import DV footage As a result all resulting videos had lossy compression applied and there was no facility for managing full format video The peculiar lack of QuickTime support means QuickTime Pro could edit a larger range of video than iMovie br Apple released iMovie HD as a free download to those who had purchased iMovie However in response to the release of the subsequent newer version of iMovie Apple removed the download in late January while also reducing the price tag for Final Cut Express to Several of the features removed from iMovie that were previously included with iMovie HD have been restored into iMovie and more recently iMovie br br br iMovie br iMovie version was released January as part of the iLife package It introduced some new features and restored some features from previous versions of iMovie including basic video effects such as fast slow motion and aged film and image stabilization as well as travel map functions for

save memory This feature was removed in iMovie and is no longer available in iMovie or Final Cut Pro X FCPX But in FCPX as a workaround you can cut out all but the desired part of a project export that project in ProRes format and then import that export This can be used as a smaller source clip instead of the original larger one br br br iMovie x present br iMovie was released on October by Apple Inc This version of iMovie was a complete redesign with more options to share a movie more movie and trailer theme options from iMovie for iOS easier to make picture in pictures cutaways side by
