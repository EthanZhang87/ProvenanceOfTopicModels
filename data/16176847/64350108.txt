id: 64350108
macOS Big Sur version is the seventeenth major release of macOS Apple s operating system for Macintosh computers It was announced at Apple s Worldwide Developers Conference WWDC on June and was released to the public on November br Big Sur is the successor to macOS Catalina and was succeeded by macOS Monterey which was released on October The release of Big Sur was the first time the major version number of the operating system had been incremented since the Mac OS X Public Beta in br For the first time since OS X Yosemite years earlier macOS Big Sur features a user interface redesign It features new blurs to establish a visual hierarchy along with making icons more square and UI elements more consistent Other changes include a revamp of the Time Machine backup mechanism the control center from iOS among other things It is also the first macOS version to support Macs with ARM based processors To mark the transition the operating system s major version number was incremented for the first time since from to The operating system is named after the coastal region of Big Sur in the Central Coast of California continuing the naming trend of California locations that began with OS X Mavericks br macOS Big Sur is the final version of macOS that supports Macs with Nvidia graphics cards specifically the inch dual graphics late and mid MacBook Pro models as its successor macOS Monterey drops support for those models br br br Development history br Providing some indication as to how the pre release operating system may have been viewed internally at Apple during its development cycle documentation accompanying the initial beta release of macOS Big Sur referred to its version as and when upgrading from prior versions of macOS using the Software Update mechanism to early beta releases the version referred to was An exception to this was the Developer Transition Kit which always reported the system version as macOS Big Sur started reporting the system version as on all Macs as of the third beta release br To maintain backwards compatibility macOS Big Sur identified itself as to legacy software and in the browser user agent br br br System requirements br Unlike macOS Catalina which supported every standard configuration Mac that Mojave supported Big Sur drops support for various Macs released in and early Big Sur runs on the following Macs br br iMac Mid or later br iMac Pro br MacBook Early or later br MacBook Air Mid or later br MacBook Pro Late or later br Mac Mini Late or later br Mac Pro Late or later br Developer Transition Kit only up to Big Sur beta br By using patch tools macOS Big Sur can be installed on earlier computers that are officially unsupported such as the iMac and the MacBook Pro Using these methods it is possible to install macOS Big Sur on computers as old as a MacBook Pro and iMac and Mac Mini br br br Changes br br br Design br macOS Big Sur refreshes the design of the user interface described by Apple as the biggest change since the introduction of Mac OS X Its changes include translucency in various places a new abstract wallpaper for the first time and a new color palette All standard apps as well as the Dock and the Menu Bar are redesigned and streamlined and their icons now have square shapes like iOS and iPadOS apps and are distinctly more round Compared to iOS Big Sur s icons include more shading and highlights to give a three dimensional appearance Its aesthetic has been described as neumorphism a portmanteau of new and skeuomorphism System sounds are redone as well br The new OS also brings further integration with Apple s SF Symbols enabling easier use by third party developers as UI elements for their applications through AppKit SwiftUI and Catalyst which makes it possible to unify third party applications with the existing Apple made design language br br br Interface br br br Control Center br An interface with quick toggles for Wi Fi Bluetooth screen brightness and system volume has been added to the menu bar This interface is functionally and visually similar to the Control Center on iOS and iPadOS br br br Notification Center br The Notification Center is redesigned featuring interactive notifications and a transparent user interface Notification Center also features a new widget system similar to that in iOS displaying more information with more customization than previously available br br br System br br br Support for Apple silicon br macOS Big Sur is the first release of macOS for Macs powered by Apple designed ARM based processors a key part of the transition from Intel x based processors The chip mentioned in demo videos and used in the Developer Transition Kit is the A Z Bionic On November Apple announced the first Mac Apple silicon chip the Apple M in the Late Mac Mini MacBook Air and MacBook Pro Apple has said that it will support Intel Macs for years to come and most software that has not been ported to run on ARM Macs can use Rosetta an update of a compatibility mechanism originally developed for the PowerPC to Intel x transition Likewise Apple also introduced an updated universal binary format Universal which allows developers to package their applications so that they can run natively on both ARM and x processors br br br Support for iOS and iPadOS applications br On Macs based on Apple silicon macOS Big Sur can run iOS and iPadOS applications natively and without any modifications needed from developers aside from allowing the app to be available on the Mac App Store The first Macs with this capability are those that use the Apple M SoC system on a chip br br br Time Machine overhaul br Time Machine the backup mechanism introduced back in Mac OS X Leopard has been overhauled to utilize the APFS file system introduced in MacOS High Sierra instead of the outdated HFS Specifically the new version of Time Machine makes use of APFS s snapshot technology According to Apple this enables faster more compact and more reliable backups than were possible previously with HFS formatted backup destinations An independent evaluation of this claim found that Time Machine on macOS in conjunction with APFS was fold faster upon initial local backup and fold faster upon subsequent backups relative to macOS s Time Machine implementation using HFS A more modest yet nevertheless significant advantage was noted as well for backups to network attached disks br New local i e USB or Thunderbolt connected and network connected Time Machine backup destinations are formatted as APFS by default though Time Machine can continue backing up to existing HFS backup volumes There is no option to convert existing HFS based backups to APFS instead users who want to benefit from the advantages of the new APFS based implementation of Time Machine need to start with a fresh volume br In the new version of Time Machine encryption appears to be required instead of merely optional for local disks but it remains elective for networked volumes br It is no longer possible to restore the whole system using a Time Machine backup as the signed system volume is not backed up Non core applications and user data can be restored in full using Migration Assistant preceded by a system reinstall if necessary br br br Spotlight br Spotlight the file system indexing and search mechanism introduced in Mac OS X Tiger is faster and the interface has been refined Spotlight is now the default search mechanism in Safari Pages and Keynote br br br Signed system volume br The system volume containing the core operating system is cryptographically signed Apple indicates this is a security measure to prevent malicious tampering This includes adding an SHA hash for every file on the system volume preventing changes from third party entities and the end user br br br Software updates br Software updates can begin in the background before a restart thus requiring less downtime to complete Because system files are cryptographically signed the update software can rely on them being in precise locations thus permitting them to be effectively updated in place br br br Encryption br macOS Big Sur supports encryption at the file level Earlier versions of macOS Catalina and older supported encryption only at the level of entire volumes As of June this capability is known to be compatible with Macs based on Apple silicon it is unclear whether it is compatible with Intel based Macs br br br Other changes br Bilingual dictionaries in French German Indonesian English Japanese Simplified Chinese and Polish English br Better predictive input for Chinese and Japanese users br New fonts for Indian users br The Now Playing widget has been moved from the Notification Center to the Menu Bar br Podcasts Listen Now feature br FaceTime sign language prominence br Network Utility has been removed br The macOS startup sound is now enabled by default it had been disabled by default on some machines released in and an option in System Preferences was added to enable or disable this functionality br br br Application features br br br Safari br Big Sur includes Safari which was also released for macOS Catalina and macOS Mojave on September Safari includes features such as a new home page in which users can customize what features are visible in addition to being able to set a custom wallpaper It also allows the viewer to preview a page and favicon before visiting it br Safari also includes built in web page translations in English Spanish German French Russian Chinese and Portuguese as well as support for K HDR content from Netflix on Macs with an Apple T chip although none of these were made available for macOS Catalina and Mojave br Privacy features such as iCloud Keychain which notifies users of compromised passwords extension privacy management and Privacy Report which monitors privacy trackers and further increases Safari s security were added for Safari Users were now also able to import password from Google s Chrome browser in addition to being notified of compromised passwords br Safari also supports WebExtensions API the WebP image format as well as VP decoding the latter of which allows for the playback of K and HDR content from YouTube In addition it allowed for better performance and power efficiency br Safari ended support for Adobe Flash Player in September months prior to its end of life on December br br br Messages br The Messages app was rewritten to be based upon Apple s Catalyst technology to enable it to have feature parity with its iOS counterpart The new version of the app included a refined design as well as the ability to pin up to nine conversations that can sync across iOS iPadOS and macOS Users were also now allowed to search for messages and share their names and photos Photo thumbnails could now also be used for group chats on the app br In addition users could mention contacts by putting the symbol in front of their name They were also able to reply to specific messages Memojis d avatars were also made available on Messages On Messages users could now select photos based on parameters br In India text message effects were added when users sent certain texts e g texting Happy Holi will result in users seeing effects br br br Changes to the Mac App Store br br Refinements and new features of the Mac App Store include br br A new nutrition label section dedicated to the data and information an app collects also featured in the iOS App Store br A new extensions category for Safari br Third party Notification Center widgets similar to those also added in iOS and iPadOS br The ability to share in app purchases and subscriptions on the Mac via iCloud Family Sharing br br br Notes br Collapsible pinned section br Quick text style and formatting options br Scanning enhancements br br br Photos br New editing capabilities br Improved Retouch tool br New zooming feature in views br br br Maps br Look Around interactive street level panoramas first implemented in the iOS version of Maps have been incorporated into the macOS version of Maps br Availability of directions for cyclists br Electric vehicle routing based on proximity to charging stations and monitoring of battery levels on selected car models br Guides for exploring new places br br br Voice Memos br A file structure has been implemented to allow organization of recordings in folders br Recordings can be marked as Favorites for easier subsequent access br Smart Folders automatically group Apple Watch recordings recently deleted recordings and Favorites br Audio can be enhanced to reduce background noise and room reverb br br br Other applications found in macOS Big Sur br br br Removed functionality br Calculator Notification Center Widget br Option to toggle Font Smoothing in System Preferences br Support in Safari for AdBlock plugins like uBlock Origin br Removed the option not to have a clock in the menu bar br br br Criticism br The rollout of Big Sur came with several problems Upgrading to the initial public release of Big Sur version bricked some computers rendering them unusable Many of these were and MacBook Pros though problems were also observed on a MacBook Pro and an iMac from the same year The initial rollout also disrupted Apple s app notarization process causing slowdowns even on devices not running Big Sur Users also reported that the update was slow or even might fail to install macOS Catalina and Big Sur apps were taking a long time to load because of Gatekeeper issues br The issues with the COVID pandemic meant it was hard for users to visit an Apple Store to get their machines fixed Shortly afterwards Apple released a series of steps explaining how these Macs could be recovered br Certain Apple applications running on early versions of Big Sur were reported to bypass firewalls raising privacy and security concerns This was addressed with the release of macOS Big Sur which removed the whitelist for built in programs Conversely security experts have reported that Big Sur will check an application s certificate every time it is run degrading system performance There have been reports that the operating system sends a hash back to Apple of every program run and when it was executed Apple responded that the process is part of efforts to protect users from malware embedded in applications downloaded outside of the Mac App Store br Some users have reported problems connecting external displays to Macs running Big Sur and br When upgrading Macs from and to Big Sur the upgrade process could become stuck for seemingly unclear reasons Only a full system restore from backup would solve this problem In October a solution became known that required removal of up to several hundred thousand excess temporary files in the system folders The problem was fixed in December in the Big Sur Full installer br br br Vulnerability br In there were reports of two pieces of malware that infected macOS and include both x and ARM code The first one was detected in early The second one Silver Sparrow was detected on nearly Macs in February br br br Release history br The public release of macOS Big Sur began with for Intel Macs Version was preinstalled on Apple silicon Macs and Apple advised those with that version to be updated to br br See Apple s main pages for Big Sur release notes for consumers for enterprise as well as their current security content page br br br br br br External links br macOS
