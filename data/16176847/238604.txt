A UX is a Unix based operating system from Apple Computer for Macintosh computers integrated with System s graphical interface and application compatibility It is Apple s first official Unix based operating system launched in and discontinued in with version A UX requires select k based Macintosh models with an FPU and a paged memory management unit PMMU including the Macintosh II SE Quadra and Centris series br Described by InfoWorld as an open systems solution with the Macintosh at its heart A UX is based on UNIX System V Release with features from System V Releases and and BSD versions and It is POSIX and System V Interface Definition SVID compliant and includes TCP IP networking since version Having a Unix compatible POSIX compliant operating system enabled Apple to bid for large contracts to supply computers to U S federal government institutes br br br Features br A UX provides a graphical user interface including the familiar Finder windows menus and controls The A UX Finder is a customized version of the System Finder adapted to run as a Unix process and designed to interact with the underlying Unix file systems A UX includes the CommandShell terminal program which offers a command line interface to the underlying Unix system An X Window System server application called MacX with a terminal program can also be used to interface with the system and run X applications alongside the Finder Alternatively the user can choose to run a fullscreen X R session without the Finder br Apple s compatibility layer allows A UX to run Macintosh System Unix and hybrid applications A hybrid application uses functions from both the Macintosh toolbox and the Unix system For example it can run a Macintosh application which calls Unix system functions or a Unix application which calls Macintosh Toolbox functions such as QuickDraw or a HyperCard stack graphical frontend for a command line Unix application A UX s compatibility layer uses some existing Toolbox functions in the computer s ROM while other function calls are translated into native Unix system calls and it cooperatively multitasks all Macintosh apps in a single address space by using a token passing system for their access to the Toolbox br A UX includes a utility called Commando similar to a tool of the same name included with Macintosh Programmer s Workshop to assist users with entering Unix commands Opening a Unix executable file from the Finder opens a dialog box that allows the user to choose command line options for the program using standard controls such as radio buttons and check boxes and display the resulting command line argument for the user before executing the command or program This feature is intended to ease the learning curve for users new to Unix and decrease the user s reliance on the Unix manual A UX has a utility that allows the user to reformat third party SCSI drives in such a way that they can be used in other Macs of that era br A UX requires k based Macintoshes with a floating point unit FPU and a paged memory management unit PMMU and select models For example the Quadra AV the fastest k Macintosh cannot run A UX br br br History br A UX was announced at the February Uniforum conference seven months behind schedule It is based on AT T s Unix System V with additional features from BSD Unix Networking support includes TCP IP AppleTalk and NFS implementations developed by UniSoft The base system has no GUI with only the command line It can run one Macintosh application at a time using the System GUI interface although it is compatible with only about of the existing Macintosh software library br It was initially aimed at existing Unix customers universities and VARs The system was initially sold pre installed on the Macintosh II for US equivalent to in a larger monitor could be added or a kit could upgrade an existing Mac II for a lower price Third party software announced with the system s first release includes the Ingres database StatView developer tools and various productivity software packages br Released in A UX supplies the basic GUI of System with Finder Chooser Desk Accessories and Control Panels It provisions Unix with the X Window System X R GUI the Draft POSIX standard and overall improved speed to competitive levels with Sun desktop and deskside workstations which used the same Motorola series CPU FPU and MMU none of which supported the exceptionally large RAM complement of MB at the time Having its first POSIX compliant platform allowed Apple to join a growing list of industry heavyweights to be allowed into the US federal government s burgeoning billion bid market br In Apple s plans were influenced by the new AIM alliance with IBM envisioning A UX as becoming the basis for drastically scaling its concept of Macintosh system architecture and application compatibility across the computing industry from personal to enterprise markets Apple formed a new business division for enterprise systems led by director Jim Groff to serve large businesses government and higher education Basing the division upon a maturing A UX Groff admitted that Apple was not a major player in the Unix market and had performed merely quiet marketing of the operating system but fully intended to become a major player with very broad based marketing objectives in Further Apple believed the alliance with IBM would merge A UX AIX and System thus ultimately scaling the execution of Macintosh applications from Mac desktops to IBM s huge RS systems br In November Apple launched A UX planning to synchronize the two concurrent release schedules of A UX and System At that time the company also preannounced A UX expected for release in or The announcement expounded upon the historic technology partnership between Apple and IBM expecting to merge Apple s user friendly graphical interface and desktop applications market with IBM s highly scalable Unix server market and allowing the two companies to enter what Apple believed to be an emerging general desktop open systems market The upcoming A UX was proposed to target the PowerOpen Environment ABI merge features of IBM s AIX variant of Unix into A UX and use the OSF kernel from the Open Software Foundation A UX was proposed to serve as an important migration path to this new system making Unix and System applications compliant with the PowerOpen specification The future A UX and AIX operating systems were intended to run on a variety of IBM s POWER and PowerPC hardware and on Apple s PowerPC based hardware br br Apple agreed to provide IBM with the technology needed to allow standard Macintosh applications starting with the Finder to run under the new AIX much as they do under A UX today Apple will apply the PowerOpen label to the new version of A UX that results from the deal IBM will do likewise with the new AIX br In April a C level secure version of A UX was released Coincidentally the AIM alliance had launched the Apple IBM partnership corporation Taligent Inc one month earlier with the mission of bringing Apple s other next generation operating system Pink to market as a grandly universal operating system and application framework br Contrary to all announcements Apple eventually abandoned all plans for the unreleased A UX In PowerOpen was discontinued and Apple withdrew from the Taligent Inc partnership in December In Apple discontinued its Copland project which had spent two years in the public view intended to become Mac OS and to host Taligent software From to the company deployed a short lived platform of Apple Network Server systems based upon PowerPC hardware and a customized IBM AIX operating system Apple s overall failed operating system strategy left it with the badly aged System and no successor Following its acquisition of NeXT Apple introduced s Mac OS X Server a descendant of the Unix based NeXTSTEP operating system br The final release of A UX is version of Apple had abandoned A UX completely by br br br Reception br A UX was criticized in the April InfoWorld review for having a largely command line interface as in other Unix variants rather than graphical as in System its networking support was praised though BYTE in listed A UX among the Excellence winners of the BYTE Awards stating that it could make Unix the multitasking operating system of choice during the next decade and challenge OS Compared to contemporary workstations from other Unix vendors however the Macintosh hardware lacks features such as demand paging The first two versions A UX consequently suffer from poor performance and poor sales Users also complained about the amount of hard drive space it uses on a standard Macintosh though comparable to any Unix system br A UX was praised in the August issue of InfoWorld by the same author describing it as an open systems solution with the Macintosh at its heart where Apple finally gets Unix right He praised the GUI single button point and click installer one year of personal tech support the graphical help dialogs and the user s manuals saying that A UX defies the stereotype that Unix is difficult to use and is the easiest version of Unix to learn Its list price of equivalent to in is much higher than that of much weaker competing PC operating systems such as System OS MS DOS and Windows but low compared to the then prevailing proprietary Unix licenses of more than equivalent to in The review found the system speed acceptable but not great even on the fastest Quadra blaming not the software but the incomplete Unix optimization found in Apple s hardware Though a very good value the system s price performance ratio was judged as altogether uncompetitive against Sun s SPARCstation The reviewers thought it unlikely for users to want to buy Macs just to run A UX and would have awarded InfoWorld s top score if the OS was not proprietary to Macintosh hardware br Tony Bove of the Bove Rhodes Report generally complained that f or Unix super users there is no compelling reason to buy Apple s Unix For Apple A UX has always been a way to sell Macs not Unix it s a check off item for users br br br Legacy br Vintage A UX users had one central repository for most A UX applications an Internet server at NASA called Jagubox It was administered by Jim Jagielski who was
