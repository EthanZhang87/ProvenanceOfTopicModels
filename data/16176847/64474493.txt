The iPhone and iPhone Mini stylized and marketed as iPhone mini are smartphones designed developed and marketed by Apple Inc They are the fourteenth generation iPhones succeeding the iPhone They were unveiled at a virtually held Apple Special Event at Apple Park in Cupertino California on October alongside the premium flagship iPhone Pro and iPhone Pro Max and HomePod Mini Pre orders for the iPhone started on October and the phone was released in most countries on October alongside the iPhone Pro and fourth generation iPad Air Pre orders for the iPhone Mini began on November and the phone was released on November alongside the iPhone Pro Max br The major upgrades over the iPhone include the addition of a Super Retina XDR OLED as opposed to the Liquid Retina LED backlit LCD IPS panel on the iPhone and XR G support the introduction of MagSafe Apple A Bionic system on a chip SoC and high dynamic range video Dolby Vision K up to fps The iPhone and iPhone Mini like the iPhone Pro and iPhone Pro Max are the first iPhone models from Apple to no longer include a power adapter or EarPods headphones found in prior iPhone models however a USB C to Lightning cable is included this change was retroactively applied to other iPhone models sold by Apple such as the iPhone XR iPhone and the second generation iPhone SE br br br Design br The iPhone and Mini is the first major redesign since the iPhone X It features a chassis with flat edges similar to the iPhone and iPhone designs as well as the iPad Pro since and the th generation iPad Air which was also released in The notch size is similar to previous iPhone models despite speculation about a reduction in width The borders around the display are thinner by than any previous model The new design also comes with a ceramic hardened front glass marketed as Ceramic Shield while the back retains the previous generation Dual Ion Exchange strengthened glass br Blue iPhone mini br On April at Apple s Special Event Spring Loaded Apple revealed a new purple color option which became available on April br The iPhone and Mini are available in six colors Black White Product Red Green Blue and Purple br br br Specifications br br br Hardware br The iPhone and iPhone Mini use Apple s six core A Bionic processor which contains a next generation neural engine They both have three internal storage options and GB Both also carry an IP water and dust resistance rating along with dirt and grime and is water resistant up to six meters feet for minutes However the manufacturer warranty does not cover liquid damage to the phone br The iPhone series are the first iPhone models to be supplied from launch without EarPods or a wall adapter which Apple says was done to reduce carbon emissions and waste since most users already own them Apple also claims more boxes can fit on a pallet given the smaller box and thus further reducing emissions A USB C to Lightning cord is still included This change also applies retroactively to all other iPhone models still in production To comply with French law regarding wireless device radiation and health which requires phones to be bundled with and promote use of hands free accessories by children under iPhone models will still include EarPods in this market br A magnetic connector known as MagSafe is introduced on the iPhone models allowing accessories such as cases and charging cords to be attached to the rear of the device Accessories can also be stacked together br The devices support G cellular communications This allows upload speeds of up to Mbit s and download speeds of up to Gbit s However only models sold in the U S support the fastest mmWave technology those sold elsewhere in the world including Canada support only sub GHz frequency bands A new feature called Smart Data Mode enables G only when necessary to preserve battery life br br br Displays br The iPhone features a inch mm display with Super Retina XDR OLED technology at a resolution of pixels and a pixel density of about ppi The iPhone Mini features a inch mm display with the same technology at a resolution of pixels and a pixel density of about ppi Both phones have a peak brightness of nits when viewing HDR content equivalent to the iPhone Pro and normal brightness of nits Both phones also use an improved glass ceramic covering called Ceramic Shield which is co developed with Corning Inc Apple describes it as having times better drop performance and being tougher than any smartphone glass br br br Batteries br The iPhone has a Wh mAh battery a slight decrease from the Wh mAh battery found in the iPhone and identical to the battery found in the iPhone Pro The iPhone Mini has a Wh mAh battery Like previous iPhones the battery is not user replaceable br br br Chipsets br Both the iPhone and Mini have the Apple A Bionic the first ARM based smartphone system on a chip SoC manufactured on the nm process node However unlike previous years they are not the first Apple devices to receive the newest A series processor with the fourth generation iPad Air being the first Both phones use Qualcomm s X G modem br br br Cameras br Both phones have two rear megapixel cameras wide and ultra wide The wide camera is a mm full frame equivalent with an f aperture which captures more light than the f aperture in the iPhone and a seven element lens The ultra wide camera is a mm full frame equivalent with an f aperture and a five element lens br All cameras now support Night Mode for both photo and time lapse video at full resolution Smart HDR has been improved thanks to Smart HDR This iPhone model is the first capable of shooting bit high dynamic range Dolby Vision K video at up to fps which allows for greater brightness and deeper shadows br The front facing TrueDepth camera features a megapixel camera with an f aperture This model also added Night Mode to the front facing camera br Sensors br The iPhone and Mini include mostly the same sensors found on prior iPhone models going back to the iPhone X These include an accelerometer gyroscope barometer proximity sensor ambient light sensor and a digital compass The devices also include the Face ID sensor for biometric authentication br br br Software br br Both phones originally shipped with iOS The devices come with the stock iOS apps such as Safari Weather and Messages and they include Siri the personal assistant in iOS They received iOS on September iOS which was released on September and most recently iOS released on September It will be compatible with the upcoming iOS due to be released in late br br br Reception br The iPhone received largely positive reviews The Verge called it a beautiful powerful and incredibly capable device praising the new design reminiscent of the iPhone the speed of the A Bionic processor its G capabilities addition of the OLED display like on the high end iPhones combined with much slimmer bezels than previous iPhone models and improved battery life over iPhone Engadget also gave the iPhone a positive review praising the MagSafe wireless charging and accessories magnetic attachment as well as the redesigned camera system a greatly improved display like in its Pro counterparts br iPhone was the third best selling and was the most popular model globally in Q br Apple was criticized for the continued reliance on Face ID as the sole biometric option to unlock the device which is incompatible with face masks iOS allowed the use of a paired Apple Watch to unlock the phone while wearing a mask while iOS allows unlocking with a mask on without an Apple Watch The third generation iPhone SE is the only iPhone currently produced by Apple that supports Touch ID an alternative unlocking option that is compatible with face masks All models can still use a passcode to log in br The iPhone mini has received more mixed reviews Some praised the phone for being a new small phone while others criticized the price and inferior battery life compared to the full size although the battery life of the iPhone mini is longer than that of the second generation iPhone SE br br br OLED gate br Within two weeks after its public release a thread was started at Apple Support Communities describing a problem with the iPhone and iPhone Pro OLED panel black pixels not shutting off completely in black scenes resulting in what was described as ugly glowing A considerable number of users have since posted replies reporting the same problem photos and videos have been shared online demonstrating the issue As of January Apple has not yet made an official statement br br br EarPods and power adapter controversy br Apple no longer includes either EarPods or a power adapter in the boxes of all iPhone and Pro models claiming that it is an environmental initiative and no longer including them would reduce e waste and permit smaller iPhone boxes allowing more devices to be transported simultaneously to decrease its carbon footprint The boxes only include a USB C to Lightning cable incompatible with the existing USB A power adapters that Apple previously supplied with its devices Users can still use their existing USB A power adapters and cables but must purchase a USB C power adapter sold separately to enable fast charging br In December a Brazilian consumer rights watchdog Procon SP Foundation requested Apple to provide proof that not including chargers is beneficial to the environment The watchdog argues that Apple removing the charger is harming consumers and wants to force the company to include one as it claims the charger is an essential component br The Verge reported the reason power adapters and EarPods are no longer included could be to offset the increased cost of G components These new components are reported to cost more than their predecessors br br br Repairability concerns br iFixit and Australian YouTuber Hugh Jeffreys discovered that a number of key components such as the cameras would malfunction or display warnings if they are replaced with new ones or those taken from an otherwise identical donor unit Internal Apple documents also mention that beginning with the iPhone and in subsequent models authorized technicians would have to run the phones through an internal System Configuration tool to reprogram repaired units in order to account for hardware changes While Apple has yet to comment on the issue the inability to replace key system components have raised concerns about right to repair and planned obsolescence However the iPhone Mini does not have this issue Apple later addressed the issue with the release of iOS which displays a warning message if the phone detects an unpaired camera module but otherwise allows for full functionality br br br Electromagnetic radiation concerns br In September the French watchdog agency Agence nationale des fr quences notified Apple that sales of the iPhone must be halted in France due to the device exceeding the legal specific absorption rate for consumer electronics The agency also requested that Apple must recall all iPhone s that have been produced in order to meet safety regulations However this coincided with the release of the iPhone models where Apple also discontinued the iPhone globally br Despite the move however France s digital minister did emphasize the iPhone s radiation levels remained well below the threshold deemed harmful by scientific studies Even Apple disputed the findings and said the device complies with regulations Regulations source This highlighted a discrepancy between the agency s tests and real world phone usage scenarios br br br See also br Comparison of smartphones br History of the iPhone br List of iPhone models br Timeline of iPhone models br br br Explanatory notes br br br br br br
