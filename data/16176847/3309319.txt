title: Architecture of macOS
id: 3309319
The architecture of macOS describes the layers of the operating system that is the culmination of Apple Inc s decade long research and development process to replace the classic Mac OS br After the failures of their previous attempts Pink which started as an Apple project but evolved into a joint venture with IBM called Taligent and Copland which started in and was cancelled two years later Apple began development of Mac OS X later renamed OS X and then macOS with the acquisition of NeXT s NeXTSTEP in br br br Development br br br NeXTSTEP br br NeXTSTEP used a hybrid kernel that combined the Mach kernel developed at Carnegie Mellon University with subsystems from BSD NeXTSTEP also introduced a new windowing system based on Display PostScript that intended to achieve better WYSIWYG systems by using the same language to draw content on monitors that drew content on printers NeXT also included object oriented programming tools based on the Objective C language that they had acquired from Stepstone and a collection of Frameworks or Kits that were intended to speed software development NeXTSTEP originally ran on Motorola s k processors but was later ported to Intel s x Hewlett Packard s PA RISC and Sun Microsystems SPARC processors Later on the developer tools and frameworks were released as OpenStep as a development platform that would run on other operating systems br br br Rhapsody br br On February Apple acquired NeXT and began development of the Rhapsody operating system Rhapsody built on NeXTSTEP porting the core system to the PowerPC architecture and adding a redesigned user interface based on the Platinum user interface from Mac OS An emulation layer called Blue Box allowed Mac OS applications to run within an actual instance of the Mac OS and an integrated Java platform The Objective C developer tools and Frameworks were referred to as the Yellow Box and also made available separately for Microsoft Windows The Rhapsody project eventually bore the fruit of all Apple s efforts to develop a new generation Mac OS which finally shipped in the form of Mac OS X Server br br br Mac OS X br br At the Worldwide Developers Conference WWDC Apple announced a move that was intended as a response to complaints from Macintosh software developers who were not happy with the two options Yellow Box and Blue Box available in Rhapsody Mac OS X would add another developer API to the existing ones in Rhapsody Key APIs from the Macintosh Toolbox would be implemented in Mac OS X to run directly on the BSD layers of the operating system instead of in the emulated Macintosh layer This modified interface called Carbon would eliminate approximately troublesome API calls of about total and replace them with calls compatible with a modern OS br At the same conference Apple announced that the Mach side of the kernel had been updated with sources from the OSFMK Open Source Foundation Mach Kernel and the BSD side of the kernel had been updated with sources from the FreeBSD NetBSD and OpenBSD projects They also announced a new driver model called I O Kit intended to replace the Driver Kit used in NeXTSTEP citing Driver Kit s lack of power management and hot swap capabilities and its lack of automatic configuration capability br At the WWDC Apple revealed Quartz a new Portable Document Format PDF based windowing system for the operating system that was not encumbered with licensing fees to Adobe like the Display PostScript windowing system of NeXTSTEP Apple also announced that the Yellow Box layer had been renamed Cocoa and began to move away from their commitment to providing the Yellow Box on Windows At this WWDC Apple also showed Mac OS X booting off of a HFS Plus formatted drive for the first time br The first public release of Mac OS X released to consumers was a Public Beta released on September br br br br br br Bibliography br Levin Jonathan September OS Internals Volume I User Mode v ed Technologeeks ISBN br Levin Jonathan October b OS Internals Volume II Kernel Mode v ed Technologeeks ISBN br Singh Amit June Mac OS X Internals A Systems Approach Addison Wesley Professional ISBN br br br External links br Official Website br MacOS Mojave br Mac OS X Reviews br Mac OS X Internals
