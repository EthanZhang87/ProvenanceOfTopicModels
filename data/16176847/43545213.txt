title: Metal (API)
id: 43545213
Metal is a low level low overhead hardware accelerated D graphic and compute shader API created by Apple debuting in iOS Metal combines functions similar to OpenGL and OpenCL in one API It is intended to improve performance by offering low level access to the GPU hardware for apps on iOS iPadOS macOS and tvOS It can be compared to low level APIs on other platforms such as Vulkan and DirectX br Metal is an object oriented API that can be invoked using the Swift Objective C or C programming languages Full blown GPU execution is controlled via the Metal Shading Language According to Apple promotional materials MSL Metal Shading Language is a single unified language that allows tighter integration between the graphics and compute programs Since MSL is C based you will find it familiar and easy to use br br br Features br Metal aims to provide low overhead access to the GPU Commands are encoded beforehand and then submitted to the GPU for asynchronous execution The application controls when to wait for the execution to complete thus allowing application developers to increase throughput by encoding other commands while commands are executed on the GPU or save power by explicitly waiting for GPU execution to complete Additionally command encoding is CPU independent thus applications can encode commands to each CPU thread independently Lastly render states are pre computed beforehand allowing the GPU driver to know in advance how to configure and optimize the render pipeline before command execution br Metal improves the capabilities of GPGPU programming by using compute shaders Metal uses a specific shading language based on C implemented using Clang and LLVM br Metal allows application developers to create Metal resources such as buffers textures Resources can be allocated on the CPU GPU or both and provides facilities to update and synchronize allocated resources Metal can also enforce a resource s state during a command encoder s lifetime br On macOS Metal can provide application developers the discretion to specify which GPU to execute Application developers can choose between the low power integrated GPU of the CPU the discrete GPU on certain MacBooks and Macs or an external GPU connected through Thunderbolt Application developers also have the preference on how GPU commands are executed on which GPUs and provides suggestion on which GPU a certain command is most efficient to execute commands to render a scene can be executed by the discrete GPU while post processing and display can be handled by the integrated GPU br br br Metal Performance Shaders br Metal Performance Shaders is a highly optimized library of graphics functions that can help application developers achieve great performance at the same time decrease work on maintaining GPU family specific functions It provides functions including br br Image filtering algorithms br Neural network processing br Advanced math operations br Ray tracing br br br History br Metal has been available since June on iOS devices powered by Apple A or later and since June on Macs models or later running OS X El Capitan br On June at WWDC Apple announced the second version of Metal to be supported by macOS High Sierra iOS and tvOS Metal is not a separate API from Metal and is supported by the same hardware Metal enables more efficient profiling and debugging in Xcode accelerated machine learning lower CPU workload support for virtual reality on macOS and specificities of the Apple A GPU in particular br At the WWDC Apple announced the migration of the Mac to Apple silicon Macs using Apple silicon will feature Apple GPUs with a feature set combining what was previously available on macOS and iOS and will be able to take advantage of features tailored to the tile based deferred rendering TBDR architecture of Apple GPUs br At the WWDC Apple announced the third version of Metal Metal which would debut with the release of macOS Ventura iOS and iPadOS Metal introduces the MetalFX upscaling framework which renders complex scenes in less time per frame with high performance upscaling and anti aliasing mesh shaders support Also announced possibility to use C C for Metal API br br br Supported GPUs br The first version of Metal supports the following hardware and software br br Apple A SoC or later with iOS or later br Apple M SoC or later with macOS or later br Intel Processor with Intel HD and Iris Graphics Ivy Bridge series or later with OS X or later br AMD Graphics with GCN or RDNA architecture with OS X or later br NVIDIA Graphics with Kepler architecture with OS X to macOS operating system br NVIDIA Graphics with Maxwell architecture or Pascal architecture with OS X to macOS operating system br The second version of Metal supports the following hardware and software br br Apple A SoC or later with iOS or later br Apple M SoC or later with macOS or later br Intel Processor with Intel HD and Iris Graphics Skylake series or later with macOS or later br AMD Graphics with GCN or RDNA architecture with macOS or later br The third version of Metal supports the following hardware and software br br Apple A or later with iOS iPadOS or
