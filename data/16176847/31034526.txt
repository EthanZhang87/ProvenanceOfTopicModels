Macintosh computers and iOS devices by means of close range wireless communication This communication takes place over Apple Wireless Direct Link Action Frames and Data Frames using generated link local IPv addresses instead of the Wi Fi chip s fixed MAC address br Prior to OS X Yosemite OS X and under OS X Lion Mountain Lion and Mavericks OS X respectively the AirDrop protocol in macOS was different from the AirDrop protocol of iOS and the two were therefore not interoperable OS X Yosemite and later support the iOS AirDrop protocol which is used for transfers between a Mac and an iOS device as well as between two or newer Mac computers and which uses both Wi Fi and Bluetooth Legacy mode for the old AirDrop protocol which only uses Wi Fi between a or older Mac computer or a computer running OS X Lion through OS X Mavericks and another Mac computer was also available until macOS Mojave br Apple reveals no limit on the size of the file which AirDrop can transfer However some Apple users have indicated that oversized files are almost impossible to transfer with a high probability of failure br br br Routine br br br iOS br On iOS and later AirDrop can be accessed by either tapping on Settings General AirDrop or via the Control Center Both Wi Fi and Bluetooth are automatically switched on when AirDrop is enabled as they are both utilized NFC can also be utilized

Everyone can see the device br In iOS or later the Everyone option reverts to Contacts Only after minutes br If an application implements AirDrop support it is available through the share button AirDrop is subject to a number of restrictions on iOS such as the inability to share music or videos from the native apps br br br macOS br On Macs running OS X and greater AirDrop is available in the

for transferring files The Wi Fi radios of the source and target devices communicate directly without using an Internet connection or Wi Fi Access Point br The technical details of AirDrop and the proprietary peer to peer Wi Fi protocol called Apple Wireless Direct Link AWDL have been reverse engineered and the resulting open source implementations published as OWL br and OpenDrop br During the initial handshake devices exchange full SHA hashes of users phone numbers and email addresses which might be used by attackers to infer the phone numbers and in some cases email addresses themselves br In The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice claimed that following complaints from the public about anonymous dissemination of inappropriate messages in public places using AirDrop a forensic institute in Beijing was commissioned to analyze iPhone s encrypted device logs A rainbow table correlating phone numbers and email accounts was created during investigation and has effectively assisted the police in identifying several suspects involved in such cases br Researchers at the Technische Universit t Darmstadt stated that Apple knew that AirDrop users could be identified and
