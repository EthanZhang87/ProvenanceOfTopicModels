The iPad th generation also referred to as the iPad inch is a tablet computer developed and marketed by Apple Inc as the successor to the ninth generation iPad It was announced on October and was released on October br br br Specifications br The design of the tenth generation iPad more closely resembles the higher end iPad Air and Pro models with flatter edges and no home button As with the iPad Air and Mini the Touch ID sensor is located in the power button It is available in silver blue pink and yellow color finishes br Like the iPad Air it has a inch x Liquid Retina display an increase from the previous inch model but it is not laminated The tenth generation iPad uses an A Bionic processor previously seen in the fourth generation iPad Air and the iPhone in The chip has a core CPU a core GPU and a core Neural Engine br The tenth generation iPad has Bluetooth and Wi Fi ax wireless capabilities as well as sub GHz G on cellular models It is the first base model iPad to use USB C instead of the Lightning connector connectivity is limited to USB transfer speeds with support for external displays at p resolution at a refresh rate of Hz or p at Hz The tenth generation iPad does not include a headphone connector requiring wireless headphones or a USB C adapter sold separately br The tenth generation iPad features a megapixel rear facing wide angle camera with an aperture and K video recording support In a first for any iPad the front facing camera is now located on the long edge of the display so that it is horizontally centered when the tablet is in a landscape orientation br br br Accessories br The tenth generation iPad supports the first generation Apple Pencil a USB C to Lightning cable adapter must be used to pair and charge it This adapter has been included with newer production runs of the first generation Pencil since October and is sold separately for existing owners It also supports the lower cost Apple Pencil USB C which charges via a built in USB C port Unlike other iPad models with USB C it does not support the second generation Apple Pencil br Apple unveiled a new keyboard cover accessory for the tenth generation iPad known as the Magic Keyboard Folio as it is incompatible with the Magic Keyboard and Smart Keyboard Folio Unlike the Magic Keyboard designed for the iPad Air and iPad Pro the Magic Keyboard Folio detaches from the back cover and can be used as an adjustable stand and it includes a key function row with a lock button br br br Reception br The tenth generation iPad received mixed reviews from critics with praise for its new design battery life and performance but criticism for removing the headphone jack the lack of support for the second generation Apple Pencil and a higher price point than its predecessor br CNN writer Mike Andronico felt that the A processor had the best performance we ve seen on a tablet at this price and made the device more future proof while the Magic Keyboard Folio accessory was considered to potentially be Apple s best keyboard cover yet However it was noted that its display was starting to show its age in comparison to the iPad Pro and the iPhone Pro due to its lower resolution and refresh rate and that for the vast majority of people who just want a great tablet for streaming sketching gaming and some light productivity the ninth gen iPad is still the better value br The Verge similarly questioned the model s positioning as being stuck in the middle between the cheaper ninth generation iPad and the higher end Air and Pro noting that in a vacuum there s very little to complain about with the th gen iPad It s an excellent tablet that does all of the things you expect from a tablet very well but that it costs considerably more than the ninth generation model and is not as good as an iPad Air And since you can find a current iPad Air on sale fairly easily at this point this new iPad is not the iPad to buy right now despite the fact that it has a lot going for it br br br Timeline br br Source Apple Newsroom Archive br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br Official website
