reported the iPad bending after a few days of use or after carrying it around in a backpack YouTuber Zack Nelson then published a video on his channel JerryRigEverything showing the device cracking and snapping in half after applying just a small amount of pressure with his hands in the center of the device Nelson concluded that the two weakest points were right dead center on either side of the iPad Pro and the crack happened at the very poorly placed microphone hole and the new Apple Pencil charging duct Users reported devices already bent right out of the box mostly cellular models Apple responded to these reports quickly asserting that this is normal and a non issue a response that has been criticized According to Apple the bending is a byproduct of its new manufacturing process Apple has added a support page relating to these issues br br br models br The model of the iPad Pro was seen as a minor enhancement amongst technical reviewers The LIDAR sensor which Apple added for increased AR capability was touted as a feature only a handful of customers will use The new camera setup in the model was noted for providing good image quality The addition in RAM and change in storage options were welcomed but the model was sometimes seen as overkill br br br models br The models had a vast range of reviews feeling that the already powerful processor was made excessively powerful stating that the processor wasn t being taken advantage of due to iPadOS still being considered too limiting and not having professional apps from macOS Camera placement has been criticized for video conferencing The Verge has criticized that they should have had multiuser support like the Mac but they gave positive reviews to the Mini LED and cameras br Despite having and gigabytes of RAM iPadOS only initially allowed gigabytes for apps but this was changed in iPadOS br br br Model comparison br br br Support br br br Models br br br Timeline br br Source Apple Newsroom Archive br
