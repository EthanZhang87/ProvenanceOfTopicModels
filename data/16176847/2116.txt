The Apple II series of microcomputers was initially designed by Steve Wozniak manufactured by Apple Computer now Apple Inc and launched in with the Apple II model that gave the series its name It was followed by the Apple II Plus Apple IIe Apple IIc and Apple IIc Plus with the IIe being the most popular The name is trademarked with square brackets as Apple then beginning with the IIe as Apple In terms of ease of use features and expandability the Apple II was a major advancement over its predecessor the Apple I a limited production bare circuit board computer for electronics hobbyists br The Apple II computers are based on the bit processor and can display text and two resolutions of color graphics A software controlled speaker provides one channel of low fidelity audio A model with more advanced graphics and sound and a bit processor the Apple IIGS was added in It remained compatible with earlier Apple II models but the IIGS has more in common with mid s systems like the Atari ST Amiga and Acorn Archimedes br The Apple II was first sold on June By the end of production in somewhere between five and six million Apple II series computers including about million Apple IIGS models had been produced The Apple II was one of the longest running mass produced home computer series with models in production for just under years br The Apple II became one of several recognizable and successful computers during the s and early s although this was mainly limited to the US It was aggressively marketed through volume discounts and manufacturing arrangements to educational institutions which made it the first computer in widespread use in American secondary schools displacing the early leader Commodore PET The effort to develop educational and business software for the Apple II including the release of the popular VisiCalc spreadsheet made the computer especially popular with business users and families br Despite the introduction of the Motorola based Macintosh in the Apple II series still reportedly accounted for of the company s hardware sales in the first quarter of fiscal Apple continued to sell Apple II systems alongside the Macintosh until terminating the IIGS in December and the IIe in November The last II series Apple in production the IIe card for Macintoshes was discontinued on October The total Apple II sales of all of its models during its year production run were about million units with the peak occurring in when million were sold br br br Hardware br br Unlike preceding home microcomputers The Apple II was sold as a finished consumer appliance rather than as a kit unassembled or preassembled Apple marketed the Apple II as a durable product including a ad in which an Apple II survived a fire started when a cat belonging to one early user knocked over a lamp br All the machines in the series except the IIc share similar overall design elements The plastic case was designed to look more like a home appliance than a piece of electronic equipment and the case can be opened without the use of tools All models in the Apple II series have a built in keyboard with the exception of the IIGS which has a separate keyboard br br Apple IIs have color and high resolution graphics modes sound capabilities and a built in BASIC programming language The motherboard holds eight expansion slots and an array of random access memory RAM sockets that can hold up to kilobytes Over the course of the Apple II series life an enormous amount of first and third party hardware was made available to extend the capabilities of the machine The IIc was designed as a compact portable unit not intended to be disassembled and cannot use most of the expansion hardware sold for the other machines in the series br br br Software br The original Apple II has the operating system in ROM along with a BASIC variant called Integer BASIC Apple eventually released Applesoft BASIC a more advanced variant of the language which users can run instead of Integer BASIC The Apple II series eventually supported over software programs br When the Disk II floppy disk drive was released in a new operating system Apple DOS was commissioned from Shepardson Microsystems and developed by Paul Laughton adding support for the disk drive The final and most popular version of this software was Apple DOS br Apple DOS was superseded by ProDOS which supported a hierarchical filesystem and larger storage devices With an optional third party Z based expansion card the Apple II could boot into the CP M operating system and run WordStar dBase II and other CP M software With the release of MousePaint in and the Apple IIGS in the platform took on the look of the Macintosh user interface including a mouse br Much commercial Apple II software shipped on self booting disks and does not use standard DOS disk formats This discouraged the copying or modifying of the software on the disks and improved loading speed br br br Models br br br Apple II br br The first Apple II computers went on sale on June with a MOS Technology later Synertek microprocessor running at MHz KB of RAM an audio cassette interface for loading programs and storing data and the Integer BASIC programming language built into the ROMs The video controller displayed columns by lines of monochrome upper case only the original character set matches ASCII characters x to x F text on the screen with NTSC composite video output suitable for display on a TV monitor or on a regular TV set by way of a separate RF modulator The original retail price of the computer was US with KB of RAM and US with the maximum KB of RAM To reflect the computer s color graphics capability the Apple logo on the casing was represented using rainbow stripes which remained a part of Apple s corporate logo until early The earliest Apple IIs were assembled in Silicon Valley and later in Texas printed circuit boards were manufactured in Ireland and Singapore br An external inch floppy disk drive the Disk II attached via a controller card that plugged into one of the computer s expansion slots usually slot was used for data storage and retrieval to replace cassettes The Disk II interface created by Steve Wozniak was regarded as an engineering masterpiece for its economy of electronic components br Rather than having a dedicated sound synthesis chip the Apple II had a toggle circuit that could only emit a click through a built in speaker or a line out jack all other sounds including two three and eventually four voice music and playback of audio samples and speech synthesis were generated entirely by software that clicked the speaker at just the right times br The Apple II s multiple expansion slots permitted a wide variety of third party devices including Apple II peripheral cards such as serial controllers display controllers memory boards hard disks networking components and realtime clocks There were plug in expansion cards such as the Z SoftCard that permitted the Apple to use the Z processor and run a multitude of programs developed under the CP M operating system including the dBase II database and the WordStar word processor There was also a third party card that would allow OS Level One to be run Third party sound cards greatly improved audio capabilities allowing simple music synthesis and text to speech functions Eventually Apple II accelerator cards were created to double or quadruple the computer s speed br Rod Holt designed the Apple II s power supply He employed a switched mode power supply design which was far smaller and generated less unwanted heat than the linear power supply some other home computers used br The original Apple II was discontinued at the start of superseded by the Apple II br br br Apple II Plus br br The Apple II Plus introduced in June included the Applesoft BASIC programming language in ROM This Microsoft authored dialect of BASIC which was previously available as an upgrade supported floating point arithmetic and became the standard BASIC dialect on the Apple II series though it ran at a noticeably slower speed than Steve Wozniak s Integer BASIC br Except for improved graphics and disk booting support in the ROM and the removal of the k assembler to make room for the floating point BASIC the II was otherwise identical to the original II in terms of electronic functionality There were small differences in the physical appearance and keyboard RAM prices fell during and all II machines came from the factory with a full k of memory already installed br br br Apple II Europlus and J Plus br br After the success of the first Apple II in the United States Apple expanded its market to include Europe Australia and the Far East in with the Apple II Europlus Europe Australia and the Apple II J Plus Japan In these models Apple made the necessary hardware software and firmware changes in order to comply to standards outside of the US br br br Apple IIe br br The Apple II Plus was followed in by the Apple IIe a cost reduced yet more powerful machine that used newer chips to reduce the component count and add new features such as the display of upper and lowercase letters and a standard KB of RAM br The IIe RAM was configured as if it were a KB Apple II Plus with a language card The machine had no slot but instead had an auxiliary slot that could accept a KB memory card to enable the column display This card contained only RAM the hardware and firmware for the column display was built into the Apple IIe An extended column card with more memory increased the machine s RAM to KB br The Apple IIe was the most popular machine in the Apple II series It has the distinction of being the longest lived Apple computer of all time it was manufactured and sold with only minor changes for nearly years The IIe was the last Apple II model to be sold and was discontinued in November br During its lifespan two variations were introduced the Apple IIe Enhanced four replacement chips to give it some of the features of the later model Apple IIc and the Apple IIe Platinum a modernized case color to match other Apple products of the era along with the addition of a numeric keypad br Some of the feature of the IIe were carried over from the less successful Apple III among them the ProDOS operating system br br br Apple IIc br br The Apple IIc was released in April billed as a portable Apple II because it could be easily carried due to its size and carrying handle which could be flipped down to prop the machine up into a typing position Unlike modern portables it lacked a built in display and battery It was the first of three Apple II models to be made in the Snow White design language and the only one that used its unique creamy off white color br The Apple IIc was the first Apple II to use the C low power variant of the processor and featured a built in inch floppy drive and KB RAM with a built in disk controller that could control external drives composite video NTSC or PAL serial interfaces for modem and printer and a port usable by either a joystick or mouse Unlike previous Apple II models the IIc had no internal expansion slots at all br Two different monochrome LC displays were sold for use with the IIc s video expansion port although both were short lived due to high cost and poor legibility The IIc had an external power supply that converted AC power to V DC though the IIc itself will accept between V and V DC allowing third parties to offer battery packs and automobile power adapters that connected in place of the supplied AC adapter br br br Apple IIGS br br The Apple IIGS released on September is the penultimate and most advanced model in the Apple II series and a radical departure from prior models It uses a bit microprocessor the C operating at MHz with bit addressing allowing expansion up to MB of RAM The graphics are significantly improved with colors and new modes with resolutions of and The audio capabilities are vastly improved with a built in music synthesizer that far exceeded any other home computer br The Apple IIGS evolved the platform while still maintaining near complete backward compatibility Its Mega II chip contains the functional equivalent of an entire Apple IIe computer sans processor This combined with the s ability to execute C code directly provides full support for legacy software while also supporting bit software running under a new OS br The OS eventually included a Macintosh like graphical Finder for managing disks and files and opening documents and applications along with desk accessories Later the IIGS gained the ability to read and write Macintosh disks and through third party software a multitasking Unix like shell and TrueType font support br The GS includes a voice Ensoniq DOC sample based sound synthesizer chip with KB dedicated RAM KB or later MB of standard RAM built in peripheral ports switchable between IIe style card slots and IIc style onboard controllers for disk drives mouse RGB video and serial devices and built in AppleTalk networking br br br Apple IIc Plus br br The final Apple II model was the Apple IIc Plus introduced in It was the same size and shape as the IIc that came before it but the inch floppy drive had been replaced with a inch drive the power supply was moved inside the case and the processor was a fast MHz C processor that actually ran bit Apple II software faster than the IIGS br The IIc Plus also featured a new keyboard layout that matched the Platinum IIe and IIGS Unlike the IIe IIc and IIGS the IIc Plus came only in one version American and was not officially sold anywhere outside the US The Apple IIc Plus ceased production in with its two year production run being the shortest of all the Apple II computers br br br Apple IIe Card br br Although not an extension of the Apple II line in the Apple IIe Card an expansion card for the Macintosh LC was released Essentially a miniaturized Apple IIe computer on a card using the Mega II chip from the Apple IIGS it allowed the Macintosh to run bit Apple IIe software through hardware emulation with an option to run at roughly double the speed of the original IIe about MHz However the video output was emulated in software and depending on how much of the screen the currently running program was trying to update in a single frame performance could be much slower compared to a real IIe This is due to the fact that writes from the C on the IIe Card to video memory were caught by the additional hardware on the card so the video emulation software running on the Macintosh side could process that write and update the video display But while the Macintosh was processing video updates execution of Apple II code would be temporarily halted br With a breakout cable which connected to the back of the card the user could attach up to two UniDisk or Apple Drives up to one UniDisk drive and a DE Apple II joystick Many of the LC s built in Macintosh peripherals could also be borrowed by the card when in Apple II mode including extra RAM the Mac s internal inch floppy drives AppleTalk networking any ProDOS formatted hard disk partitions the serial ports mouse and real time clock The IIe card could not however run software intended for the bit Apple IIGS br br br Advertising marketing and packaging br br Mike Markkula a retired Intel marketing manager provided the early critical funding for Apple Computer From to Apple used the Regis McKenna agency for its advertisements and marketing In Chiat Day acquired Regis McKenna s advertising operations and Apple used Chiat Day At Regis McKenna Advertising the team assigned to launch the Apple II consisted of Rob Janoff art director Chip Schafer copywriter and Bill Kelley account executive Janoff came up with the Apple logo with a bite out of it The design was originally an olive green with matching company logotype all in lower case Steve Jobs insisted on promoting the color capability of the Apple II by putting rainbow stripes on the Apple logo In its letterhead and business card implementation the rounded a of the logotype echoed the bite in the logo This logo was developed simultaneously with an advertisement and a brochure the latter being produced for distribution initially at the first West Coast Computer Faire br Since the original Apple II Apple has paid high attention to its quality of packaging partly because of Steve Jobs personal preferences and opinions on packaging and final product appearance All of Apple s packaging for the Apple II series looked similar featuring much clean white space and showing the Apple rainbow logo prominently For several years up until the late s Apple used the Motter Tektura font for packaging until changing to the Apple Garamond font br Apple ran the first advertisement for the Apple II a two page spread ad titled Introducing Apple II in BYTE in July The first brochure was entitled Simplicity and the copy in both the ad and brochure pioneered demystifying language intended to make the new idea of a home computer more personal The Apple II introduction ad was later run in the September issue of Scientific American br Apple later aired eight television commercials for the Apple IIGS emphasizing its benefits to education and students along with some print ads br br br Clones br br The Apple II was frequently cloned both in the United States and abroad in a similar way to the IBM PC According to some sources see below more than different models of Apple II clones were manufactured Most could not be legally imported into the United States Apple sued and sought criminal charges against clone makers in more than a dozen countries br br br Data storage br br br Cassette br Originally the Apple II used Compact Cassette tapes for program and data storage A dedicated tape recorder along the lines of the Commodore Datasette was never produced Apple recommended using the Panasonic RQ in some of its early printed documentation The uses of common consumer cassette recorders and a standard video monitor or television set with a third party RF modulator made the total cost of owning an Apple II less expensive and helped contribute to the Apple II s success br Cassette storage may have been inexpensive but it was also slow and unreliable The Apple II s lack of a disk drive was a glaring weakness in what was otherwise intended to be a polished professional product Recognizing that the II needed a disk drive to be taken seriously Apple set out to develop a disk drive and a DOS to run it Wozniak spent the Christmas holidays designing a disk controller that reduced the number of chips used by a factor of compared to existing controllers Still lacking a DOS and with Wozniak inexperienced in operating system design Jobs approached Shepardson Microsystems with the project On April Apple signed a contract for with Sheperdson to develop the DOS br Even after disk drives made the cassette tape interfaces obsolete they were still used by enthusiasts as simple one bit audio input output ports Ham radio operators used the cassette input to receive slow scan TV single frame images A commercial speech recognition Blackjack program was available after some user specific voice training it would recognize simple commands Hit stand Bob Bishop s Music Kaleidoscope was a simple program that monitored the cassette input port and based on zero crossings created color patterns on the screen a predecessor to current audio visualization plug ins for media players Music Kaleidoscope was especially popular on projection TV sets in dance halls br br br The OS Disk br br Apple and many third party developers made software available on tape at first but after the Disk II became available in tape based Apple II software essentially disappeared from the market The initial price of the Disk II drive and controller was US although a off coupon was available through the Apple newsletter Contact The controller could handle two drives and a second drive without controller retailed for br The Disk II single sided floppy drive used inch floppy disks double sided disks could be used one side at a time by turning them over and notching a hole for the write protect sensor The first disk operating systems for the Apple II were DOS and DOS which stored KB on each disk organized into tracks of byte sectors each After about two years DOS was introduced storing KB thanks to a minor firmware change on the disk controller that allowed it to store sectors per track This upgrade was user installable as two PROMs on older controllers After the release of DOS the user community discontinued use of DOS except for running legacy software Programs that required DOS were fairly rare however as DOS was not a major architectural change aside from the number of sectors per track a program called MUFFIN was provided with DOS to allow users to copy files from DOS disks to DOS disks It was possible for software developers to create a DOS disk which would also boot on a system with DOS firmware br Later double sided drives with heads to read both sides of the disk became available from third party companies Apple only produced double sided inch disks for the Lisa computer br On a DOS x disk tracks and most of track were reserved to store the operating system It was possible with a special utility to reclaim most of this space for data if a disk did not need to be bootable A short ROM program on the disk controller had the ability to seek to track zero which it did without regard for the read write head s current position resulting in the characteristic chattering sound of a Disk II boot which was the read write head hitting the rubber stop block at the end of the rail and read and execute code from sector The code contained in there would then pull in the rest of the operating system DOS stored the disk s directory on track smack in the middle of the track disks in order to reduce the average seek time to the frequently used directory track The directory was fixed in size and could hold a maximum of files Subdirectories were not supported br Most game publishers did not include DOS on their floppy disks since they needed the memory it occupied more than its capabilities instead they often wrote their own boot loaders and read only file systems This also served to discourage crackers from snooping around in the game s copy protection code since the data on the disk was not in files that could be accessed easily br Some third party manufacturers produced floppy drives that could write tracks to most inch disks yielding KB of storage per disk but the format did not catch on widely and no known commercial software was published on track media Most drives even Disk IIs could write tracks a two byte modification to DOS to format the extra track was common br The Apple Disk II stored KB on single sided single density floppy disks but it was very common for Apple II users to extend the capacity of a single sided floppy disk to KB by cutting out a second write protect notch on the side of the disk using a disk notcher or hole puncher and inserting the disk flipped over Double sided disks with notches on both sides were available at a higher price but in practice the magnetic coating on the reverse of nominally single sided disks was usually of good enough quality to be used both sides were coated in the same way to prevent warping although only one side was certified for use Early on diskette manufacturers routinely warned that this technique would damage the read write head of the drives or wear out the disk faster and these warnings were frequently repeated in magazines of the day In practice however this method was an inexpensive way to store twice as much data for no extra cost and was widely used for commercially released floppies as well br Later Apple IIs were able to use inch disks with a total capacity of KB and hard disks DOS did not support these drives natively third party software was required and disks larger than about KB had to be split up into multiple virtual disk volumes br DOS was succeeded by ProDOS a descendant of the Apple s SOS It added support for subdirectories and volumes up to MB in size ProDOS became the Apple II DOS of choice AppleWorks and other newer programs required it br br br Legacy br br The Apple II series of computers had an enormous impact on the technology industry and expanded the role of microcomputers in society The Apple II was the first personal computer many people ever saw Its price was within the reach of many middle class families and a partnership with MECC helped make the Apple II popular in schools By the end of Apple had already sold over Apple IIs Its popularity bootstrapped the computer game and educational software markets and began the boom in the word processor and computer printer markets The first spreadsheet application VisiCalc was initially released for the Apple II and many businesses bought them just to run VisiCalc Its success drove IBM in part to create the IBM PC which many businesses purchased to run spreadsheet and word processing software at first ported from Apple II versions br The Apple II s slots allowing any peripheral card to take control of the bus and directly access memory enabled an independent industry of card manufacturers who together created a flood of hardware products that let users build systems that were far more powerful and useful at a lower cost than any competing system most of which were not nearly as expandable and were universally proprietary The first peripheral card was a blank prototyping card intended for electronics enthusiasts who wanted to design their own peripherals for the Apple II br Specialty peripherals kept the Apple II in use in industry and education environments for many years after Apple Computer stopped supporting the Apple II Well into the s every clean room the super clean facility where spacecraft are prepared for flight at the Kennedy Space Center used an Apple II to monitor the environment and air quality Most planetariums used Apple IIs to control their projectors and other equipment br Even the game port was unusually powerful and could be used for digital and analog input and output The early manuals included instructions for how to build a circuit with only four commonly available components one transistor and three resistors and a software routine to drive a common Teletype Model machine Don Lancaster used the game I O to drive a LaserWriter printer br br br Modern use br Today emulators for various Apple II models are available to run Apple II software on macOS Linux Microsoft Windows homebrew enabled Nintendo DS and other operating systems Numerous disk images of Apple II software are available free over the Internet for use with these emulators AppleWin and MESS are among the best emulators compatible with most Apple II images
