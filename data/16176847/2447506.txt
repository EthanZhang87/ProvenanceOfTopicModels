id: 2447506
Maemo is a software platform originally developed by Nokia now developed by the community for smartphones and Internet tablets The platform comprises both the Maemo operating system and SDK Maemo played a key role in Nokia s strategy to compete with Apple and Android but ultimately failed to surpass both companies Maemo is mostly based on open source code and has been developed by Maemo Devices within Nokia in collaboration with many open source projects such as the Linux kernel Debian and GNOME Maemo is based on Debian and draws much of its GUI frameworks and libraries from the GNOME project It uses the Matchbox window manager and the GTK based Hildon framework as its GUI and application framework br The user interface in Maemo is similar to many hand held interfaces and features a home screen from which all applications and settings are accessed The home screen is divided into areas for launching applications a menu bar and a large customizable area that can display information such as an RSS reader Internet radio player and Google search box The Maemo user interface is slightly different the menu bar and info area are consolidated to the top of the display and the four desktops can be customized with shortcuts and widgets br At the Mobile World Congress in February it was announced that the Maemo project would be merging with Moblin to create the MeeGo mobile software platform Despite that the Maemo community continued to be active and in late Nokia began transferring Maemo ownership to the Hildon Foundation which was replaced by a German association Maemo Community e V br Since a new release called Maemo Leste is in development which is based on Devuan br br br User interface br br br OS OS br Up to Maemo AKA OS the default screen is the Home screen the central point from which all applications and settings are accessed The Home Screen is divided into the following areas br br Vertically down the left hand side of the screen is the taskbar with applets for the web browser communications and application menu by default These can be modified using third party plug ins e g to provide a favorites or command menu br Horizontally across the top left half is the menu bar which shows the application name and window title and gives access to the application s menu which contains the typical file edit view tools etc menus and sub menus br Horizontally across the top right quadrant is the status bar containing icons such as battery life wireless connection volume Bluetooth status and brightness by default These can be expanded using third party plug ins in the same manner as the task bar br The remaining large part of the display contains Home applets roughly analogous to Apple Inc s Dashboard widgets which can display data as well as serving as a shortcut to applications These include an RSS reader Internet radio player Google search box and contact list by default but can also be expanded with third party plug ins br The interface uses either the touch screen or a directional pad and select button with separate back menu and home buttons It is capable of receiving text input through handwriting recognition two different sizes of on screen keyboard and hardware keyboard input with the N br br br Maemo Fremantle br br The user interface in Maemo is different from its predecessors It provides four fully customizable with the ability to add remove widgets move widgets around change the background and customize shortcuts to applications contacts Home screens called Panorama Desktop Switching from one desktop to the others is done by sliding one s finger horizontally on the background The dashboard is accessed via the upper left icon and shows all the running applications in a manner similar to the Expos feature in Apple s Mac OS X operating system From the dashboard running applications can be brought back to full screen by tapping the preview window and applications can be closed by tapping an X symbol located in the top right corner of the preview window similar to the concept of closing applications in other operating systems The application launcher where all the installed applications can be launched can also be accessed from the dashboard If no task or application is running in the background tapping the top left icon skips the dashboard and directly displays the application launcher br Maemo provides the Mozilla based MicroB web browser with complete Adobe Flash support It supports an display resolution so some web pages can be viewed without horizontal scrolling It can automatically connect to known wireless networks download RSS feeds and email and disconnect automatically without user intervention br Advanced Packaging Tool with a command line apt get client can be used to install applications Users can subscribe to different software repositories which can then be used to automatically keep software up to date The application manager also provides an overview of everything currently installed on the system Data can be synchronized with a PC via a USB connection and the user s files can be accessed using the standard Removable Storage Device protocol br A new update Version was released onto the Nokia N on November as an OTA update The new version mostly consists of security updates This is considered to be the final official update to Maemo Fremantle shipped by Nokia br Further development of Maemo happens as a community effort in Maemo CSSU br br br Features br br br Updating br Maemo devices can be updated using a simple flashing method with a computer over USB br Since Diablo Maemo Maemo supports Seamless Software Update SSU which allows incremental operating system upgrades over the air using the Advanced Packaging Tool without the need for a full flash with every update br Flashing remains available as a way to start over from scratch with a clean installation much like formatting a hard drive and reinstalling an operating system on a PC br br br Security br br The quick start guide for developers warns that Maemo security concentrates on preventing remote attacks e g by wireless networking and Bluetooth It also warns that Maemo s root account has a trivial default password user gainroot password rootme which needs to be changed before enabling remote access br Maemo employs a numeric security code as a way to lock the device s controls and display independently of the root password to help prevent unauthorised access br br br Software architecture br Maemo is a modified version of the Debian Linux distribution slimmed down for mobile devices It uses an X Window System based graphical user interface using Xomap and the Matchbox window manager The GUI uses the GTK toolkit and Hildon user interface widgets and API br BusyBox a software package for embedded and mobile devices replaces the GNU Core Utilities used in Debian proper to reduce memory usage and storage requirements at the expense of some functionality br ESD is used as the primary sound server and GStreamer is used by the shipped media player to play back sounds and movies The formats supported by GStreamer can be extended by compiling GStreamer plugins in scratchbox Maemo SDK which was done for example to bring Ogg support to the platform as well as experimental features such as WebM and VP after they were announced by Google Third party media players can access GStreamer directly or via osso media server br Window management is handled by the Matchbox window manager which limits the screen to showing a single window at a time Ubuntu Netbook Edition implements a similar system This is to improve usability on a mobile device with a small screen br Although Maemo is based on Linux and other open source software some parts of Maemo remain closed source These include some user space software like certain status bar and taskbar applets including the display brightness applet and applications and some system daemons related to connectivity and power management br br br Software br Maemo comes with a number of built in applications but additional applications can be installed from a number of sources including various official and community software repositories and deb files through either the built in package manager Application manager or the Advanced Packaging Tool and dpkg Bundled applications include the Mozilla based MicroB browser Macromedia Flash player Gizmo and Skype br br br Notable third party applications br Due in part to the free and open source nature of Linux and Maemo porting applications to Maemo is a straightforward procedure Because of this there are many third party applications available for the platform Some applications are original software written specifically for Maemo while other applications are straight ports of existing Linux programs Some notable software includes br br Media players br MPlayer br Internet br Claws Mail Modest Midori Firefox for mobile Opera Mobile br Office applications br Gnumeric spreadsheet Abiword word processing br Instant Messaging br Pidgin br VOIP br Gizmo Skype br Games br The Battle for Wesnoth Wormux Doom Angry Birds br Others br FBReader e book reader GPE OpenSync compatible PIM rdesktop RDP remote access Rhapsody subscription music US only ScummVM game emulator Free HP S calculator emulator Monsoon HAVA TV viewer and controller Navit GPS navigation software Vagalume Last FM player VNC br Fremantle Stars br Applications developed by the community and supported by Nokia as Fremantle Stars will be part of Maemo Notable applications include ScummVM game includes Beneath a Steel Sky and Fennec web browser br Debian br The complete ARM Debian distribution can be installed as a Maemo application making thousands of software packages available including OpenOffice org Mozilla Firefox Java the GNOME and LXDE desktops etc Debian ARM packages can also be used if they are modified with the maemo optify tool The ability to run largely unmodified linux packages sets Maemo apart from other Linux based mobile operating systems such as Android and webOS br br br Media support br Other media types such as the audio format OGG can be added with the use of community plug ins br br Video br MPEG MPEG ASP H RealVideo AVI GP br Audio playlists br MP RealAudio MPEG AAC WAV AMP MP AMR AWB M A WMA OGG Vorbis requires addon package M U PLS br Image Animation br JPEG BMP TIFF PNG SVG Tiny ICO br Text layout br text files PDF HTML br br br Software development br Software can be developed in C using the Maemo SDK Java which is supported by the Jalimo JVM Python Ruby Mono Vala Perl and Pascal br The Maemo SDK is based around the Debian oriented Scratchbox Cross Compilation Toolkit which provides a sandbox environment in which development may take place Scratchbox uses QEMU to emulate an ARM processor or sbrsh to remotely execute instructions Scratchbox compatible rootstraps are available for both x and ARM so the majority of development and debugging takes place on x with final packaging being for ARM br As a new feature of the Maemo operating system Maemo offers the Qt library as a community supported component alongside the officially supported GTK backend This will change with the Harmattan release which will add the Qt library as the default with GTK becoming community supported The programming languages Python C and C will also be supported br The Nokia Developer Wiki community has articles about Qt development and includes tutorials and articles about development for the Maemo operating system br br br Hardware br The Maemo operating system is designed for Nokia Internet Tablets which feature very similar specifications to Nokia s high end N series and E series cellphones with TI OMAP ARM SoCs large screens and expandable internal storage Although the highly optimized hardware specific nature of Maemo renders its operation on non Internet tablet hardware very difficult most of the important non proprietary parts of the operating system along with some of the available third party applications are actively being packaged for Debian and are available for use on other distributions which will open up a large range of other hardware options br Nokia runs the Maemo operating system on the Nokia N and Nokia N br br br Version history br br br OS br br Shipped with the in November this is the original Internet tablet OS It came bundled with the Opera web browser Flash basic email and RSS clients audio and video players PDF and image viewers a graphical Advanced Packaging Tool front end dubbed simply Application manager and a variety of simple games and utilities br br br OS br br On May Nokia announced a new version of Internet Tablet OS which was subsequently released as a beta version for the on June and as a production version on June The update featured improved performance and stability a built in Google Talk client a refreshed look and a new full screen finger keyboard Because of significant API and architecture changes existing applications required recompiling It is the last officially supported Internet Tablet OS release for the br Also included was the ability to support GB RS MMC cards FAT formatted The Linux kernel was upgraded to with the associated patches for the OMAP platform included This new version uses kernel preemption for improved interactivity br br br OS br br OS was released and bundled with the N on January after its unveiling at the Las Vegas CES summit It featured significant bug fixes and performance improvements in almost all areas of the OS bringing updated versions of the Opera web browser and Adobe Flash Player an updated interface and various API and library updates br br br OS br br OS was released with the N in November based on Linux and featuring MicroB a new Mozilla based web browser that replaces Opera It also features integrated Samba file sharing and additional support for Windows Media Player Formats and H and improved support for USB devices among other incremental UI improvements particularly in the direction of finger friendliness Dynamic frequency scaling between MHz and MHz was also implemented which gave the N a MHz speed increase br br br Diablo br Diablo is the codename for the OS Feature Upgrade corresponding to Maemo released in June Major features include significant improvements to the built in Application manager incremental operating system upgrades without reflashing Seamless Software Update SSU Modest as the default mail client and a new version of the MicroB browser with better performance and some interface improvements though still based on the same Gecko release as Chinook s MicroB Diablo also included an implementation of the WiMAX stack for the short lived N variation called N WiMAX edition br br br SSU br SSU in particular is one of the most significant parts of the Diablo release as it eliminates the flash based upgrade system of previous Maemo releases which required the user to completely wipe their device with each upgrade With SSU the user can receive over the air updates This also decouples bundled software updates from the major system updates as was required with the flash based method so Nokia can release more frequent updates to individual packages than before br The first SSU update was pushed on August and brought Diablo up to version The update primarily features MicroB Modest and connectivity framework updates as well as a number of other minor bugfixes br br br Maemo br br Maemo also known as Fremantle is the default operating system on the Nokia N The release features a much more finger friendly and consistent user interface and an X server based on Xorg rather than KDrive It also features several new technologies including the Tracker search system PulseAudio replacing ESD the OHM hardware management daemon the gUPnP UPnP framework enhanced location framework and Upstart Several existing technologies have also been updated including Gecko BlueZ gstreamer will include OpenMAX GTK and Telepathy br Maemo comes with new hardware the Nokia N featuring a Texas Instruments OMAP SoC with an HSPA modem and HD camera which provides significant improvements in speed D acceleration and media playback Nokia decided that the commercial Maemo platform releases will not be available on N N hardware for compatibility reasons An open source Linux project called Mer a variant of Maemo has been formed to provide an alternative fully open operating system for mobile devices including the Nokia N and N br Unlike most smartphones the end user is able to gain root access by installing an application such as the rootsh and then issuing the appropriate command in the terminal in Maemo The device does not need to be unlocked or jailbroken in order to install an unsupported application The UK cellular operator Vodafone has its own branded somewhat more restricted version of the Maemo operating system Users can flash change to the global variant of the operating system if they wish br The Maemo operating system comes preloaded with a variety of applications such as br br Web br Maemo Browser Mozilla based web browser with Adobe Flash RSS reader br Phone application br VoIP br Session Initiation Protocol Skype br Conversations IM chat and SMS no MMS br Media br Camera Photos Media player br Production br Email Calendar PDF reader Contacts br Ovi Maps Find position on a map using the GPS Search an address or location Plan routes br Utilities br Clock Notes Calculator Sketch br System Tools br File manager Application manager for downloads Widgets br Games br Bounce Chess Blocks Marbles and Mahjong br Nokia expects the open source community to play a large part in the development of applications for Maemo For example Nokia has launched a contest at the onedotzero festival in London called PUSH N aimed at designers artists hackers and modders The contest invites participants to connect the N to something you love br More than additional applications mostly free to download and use have been created by third party developers br br br Maemo Leste br br Maemo Leste is an operating system currently in development It is a modernised and liberated version of Maemo rebased on top of Devuan with a mainline Linux kernel aims to develop An independent mobile operating system focused on trustworthiness The first operating system images were released in February The latest release supports phone calls and SMS messages on a number of devices including the Nokia N some integration and bug fixes remain and the Motorola Droid as announced in the project s Five year anniversary blog post br It is currently in a usable state with support for various targets such as the N Motorola Droid and the PinePhone Unlike other distributions Maemo Leste targets devices where it can be used with upstream Linux kernels to offer proper updates to both functionality and security The operating system aims to be entirely open source and even re implements certain closed components that were present in Maemo Fremantle br Maemo Leste is entirely community developed and its developers are active on maemo leste connect on the Libera Chat IRC network br br br Hacker Editions br Nokia s release of the N in January included Internet Tablet OS OS ran only on the N and Nokia had no plans to release it for the however feedback from disgruntled owners led Nokia to release an unsupported hybrid of OS and OS dubbed Internet Tablet OS Hacker Edition in February OS HE combined the binary parts of OS with most of the updated libraries and user space applications of OS br Nokia followed the release of the N and OS in November with the OS Hacker Edition for the on February employing a similar method to the OS HE release to create a hybrid between OS and OS The Hacker Editions allow users to access the latest Internet Tablet OS releases and third party software although due to the s hardware limitations and the increased CPU requirements of OS performance is inferior to that of OS HE in most areas br br br Alternative desktops br In addition to the officially supported Hildon environment that comes standard on the tablets several alternate desktop systems are available Penguinbait a member of the Internet Tablet Talk community has successfully ported KDE Openbox and Xfce to the N and N the N is able to run an early version of the KDE port A port of KDE Plasma Workspaces were developed LXDE is the default desktop for the Easy Debian distribution which is installed as a single application under Maemo but provides access to the full range of software in the ARM Debian distribution including GIMP Iceweasel Firefox and OpenOffice via a chroot environment br br br Derivatives br br br MeeGo br br In the wake of the release of the MeeGo code base there are two main community efforts to bring MeeGo to the current Maemo devices N N and N as Nokia has launched the N which is powered by MeeGo These efforts are the MeeGo adaptation for the N and N devices and the MeeGo to N project br br br Harmattan br Harmattan was originally planned as a transitional operating system developed by Nokia meant to be a bridge between Nokia s Maemo and the MeeGo project It is still using the APT package manager for applications but the graphical user interface and major parts of the system were improved rewritten from scratch or rebased on top of Meego frameworks It is heavily using the Qt libraries instead of GTK Hildon and introduced a new UI paradigm based on Swipe gestures done from the edge of the screen After problems with the original Meego project Nokia decided to rename Harmattan to Meego Harmattan and shipped their N with this OS br br br Mer br br Mer is a completely free and open source software distribution targeting mobile and embedded systems first developed for reimplementing Maemo in the open and then rebased on top of the MeeGo tools br br br Qt br In January Nokia began the process of acquiring Trolltech the developer of the Qt application framework Nokia has since announced plans for the Qt libraries to be bundled with Maemo by Q though without a platform specific hildonized user interface as is offered with GTK meaning Qt applications will look different from hildonized GTK applications This will make porting of Qt applications to the platform easier for developers and make new applications available to users Qt support on S devices will likely lead to cross platform application sharing between the two platforms The announcement has been met with mixed reactions in the developer community br br br Release history br br br Naming br Maemo codenames are named for winds For example the latest release codenamed Fremantle is a reference to the Fremantle Doctor the Western Australian vernacular term for the cooling afternoon sea breeze which occurs during summer months in south west coastal areas of Western Australia br br Hacker Editions Nokia released but community maintained Primarily used by developers to continue developing programs while using older hardware br br br Maemo Summit br In and Maemo developers and users gathered at the Maemo Summit the registration for which was free Each participant got a badge and a Maemo T shirt br The Maemo Summit was held in Amsterdam on October The first day was the Nokia day with the other two days dedicated to community contributions Nearly developers attended the summit Nokia gave out N devices to independent developers during the summit br The Maemo Summit was also the last Maemo Summit since MeeGo was launched The event was replaced by the MeeGo Conference
