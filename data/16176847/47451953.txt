alongside the st generation SE are the longest supported iPhones ever released through seven major versions of iOS from iOS to iOS They do not support iOS due to hardware limitations br br br History br Before the official unveiling several aspects of the iPhone s were rumored including the base model having gigabytes of storage the pressure sensitive display technology known as D Touch and a new rose gold color option br iPhone s and iPhone s Plus were officially unveiled on September during a press event at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco Pre orders began September with the official release on September br On September Apple announced the iPhone and Plus as respective successors to the iPhone s and s Plus although they continued to be sold at a reduced price point as entry level options in the iPhone lineup br On March the iPhone s and s Plus were released in Indonesia alongside the iPhone and Plus following Apple s research and development investment in the country br The iPhone s iPhone s Plus and first generation iPhone SE were the last iPhone models to feature a standard mm stereo headphone jack and were discontinued on September with the release of the iPhone XR br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Specifications br br br Hardware br br br Design br The iPhone s is nearly identical in design to the iPhone In response to the bendgate design flaws of the previous model changes were made to improve the durability of the chassis the s was constructed from a stronger series aluminum alloy key points in the rear casing were strengthened and reinforced and touchscreen integrated circuits were re located to the display assembly Alongside the existing gold silver and space gray options a new rose gold color option was also introduced br br br Chipsets br The iPhone s is powered by the Apple A system on chip which the company stated is up to faster than Apple A and has up to better graphics performance The iPhone s has GiB of RAM twice as much as any previous iPhone and also supports LTE Advanced The Touch ID sensor on the s was also updated with the new version having improved fingerprint scanning performance over the previous version br br br Batteries br While the capacities of their non user replaceable batteries are slightly smaller mAh and mAh respectively Apple rates the iPhone s and s Plus as having the same average battery life as their respective predecessors mAh and mAh The A system on chip was dual sourced from TSMC and Samsung Although it was speculated that the Samsung version had worse battery performance than the TSMC version multiple independent tests have shown there is no appreciable difference between the two chips Although the device was not promoted as such the iPhone s has a degree of water resistance because of a change to its internal design which places a silicone seal around components of the logic board and an adhesive gasket around the display assembly to prevent them from being shorted by accidental exposure to water br br br Displays br Their displays are the same sizes as those of the iPhone coming in inch p and inch p Plus sizes The iPhone s features a technology known as D Touch sensors are embedded in the screen s backlight layer that measure the firmness of the user s touch input by the distance between it and the cover glass allowing the device to distinguish between normal and more forceful presses D Touch is combined with a Taptic Engine vibrator to provide associated haptic feedback Although similar this is distinct from the Force Touch technology used on the Apple Watch and the trackpad of the Retina MacBook as it is more sensitive and can recognize more levels of touch pressure than Force Touch Due to the hardware needed to implement D Touch the iPhone s is heavier than its predecessor br br br Cameras br The iPhone s and s Plus feature a megapixel pixels rear facing camera an upgrade from the megapixel unit on previous models as well as a megapixel front facing camera compared to megapixels of the iPhone iPhone s iPhone Plus and iPhone SE br Their rear camera can record K video p for the first time on an iPhone as well as FullHD p video at and now frames per second the latter also for the first time on an iPhone The camera was well received by many critics of the phone When the camera takes a K video recording it can use the storage on the phone rapidly The gigabyte version of the phone was only capable of holding minutes of K video bit rate MB s or Mbit s br Still photos with megapixels can be captured during video recording br br br Storage br The iPhone s and s Plus were originally offered in models with and GB or GiB of internal storage Following the release of iPhone in September the and GB models were dropped and replaced by a new GB GiB option Some of this storage space is used by preinstalled software resulting in usable storage of and GiB For improved storage performance iPhone s utilizes NVM Express NVMe resulting in a maximum average read speed of megabytes per second br br br Software br br The iPhone s originally shipped with iOS the operating system leverages the D Touch hardware to allow recognition of new gestures and commands including peeking at content with a light touch and popping it into view by pressing harder and accessing context menus with links to commonly used functions within apps with harder presses on home screen icons The camera app s Retina Flash feature allows the display s brightness to be used as a makeshift flash on images taken with the front camera while Live Photos captures a short video alongside each photo taken br The iPhone s s Plus and first generation SE support iOS which was first released on September They also support iOS unveiled on June and was released to the public on September as well as iOS unveiled on June and iOS unveiled on June These phones support most of the main features of iOS including dark mode Along with the iPhone SE the s and s Plus are the oldest iPhones to support iOS iOS and iOS br On June after iOS was announced at the WWDC it was revealed that the iPhone s and s Plus along with the first generation iPhone SE iPhone and iPhone Plus will not be compatible with this new version of the operating system br br br Reception br The iPhone s had a generally positive reception While performance and camera quality were praised by most reviewers the addition of D Touch was liked by one critic for the potential of entirely new interface interactions but disliked by another critic for not providing users with an expected intuitive response before actually using the feature The battery life was criticized and one reviewer asserted that the phone s camera was not significantly better than the rest of the industry The iPhone s set a new first weekend sales record selling million models up from million for the iPhone in the previous year However Apple saw its first ever quarterly year over year decline in iPhone sales in the months after the launch credited to a saturated smartphone market in Apple s biggest countries and a lack of iPhone purchases in developing countries br Nilay Patel of The Verge in described the s in particular the Plus model as right now the best phone on the market There just aren t other companies that can roll out a feature like D Touch and make it work in a way that suggests the creation of entirely new interface paradigms and every other phone maker needs to figure out exactly why Apple s cameras are so consistent before they can really compete Samuel Gibbs of The Guardian commented that the phone has the potential to be the best smaller smartphone on the market but its short battery life is deeply frustrating and described the camera as not leagues ahead of the competition anymore Tom Salinger of The Register praised performance noting that we re now using phones with the performance of current PCs but described D Touch as just a glorified vibrator and no good you still don t know quite what s going to happen until you try it Ryan Smith and Joshua Ho of AnandTech awarded the iPhone s and s Plus its Editors Choice Gold Award based largely on the phone s performance and the addition of D Touch br br br Sales br On the Monday following the iPhone s s launch weekend Apple announced that they had sold million models a record breaking number that exceeded the million launch sales of the iPhone in In the months following the launch Apple saw its first ever quarterly year over year decline in iPhone sales attributed to a saturated smartphone market in Apple s biggest sales countries and consumers in developing countries not buying iPhones br As of the iPhone s has sold over million units worldwide br br br Hardware issues br br br Unexpected battery shutdowns br br In November Apple announced that a very small number of iPhone s devices manufactured between September and October have faulty batteries that unexpectedly shut down While Apple noted that the battery problems were not a safety issue it announced a battery replacement program for affected devices Customers with affected devices which span a limited serial number range were able to check their device s serial number on Apple s website and if affected receive a battery replacement free of charge at Apple Stores or authorized Apple Service Providers br In December Apple revealed new details about the issue stating that the affected devices contained a battery component that was exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been before being assembled into battery packs br br br See also br Telephones portal br Comparison of smartphones br History of iPhone br List of iPhone models br Timeline
