The Apple Watch is a brand of smartwatch products produced by Apple It incorporates fitness tracking health oriented capabilities and wireless telecommunication and integrates with watchOS and other Apple products and services The Apple Watch was released in April and quickly became the world s best selling wearable device million were sold in the second quarter of fiscal and more than million people were estimated to use an Apple Watch as of December Apple has introduced a new generation of the Apple Watch with improved internal components each September each labeled by Apple as a Series with certain exceptions br Each Series has been initially sold in multiple variants defined by the watch casing s material color and size except for the budget watches Series and SE available only in aluminum and the Ultra available only in mm titanium and beginning with Series by the option in the aluminum variants for LTE cellular connectivity which comes standard with the other materials The band included with the watch can be selected from multiple options from Apple and watch variants in aluminum co branded with Nike and in stainless steel co branded with Herm s are also offered which include exclusive bands colors and digital watch faces carrying those companies branding br The Apple Watch operates in conjunction with the user s iPhone for functions such as configuring the watch and syncing data with iPhone apps but can separately connect to a Wi Fi network for data reliant purposes including communications app use and audio streaming LTE equipped models can also perform these functions over a mobile network and can make and receive phone calls independently when the paired iPhone is not nearby or is powered off substantially reducing the need for an iPhone after initial setup The oldest iPhone model that is compatible with any given Apple Watch depends on the version of the operating system installed on each device As of September new Apple Watches come with watchOS preinstalled and require an iPhone running iOS which is compatible for the iPhone XS and later br br br Development br Apple design chief Jony Ive became interested in building a watch shortly after Steve Jobs s death in October That December The New York Times reported that Apple was exploring various ideas including a curved glass iPod that would wrap around the wrist which users would interact with through the Siri voice assistant and which could relay information back to the iPhone In February the NYT and The Wall Street Journal again confirmed that Apple was working on a smartwatch with a curved display and Bloomberg News said the team had grown to about designers br In March Apple hired ex Adobe chief technology officer Kevin Lynch reporting to Bob Mansfield to lead the watch project which would become the company s first major new product without input from late co founder Steve Jobs Apple started the project without specific use cases in mind not knowing what problems the watch would solve but felt that technology was going to move onto the body according to Alan Dye who was in charge of its user interface According to Kevin Lynch the team felt people spent too much time on their phone nagged by notifications and a watch would provide that level of engagement in a way that s a little more human a little more at the moment when you re with somebody br In July Financial Times reported that Apple had begun hiring more employees to work on the smartwatch and that it was targeting a retail release in late br The software evolved more quickly than the hardware To test it the team created its first prototype an iPhone strapped to the wrist with velcro which showed the watch software in its true size and an onscreen watch crown for input The crown was later turned into a physical dongle plugged into the headphone jack Early on the user interface and bundled apps were inspired by the iPhone but they were too complex and underwent three rounds of redesigns to avoid awkwardly long interactions that would annoy users The team worked on notification vibrations and sounds for more than a year attempting to make them reflect the nature of different notifications They also added a way to show a contextual menu by pressing the display more deeply called Force Touch In contrast with Apple s usually narrow design options the team thought a watch would need to appeal to users diverse tastes in fashion so they opted to give a choice of bands models like the gold plated Apple Watch Edition and watch faces br br br Unveiling and release br In April Apple CEO Tim Cook told The Wall Street Journal that the company was planning to launch new products that year but revealed no specifics br In June Reuters reported that production of a smartwatch product was expected to begin in July for an October release br During a September press event where the iPhone was also presented the new watch product was introduced by Tim Cook s one more thing section After a video focusing on the design process Cook reappeared on stage wearing an Apple Watch br In comparison to other Apple products and competing smartwatches marketing of the Apple Watch promoted the device as a fashion accessory Apple later focused on its health and fitness oriented features in an effort to compete with dedicated activity trackers The watchOS added fitness tracking for wheelchair users social sharing in the Activity app and a Breathe app to facilitate mindfulness br The device was not branded as iWatch which would have put it in line with its product lines such as iPod iPhone and iPad In the United States the iWatch trademark is owned by OMG Electronics who was crowdfunding a device under the same name it is owned in the European Union by Irish firm Probendi In July Probendi sued Apple Inc for trademark infringement arguing that through keyword advertising on the Google search engine it caused advertising for the Apple Watch to appear on search results pages when users searched for the trademarked term iWatch br br br Release br Pre orders for the Apple Watch began on April with the official release on April Initially it was not available at the Apple Store customers could make appointments for demonstrations and fitting but the device was not in stock for walk in purchases and had to be reserved and ordered online CNET felt that this distribution model was designed to prevent Apple Store locations from having long line ups due to the high demand The first ever retail store to display the Apple Watch to the public was Colette in Paris Later on selected models were available in limited quantities at luxury boutiques and authorized resellers br On June Apple announced that it planned to stock Apple Watch models at its retail locations br On August Best Buy announced that it would begin stocking Apple Watch at its retail stores by the end of September Both T Mobile US and Sprint also announced plans to offer Apple Watch through their retail stores br In September Apple launched a new subset of Apple Watch with a stainless steel body and leather band in collaboration with Herm s The following year Apple launched another subset of Apple Watches in collaboration with Nike dubbed Apple Watch Nike Both subsets featured cosmetic customization but otherwise functioned like standard Apple Watches br Apple Watch went on sale in India in November The device also launched in Chile the Philippines Indonesia and South Africa br br br Hardware br br br Design and materials br br Each series of Apple Watch is offered in multiple variants distinguished by the casing s material color and size with special bands and digital watch faces available for certain variants co branded with Nike and Herm s which are also sometimes accompanied by other unique extras like stainless steel charging pucks premium packaging and exclusive color basic bands br Originally at launch the Apple Watch was marketed as one of three collections designating the case material In order of increasing cost the collections were br br Apple Watch Sport aluminium case br Apple Watch stainless steel case br Apple Watch Edition originally released as an kt gold casing with newer materials in later models br Starting with Series Series Apple dropped the Sport moniker from the branding apart from the sport bands and the Apple Watch was available with either an aluminum lowest cost or stainless steel case Apple Watch Edition branding still exists but now refers to watch casings made from ceramic or titanium br Apple did not explicitly market the first generation Apple Watch as being waterproof stating that it can withstand splashes of water such as rain and hand washing but does not recommend submersion IPX Apple introduced a higher level of water resistance with the release of the Apple Watch Series and the device was explicitly advertised as being suitable for swimming and surfing The Series also includes an IP X certification for dust resistance br br br Size br Since the introduction of the Apple Watch it has been available in two sizes primarily affecting screen resolution and area The smaller size at launch was mm in referring to the approximate height of the watch case the larger size was mm in Starting with Series the two nominal sizes changed to mm in and mm in The nominal sizes changed again with the introduction of Series mm in and mm in br The overall shape and width of the watch has not changed significantly since its release so customizable bands and accessories are typically compatible with any Apple Watch of the same size class Bands that fit the smaller size class mm in mm in and mm in watches and larger size class mm in mm in and mm in watches are generally interchangeable within the class The casing of the watch includes a mechanism to allow the user to change the straps without special tools br br br Input and sensors br br For input the Watch features a digital crown on one side which can be turned to scroll or zoom content on screen and pressed to return to the home screen or display recently used apps Next to the crown on the same side of the watch is the Side Button which can be used to access Control Center and the contactless payment service Apple Pay The Watch also prominently features a touchscreen prior to Series SE the screen included Force Touch technology which enabled the display to become pressure sensitive and therefore capable of distinguishing between a tap and a press for displaying contextual menus Force Touch has since been physically removed in Watch Series and Watch SE and has been disabled via software on Watch Series and earlier on models supporting watchOS br Additional sensors integrated into the Watch include an accelerometer gyroscope and barometer which are used to determine device orientation user movement and altitude The back of all Apple Watches are equipped with a Heart Rate Monitor which projects infrared and green light from light emitting diodes LEDs onto the user s skin and photodiodes measure the varying amount of light reflected Because blood absorbs green light and reflects red light the amounts of each type of reflected light are compared to determine heart rate The Watch adjusts the sampling rate and LED brightness as needed Starting with the Series Apple added electrical sensors to the Digital Crown and back allowing the Watch to take electrocardiogram ECG readings the device won FDA clearance in October becoming the first consumer device capable of taking an ECG A blood oxygen monitor was added with the Series in albeit as a wellness device not capable of diagnosing a medical condition The blood oxygen monitor added red LEDs to the back allowing the watch to determine oxygen levels by measuring blood color The Watch SE reverted to the capabilities of the Series dropping the electrical sensors and blood oxygen monitor br br br Battery br Apple rates the device s battery for hours of mixed usage Apple Watch is charged by means of inductive charging If the watch s battery depletes to less than percent the user is alerted and offered to enable Low Power Mode which allows the user to continually use the watch while some features are disabled The watch then reverts to its original mode when the battery is sufficiently charged br br br Bands br Apple Watch comes with an included band strap to attach it to the user s wrist The proprietary band attachment mechanism allows swapping models by holding down the connectors on the bottom of the watch and sliding the band pieces out Apple produces bands in a variety of materials and colors however third party bands are still compatible when using Apple s design guidelines Bands designed for the original Series mm and mm case sizes are compatible with the Series mm and mm cases as well as the Series mm and mm cases respectively br Starting with Apple Watch Series Apple introduced the online Apple Watch Studio which allows customers to mix and match bands on purchase eliminating the need to purchase a specific combination of case and band design and allows for a simplification of packaging since Apple Watch Series in br br br Models br br Apple Watch models have been divided into five collections Apple Watch st generation present Apple Watch Sport st generation Apple Watch Nike Series present Apple Watch Herm s st generation Series Series present and Apple Watch Edition st generation only They are differentiated by combinations of cases bands and exclusive watch faces

displays with thinner bezels and rounded corners and a slightly rounder thinner chassis with a redesigned ceramic back Internally there is a new S bit dual core processor capable of up to double the S s performance upgraded GB storage and a new electrical heart sensor The microphone was moved to the opposite side between the side button and the digital crown to improve call quality Other changes include the digital crown incorporating haptic feedback with the Apple Haptic Engine and includes the new Apple designed W wireless chip br The ECG system has received clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration a first ever for a consumer device and is supported by the American Heart Association The Series can also detect falls and can automatically contact emergency services unless the user cancels the outgoing call br The watch received mostly positive reviews from critics TechRadar gave it a score of calling it one of the top smartwatches while criticizing the short battery life Digital Trends gave it a score of calling it Apple s best product and praising the design build quality and software among others while criticizing the battery life CNET gave it a score of calling it the best overall smartwatch around while criticizing the battery life and lack of watch face options T gave it a score of calling it a truly next gen smartwatch due to its thinner body

in gold silver and graphite finishes br For legal reasons blood oxygen monitoring is not available on Apple Watch Series and Ultra models sold in the United States after January br Following a ruling by the International Trade Commission on a lawsuit regarding the blood oxygen monitoring feature Apple temporarily stopped selling Apple Watch Series and Ultra on December ahead of an import ban going into effect December At the time to Mac reported Apple says that the ITC s ban only impacts sales of the Apple Watch Series and Apple Watch Ultra because those devices offer blood oxygen monitoring capabilities A US Federal Appeals Court paused the import ban pending a US Customs and Border Protection ruling on whether Apple s changes would be enough to avoid the patent dispute and Apple resumed sales on December br As of May there have been no updates made to the Series Ultra blood oxygen sensor issues br br br Carbon neutrality claims br Apple markets the Series and Ultra as its first ever carbon neutral products depending on the selected case material and band due to a combination of cutting the carbon dioxide emissions per watch manufactured and sold Apple claims a reduction of for the Series and for the Ultra and the company s purchases of forestry and nature based carbon offsets and credits which some criticized for being misleading due to reliability issues in carbon accounting for forestry carbon offsets br Most of Apple s claimed emissions reductions were driven by renewable energy requirements imposed on suppliers other factors include increased use of recycled materials and a lower reliance on shipping products by plane which is highly carbon intensive Apple says the watches manufacturing relies on clean electricity though this partly relies on Apple investing in clean energy projects to offset suppliers use of electricity produced from fossil fuels NewClimate Institute a non profit said Apple s per cent clean energy claim was highly contentious since Apple s major suppliers continue to have very low renewable electricity shares br The carbon offsets used by Apple follow standards set by Verra the Climate Community Biodiversity Alliance and the Forest Stewardship Council However some investigative reporting has indicated that of Verra s rainforest carbon offsets were allegedly worthless and that the standard may worsen global warming Niklas Kaskeala chair of the non profit Compensate Foundation said Apple s tree planting offsets had systemic flaws the Financial Times found that in one Apple conservation scheme newly planted trees were chopped down within a decade releasing absorbed carbon back into the atmosphere that most of the planted trees were eucalyptus posing monoculture concerns and that only of the land was dedicated to regrowing native tree species br On September the European Union announced that it would ban most uses of the term carbon neutral in advertising by including claims that are based on carbon offsets to address greenwashing and misleading advertising This decision was praised by Monique Goyens director general of EU consumer group BEUC who also called Apple s claims bogus and scientifically inaccurate Gilles Dufrasne policy officer at non profit Carbon Market Watch said it was misleading to consumers for Apple to give the impression that buying the Watch has no impact on the climate at all based on what he described as accounting tricks Other environmental groups criticized Apple s emphasis on carbon emissions without accounting for e waste due to the difficulty of repairing these products Berkeley Carbon Trading Project director Barbara Haya praised the products emissions reduction but also criticized Apple s use of the term carbon neutral in advertising br br br Software br watchOS is a distinct operating system designed specifically for Apple Watch While based on iOS which is used in iPhones it offers a tailored experience for the smaller screen and wrist worn form factor br Features br br Timekeeping Telling time is a core function with various watch faces to choose from br Notifications View and respond to notifications from an iPhone directly on a watch br Health and Fitness Extensive health and fitness tracking features like heart rate monitoring workout programs and activity rings to stay motivated br Apps Download and use various apps specifically designed for Apple Watch covering fitness communication news and more br Integration with iPhone Works seamlessly with an iPhone for functionalities like making calls sending texts unlocking an iPhone and using Apple Pay br Updates Apple frequently releases updates to watchOS bringing new features bug fixes and security improvements One can update a watch through the Watch app on an iPhone or directly on the Apple Watch itself if it has watchOS or later br Apple Watch runs watchOS whose interface is around a home screen with circular app icons which can be changed to a list view in the devices settings The OS can be navigated using the touchscreen or the crown on the side of the watch During its debut the first generation Apple Watch needed to be paired with an iPhone or later running iOS or later this version of iOS introduced the Apple Watch app which is used to pair the watch with an iPhone customize settings and loaded apps and highlight compatible apps from the App Store br The Apple Watch is capable of receiving notifications messages and phone calls via a paired iPhone Glances allowed users to swipe between pages containing widget like displays of information however this feature was replaced by a new Control Center watchOS also supports Handoff to send content from Apple Watch to an iOS or macOS device and act as a viewfinder for an iPhone camera Siri is also available for voice commands and is capable of responding with voice prompts on the Series watches Apple Watch also supports Apple Pay and enables its use with older iPhone models that do not contain near field communication NFC support br Apple Watch s default apps are designed to interact with their iOS counterparts such as Mail Phone Calendar Messages Maps Music Photos Reminders Remote which can control iTunes and Apple TV Stocks and Wallet Using the Activity and Workout apps a user can track their physical activity and send data back to the iPhone for use in its Health app and other HealthKit enabled software With watchOS Reminders Home Find My Friends Heart Rate and Breathe were added to the stock apps br br br Version history br br At WWDC Tim Cook announced watchOS described by CNET as a significant revamp it included a new software development kit that allows more direct access to the device s hardware new watch faces the ability to reply to an e mail and other features WatchOS was released in September Following the software update some users experienced issues with lag br watchOS was announced at WWDC with a priority on performance Users are able to keep apps running in memory as well as receive background updates and refreshed information Other updates include a new Dock invoked with the side button to replace the performance laden Glances an updated Control Center and new reply options on Messages Several new watch faces have also been added including Minnie Mouse along with the ability to switch watch faces from the lock screen simply by swiping A new feature called SOS allows users to hold the dock button to make a call to the local emergency line and pull up the user s Medical ID Another feature is Activity Sharing which allows sharing of workouts with friends and even sending their heartbeats to one another A new app called Breathe guides users through breathing exercises throughout the day with visuals and haptic feedback It was made available to the public in September br watchOS was released to the public in October and watchOS was released in March Both updates added minor improvements and bug fixes br WatchOS was announced at WWDC and released to the public in September WatchOS features a proactive Siri watch face personalized activity coaching and an entirely redesigned music app It also introduces Apple GymKit a technology platform to connect workouts with cardio equipment br WatchOS was released in March It introduced support for Nightstand mode in portrait orientation It brought back the ability for music playing on the iPhone to be controlled using the Music app on the Apple Watch and also enabled control of playback and volume on Apple s HomePod Other new features included a new charging animation and a new app loading animation Activity data was added to the Siri watch face and the battery complication more accurately reports battery life br watchOS was first shown to the public at the San Jose WWDC developer conference held by Apple It introduced an instant watch to watch walkie talkie mode all new Podcasts app raise wrist to speak Siri customizable Control Center and the ability to access the notification center and control center from apps Other features included support for WebKit to view web pages six new watch faces and new workout running features It was released to the public in September On the newest release of watchOS beta the sleep feature was shown on screen this would eliminate the need to use third party apps br watchOS was released to the public in September It introduced more native iOS apps such as voice memos calculator and a native watchOS app store watchOS also introduced new features such as the noise app that allows one to measure ambient sound in decibels menstrual tracking and new watch faces Other features include Siri being able to tell users what music they are listening to activity trends and a new UI framework for developers br watchOS was announced on June at the WWDC and released on September new functionalities include sleep tracking additional watch faces handwashing detection and new workouts such as dancing br watchOS was announced on June at the WWDC and released on September It replaces the Breathe app with a new Mindfulness app and adds a Focus mode as well as a Portrait Watch Face updates to the Messages and Home apps Contacts and Find My apps and a redesigned Photos app br watchOS was released to public on September It enhances the Workout display with new views of metrics like Activity rings Heart Rate Zones Power and Elevation It also supports better sleep tracking and additional watch faces br watchOS was announced on June at WWDC and released on September It includes a major redesign of all stock watchOS apps more detailed metrics available for cycling workouts and new Smart Stacks stacks of widgets available from the clock br br br Third party apps br In watchOS third party WatchKit applications run in the background on the iPhone as an application extension while a set of native user interface resources are installed on Apple Watch Thus watchOS apps must be bundled within their respective iOS app and are synced to the watch either manually or automatically upon installation of the phone app br With the release of watchOS Apple made it mandatory for new watch apps to be developed with the watchOS SDK from June onwards no third party languages or SDKs can be used to develop apps This allowed for developers to create native apps that are run on the watch itself thus improving the responsiveness of third party apps br In watchOS and earlier all watchOS apps are dependent apps the watchOS app relies on an iOS companion app in order to function properly In watchOS or later developers are able to create completely independent watchOS apps and no longer require an app to be installed on the paired iPhone This was assisted by the introduction of a separate App Store on the Apple Watch itself br br br Reception br br Following the announcement initial impressions from technology and watch industry observers were varied the watch was praised by some for its design potential capabilities and eventual usefulness while others offered criticism of these same aspects Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen said he can t wait to try it and Steve Jobs biographer Walter Isaacson described it as extremely cool and an example of future technology that is much more embedded into our lives Evan Dashevsky of PC Magazine said it offered nothing new in terms of functionality compared to the Moto except the customizable vibration notifications In November Apple Watch was listed by Time as one of the Best Inventions of br br Initial reviews for the device have been generally positive with some caveats Reviewers praised the watch s potential ability to integrate into everyday life and the overall design of the product but noted issues of speed and price Many reviewers described the watch as functional and convenient while also noting failure to offer as much potential functionality as preceding smartphones Farhad Manjoo of The New York Times mentioned the device s steep learning curve stating it took him three long often confusing and frustrating days to become accustomed to watchOS but loved it thereafter Some reviewers also compared it to competing products such as Android Wear devices and claimed The Smartwatch Finally Makes Sense Reviewers had mixed opinions on battery life though with Geoffrey Fowler of The Wall Street Journal saying the battery lives up to its all day billing but sometimes just barely and others compared it to the Samsung Gear which strolls through three days of moderate usage Tim Bradshaw of the Financial Times used several applications over a period of days He concluded that there is no killer application so far besides telling the time which is the basic function of a wristwatch anyhow br When using the Apple Watch some users have reported issues using the heart monitoring feature due to permanent skin conditions including tattoos The Watch uses photoplethysmography technology PPG that utilizes the green LEDs to measure heart rates To gauge a user s heart rate the watch flashes green light from the LEDs at the skin and records the amount of this light that is absorbed by the red pigment of the blood Under certain circumstances the skin may not allow for the light absorption to be read properly and thus provide inaccurate results br Some users have complained that the logo and text on the back of the Apple Watch Sport model primarily the space gray version can be easily worn off br br br Sales br br Financial analysts offered early sales estimates from a few million to as many as million in the first year Time s Tim Bajarin summarized the breadth of reactions writing that there is not enough information yet to determine how this product will fare when it finally reaches the market next year br Owing to the inadequacy of materials the Apple Watch s delivery was delayed from its initial pre order release date of April As a result only percent of the pre ordered Apple Watches were dispatched in the United States during the weekend after the release date It is estimated Apple received almost one million Apple Watch pre orders in the United States during the initial six hours of the pre order period on April after which it sold out and further orders would start delivering in June A report later on by an analyst stated that Apple Watch was already a billion business during its first year br Apple has not disclosed any sales figures for the Apple Watch An estimate by IDC states Apple shipped over million units in In late a veteran of the Swiss watch industry said Apple sold about million watches and had a market share of about percent Analysts estimate Apple sold million watches in million in and million in In analysts estimated there were million units in use br In Apple sold more watches than the entire Swiss watch industry which includes Swatch and TAG Heuer among others br br br Intellectual property disputes br br In December Joseph Wiesel a New York
