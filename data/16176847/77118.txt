title: Apple Lisa
id: 77118
Lisa is a desktop computer developed by Apple released on January It is generally considered the first mass market personal computer operable through a graphical user interface GUI In a machine like the Lisa was still so expensive that it was primarily marketed to individual and small and medium sized businesses as a groundbreaking new alternative to much bigger and more expensive mainframes or minicomputers such as from IBM that either require additional expensive consultancy from the supplier hiring specially trained personnel or at least a much steeper learning curve to maintain and operate Earlier GUI controlled personal computers were not mass marketed for example the Xerox Alto was manufactured only for Xerox and select partners through Xerox PARC from the early to mid s br Development of project LISA began in It underwent many changes and shipped at US equivalent to in with a five megabyte hard drive It was affected by its high price insufficient software unreliable Apple FileWare floppy disks and the imminent release of the cheaper and faster Macintosh Only Lisa units were sold in two years br Considered a commercial failure with technical acclaim Lisa introduced several advanced features that reappeared on the Macintosh and eventually IBM PC compatibles These include an operating system with memory protection and a document oriented workflow The hardware is more advanced overall than the following Macintosh including hard disk drive support capacity for up to megabytes MB of random access memory RAM expansion slots and a larger higher resolution display br The complexity of the Lisa operating system and its associated programs especially its office suite and the ad hoc protected memory implementation due to the lack of a Motorola memory management unit placed a high demand on the CPU and to some extent the storage system As a result of cost cutting measures designed to bring it more into the consumer market advanced software and factors such as the delayed availability of the processor and its impact on the design process many said that Lisa s user experience was sluggish overall The workstation tier price though at the low end and lack of a technical software application library made it a difficult sale for much of the technical workstation market Further impediments to the Lisa s acceptance were the runaway success of the IBM PC and Apple s decision to essentially compete with itself via the lower priced Macintosh br In after Steve Jobs was forced out of the Lisa project by Apple s board of directors he appropriated the Macintosh project from Jef Raskin who had originally conceived of a sub text based appliance computer in Jobs immediately redefined Macintosh as a less expensive and more focused version of the graphical Lisa br When Macintosh launched in January it quickly surpassed Lisa s underwhelming sales Jobs then began assimilating increasing numbers of Lisa staff as he had done with the Apple II division after assuming control over Raskin s project Newer Lisa models were eventually introduced to address its shortcomings but even after lowering the list price considerably the platform failed to achieve sales volumes comparable to the much less expensive Mac The final model the Lisa was rebranded as the Macintosh XL to become the high end model in the Macintosh series br br br History br br br Development br br br Name br Though the documentation shipped with the original Lisa only refers to it as The Lisa Apple officially stated that the name was an acronym for Locally Integrated Software Architecture Because Steve Jobs s first daughter was named Lisa Nicole Brennan born in it was sometimes inferred that the name also had a personal association and perhaps that the acronym was a backronym invented later to fit the name Andy Hertzfeld said that the acronym was reverse engineered from the name Lisa in late by the Apple marketing team after they had hired a marketing consultancy firm to come up with names to replace Lisa and Macintosh at the time considered by Jef Raskin to be merely internal project codenames and then rejected all of the suggestions Privately Hertzfeld and the other software developers used Lisa Invented Stupid Acronym a recursive backronym while computer industry pundits coined the term Let s Invent Some Acronym to fit Lisa s name Decades later Jobs told his biographer Walter Isaacson Obviously it was named for my daughter br br br Research and design br The project began in as an effort to create a more modern version of the then conventional design epitomized by the Apple II A ten person team occupied its first dedicated office at Stevens Creek Boulevard next to the Good Earth restaurant nicknamed the Good Earth building Initial team leader Ken Rothmuller was soon replaced by John Couch under whose direction the project evolved into the window and mouse driven form of its eventual release Trip Hawkins and Jef Raskin contributed to this change in design Apple s co founder Steve Jobs was involved in the concept br At Xerox s Palo Alto Research Center research had already been underway for several years to create a new humanized way to organize the computer screen today known as the desktop metaphor Steve Jobs visited Xerox PARC in and was absorbed and excited by the revolutionary mouse driven GUI of the Xerox Alto By late Jobs successfully negotiated a payment of Apple stock to Xerox in exchange for his Lisa team receiving two demonstrations of ongoing research projects at Xerox PARC When the Apple team saw the demonstration of the Alto computer they were able to see in action the basic elements of what constituted a workable GUI The Lisa team put a great deal of work into making the graphical interface a mainstream commercial product br The Lisa was a major project at Apple which reportedly spent more than million on its development More than people participated in the design plus more in the sales and marketing effort to launch the machine BYTE magazine credited Wayne Rosing with being the most important person in the development of the computer s hardware until the machine went into production at which point he became the technical lead for the entire Lisa project The hardware development team was headed by Robert Paratore The industrial design product design and mechanical packaging were headed by Bill Dresselhaus the Principal Product Designer of Lisa with his team of internal product designers and contract product designers from the firm that eventually became IDEO Bruce Daniels was in charge of applications development and Larry Tesler was in charge of system software The user interface was designed in six months after which the hardware operating system and applications were all created in parallel br In after Steve Jobs was forced out of the Lisa project he appropriated the existing Macintosh project which Jef Raskin had conceived in and led to develop a text based appliance computer Jobs redefined Macintosh as a cheaper and more usable Lisa leading the project in parallel and in secret and substantially motivated to compete with the Lisa team br In September below the announcement of the IBM PC InfoWorld reported on Lisa McIntosh and another Apple computer secretly under development to be ready for release within a year It described Lisa as having a processor and KB RAM and designed to compete with the new Xerox Star at a considerably lower price In May the magazine reported that Apple s yet to be announced Lisa network work station is also widely rumored to have a mouse Apple Confidential said Finally and perhaps most damaging even before the Lisa began shipping in June the press was full of intentionally leaked rumors about a fall release of a baby Lisa that would work in much the same way only faster and cheaper Its name Macintosh br br br Launch br Lisa was launched on January Its low sales were quickly surpassed by the January launch of the Macintosh Newer versions of the Lisa were introduced that addressed its faults and lowered its price considerably but it failed to achieve sales comparable to the much less expensive Mac The Macintosh project assimilated a lot more Lisa staff The final revision the Lisa was modified and sold as the Macintosh XL br br br Discontinuation br The high cost and the delays in its release date contributed to the Lisa s discontinuation although it was repackaged and sold at as the Lisa In the entire Lisa platform was discontinued br In Sun Remarketing purchased about Macintosh XLs and upgraded them In with the help of Sun Remarketing Apple disposed of approximately unsold Lisa units in a guarded landfill in Logan Utah to receive a tax write off on the unsold inventory Some leftover Lisa computers and spare parts were available until Cherokee Data which purchased Sun Remarketing went out of business br br br Timeline of Lisa models br br br Overview br br br Hardware br br The Lisa was first introduced on January It is one of the first personal computer systems with a graphical user interface GUI to be sold commercially It uses a Motorola CPU clocked at MHz and has MB of RAM It can be upgraded to MB and later shipped with as little as kilobytes The CPU speed and model were not changed from the release of the Lisa to the repackaging of the hardware as Macintosh XL br The real time clock uses a bit integer and the base year is defined as the software won t accept any value below so the only valid range is The real time clock depends on a AA cell NiCd pack of batteries that only lasts for a few hours when main power is not present Prone to failure over time the battery packs could leak corrosive alkaline electrolyte and ruin the circuit boards br The integrated monochrome black on white monitor has rectangular pixels on a inch cm screen br Lisa s printer support includes Apple s Dot Matrix Daisy Wheel and ImageWriter dot matrix printers and Canon s new color inkjet technology br The original Lisa later called the Lisa has two Apple FileWare inch double sided variable speed floppy disk drives more commonly known by Apple s codename Twiggy They have what was then a very high capacity of approximately kB each but are unreliable and use proprietary diskettes Competing systems with high diskette data storage have much larger floppy disks seen as cumbersome and old fashioned for a consumer system br Lisa s innovations include block sparing to reserve blocks in case of bad blocks even on floppy disks Critical operating system information has redundant storage for recovery in case of corruption br br br Lisa br br The first hardware revision the Lisa was released in January and was priced between US and It was much less expensive than the original model and dropped the Twiggy floppy drives in favor of a single K Sony microfloppy The Lisa has as little as KB of RAM The Lisa consists of a Lisa bundled with an external or megabyte hard drive In at the same time the Macintosh was officially announced Apple offered free upgrades to the Lisa to all Lisa owners by replacing the pair of Twiggy drives with a single inch drive and updating the boot ROM and I O ROM In addition the Lisa s new front faceplate accommodates the reconfigured floppy disk drive and it includes the new inlaid Apple logo and the first Snow White design language elements The Lisa has a MB internal hard drive no parallel port and a standard configuration of MB of RAM br Developing early Macintosh software required a Lisa There were relatively few third party hardware offerings for the Lisa as compared to the earlier Apple II AST offered a MB memory board which when combined with the standard Apple KB memory board expanded the Lisa to a total of MB of memory the maximum amount that the MMU can address br Late in the product life of the Lisa there were third party hard disk drives SCSI controllers and double sided inch floppy disk upgrades Unlike the original Macintosh the Lisa has expansion slots The Lisa motherboard has a very basic backplane with virtually no electronic components but plenty of edge connector sockets and slots There are two RAM slots one CPU upgrade slot and one I O slot all in parallel At the other end are three Lisa slots in parallel br br br Macintosh XL br br In January following the Macintosh the Lisa with integrated MB hard drive was rebranded as Macintosh XL It was given a hardware and software kit enabling it to reboot into Macintosh mode and positioning it as Apple s high end Macintosh The price was lowered yet again to and sales tripled but CEO John Sculley said that Apple would have lost money increasing production to meet the new demand Apple discontinued the Macintosh XL leaving an eight month void in Apple s high end product line until the Macintosh Plus was introduced in br br br Software br br br Lisa OS br br The Lisa operating system features protected memory enabled by a crude hardware circuit compared to the Sun workstation c which features a full memory management unit Motorola did not have an MMU memory management unit for the ready in time so third parties developed their own Apple s is also the result of a cost cutting compromise with sluggish performance Based in part on elements from the Apple III SOS operating system released three years earlier Lisa s disk operating system also organizes its files in hierarchical directories File system directories correspond to GUI folders as with previous Xerox PARC computers from which Lisa borrowed heavily Lisa was designed around a hard drive unlike the first Macintosh br Lisa has two main user modes the Lisa Office System and the Workshop The Lisa Office System is the GUI environment for end users The Workshop is a program development environment and is almost entirely text based though it uses a GUI text editor The Lisa Office System was eventually renamed which refers to the seven supplied application programs LisaWrite LisaCalc LisaDraw LisaGraph LisaProject LisaList and LisaTerminal br Apple s warranty said that this software works precisely as stated and Apple refunded an unspecified number of users in full for their systems These operating system frailties and costly recalls combined with the very high price point led to the failure of the Lisa in the marketplace NASA purchased Lisa machines mainly to use the LisaProject program br In the Computer History Museum announced it would be releasing the source code for Lisa OS following a check by Apple to ensure this would not impact other intellectual property For copyright reasons this release does not include the American Heritage dictionary For its th anniversary on January Lisa OS Software version s source code is available under an Apple Academic License Agreement br br br MacWorks br br In April following the release of the Macintosh Apple introduced MacWorks a software emulation environment that allows the Lisa to run Macintosh System software and applications MacWorks helped make the Lisa more attractive to potential customers although it did not enable the Macintosh emulation to access the hard disk until September Initial versions of the Mac OS could not support a hard disk on the Macintosh machines In January re branded MacWorks XL it became the primary system application designed to turn the Lisa into the Macintosh XL br br br Third party software br br A significant impediment to third party software on the Lisa was the fact that when first launched the Lisa Office System could not be used to write programs for itself A separate development OS called Lisa Workshop was required During this development process engineers would alternate between the two OSes at startup writing and compiling code on one OS and testing it on the other Later the same Lisa Workshop was used to develop software for the Macintosh After a few years a Macintosh native development system was developed For most of its lifetime the Lisa never went beyond the original seven applications that Apple had deemed enough to do everything although UniPress Software did offer UNIX System III for br Santa Cruz Operation SCO offered Microsoft XENIX version a UNIX like command line operating system for the Lisa and the Multiplan spreadsheet version that ran on it br br br Reception br br BYTE wrote in February after previewing the Lisa that it was the most important development in computers in the last five years easily outpacing the IBM PC It acknowledged that the price was high and concluded Apple is not unaware that most people would be incredibly interested in a similar but less expensive machine We ll see what happens br The Apple Lisa was a commercial failure the company s largest since the Apple III of Apple sold a total of approximately Lisa machines at US equivalent to about in each generating total sales of million against a development cost of more than million The largest Lisa customer was NASA which used LisaProject for project management br The Lisa and its Mac ROM enabled Macintosh XL version are the final two releases in the Lisa line which was discontinued in April The Macintosh XL is a hardware and software conversion kit to effectively reboot Lisa into Macintosh mode In Apple offered all Lisa and XL owners the opportunity to return their computer with an additional payment of US in exchange for a Macintosh Plus and Hard Disk Reportedly working but unsold Lisa computers were buried in a landfill br br br Legacy br The Macintosh project led by Steve Jobs borrowed heavily from Lisa s GUI paradigm and directly took many of its staff to create Apple s flagship platform of the next several decades The column based interface for instance utilized by Mac OS X had originally been developed for Lisa It had been discarded in favor of the icon view br Apple s culture of object oriented programming on Lisa contributed to the conception of Pink the first attempt to re architect the operating system of Macintosh br In reflecting on his time at Apple after his move to Sun Microsystems Wayne Rosing recalled that building the Lisa had been hard work that the machine had needed a hard disk and enough memory and had still been slow Yet he noted the level of integration between applications in the Lisa had not yet been achieved again by Apple br br
