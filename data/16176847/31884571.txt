Capps demonstrated Epic Games Infinity Blade II the sequel to Infinity Blade on an iPhone s Capps boasted that the game uses Epic Games Unreal Engine and features the same graphic techniques used in the Xbox game Gears of War br Speculation about Apple s next generation smartphone including various specifications and a predicted name iPhone had been widespread in the time preceding its debut After the iPhone s was announced it was considered by some media to be a disappointment due to the expected release of an iPhone br There were no external differences between the iPhone CDMA model and the iPhone s with the exception of a SIM card slot on the iPhone s All changes were internal slight external differences between the iPhone GSM model and the iPhone s exist as said differences existed between the CDMA and GSM models of the iPhone br On September the iPhone s name was re stylised as iPhone s using a lower case s to reflect the names of the newly announced iPhone s and iPhone c This was unusual for Apple as an upper case S had been used since the introduction of the iPhone GS in br On September the iPhone s was officially discontinued following the reveal of iPhone and iPhone Plus However s production did continue for developing markets until February br On September following the release of iOS Apple dropped support for the iPhone s making iOS the last major iOS version available for the device br br br Software br br The iPhone s like other iPhones runs iOS Apple s mobile operating system The user interface of iOS is based on the concept of direct manipulation using multi touch gestures Interface control elements consist of sliders switches and buttons The response to user input is immediate and provides a fluid interface Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe tap pinch and reverse pinch all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi touch interface br Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device one common result is the undo command or rotating it in three dimensions one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode br The iPhone s was first shipped with iOS which was released on October two days before the release of the device As of June the device can be updated to iOS br It can act as a hotspot sharing its internet connection over WiFi Bluetooth or USB and also accesses the App Store a digital application distribution platform for iOS developed and maintained by Apple The service allows users to browse and

in a playlist or by a specific artist or create a Genius playlist br The iPhone s introduced a new automated voice control system called Siri that allows the user to give the iPhone commands which it can execute and respond to For example iPhone commands such as What is the weather going to be like will generate a response such as The weather is to be cloudy and rainy and drop to degrees today These commands can vary greatly and control almost every application of the smartphone The commands given do not have to be specific and can be used with natural language Siri can be accessed by holding down the home button for a short amount of time compared to using the regular function An impact of Siri as shown by Apple video messages is that it is much easier for people to use device functions while driving exercising or when they have their hands full It also means people with trouble reading seeing or typing can access the smartphone more easily br On the iPhone s texting can be aided by the voice assistant which allows speech to text In addition to regular texting messaging on the iPhone s is supported by iMessage a specialized instant messaging program and service that allows unlimited texting to other Apple iOS products This supports the inclusion of media in text messages integration with the device s voice controlled software assistant and read receipts for sent

software as well as a spell checker that includes many regional dialects such as Swiss spoken French br At the announcement plans were in place for the iPhone s to support many languages Different features have different language requirements such as keyboards compared to the word predictor and spell checker which needs a large dictionary of words Language support is related to the iOS operating system that the device launched with although not always The Siri digital assistant supported French English and German at launch Since it uses a software based keyboard supported by the multi touch display it can support many different keyboard layouts without having to change physically The iPhone s can display different languages and scripts at the same time br On September iOS was released to the iPhone s among other compatible iOS devices as an over the air OTA upgrade package According to Apple the update contained new features and tweaks which included a new maps app dubbed

not compatible with the Apple Watch br On June Apple announced at the WWDC that the iPhone s would support iOS This makes it the first iPhone to support five major versions of iOS and the second iOS device to support five major versions after the iPad On December Apple faced a class action lawsuit alleging that they had knowingly slowed down iPhone s devices with iOS The lawsuit was settled in br On June Apple announced that the iPhone s would not support iOS due to hardware limitations br On July Apple released iOS for the iPhone s to fix issues caused by the GPS week number rollover The issues would impact the accuracy of GPS location and set the device s date and time to an incorrect value preventing connection to HTTPS servers and consequently Apple s servers for activation iCloud and the iTunes and App stores br br br Hardware br br The iPhone s uses the Apple A system on chip SoC also found in the iPad Mini st generation that incorporates an Imagination Technologies PowerVR SGX graphics processing unit GPU This GPU features pixel vertex and geometry shader hardware supporting OpenGL ES The SGX is an improved version of the GPU used in the iPhone s predecessor the iPhone The iPhone s uses a dual core model that is integrated with the Apple A SoC in the same way as the iPad Apple claims that the iPhone s has up to seven times faster graphics than the iPhone this was corroborated by Epic Games president Mike Capps br br The iPhone s has MB of DDR RAM Maximum available storage size increased to GB while the GB and GB model options were retained In September Apple released an iPhone s for free with a two year contract but with only GB of storage The screen is the same as the prior generation iPhones inches mm resolution Apple s retina design There was an improvement in interactive multimedia applications compared to its predecessor br The iPhone s has an improved cellular GSM antenna design over the iPhone The new antenna is divided up into two pieces within the stainless steel band that wraps around the sides of the smartphone Therefore if the iPhone s is gripped in such a way as to attenuate one piece of the cellular antenna the radio will switch to the other piece that isn t being gripped The iPhone s can support a maximum theoretical download speed of up to Mbps with HSDPA As a result of an upgraded radio chip inside it in addition to being a world phone both GSM and CDMA customers can roam internationally on GSM networks It also supports Bluetooth br The camera on the iPhone s also known as an iSight camera can take megapixel photographs by pixels and record p videos at up to frames per second with upgraded quality better clarity better white balance color accuracy due to an additional lens IR filter a wider f aperture and Image signal processor built in A br The built in gyroscope allows for some image stabilization for the camera while recording video although it still has room for improvement since state of the art image stabilization algorithms do not need to use a gyroscope but use image processing Other features of the camera are macro for close up pictures and faster capture including being able to take its first image in seconds and the next half a second later br br The iPhone s features a in millimetres by pixel multitouch Retina display It has two volume buttons and a ring silent switch on the left side On the top left there is a mm headphone jack and a microphone that is used for both noise cancellation during calls and when in speakerphone FaceTime video calling mode The lock power button is situated on the top right edge of the device The right side of the device has a Micro SIM card slot The bottom of the device features a speaker output on the right and a microphone input on the left with the Apple proprietary pin dock connector in the center The iPhone s supports video out via AirPlay and various Apple A V cables Supported video formats include H p frames per second maximum MPEG video and motion JPEG M JPEG br In addition to user inputs the device also has several sensors that give the smartphone information about its orientation and external conditions These include a three axis gyroscope an accelerometer a proximity sensor and an ambient light sensor The iPhone s claimed to have hours standby time hours talk time on G hours talk time on G hours G browsing and hours Wi Fi browsing Additionally it can sustain up to hours of video playback or hours of audio playback br br br Design br br The iPhone s has a stainless steel dual cellular antenna design identical to iPhone CDMA Apple redesigned the antenna in the iPhone CDMA after some original iPhone users reported cellular signal attenuation problems as a result of holding it in certain positions The improved cellular radio in the smartphone can switch between two antennas depending on which is sending receiving the best signal These two antennas are incorporated into the distinctive stainless steel band that wraps around the sides of the iPhone s The bands on the iPhone s are divided into two antennas cellular and Global Positioning System GPS with Bluetooth and Wi Fi reliant on an internal antenna br The iPhone and s were designed by Jonathan Ive The generation iPhones differ from earlier Apple designs the bulges of the back panel as well as the band between the front and back are gone and have been replaced with flattened surfaces The redesign reflects the utilitarianism and uniformity of existing Apple products such as the iPad and the iMac The overall dimensions of the iPhone s are lower than that of the GS br It is millimetres in high millimetres in wide and millimetres in deep compared to the iPhone GS which is millimetres in high millimetres in wide and millimetres in deep making the iPhone and s thinner than the GS The internal components are situated between two panels of aluminosilicate glass described by Apple as being chemically strengthened to be times stiffer and times harder than plastic theoretically allowing it to be more scratch resistant and durable than the prior models br br br Reception br br br Critical reception br Reception to the iPhone s was favorable Reviewers noted Siri the new camera and processing speeds as significant advantages over the prior model Tim Stevens of Engadget said that the iPhone s does everything better than the iPhone but it simply doesn t do anything substantially different Joshua Topolsky of The Verge stated that if this were to be a car it would be a Mercedes and that Siri is probably one of the most novel applications Apple has ever produced Most reviewers thought that Siri was the most important feature on the iPhone s Brian Chen of Wired said that the fifth generation iPhone s superb camera and speedy dual core processor are classy additions But Siri is the reason people should buy this phone br Retrevo surveyed more than U S consumers and reported that percent of all smartphone owners were not disappointed by the new iPhone s but percent or almost a half of current iPhone owners were percent were hoping for a bigger display percent wanted a refreshed design and percent desired G Echoing technology pundits Reuters suggested that the lack of a more radical departure from the iPhone could open new market opportunities for rivals Analyst C K Lu of Gartner believed that Apple no longer had the leading edge and that the s would only sell due to brand loyalty as fans had been expecting an iPhone with a thinner profile edge to edge screen and stronger features These same fans had also wanted a cheaper stripped down iPhone br Gaming on the iPhone s has been likened to the PlayStation Vita that features the same SGX GPU only in a quad core configuration and the Nintendo DS handheld game consoles Further the iPhone s ability to process million polygons per second has been compared to the PlayStation and the Xbox home video game consoles that can process million and million polygons per second respectively br Computer and Video Games s CVG deputy editor Andy Robinson told TechRadar that the s is certainly laying down some serious credibility for the iPhone as a core gaming device Not only is it now pushing out games that simply eclipse the DS visually but features like cloud saving and TV streaming support are really exciting for gamers The senior gaming analyst at Jon Peddie Research Ted Pollak believes the biggest improvement to gaming on the iPhone s is the voice control features noting that one of the features that Nintendogs players loved was the ability to talk to it There s no reason why a game like that couldn t be done on the iPhone s and much more sophisticated given the voice control shown br In the iPhone s won the T Work Gadget of the Year award beating RIM s Blackberry Bold rival Samsung s Galaxy Note amongst others br br br Issues br br Since the introduction of the iPhone s there have been several issues reported by users on internet forums that have been noted by media organizations such as CNN Boy Genius Report The Guardian and PC World br br No audio on outgoing calls br Sometimes there is no speaker audio for services such as web radio even though the speaker works fine when used as a telephone This error may be due to a malfunctioning switch sensing the headphone plug and different handling of this information by different apps br Yellow tinted screens primarily affecting white cased units it turned out the previous models had a less accurately calibrated screen and thus displayed images with a bluish tint br Battery problems Apple released iOS to diagnose and address the issue However the update has failed to completely resolve the underperforming battery issue As of February Apple was still investigating the battery drain issue br Not understanding the accent of users from various countries while speaking to Siri br Bluetooth connectivity and range sometimes poor deficient and or defective The sound quality on the other end is muffled and or undiscernible with reports indicating the iPhone is likely the problem as opposed to the Bluetooth headsets br The iPhone s had an issue where the Wi Fi toggles would appear greyed out in both Settings and the Control Center which was mainly caused by thermal shock of the Wi Fi antenna br br br Commercial reception br Unlike prior iPhone models the number of sales of the iPhone had not yet climaxed before the introduction of the s Previous iPhone models were released during or after declining sales figures In addition iPhone users had high marks for being satisfied with their smartphones Upon the announcement of the iPhone s shares of Samsung Electronics HTC and Nokia gained on Wednesday after the s was announced while Apple stock fell However later in the day Apple shares rebounded ending with a gain br With the launch of orders AT T said that the demand for the iPhone s was extraordinary More than orders were placed within hours of release through AT T The German telephone company Deutsche Telekom said they were satisfied with consumer interest In addition AT T Verizon and Sprint sold out initial stock by October and by October there was a week estimate on new orders to be filled On October AT T surpassed one million iPhone s activations On October Apple announced that more than one million orders for the iPhone s had been received within the first hours of it being on sale beating the device record set by the iPhone The month wait between the iPhone and s may have contributed to overwhelming sales as well br On October Apple had announced that four million units of the iPhone s were sold in the first three days of release and million iOS users had upgraded to the then latest version of iOS iOS which was released upon the introduction of the iPhone s Phil Schiller Apple s senior vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing stated that the iPhone s is off to a great start with more than four million sold in its first weekend the most ever for a phone and more than double the iPhone launch during its first three days The used smartphone market saw unprecedented rates of trade ins in the weeks leading up to the s announcement and after it there was a drop in prices offered Previous generation iPhones are recirculated through the markets via various methods and third party buyers may purchase older generation iPhones Apple also buys back previous generation iPhones under a special program On April AT T announced that million iPhone units were activated in Q and million in Q In total AT T sold million
