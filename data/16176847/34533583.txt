title: Mer (software distribution)
id: 34533583
Mer was a free and open source software distribution targeted at hardware vendors to serve as a middleware for Linux kernel based mobile oriented operating systems It is a fork of MeeGo br br br Goals br Some goals of the project are br br Openly developed with transparency built into the fabric of the project br Provide a mobile device oriented architecture br Primary customers are mobile device vendors not end users br Have structure processes and tools to make life easy for device manufacturers br Support innovation in the mobile OS space br Inclusive of projects and technologies e g MeeGo Tizen Qt Enlightenment Foundation Libraries EFL HTML br Governed as a meritocracy br Run as a non profit through donations br br br Software architecture br br Mer is not an operating system it is aimed to be one component of an operating system based on the Linux kernel Mer is a part of the operating system above the Linux kernel and below the graphical user interface GUI br Mer just provides the equivalent of the MeeGo core The former MeeGo user interfaces and hardware adaptation are to be done by various other projects and by hardware manufacturers which will be able to build their products on top of the Mer core br br br Components br There is support for systemd Wayland Hybris and other current FOSS software br Zephyr is an attempt at creating a stack for use by other projects to be exploring lightweight high performance next generation UIs based on Mer Qt QML Compositor and Wayland br Weston which was released on October supports libhybris making it possible to use Android device drivers with Wayland br br br Supported hardware br Mer can be compiled for a number of instruction sets such as x ARM or MIPS br There are Mer based builds available for various devices including Raspberry Pi Beagleboard Nokia N Nokia N Nokia N and for various Intel Atom based tablets These also include hardware adaptation packages and various UXes running on top of Mer provided by different projects They can be flashed on the device and might work in dual boot mode with the original firmware br Mer uses Open Build Service OBS in mer but with one repository per architecture br br br Products based on Mer br br br KDE Plasma Active br Mer was used as a reference platform for KDE s Plasma Active br br br Vivaldi Tablet and Improv computer br In January a Plasma Active tablet device initially known as Spark tablet and soon renamed Vivaldi Tablet was announced Based on the Allwinner A SoC it would have a multitouch display run the Plasma Active user interface on top of Mer and have a target price of about The project encountered some problems when its hardware partner in China completely changed the internal components and was reluctant to release the kernel source for the new hardware As of early July the Vivaldi had been set back but a solution was in the pipes according to Plasma developer Aaron Seigo As a kind of side project Improv computer was targeted for developers and was to be released in January Mer preinstalled In mid both projects were discontinued br br br Nemo Mobile br Parallel to Sailfish OS by Jolla Nemo Mobile is a community driven operating system based on a Linux kernel Mer a GUI and diverse applications br Since Nemo Mobile is no longer using Mer Project as a base but switched to Manjaro Linux The main reason for the move was obsolete components like Qt version due to licensing restrictions br br br Jolla and Sailfish OS br In July Jolla a Finnish company founded by former Nokia employees involved in MeeGo development announced their work on a new operating system called Sailfish OS which is based on MeeGo and Mer s core with added proprietary GUI and hardware implementation layers It was presented in late November Jolla released its first br smartphone using Sailfish in simply called Jolla In October Jolla announced for May the Jolla Tablet with Sailfish OS which is to be bit on quadcore Intel CPU Also is ready for licensing hence it is used with products like Aqua Fish by Intex and PuzzlePhone br br br Yuanxin OS br In November Yuanxin Technology in China announced it is working on Yuanxin OS The company s president Shi Wenyong called the OS China s own smartphone OS to be on par with Android and Apple iOS Mr Shi explained to a reporter that Yuanxi OS is based on the Mer distribution br br br History br br Mer s initial aim to provide a completely free alternative to the Maemo operating system which was able to run on Nokia Internet Tablets such as the N and N collectively known as the N x devices br It was based on Ubuntu and with the release of Maemo Fremantle a new goal emerged To bring as much of Fremantle as we can get on the N x br br br Shift to MeeGo br Mer suspended development at release since focus had switched to building MeeGo for the N and N devices By then MeeGo was available and supported by a much wider community br br br Collapse of MeeGo br The development was silently resumed during the summer of by a handful of MeeGo developers some of them previously active in the Mer project after Nokia changed its strategy in February These developers were not satisfied with the way MeeGo had been governed behind closed doors especially after Nokia departed and they were also concerned that MeeGo heavily depended on big companies which could stop supporting it as was the case when Nokia abandoned MeeGo as part of its new strategy br This was again proven to be a problem after Intel Samsung and the Linux Foundation announced they were going to create a new operating system called Tizen This new OS began focusing on HTML and using the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries EFL instead of Qt for native applications However on May it was announced that Tizen Common would be bringing Qt back by starting to ship with it integrated br br br Revival with MeeGo Reconstructed br After the Tizen project was announced the revival of the Mer project was announced on the MeeGo mailing list with the promise that it would be developed and governed completely in the open as a meritocracy unlike MeeGo and Tizen It would also be based on the MeeGo code base and tools aiming to provide just the equivalent of the MeeGo core with no default UI The APIs for third party application development are included meaning that Qt EFL and HTML would be supported on the platform and maybe even others if widely requested br The project quickly started to gain traction among many open source developers who had been involved in MeeGo and it started being used by former MeeGo projects such as the reference handset UX now rebased on top of Mer and called Nemo Mobile and a couple of projects targeting tablet UXes such as Cordia a reimplementation of the Maemo Hildon UX and Plasma Active emerged on top of Mer Equivalent Mer based project of the former MeeGo IVI and Smart TV UXes are not yet known to exist br The aim of the Mer community is to create in a solid way what had been unable to be done with MeeGo Mer is to become what MeeGo was expected to be but has not become Mer aims to become the MeeGo when the Linux Foundation finds that it complies with all of the MeeGo requirements br br br Merger with Sailfish br In early it was announced that they would unify Mer and Sailfish operations under one brand called Sailfish OS discontinuing use of the name Mer br
