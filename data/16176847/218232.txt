generating more revenue than the buy to own model used by the iTunes Store Apple now operates its own subscription based streaming music service Apple Music alongside the iTunes Store br br br History

than minutes Free content can vary from a preview of a show to bonus content to pilot episodes and entire seasons of TV shows examples of free seasons include HBO s The Weight of the Nation and ABC s Pan Am Some networks such as ABC and NBC have their own pages of Free Season Premieres br While previously the US iTunes Store has offered as many as three free songs each week the single of the week Discovery Download and Canci n de la Semana in recent years the store has instead replaced the three aforementioned categories with a unified Single of the Week banner with the week s single being from a new up and coming artist In Apple discontinued the Single of the Week program br br br Current model br br br Music br A song usually costs however for songs with high popularity the price is

Podcasts apps lets users download subscribe to and sync podcasts br The iTunes U app gives access to iTunes U educational material br Originally mobile users had to be connected to a Wi Fi network in order to enter the store hence its original name iTunes Wi Fi Music Store However at Macworld Apple issued a software update which automatically allowed G and EDGE users to access the store s full functionality for files smaller than megabytes MB The iOS update added the ability to download movies TV shows audiobooks iTunes U and ringtones on mobile devices in addition to the previously available songs and podcasts On February Apple increased the MB G download limit to MB In March Apple increased the G download limit to MB and in late Apple increased the limit to MB when they released the final version of iOS for their new iPhones br br br Customer support br In the United States Apple provides technical support for the iTunes Store via email there is no phone number for issues with iTunes purchases Most customer service inquiries are handled online via the Report a Problem link in iTunes br br br Charitable donations br In response to major natural disasters Apple provides the facility for donations to be made through the iTunes Store Unlike other iTunes purchases donations made to charitable organizations through this system are not subject to the handling fee Apple usually charges iTunes donation pages were set up following the Haiti earthquake the Japanese earthquake and ensuing tsunami and s Hurricane Sandy In all of these cases donations were redirected to the Red Cross br br br Music br The store began operations after Apple signed deals with five major record companies EMI Universal Music Group Warner Music Group Sony Music Entertainment and Bertelsmann Music Group Songs from more than independent labels were added later the first being from The Orchard on June br As of April iTunes offers million songs including exclusive tracks from numerous artists Not all artists are available on iTunes but many holdouts such as Led Zeppelin and Radiohead have allowed their music to be sold on the iTunes Store in recent years New songs are added to iTunes catalog on a daily basis and the iTunes Store is updated each Tuesday br Downloaded songs come with song information name artist album already filled out though iTunes provides a free service by Gracenote to do this for songs not purchased from the store although they must be imported with iTunes Songs that have an entry in the iTunes Store also come with album artwork Artwork is embedded in the metadata Artwork can be obtained for songs not purchased from the store for free if the user has an iTunes Store account Purchased songs do not come with lyrics nor does iTunes provide a service for acquiring the missing lyrics However several third party applications exist to locate and automatically add lyrics to the user s music br Some albums purchased on iTunes came with booklets The first instance of this was the release of the album How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb by rock band U br br br Album Only songs br Some songs are available from the store by Album Only meaning the song can only be acquired through the purchase of the entire album whereas most songs can be downloaded separately from the album they belong to br Songs above minutes in length are by default Album Only songs However this is not universally true for example Living in the Heart of the Beast by Henry Cow is minutes and seconds yet is available for individual purchase as of December Soundtracks also often have many Album Only tracks br Sometimes the minute restriction works in an artist s favor Examples of this include Prince s Lovesexy and the deluxe version of Phoenix s Bankrupt which both have an album as a single track instead of being separate in Prince s case the track was the album while in Phoenix s case it was a collection of demos and outtakes forcing the buyer to buy the album itself br Movie soundtracks normally include songs owned by many different labels making licensing more complex For example Forrest Gump The Soundtrack includes songs from Peacock Records Argo Records and Capitol Records among many others Greatest Hits by Red Hot Chili Peppers has only one song Higher Ground that is not available for download on a per song basis whilst Circus Britney Spears album has two songs that are available for album download only Rock Me In and Phonography br br br Partial Albums br Some albums on the iTunes store are available only as a Partial Album meaning that one or more of the songs on an album s CD release are not available on its iTunes equivalent often due to differing copyright holders between songs br br br Work Only songs br Some tracks are listed as Work Only which means they can only be obtained by purchasing the entire piece of work within the album the tracks cannot be bought as singles Works are generally pieces of classical music symphonies string quartets etc in multiple movements br br br LP format br In September Apple introduced the iTunes LP format known pre launch by the code name Cocktail which features visual interactive content alongside album tracks and lyrics br br br Store sections br br When entering the US music store there are multiple sections one can visit Music is divided into genres Alternative Classical Jazz Soundtrack etc and there are a number of links to other sections of the store under the Quick Links header These include Recommended for You Complete My Album iTunes LP as well as thematic sections such as iTunes Festival sections br In November Apple created a category for Latino and Hispanic content iTunes Latino Telemundo and Mun made some of their popular programs available for purchase becoming the first Hispanic television content in the store It offers music music videos audiobooks podcasts and television shows in Spanish in a single concentrated area The brief descriptions given to the content are in Spanish as well as several subcategories Gibraltarian flamenco metal band Breed released an exclusive album called Un Encuentro to coincide with the launch of iTunes Latino It features songs all from previous albums but all sung in Spanish br In Apple created Mastered for iTunes When iTunes launched the decision was made to standardize on AAC instead of the more popular MP format on the supposition that it offers better quality compared to other codecs at similar bit rates Mastered for iTunes MFiT is a procedure developed by Apple specifically for mastering engineers to follow This set of tools allows engineers to audition Apple s proprietary encoding during the mastering process to take into account how music will eventually interact with Apple s encoding In addition to auditioning the encoder there is also a tool called afclip that processes the audio file and creates a text file for audio clips Because of this special encoding process extra attention must be paid to headroom and inter sample peaking while mastering In August it was announced that the Mastered for iTunes program would be rebranded as Apple Digital Masters With the rebranding the high resolution masters are now available with Apple Music through streaming It is speculated that the rebranding came because the functionality of iTunes would be changing in macOS Catalina and therefore the Mastered for iTunes name no longer made sense br br br Censorship br br There is a policy of censoring profanity in titles on iTunes This has resulted in a Scunthorpe glitch by which inoffensive titles are censored due to a coincidental string of letters If the song has an explicit label it will be marked explicit next to the song title If a song is marked explicit it is unavailable for purchase if restrict explicit content is checked under the parental controls preference Often there will be a clean mark next to the title of some songs meaning the lyrics have been censored and is available to purchase on all accounts Generally if a song is marked clean there is an explicit version available as well br br br Reception and commercial success br br In the first hours the iTunes store sold about tracks and more than million tracks were sold in its first days When released for Windows in October iTunes was downloaded more than million times in the first days selling more than million songs in that period On December Apple announced that it had sold million songs br In January at the Macworld Conference Expo in San Francisco Steve Jobs announced Sellers that an unnamed person had purchased US worth of music On March Apple announced that iTunes Music Store customers had purchased and downloaded million songs from iTunes Music Store A song sold on iTunes gives the artist cents in profit They also reported that customers were purchasing million songs a week which translates to a projected annual run rate of million songs a year The millionth song was The Path of Thorns by Sarah McLachlan br On April iTunes Music Store marked its first anniversary with million songs sold clear dominance in the paid online music market and a slight profit The store also offers hundreds of movie trailers and music videos in an attempt to boost soundtrack sales In the conference Steve Jobs reiterated that a subscription service is still not in the interest of customers and reported that only million of the million songs offered in the Pepsi giveaway campaign were redeemed which he blamed on technical problems in Pepsi distribution According to an Apple press release dated August iTunes Music Store was the first store to have a catalog of more than one million songs Also iTunes Music Store at that point maintained a percent market share of legal music downloads br The emerging monopoly of the store was criticized in by Mike Lang of Miramax for effectively strangling the industry He says that because the music industry has allowed too few content providers it is now suffering Lang views the issue as being more of a threat than music piracy br br br Sales milestones br br br Music br million songs sold July br Kevin

Internationalization br Originally only Mac OS X users who had a US billing address could buy songs with the service but Steve Jobs announced plans to support both Windows and non American users The Windows version of iTunes and support for the Windows platform from iTunes Music Store were announced on October with immediate availability Beginning in the service has become available in a number of countries other than the United States br br To buy files through the store a user must install the proprietary digital media player iTunes to access the store This software is available only for certain versions of the Macintosh or Windows operating systems br br According to an Apple press release the European iTunes Music Stores sold a combined total of songs in one week with of those songs sold in the UK br The Italian Portuguese Dutch Greek stores have been localized br On December the British Office of Fair Trading referred iTunes Music Store to the European Commission because it prevents consumers in one EU country from buying music from stores in other EU countries in violation of EU free trade legislation the immediate cause of the referral was because the price charged in the Eurozone equates to in sterling rather than the actually charged there br iTunes Music Store in Japan had million songs available at start In the next four days the store had sold one million songs the pace faster than that of the US store In addition to a long delay Apple failed to have one set price for singles Pundits speculated that this may have indicated the introduction of new price structure to the rest of the stores in future in favor of record labels who would like to see higher prices for new songs This extension to other countries was announced in January br The release of video capable iPods also saw the store launch in Australia with music videos and short films by Pixar iTunes Gift Cards as they are now known are now also available in many more stores such as JB Hi Fi David Jones and the Woolworths chain of stores Access was inadvertently given to some people in New Zealand too Failed negotiations with the Sony BMG label meant that none of that label s artists

Vietnam Apple also offers other payment methods like PayPal which differ from country to country Residents in other countries can only buy a gift card from a merchant or download free podcasts and previews br br br Digital rights management br br In the past the iTunes Store used Apple s FairPlay digital rights management DRM technology FairPlay was built into the MP multimedia file format as an encrypted AAC audio layer and was used by the company to protect copyrighted works sold through the store allowing only authorized devices to play the content The restrictions imposed by FairPlay mainly limited device compatibility sparked criticism with a lawsuit alleging antitrust violation that was eventually closed in Apple s favor and various successful efforts to remove the DRM protection from files with Apple continually updating its software to counteract such projects br In February an open letter by Steve Jobs Apple s then CEO discussed the use of DRM on music raising points about the future of the protection and announced the company s support for ending the use of DRM Although the open letter initially caused mixed industry reactions Apple signed a deal with EMI a record label the following month in order to offer iTunes customers a purchase option called iTunes Plus for a higher quality DRM free version of all of EMI s tracks In January Apple signed deals with all major record labels as well as a large number of independent labels in order to begin to offer most iTunes music DRM free On January Apple announced that DRM had been removed from of its music catalog in the US Full DRM free iTunes Plus music availability was achieved in the US on April coinciding with the introduction of a three tiered pricing model This does not apply to songs

Sunday February Apple launched a promotion with Pepsi in which they gave away million songs through tokens on selected soft drink bottle caps Unfortunately for Apple Pepsi failed to properly

been sold through iTunes Music Store The millionth song was titled Somersault Dangermouse Remix by Zero purchased by Kevin Britten of Hays Kansas He then received a phone call from Apple CEO Steve Jobs who offered his congratulations as well as a GB rd Generation iPod laser engraved with a message of thanks br Inspired by Pepsi s marketing success with iTunes giveaways Coca Cola partnered with Eleven to give away a free iTunes song with every US fl oz ml Slurpee frozen beverage until July Songs could be redeemed until August by entering a code printed on the Slurpee cup into iTunes Music

Sound as part of Coldplay s X Y album br On July Facebook and iTunes began offering a promotion where members of the Apple Students group would receive a free song sampler each week until September in various music genres The idea behind the promotion was to get students more familiar and enthusiastic with each service as Autumn classes approached However in order to prevent abuse of the promotion the weekly code that Facebook provided stopped working after it was redeemed one million times In addition the promotion caused discontent among international students as the code was only valid in the US iTunes Music Store br On April Apple announced that it will be counting down to the billionth app apps being the applications for iPod Touch and iPhone Apple launched a continuous counter to the billionth app on Good Friday Connor Mulcahey age of Weston CT downloaded the billionth app Bump by Bump Technologies and received a MacBook Pro a GB iPod Touch a Time Capsule and a Gift Card for

Apple Computer but Apple Records said it would appeal the ruling Despite this plans were announced by Neil Aspinall in April to remaster completely and release the entire Beatles catalog on an unspecified online music service as well as release some previously unheard work by the band No date was set at that time It has also been reported that the Beatles music catalog might initially be appearing on iTunes only as Apple is reported to be negotiating with Britain s EMI group over an online distribution deal that might be exclusive for a limited time br During his Macworld Keynote address on January Apple CEO Steve Jobs used the band s song With a Little Help from My Friends followed by Lovely Rita to introduce the music playing capabilities of the company s new iPhone This was regarded by industry observers as further evidence that the Beatles catalog would be introduced to iTunes Music Store catalog in the near future On February Apple Corps and Apple Inc announced they had reached a settlement in their legal dispute br In a related development Apple announced on August that the entire solo catalog of John Lennon would be available on iTunes The solo catalogs of the other three Beatles Paul McCartney Ringo Starr and George Harrison are also available on iTunes br On November the entire Beatles catalog was officially made available on the iTunes Store br br br The Consumer Council of Norway EULA challenge br On June The Consumer Ombudsmen in Norway Sweden and Denmark launched a common open letter to Apple regarding the EULA of iTunes through the Norwegian Consumer Ombudsman Bj rn Erik Thon The iTunes case is based upon an official complaint filed by The Consumer Council of Norway on January br The main allegations were that br br The EULA is unbalanced to disfavor the customer Scandinavian law requires any written agreement to favor both parties The weak party also enjoys protection from exploitation according to Norwegian consumer laws br The iTunes Store s use of Digital rights management limits the number of devices purchased songs can be played on br iTunes contract entitles the company to at any time change the terms of the contract without notice including the selection of players or software that must be used for iTunes files and also the number of times a customer can change or copy already purchased files br The EULA is both vague and hard to understand for the customers br The EULA states that the legal relationship between the company and customers is regulated by English contract law It is unreasonable to expect Norwegian consumers to have comprehensive knowledge of English law Products marketed to Norwegian consumers in Norway are subject to Norwegian law a right that cannot be waived by a clause in a company s standard customer contract br The EULA removes iTunes responsibility regarding damage to the consumer s computer caused by software errors even though responsibility cannot be waived in Scandinavian Law br Apple responded July br On January German and French consumer groups joined forces with Norway and Finland Their goal is to create a united European front against iTunes Germany and France have each had their own negotiation process with iTunes According to the press statement Apple is in favor of this The key points in the negotiations were br br Interoperability the consumer should have the right and ability to play his or her music on any device of his or her own choice br Change of conditions iTunes must revoke their right to change the terms and conditions EULA at any time without the consent of the consumer br Liability iTunes should change its clause limiting its liability to recover consumer damages if they are caused by content sold by iTunes br Applicable Law Consumers entering into a contract with iTunes should be able to rely on the consumer protection rules according to the law of the country in which they live br br br EU antitrust case br In Which magazine complained to the European Commission about the higher prices in the UK for the same songs sold in other parts of the European Union typically in the rest of the EU and in the UK In the Commission withdrew its investigation after Apple agreed to end the price disparity br br br Content disputes br br br Universal Music Group br br On July the New York Times reported that Universal the world s largest music corporation at the time of writing would not renew its annual contract to sell music through iTunes Instead Universal said that it would market music to Apple at will allowing it to remove its songs from the iTunes service on short notice if the two sides did not agree on pricing or other terms br On August UMG announced a plan to sell some songs in MP format without Digital rights management through a variety of online services such as Amazon Music and the newly created gBox While these tracks continue to be available through the iTunes Store Universal chose to license these songs in DRM free formats only through other services br br br NBC Universal TV series br On August Apple announced that programs on NBC s television schedule would not be available on iTunes NBC had informed Apple the previous day that it would not be renewing its contract It was later clarified that this change only applied to series produced by NBC Universal owned Universal Media Studios including Universal produced shows on other networks such as House NBC programs produced by other studios such as Chuck Warner Bros and Journeyman th Century Fox would remain available on iTunes br Apple has publicly asserted that NBC would only renew their contract if Apple agreed to a price increase of US per episode which they did not NBC disputes that claim claiming that Apple balked at NBC s request to package shows together and make wholesale pricing more flexible NBC claims that they never asked to double the wholesale price and insisted that their shows would be sold by the iTunes Store through early December Other networks who sold their shows via iTunes did not follow suit On December NBC shows were pulled from the iTunes Store br On September Apple and NBC Universal announced that NBC s TV shows were once again available on the US iTunes Store br The UK iTunes Store has many shows from NBC available although they are distributed by Universal Studios
