Apple Pay is a mobile payment service by Apple Inc that allows users to make payments in person in iOS apps and on the web Supported on iPhone Apple Watch iPad Mac and Vision Pro Apple Pay digitizes and can replace a credit or debit card chip and PIN transaction at a contactless capable point of sale terminal It does not require Apple Pay specific contactless payment terminals it can work with any merchant that accepts contactless payments It adds two factor authentication via Touch ID Face ID Optic ID PIN or passcode Devices wirelessly communicate with point of sale systems using near field communication NFC with an embedded secure element eSE to securely store payment data and perform cryptographic functions and Apple s Touch ID and Face ID for biometric authentication br Apple Pay can also be used to ride some public transport networks either through the use of credit debit cards open loop for example across TfL in London SL in Stockholm and at OMNY readers across New York City s subway and bus network or dedicated travel cards such as JR East s Suica the Chicago Transit Authority s Ventra the San Francisco Bay Area s Clipper closed loop and Hong Kong s Octopus Card br br br Service br br br Device compatibility br The service is compatible with iPhone and newer iPad Air and newer Macs with Touch ID and Apple Watch Series and later In iOS or later the number of cards able to be added to the service is determined by the capacity of the secure element which varies by device br br br Technology br br Apple Pay uses the EMV Payment Tokenization Specification br The service keeps customer payment information private from the retailer by replacing the customer s credit or debit card Funding Primary Account Number FPAN with a tokenized Device Primary Account Number DPAN and creates a dynamic security code generated for each transaction The dynamic security code is the cryptogram in an EMV mode transaction and the Dynamic Card Verification Value dCVV in a magnetic stripe data emulation mode transaction Apple added that they would not track usage which would stay between the customers the vendors and the banks Users can also remotely halt the service on a lost phone via the Find My iPhone service br To pay at points of sale users hold their authenticated Apple device to the point of sale system s NFC card reader iPhone users authenticate by using Touch ID Face ID or passcode whereas Apple Watch users authenticate by double clicking a button on an unlocked device To pay in supported iOS apps users choose Apple Pay as their payment method and authenticate with Touch ID or Face ID Users can add payment cards to the service in any of four ways through the payment card listed on their iTunes accounts by taking a photo of the card being provisioned from within the card issuer s app or by entering the card information manually br Although users receive immediate notification of the transaction the Apple Pay system is not an instant payment instrument because the fund transfer between counter parties is not immediate The settlement time depends on the payment method chosen by the customer An exception being payments made using a card which stores the user s balance on the card itself such as a Japanese Suica card or a Hong Kong Octopus card These cards can transfer funds directly to the merchant without the need for an online connection br In the United Kingdom traditional contactless payments using bank cards are limited to previously until October as no cardholder authentication is provided as part of the transaction Payments using Apple Pay however support payments of any amount owing to the increased security and lower risk of fraud in Apple Pay transactions although some issuing banks may impose their own transaction limits and not all contactless readers support this functionality see CDCVM below Similar transaction limits apply in other countries br Apple assumes some liability for fraudulent use of the service Banks are expected to carry the burden of the service and Apple is said to have negotiated smaller transaction fees In turn the banks hoped to capture purchases that were formerly handled without credit Financial Times reported that Apple receives cut of US purchases made with the service but following the UK launch reported that Apple s cut is much lower in the UK This is largely because Regulation EU capped interchange fees in the European Economic Area at for personal credit cards and for personal debit cards with effect from June In Russia Apple receives for debit cards and for credit cards of each purchase and in addition the bank pays rubles a year for each card added in the service br Apple is ending its in house buy now pay later service in the US shifting to third party lenders for instalment plans Existing users can still manage payments via the Wallet app Apple will partner with banks such as Citi HSBC and ANZ to offer these options in the upcoming iOS br br br Consumer Device Cardholder Verification Method CDCVM br In EMV mode transactions Apple Pay supports the use of the Consumer Device Cardholder Verification Method CDCVM using Touch ID Face ID or the phone s or watch s passcode The use of CDCVM allows for the device itself to provide verification for the transaction and may not require the cardholder to sign a receipt or enter their PIN Additionally in certain markets which have a no verification contactless limit using contactless cards such as the limit in the United Kingdom and the C limit in Canada and the SAR limit in Saudi Arabia the use of CDCVM can enable merchants to accept transactions higher than these amounts using Apple Pay providing their terminal software is updated to support the latest network contactless specifications br br br Global acceptance br About two thirds of merchants accept contactless payments Due to provisioning differences between countries and even between issuers users may encounter acceptance issues when travelling to a different country Some known examples include br br Canada UK Saudi Arabia and possibly other non US issued Visa cards only support EMV mode transactions and not legacy magnetic stripe data emulation transactions Some contactless terminals in the US do not support EMV mode contactless transactions even if they support EMV contact transactions and therefore these visitors to the US will receive a Could Not Complete Payment error on the iPhone screen and an error on the terminal when attempting to use Apple Pay br br br Apple Cash br Apple Cash formerly Apple Pay Cash is a feature that allows the transfer of money from one user to another via iMessage When a user receives a payment the funds are deposited in the recipient s Apple Cash card where it is available for immediate use at merchants that accept Apple Pay Prior to April the Apple Cash Card was provisioned as a Discover Contactless Debit card Apple Cash Device Account Numbers currently are issued reissued on the Visa payment network ensuring a larger acceptance for the Apple Cash card at more merchants br Alternatively the user can choose to transfer the balance to a nominated bank account via ACH transfer Apple Cash is only available in the United States br br br Cost br Apple Pay does not cause additional fees for users and merchants In Switzerland for example participating card issuers pay for the service In Swiss banks paid a fixed commission CHF US quarterly on every card to Apple Additionally they paid for credit card transactions and for web or app based transactions Swiss antitrust authorities require that an acquirer pays maximum of the transaction amount to the issuer The competition commission calls this amount interchange fee Apple charges between and of the credit card issuers income earned from the acquirer br br br History br The service was in preparation for a long time as Apple acquired startups hired executives and filed patents related to payments Apple partnered with American Express Mastercard and Visa Their joint project began in January though they had discussed Apple s potential involvement for years Their joint solution was a system where single use digital tokens would replace the transfer of personal information A Visa executive said that people at the company worked on the anonymized token system for a year and the other partners had similar teams in collaboration Mastercard began work on the project in and hoped that their joint work would become a standard for mobile payments The announcement of the service came at a time when Mastercard and Visa policy created strong incentives for upgrading to mobile payment compatible point of sale systems Apple then approached several big banks in mid and did not divulge the names of the other banks To maintain secrecy JPMorgan set up a windowless war room where the majority of the sensitive work was done Of their people on the project about knew that the partner was Apple Others close to the project did not know it was named Apple Pay until the announcement The company s participation remained a secret leading up to its announcement br The service was announced at Apple s iPhone event on September At its announcement Apple CEO Tim Cook described the magnetic stripe card payment process as broken for its reliance on plastic cards outdated and

QUICPay and iD enabled terminals that are already popular in Japan br On March Apple Card was announced in partnership with Goldman Sachs and Mastercard br In June it was announced that the European Commission EC will take two probes against Apple one focused on Apple Pay According to EC Apple was abusing its control of its payment wallet by blocking third party payment access to the NFC hardware that enabled contactless payments Apple opposed the claim and cited the COVID pandemic as a cause of the increased number of people using contactless paying br In June it was announced that online

retailers to build mobile payments services including those of PayPal Walmart Target Google Wallet and Softcard They noted that previous efforts did not solve customer inconvenience issues and felt that Apple Pay potentially did The Verge s Adrianne Jeffries noted that mobile payment market fragmentation was partially due to Apple s refusal to enter the market BusinessWeek s Joshua Brustein added that Apple has a history of letting first movers fail with an early version of the service before releasing a more polished version of the same idea The Verge s Dieter Bohn called Apple Pay the week s most revolutionary product and the announcement a classic Apple moment of simplification and integration and the partnership between payments services and Apple a rare piece of collaboration and agreement He predicted that the service s effect on the mobile payments industry would be similar to the iPhone s effect on the smartphone industry Nathaniel Popper of The New York Times referred to the banks level of coordination with Apple as elaborate and indicative of mutual preparation and investment Some analysts added that the service could reduce the standard credit card transaction fees over time since fees traditionally cover credit card fraud The banks were willing to work with Apple in the face of efforts like Bitcoin and the Merchant Customer Exchange which seeks to work around the card networks br Early reviews of the service regarded it as easy to use but were not sure whether the service would become widely adopted The Verge s Nilay Patel wrote that the product demo was remarkably smooth and a cohesive user experience Patel said the process took five to ten seconds at a retail card reader and added that it may be less smooth at stores such as Walgreens where cashiers prompt customers for loyalty cards and charity donations The New York Times Neil Irwin wrote that Apple exaggerated the inconvenience of credit cards Among the plastic card s benefits he included how others could make purchases on another s behalf and how dead cell phones could leave the owner stranded br In a publication released by Consumer Reports Apple Pay Cash was the leading

Rite Aid started to accept it August Both CVS and Best Buy started to accept Apple Pay at all stores starting in October CurrentC ended in March br Target s CEO Brian Cornell said that they would be
