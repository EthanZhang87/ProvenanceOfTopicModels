mistakes included the Ukrainian capital Kyiv which was incorrectly spelled as Kylv the Welsh town Pontypridd whose label was shown miles kilometres northeast of its actual location and the English town Stratford upon Avon which was missing altogether in Apple Maps Also when users looked up London they were directed to the Canadian city London Ontario instead of its namesake the capital of the United Kingdom Many complained about outdated or inaccurate data about companies and places of interest For example in the United Kingdom chains that no longer exist were still on the maps and large stores were accidentally mapped in backyards Furthermore in the United States the label of the Willis Tower was displayed in the wrong location Apple Maps was sometimes inadequate to find companies or other points of interest at all For instance the London train and underground station Paddington and Tokyo Station were missing and the Helsinki Central railway station was shown as a park Also parks were occasionally displayed as airports Some instances of maps had cloud cover that obstructed the view of the road br On several occasions government authorities and politicians warned citizens of errors with Apple Maps In early December the police department of the Australian city Mildura alerted people who planned to reach the city using Apple Maps because Mildura was shown in the middle of Murray Sunset National Park miles kilometres from its actual location The police department stated that the error was potentially life threatening as national park temperatures could rise to F C and those traveling would be without water supplies The police rescued at least four people one of whom was stranded for hours After that the police department tried to contact Apple to solve the problem Apple fixed the error in December Alan Shatter the Minister for Justice and Equality and Minister of Defence of Ireland at the time issued a warning because of a mistake in Apple Maps a non existent

for the frustrations experienced by users He said that Apple fell short and that the company was making every effort to improve the mapping service Cook also suggested that dissatisfied users could use rival mapping applications like Bing Maps MapQuest Waze Google Maps and Nokia Maps Steve Jobs former CEO of Apple Inc had used this way of apologizing in the past A week before the release of the letter of apology just after the launch of Apple Maps spokesperson Trudy Miller had stated to technology news website All Things Digital that Apple Maps was a major initiative and that they were just getting started with it Miller also said the application would improve as more people used it br In the aftermath of the criticism two key employees left the company due to the problems associated with Apple Maps The departure of Scott Forstall senior vice president of iOS was announced in October Sources told technology news website The Verge that he had been fired for refusing to sign Tim Cook s letter of apology According to business magazine Bloomberg Businessweek Richard Williamson the person responsible for the mapping team at Apple left the following month He was succeeded by Eddy Cue br In June Eddy Cue said in an interview with Fast Company that Apple had completely underestimated the product the complexity of it He also said the problems with Apple Maps led to significant

executive team long discussed if Apple should have its own mapping service One month later Tim Cook looked back to the launch of Apple Maps in an interview with The Washington Post and said Maps was a mistake He added that the company admitted its mistake and that Maps is something the company is now proud of because of the improvements br br br TomTom s response br As the primary provider of map

trying to combine too many sources of data to create Apple Maps br br br present br Despite fixing preliminary issues Apple Maps has received mixed reviews with some critics complimenting its Flyover feature and appearance of the street map while others are criticizing its lack of features similar to those in Google Maps ZDNet said Apple Maps had its share of problems but Apple Maps is back with a vengeance Powered by some jaw dropping D graphics and enjoying an aggressive multi platform strategy Apple is finally set to redefine our geospatial expectations and take Google down a few notches An editor of The Street wrote But today and presumably after the iOS update Apple Maps has come into its own Despite the lingering absence of transit directions at last check Apple still suggests Google Maps and other routing apps I now prefer to Apple over Google Macworld wrote Apple Maps has vastly improved since it was first launched and now we conclude the turn by turn navigation is a lot better than Google s offering While there are areas that both Google and Apple can improve on we re certain that using Apple Maps won t direct you to drive into the Thames and that most of the initial issues have been fixed Thrillist wrote an article about Things Apple Maps Does Better Than Google Maps praising its ability to let the user send directions instantly from your computer to your phone see turn by turn directions from the lock screen get more specific recommendations for nearby attractions know which subway car to get on and which exit to use see true to life details and get seamless directions from Siri Apple Maps was also praised for its Look Around feature offering higher quality images than Google Street View br Apple Maps allows integration with a car s multi media system through CarPlay br Taiwan Republic of China was classified as a province of the People s Republic of China in the application in searches for Taiwan were changed automatically to China Taiwan province in Simplified Chinese prompting the Taiwan Ministry of Foreign Affairs to demand a correction from Apple br br br Controversies br br br China br br Apple has also received criticism regarding its map concerning the greater China region Apple uses Chinese map suppliers for map display within China and uses TomTom and local map suppliers for Taiwan and Hong Kong If the phone is located within mainland China it can result in all geotagged photos taken in Hong Kong Macau Taiwan Arunachal Pradesh or the disputed South China Sea islands being applied with an incorrect location or displaying the area as part of China There are some English language issues with the Chinese pinyin transliterations of the Chinese names in Taiwan and Hong Kong Photos taken in Taipei or Itanagar will display the location respectively as Taiwan Province China or Tibet Autonomous Region China Additionally Apple in China has agreed to manipulate Apple Maps to support China in the Senkaku Islands dispute by making Chinese claimed islands appear larger than they actually are as part of a business deal that was personally negotiated by Apple CEO Tim Cook br br br Ukraine br Apple s compliance with local laws has been criticized For example Apple labels Crimea as part of Russia in Apple Maps specifically for users who were accessing the app with a Crimean IP address Users in the rest of the world are showed Crimea as belonging to Ukraine br In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine Apple suspended its business operations in Russia As a safety precaution to those in Ukraine Apple had also disabled live traffic and other features in Maps br br br South Korea br Apple Maps has limited functionality in South Korea due to restrictions on geographic data in South Korea br br br See also br
