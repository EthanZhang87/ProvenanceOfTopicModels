Most of the CarPlay software runs on the connected iPhone and the CarPlay interface provides the audio and display connection to the car s infotainment system CarPlay adapts to various display sizes and control interfaces for each vehicle touch screen rotary dials buttons steering wheel controls and hands free microphones br Aftermarket head units may support CarPlay or Android Auto br The iPhone can connect to the car through a USB cable or wirelessly in two ways by exchanging network credentials with a supporting CarPlay receiver over Bluetooth establishing a two way Wi Fi connection or by using a dongle adapter to enable a wireless connection to the system s USB port br br br History br br br Predecessor br In one year after the release of the iPhone Mercedes vehicles were first to sell an audio system incorporating both the iPod and iPhone equipped with pin iOS input jacks The new Harman Kardon NTG featured full audio streaming syncing charging and control integrated into the steering wheel controls instrument panel and head unit Apple was working with Mercedes to develop iOS compatible audio systems into their cars first only a year after iPhone launch With an Apple Lightning to pin adapter iPhones iPods remain backwards compatible with the Harman Kardon and later models This is the earliest audio system specifically engineered for iPod iPhone integration which predated CarPlay and every other manufacturer incorporating iOS into vehicles br The concept of CarPlay was based on the iOS feature called iPod Out which was produced through several years of joint development by Apple and the BMW Group s Technology Office USA iPod Out enabled vehicles with the necessary infrastructure to host the analog video and audio from a supporting iOS device while receiving inputs such as button presses and knob rotations from a car s infotainment system to drive the hosted user interface in the vehicle s built in display It was announced at WWDC and first shipped in BMW Group vehicles in early The BMW and Mini option was called PlugIn and paved the way for the first cross OEM platforms introducing the concept of requiring a car specific interface for apps as opposed to MirrorLink s simple and insufficient mirroring of what was shown on the smartphone s screen br br br Development br CarPlay s codename was Stark Apple s Eddy Cue announced it as iOS in the Car at WWDC In January it was reported that Apple s hardware oriented corporate culture had led to release delays iOS in the Car was then rebranded and launched as CarPlay with significant design changes at the Geneva Motor Show in March with Ferrari Kia Mercedes Benz and Volvo among the first car manufacturers br At WWDC Apple introduced an all new version of CarPlay informally known as CarPlay which can control vehicle functions access vehicle stats and take over multiple vehicle screens completely The projected release date from Apple for this new CarPlay is late Manufacturers

including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in its electric vehicles so that it could collect and monetize more driver data and deliver a better user experience For instance GM executive Scott Miller said company made software could warm up the electric automobile s battery before driving something Apple software cannot do The company said drivers would still be able to connect smartphones to their car with Bluetooth br The announcement was widely panned by consumers the Detroit Free Press reported that some longtime GM customers said the lack of CarPlay would lead them to look at buying a Ford vehicle instead The move was widely interpreted by the press as promoting its partnership with Google and cutting off revenue streams to Apple at the expense of its customers Some noted that the move would severely inhibit customers data privacy br Ford a GM rival announced that its vehicles would continue to offer CarPlay Ford noted that GM s announcement meant that Ford s inclusion of CarPlay further distinguished itself among EV manufacturers because Tesla and Rivian have historically not included CarPlay br br br br br br External links br Official website
