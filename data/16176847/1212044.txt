it was incompatible with the earlier bit versions of GEOS for Commodore and Apple II computers but provided numerous enhancements including scalable fonts and multitasking on IBM PC XT and AT class PC clones GeoWorks saw a market opportunity to provide a graphical user interface for the million older model PCs that were unable to run Microsoft Windows x br GEOS was packaged with a suite of productivity applications Each had a name prefixed by Geo GeoWrite GeoDraw GeoManager GeoPlanner GeoDex and GeoComm It was also bundled with many PCs at the time but like other GUI environments for the PC platform such as Graphics Environment Manager GEM it ultimately proved less successful in the marketplace than Windows Former CEO of GeoWorks claims that GEOS faded away because Microsoft threatened to withdraw supply of MS DOS to hardware manufacturers who bundled Geoworks with their machines br In December NEC and Sony bundled an original equipment manufacturer OEM version of

Negotiations to make PC GEOS an integral part of PC DOS failed br GeoWorks attempted to get third party developers but was unable to get much support due to expense of the developer kit which cost for the manuals only and the difficult programming environment which required a second PC networked via serial port to run the debugger br Even though PC GEOS is referred to as an operating system it still requires DOS in load GEOS and its applications were written in a mix of assembly language Espire an interpreted language called IZL and C GEOS Object C GOC with non standard language extensions to support the object oriented design br Under DR DOS if TASKMAX was loaded before PC GEOS PC GEOS registered as graphical menu system for TASKMAX This still worked under the pre emptive multitasker EMM MULTI TASKMGR provided by Novell DOS OpenDOS and DR DOS and higher allowing for multiple GEOS and DOS applications to run concurrently br After the release of Ensemble GeoWorks ended support for the desktop version to focus on handhelds and smart devices br Geoworks Ensemble won the Software Publishers Association Excellence in Software Award for Best Consumer Program br br br NewDeal Office
