id: 273703
Power management is a feature of some electrical appliances especially copiers computers computer CPUs computer GPUs and computer peripherals such as monitors and printers that turns off the power or switches the system to a low power state when inactive In computing this is known as PC power management and is built around a standard called ACPI which superseded br APM All recent computers have ACPI support br br br Motivations br PC power management for computer systems is desired for many reasons particularly br br Reduce overall energy consumption br Prolong battery life for portable and embedded systems br Reduce cooling requirements br Reduce noise br Reduce operating costs for energy and cooling br Lower power consumption also means lower heat dissipation which increases system stability and less energy use which saves money and reduces the impact on the environment br br br Processor level techniques br The power management for microprocessors can be done over the whole processor or in specific components such as cache memory and main memory br With dynamic voltage scaling and dynamic frequency scaling the CPU core voltage clock rate or both can be altered to decrease power consumption at the price of potentially lower performance This is sometimes done in real time to optimize the power performance tradeoff br Examples br br AMD Cool n Quiet br AMD PowerNow br IBM EnergyScale br Intel SpeedStep br Transmeta LongRun and LongRun br VIA LongHaul PowerSaver br Additionally processors can selectively power off internal circuitry power gating For example br br Newer Intel Core processors support ultra fine power control over the functional units within the processors br AMD CoolCore technology get more efficient performance by dynamically activating or turning off parts of the processor br Intel VRT technology split the chip into a V I O section and a V core section The lower core voltage reduces power consumption br br br Heterogeneous computing br ARM s big LITTLE architecture can migrate processes between faster big cores and more power efficient LITTLE cores br br br Operating system level hibernation br br When a computer system hibernates it saves the contents of the RAM to disk and powers down the machine On startup it reloads the data This allows the system to be completely powered off while in hibernate mode This requires a file the size of the installed RAM to be placed on the hard disk potentially using up space even when not in hibernate mode Hibernate mode is enabled by default in some versions of Windows and can be disabled in order to recover this disk space br br br In GPUs br Graphics processing unit GPUs are used together with a CPU to accelerate computing in variety of domains revolving around scientific analytics engineering consumer and enterprise applications br All of this comes with some drawbacks the high computing capability of GPUs comes at the cost of high power dissipation Much research has been done over the power dissipation issue of GPUs and many techniques have been proposed to address this issue Dynamic voltage scaling dynamic frequency scaling DVFS and clock gating are two commonly used techniques for reducing dynamic power in GPUs br br br DVFS techniques br Experiments show that conventional processor DVFS policy can achieve power reduction of embedded GPUs with reasonable performance degradation New directions for designing effective DVFS schedulers for heterogeneous systems are also being explored A heterogeneous CPU GPU architecture GreenGPU is presented which employs DVFS in a synchronized way both for GPU and CPU GreenGPU is implemented using the CUDA framework on a real physical testbed with Nvidia GeForce GPUs and AMD Phenom II CPUs Experimentally it is shown that the GreenGPU achieves average energy savings and outperforms several well designed baselines br For the mainstream GPUs which are extensively used in all kinds of commercial and personal applications several DVFS techniques exist and are built into the GPUs alone AMD PowerTune and AMD ZeroCore Power are the two dynamic frequency scaling technologies for AMD graphic cards Practical tests showed that reclocking a GeForce GTX can achieve a lower power consumption while only decreasing performance by for a given task br br br Power gating techniques br Much research has been done on the dynamic power reduction with the use of DVFS techniques However as technology continues to shrink leakage power will become a dominant factor Power gating is a commonly used circuit technique to remove leakage by turning off the supply voltage of unused circuits Power gating incurs energy overhead therefore unused circuits need to remain idle long enough to compensate this overheads br A novel micro architectural technique for run time power gating caches of GPUs saves leakage energy Based on experiments on different GPU workloads the average energy savings achieved by the proposed technique is br Shaders are the most power hungry component of a GPU a predictive shader shut down power gating technique achieves up to leakage reduction on shader processors br The Predictive Shader Shutdown technique exploits workload variation across frames to eliminate leakage in shader clusters Another technique called Deferred Geometry Pipeline seeks to minimize leakage in fixed function geometry units by utilizing an imbalance between geometry and fragment computation across batches which removes up to of the leakage in the fixed function geometry units A simple time out power gating method can be applied to non shader execution units which eliminates of the leakage in non shader execution units on average br All the three techniques stated above incur negligible performance degradation less than br br br See also br br Plus br Advanced power management APM br Advanced Configuration and Power Interface ACPI br Hibernate br Sleep br
