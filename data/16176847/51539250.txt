The iPhone and iPhone Plus are smartphones that were designed developed and marketed by Apple Inc They are the tenth generation of the iPhone They were announced on September at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco by Apple CEO Tim Cook and were released on September succeeding the iPhone iPhone Plus iPhone S and iPhone S Plus as the flagship devices in the iPhone series Apple also released the iPhone and iPhone Plus in numerous countries worldwide throughout September and October They were succeeded as flagship devices by the iPhone and iPhone Plus on September and were discontinued with the announcement of the iPhone and iPhone Pro on September br The iPhone s overall design is similar to the iPhone and iPhone S Changes introduced included new color options Matte Black and Jet Black water and dust resistance a new capacitive static home button revised antenna bands and the controversial removal of the mm headphone jack The device s internal hardware received upgrades including a heterogeneous quad core system on chip with improved system and graphics performance upgraded megapixel rear facing cameras with optical image stabilization on all models and an additional telephoto lens exclusive to the iPhone Plus to provide enhanced x optical zoom capabilities and portrait mode The front camera is the first in the series with p Full HD video resolution The iPhone and Plus were supported from iOS to iOS and they are the third to support six versions of iOS before support was terminated after the iPhone S br The iPhone and Plus were the last iPhones using quad core CPU as well as aluminum unibody design without wireless charge and using GB of internal storage br The iPhone and Plus were the only iPhones to have jet black color finish br br br History br Prior to its announcement multiple aspects of the iPhone were heavily rumoured Apple s plans to remove the mm headphone jack received significant media attention Other rumors included a flush camera stereo speakers a gigabyte storage option and a larger mAh battery br On August invitations to a press event at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco California on September were sent out to members of the media prompting immediate speculation of the iPhone s upcoming announcement The iPhone was officially announced at that event with pre orders beginning September and general availability on September br The iPhone launched in new countries later in September with further international rollouts throughout October and November Indonesia was the last country to release the iPhone and Plus with availability starting on March following Apple s research and development investment in the country br On March Apple announced an iPhone with a red color finish and white front as part of its partnership with Product Red to highlight its AIDS fundraising campaign It launched on March but it was later discontinued after the announcement of the iPhone iPhone Plus and iPhone X in September as well as the GB Variant br On September Apple announced the iPhone and iPhone Plus as direct successors to the iPhone and Plus alongside the iPhone X br The iPhone Plus as well as the iPhone XS and its Max variant were discontinued and removed from Apple s website after the announcement of the iPhone and iPhone Pro on September They are no longer available for sale br On June Apple announced on its website that the iPhone and Plus will not receive support for iOS Controversially the iPad th generation which has the A chip received iPadOS along with the th and th generation iPads which have almost identical hardware to the iPhone and Plus respectively br br br Specifications br br br Design br br br br br br br br br br br The iPhone s exterior is similar in shape and volume to the iPhone and iPhone S although the camera bump is bigger on the iPhone Alongside the existing silver gold and rose gold colors the device is offered in new colors of matte black glossy jet black and for a limited time red The jet black color is a dark shade high gloss black finish It is created through a multi step process beginning with an anodization phase to make the surface of the casing a porous aluminum oxide and then using a machine to sweep the casing through a powdered compound absorbed by aluminum oxide The process is concluded with an ultrafine particle bath for additional finishing the entire process takes less than an hour br br br Water protection br iPhone is rated IP water and dust resistant making it the first officially water resistant iPhone although tests have resulted in malfunctions specifically distorted speakers after water exposure The warranty does not cover any water damage to the phone br br br Home button br iPhone s home button uses a capacitive mechanism for input rather than a physical push button as on previous models meaning direct skin contact or a capacitive glove is required to operate the device Physical feedback is provided via a Taptic Engine vibrator and the button is also pressure sensitive iPhone retains the D Touch display system introduced on the iPhone S providing pressure sensitive touchscreen input br br br Headphone plug removal br br The iPhone and iPhone Plus are the first iPhones not to feature a mm headphone jack It was replaced by a second speaker grille that serves as a vent for the internal barometer A Lightning to mm connector adapter as well as in ear headphones that use the Lightning connector were bundled with the device and the adapter is also sold separately as an accessory The adapter is also compatible with other iPhone iPad and iPod Touch devices running iOS and newer br br br Hardware br br br Chipsets br iPhone uses the Apple A Fusion bit system on chip which consists of two low power cores and two high power cores only two cores are used at any point in time The A chip also features a hexa core graphics chip capable of console level gaming As with prior models iPhone is available in two sizes one with a in mm screen and a Plus variant with a in mm screen The displays have identical sizes and resolutions to iPhone S but with a wider color gamut and increased brightness The screen to body ratio is about and for the and Plus respectively br Both device variants also contain a new iteration of Apple s motion coprocessor the M Unlike previous iPhone models internal storage options for iPhone begin at GB instead of GB and max out at GB iPhone Plus offers GB of RAM more than any other previous iPhone the inch iPhone has GB br br br Cameras br br br br br br br br br br br The iPhone includes a megapixel rear facing camera with a quad LED True Tone flash its aperture was widened to f and the standard size phone model adds optical image stabilization a feature that was previously exclusive to Plus models br The iPhone Plus includes a second megapixel telephoto lens which can be used to achieve optical zoom and up to digital zoom However the telephoto camera has an f aperture and lacks optical image stabilization br The iPhone and Plus record video with single channel mono audio br Still photos with megapixels can be captured during video recording br The front facing camera was upgraded to a megapixel sensor with automatic image stabilization br The iPhone and Plus are the first iPhones to be able to record p video using the front camera br br br Battery life br The iPhone has a mAh battery which can last about hours The iPhone Plus has mAh battery and can last for hours br br br Software br br The iPhone originally shipped with iOS pre installed The iPhone Plus received an exclusive portrait camera mode in the iOS software update This camera mode is capable of producing a bokeh effect using depth of field analysis of the second camera of dual lens in the back of iPhone Plus Mainstream software support for the iPhone was dropped when iOS was released But it still receives iOS security updates as of January The current version of iOS to support iPhone is iOS The device can also run Android unofficially via a project called Project Sandcastle made by Corellium a security research company that produces paid iOS Android and IoT emulators Ubuntu Focal Fossa has also been ported via Project Sandcastle br br br Accessories br br br br br br br br br br br Each iPhone originally came with a Lightning to mm adapter although this was omitted starting on September Apple sells the adapter independently as well iPhone does not have a built in DAC a Cirrus Logic CS DAC is included as part of the adapter Apple also unveiled several Bluetooth wireless headphones ostensibly intended for use with the iPhone including AirPods wireless in ear headphones and three new Beats headphone products All four products utilize an in house wireless chip known as the Apple W which is designed to provide low power Bluetooth operation and integration with iOS and macOS devices though they are still compatible with other Bluetooth supported devices br br br Reception br Reception of the iPhone was mixed Although reviewers noted improvements to the camera especially the dual rear camera on the Plus model the phone was criticized for the lack of innovation in its build quality Many reviews panned the removal of the mm headphone jack some critics argued that the change was meant to bolster licensing of the proprietary Lightning connector and the sales of Apple s own wireless headphone products and questioned the effects of the change on audio quality Apple was also mocked by critics for Phil Schiller s statement that such a drastic change required courage br Gordon Kelly of Forbes noted that rival smartphones such as the Samsung Galaxy S had increased battery life and added water resistance over its predecessor while retaining the headphone jack and that the iPhone s camera photo quality was improved but still lagging behind some phones already on the market including the Galaxy S and Nexus P Kelly praised how Apple was able to extract improved brightness and accurate color reproduction from its LCD display panel while noting that it was old technology which was also well behind rivals who had already moved to sharper p or even K screens The iPhone s exterior which reuses the aging design of the iPhone and iPhone S was criticized especially the size of the device and thick top bottom bezels with Kelly writing that the iPhone Plus is simply far too big for a smartphone with a inch display br Nilay Patel of The Verge described the devices as being full of aggressive breaks from convention despite their design continuity with previous models going as far as dubbing them a prototype of next year s rumored drastic iPhone redesign disguised as an iPhone citing the headphone jack removal which he felt was an attempt to encourage the use of wireless headphones heterogeneous CPU and home button redesign The display quality was considered an improvement over previous models albeit not as insane as the quad HD displays on competing phones The Taptic Engine was considered the first really valuable new UI concept I ve seen on phones in years as opposed to the gimmick of D Touch Patel felt that the cameras of the devices were a step above the S in terms of performance and praised the dual lens camera on the Plus for enhancing the phone s camera functionality However he panned the lack of editing features that made use of them In regards to the enhanced Bluetooth audio support provided by devices containing the W chip he argued that Apple took away an established open standard in favor of new technologies but instead of making the experience of using those new technologies better across the board it made every third party wireless audio product a second class citizen of the Apple ecosystem Giving the iPhone a out of he concluded that the devices were legitimately among the most interesting opinionated powerful phones Apple has ever shipped and the most confident expressions of the company s vision in a long time iOS is excellent the cameras are better and the performance is phenomenal And the batteries last longer br John McCann of TechRadar wrote that for the first time the phablet sized iPhone Plus was markedly better than the smaller model He highlighted improved battery life and praised the camera calling the Plus dual cameras excellent for point and shoot and much improved for low light performance McCann wrote that the lack of a headphone jack was initially frustrating but noted that it was a positive step forward for the mobile industry despite the short term effects making the most noise for now br br br Headphone jack controversy br Criticism of the iPhone centered around the removal of the headphone jack including the inability to use wired headphones with the included adapter and charge the device simultaneously br In a particularly scathing article Nilay Patel of The Verge wrote that removing the headphone jack a deeply established standard as he put it would be user hostile and stupid He goes on to list reasons why removing the port is negative concluding with No one is asking for this and Vote with your dollars br Gordon Kelly of Forbes noted that wireless audio technology was immature at the moment with Bluetooth audio quality being inferior and Lightning s audio reliability still in question The removal of the headphone jack meant that in Patel s words You re being pushed into an era where you will have to pay more for decent headphones due to their need for an integrated DAC and or Lightning licensing and pointed out that the only company to profit from this situation is Apple who will now be charging licensing fees to millions of headphone companies br In particular Apple s vice president Phil Schiller who announced the change was mocked extensively online for stating that removing the headphone jack took courage An online petition created by the consumer group SumOfUs that accuses Apple of planned obsolescence and causing substantial electronic waste by removing the headphone jack reached over signatures br br br Issues br br br Hissing noises br Some users have reported a strange hissing noise during heavy usage of the phone CNET reports it as faint buzzes and hums coming from the backside The Daily Telegraph speculates that the iPhone s new A Fusion processor is the source of the noise linking to tweets that compare the phone s hissing sound to hearing the fans spin up loudly whenever your Mac s CPU gets used to its actual potential br br br Performance differences br The Guardian reported in October that storage tests from Unbox Therapy and GSMArena showed that the GB iPhone is significantly slower than the and GB versions measuring data write speeds of MB s on a GB iPhone model versus MB s on a GB model October network tests by Cellular Insights showed that models A and A with Qualcomm modems had a significant performance edge over models A and A with Intel modems Inspection of the modems also found that the Qualcomm version s ability to use Ultra HD Voice had been turned off likely to level the playing field between the Qualcomm and Intel variants The report concluded with the statement that We are not sure what was the main reason behind Apple s decision to source two different modem suppliers for the newest iPhone Bloomberg reported in November that tests by researchers from Twin Prime and Cellular Insights had shown the two modems to perform similarly on some U S cellular networks despite one of the modems being technically capable of faster connectivity Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller told the publication that Every iPhone and iPhone Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple s wireless performance standards quality metrics and reliability testing In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards in thousands of hours of real world field testing and in extensive carrier partner testing the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models Bloomberg quoted analysts and technology advisers who stated that Apple don t want one version to get the reputation that it is better and that This may not impact the fanboys but it may make other consumers think twice about buying an Apple phone especially if they think they might be purchasing a sub standard product br br br Perception of slogan in Cantonese speaking regions br The iPhone s This is slogan has been misunderstood when translated to certain other languages br The phone s slogan in Mainland China is is here Chinese pinyin z i c while in Hong Kong its slogan is This is iPhone Chinese iPhone Jyutping ze zau si iPhone br In Cantonese the local language of Hong Kong the slogan could be mistakenly interpreted as This is penis Tsat br Chinese Jyutping cat is a common slang term for an erect penis and seven Chinese Jyutping cat which varies only in tone is often used as a euphemism br br br Replacing the home button br In the iPhone Apple added a software lock that prevents individuals from attempting to replace the home button on their own Users are now required to go to an Apple Store to have repairs done with recalibration of the button being necessary This is a step further than Apple went with iPhone S and S where only Touch ID functionality would get disabled but the return to home functionality still worked br br br Failure to connect to cellular service br Some iPhone devices with the model numbers A A and A suffer from a problem where they show a No service message even when cellular reception is available Apple will repair those devices for free within four years of the first retail sale of the unit br br br Loop disease br Some iPhone devices suffer from a problem that affects audio in the device Users reported a grayed out speaker button during calls grayed out voice memo icon and occasional freezing of the device A few users also complained that lightning EarPods failed to work with the device and that the Wi Fi button would be grayed out after restarting the iPhone On May Apple acknowledged the issue through an internal memo If an affected iPhone was no longer covered by warranty Apple said its service providers could request an exception for this particular issue The exemptions abruptly ended in July when Apple deleted the internal document Many customers have complained Apple has charged customers around to fix the issue Many customers complain the issue first appeared after a software update br br br Sales br Apple has deliberately withheld pre order sales numbers citing that these are no longer a representative metric for our investors and customers Without releasing specific numbers T Mobile US stated that the iPhone had broken the carrier s all time record for first day pre order sales The following weekend T Mobile US stated that iPhone was its biggest iPhone launch ever being up nearly x compared to the next most popular iPhone br On September two days before the iPhone went on sale Apple announced that due to high demand they had sold out of all jet black iPhone s and all colors of the iPhone Plus This caused issues for customers in the iPhone Upgrade Program who were unable to reserve new phones After customer complaints and a class action lawsuit Apple made changes to ensure members of the program could get new phones as soon as possible br In May analytics research company Strategy Analytics announced that iPhone and iPhone Plus were the best selling smartphones worldwide during the first quarter of selling million and million units respectively br br br US carrier trade in deals br For the initial U S sales of the iPhone all four major wireless carriers announced trade in deals Under the deals the monthly installment plan cost of the iPhone is negated by a monthly credit on consumers bill but consumers who cancel their service with the carrier or pay off the phone prior to the installment contract completion will not receive credits for the remaining months Jacob Kastrenakes of The Verge noted that the deals effectively constituted a return to two year phone contracts in which the deals essentially lock you into that carrier for two years br In the wake of these deals Verizon announced they had seen an increase in sales over the release of the previous year s iPhone S AT T said that sales had exceeded its expectations and T Mobile and Sprint announced huge increases in sales with T Mobile seeing a demand roughly four times higher for the than the br br br Reports about trimmed production br In December DigiTimes reported that Apple had reduced production of the iPhone because of decreasing demand for the product after the initial surge of interest waned A reason cited was consumers and suppliers turning their attention to next year s iPhone model br A new report from Nikkei at the end of December included details on sales and production of the iPhone The report based on data from suppliers stated that Apple would trim production of the iPhone by in the first quarter of following sluggish sales Nikkei reported that Apple previously trimmed production of the iPhone by due to accumulated inventory of the previous model but that the new models had sold more sluggishly than expected Additionally the report notes that the iPhone Plus which features two cameras on its back face remains popular but a shortage of camera sensors has curbed Apple s ability to meet demand for the phones br br br See also br List of iPhone models br History of the iPhone
