title: Batterygate
id: 56205405
Batterygate is a term used to describe deliberate processor slowdowns on Apple s iPhones in order to prevent handsets with degraded batteries shutting down when under high load br Critics argued the slowdown amounted to planned obsolescence however this may stem from the common misconception that all older iPhones were slowed down Some have argued that introducing a feature to prevent handsets with degraded batteries from rebooting is in fact the opposite of planned obsolescence since a slower non rebooting phone would be preferable to the alternative br Other criticism has come from the fact that the affected handsets were slowed down without explanation or other options provided to the user Apple has since updated iOS to provide notifications and settings to allow users visibility of the throttling and even the ability to disable the throttling if the user prefers to have their phone reboot under high load br The controversy first emerged in late when it was reported that since a recent iOS update some iPhone handsets had begun to experience unexpected shutdowns when their battery capacity reached caused by drops in the battery s terminal voltage below a threshold of around three volts required for operation of the device br br br History br Upon the release of iOS in late reports surfaced of battery usage issues with the update There were also reports of device instability from some users on iPhone and iPhone S models including situations where the device would unexpectedly shut down once its battery capacity reached with one user having described the battery percentage as unexpectedly jumping down to before doing so but still appearing as after the device was plugged in and rebooted br Apple confirmed in December that some iPhone S models manufactured in September and October had suffered from a battery manufacturing defect br The company stated that this defect was not a safety concern but that it could diminish capacity and cause shutdowns to protect the device s electronic components In regards to other instances of shutdowns Apple stated that it would include an additional diagnostics capability in the next iOS update so that it could improve algorithms for managing battery performance and shutdown operations in future versions With the release of iOS in February Apple stated that it had reduced unexpected shutdowns on iPhone S by more than and by over on iPhone Apple also reported that these issues were separate from the aforementioned defects in the S br In December the developers of the benchmarking tool Geekbench issued a report which showed a pattern of performance degradation on iPhone models upgraded past and iPhone models upgraded past iOS There had been anecdotal evidence in the past that Apple had intentionally degraded the performance of older iPhone models on newer versions of iOS as a form of planned obsolescence to encourage sales of newer models br In response to these reports Apple issued a statement to CNET confirming that it had implemented software performance controls based on battery health on older iPhone devices in order to preserve system stability and prevent unexpected shutdowns The company stated that its goal was to deliver the best experience for customers which includes overall performance and prolonging the life of their devices and explained that lithium ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands when in cold conditions have a low battery charge or as they age over time which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components br Soon after Apple issued a formal apology admitting that it initially believed that the issues were caused by iOS bugs and normal temporary performance decreases following an update but that continued chemical aging of batteries in older iPhone devices was also a factor Apple stated that replacing the device s battery would restore full performance and also announced that it would offer a US discount from to on battery replacements for iPhone and S from January through December and that it would include more prominent battery health information in later versions of iOS In January Apple CEO Tim Cook stated in a shareholder letter that over million battery replacements had been made under the discount program The company stated that it had never nor would ever do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades br iOS added the promised battery health information and also allows these performance controls to be disabled br Beginning with the iPhone Apple introduced a new performance management system intended to reduce performance impacts from battery aging Unlike the previous system this is always active in response to the battery s current capabilities and there is no peak performance state br br br Reception br br USA Today columnist Jefferson Graham felt that Apple should have made the battery replacements be free arguing that it would go a long way towards erasing widespread suspicion that Apple purposely tries to make its older products obsolete in order to coax consumers into buying new ones br As of January class action lawsuits had been filed against Apple over this issue A Chicago lawyer who proposed a million class action considered the battery discount an insult to loyal customers who consistently and with much fanfare have flocked to Apple stores worldwide to purchase every version of the iPhone br In January Apple CEO Tim Cook stated that the company had cut its earnings projections due to fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated as well as lower than anticipated revenue in markets such as China br On February French consumer authorities fined Apple million following a formal investigation into the decision On February Apple agreed to a million settlement in a California court under which it plans to pay at least to all U S residents who had purchased an iPhone Plus S S Plus SE or Plus device br A separate investigation from states and the District of Columbia also looked into the battery practice The investigation concluded in November with Apple and the states agreeing for Apple to pay a US million fine related to throttling performance on the devices and for Apple to issue documents to be transparent about how it throttles performance br In January a class action lawsuit ordered Apple to pay Canadian iPhone users up to million CAD to anyone who owned an iPhone iPhone s iPhone SE st generation or iPhone and upgraded to iOS between December Apple was accused of slowing down older iPhones using software updates to encourage consumers to buy newer and more expensive iPhones However Apple denies any wrongdoing and claims the updates were to prevent shutdowns due to aging batteries br br br See also br Antennagate br Planned obsolescence br Durapolist br Vendor lock in br Criticism of Apple Inc br
