Mobile app development is the act or process by which a mobile app is developed for one or more mobile devices which can include personal digital assistants PDA enterprise digital assistants EDA or mobile phones Such software applications are specifically designed to run on mobile devices taking numerous hardware constraints into consideration Common constraints include CPU architecture and speeds available memory RAM limited data storage capacities and considerable variation in displays technology size dimensions resolution and input methods buttons keyboards touch screens with or without styluses These applications or apps can be pre installed on phones during manufacturing or delivered as web applications using server side or client side processing e g JavaScript to provide an application like experience within a web browser br Mobile app development has been steadily growing in terms of revenues and jobs created A analyst report estimates there are direct app economy jobs within the EU of which there are members including the UK percent of which are mobile app developers br br br Overview br In order to facilitate the development of applications for mobile devices and the consistency thereof various approaches have been taken br Most companies that ship a product e g Apple iPod iPhone iPad provide an official software development kit SDK They may also opt to provide some form of Testing and or Quality Assurance QA In exchange for being provided the SDK or other tools it may be necessary for a prospective developer to sign some form of non disclosure agreement or NDA which restricts the sharing of privileged information br As part of the development process mobile user interface UI design is an essential step in the creation of mobile apps Mobile UI designers consider constraints contexts screen space input methods and mobility as outlines for design Constraints in mobile UI design which include the limited attention span of the user and form factors such as a mobile device s screen size for a user s hand s Mobile UI context includes signal cues from user activity such as the location where or the time when the device is in use that can be observed from user interactions within a mobile app Such context clues can be used to provide automatic suggestions when scheduling an appointment or activity or to filter a list of various services for the user br The user is often the focus of interaction with their device and the interface entails components of both hardware and software User input allows for the users to manipulate a system and the device s output allows the system to indicate the effects of the users manipulation br Overall mobile UI design s goal is mainly for an understandable user friendly interface Functionality is supported by mobile enterprise application platforms or integrated development environments IDEs br Developers of mobile applications must also consider a large array of devices with different screen sizes hardware specifications and configurations because of intense competition in mobile hardware and changes within each of the platforms br Today mobile apps are usually distributed via an official online outlet or marketplace e g Apple The App Store Google Google Play and there is a formalized process by which developers submit their apps for approval and inclusion in those marketplaces Historically however that was not always the case br Mobile UIs or front ends rely on mobile back ends to support access to enterprise systems The mobile back end facilitates data routing security authentication authorization working off line and service orchestration This functionality is supported by a mix of middleware components including mobile app servers mobile backend as a service MBaaS and service oriented architecture SOA infrastructure br br br Platform br The software development packages needed to develop deploy and manage mobile apps are made from many components and tools which allow a developer to write test and deploy applications for one or more target platforms br br br Front end development tools br Front end development tools are focused on the user interface and user experience UI UX and provide the following abilities br br UI design tools br SDKs to access device features br Cross platform accommodations support br Notable tools are listed below br br br First Party br First party tools include official SDKs published by or on behalf of the company responsible for the br design of a particular hardware platform e g Apple Google etc as well as any third party software that is officially supported for the purpose of developing mobile apps for that hardware br br br Second Party br br br Third Party br br br Back end servers br Back end tools pick up where the front end tools leave off and provide a set of reusable services that are centrally managed and controlled and provide the following abilities br br Integration with back end systems br User authentication authorization br Data services br Reusable business logic br Available tools are listed below br br br Security add on layers br With bring your own device BYOD becoming the norm within more enterprises IT departments often need stop gap tactical solutions that layer atop existing apps phones and platform component Features include br br App wrapping for security br Data encryption br Client actions br Reporting and statistics br br br System software br Many system level components are needed to have a functioning platform for developing mobile apps br br Criteria for selecting a development platform usually include the target mobile platforms existing infrastructure and development skills When targeting more than one platform with cross platform development it is also important to consider the impact of the tool on the user experience Performance is another important criterion as research on mobile apps indicates a strong correlation between application performance and user satisfaction Along with performance and other criteria the availability of the technology and the project s requirements may drive the development between native and cross platform environments To aid the choice between native and cross platform environments some guidelines and benchmarks have been published Typically cross platform environments are reusable across multiple platforms leveraging a native container while using HTML CSS and JavaScript for the user interface In contrast native environments are targeted at one platform for each of those environments For example Android development occurs in the Eclipse IDE using Android Developer Tools ADT plugins Apple iOS development occurs using the Xcode IDE with Objective C and or Swift Windows and BlackBerry each have their own development environments br br br Mobile app testing br Mobile applications are first tested within the development environment using emulators and later subjected to field testing Emulators provide an inexpensive way to test applications on mobile phones to which developers may not have physical access The following are examples of tools used for testing applications across the most popular mobile operating systems br br Google Android Emulator an Android emulator that is patched to run on a Windows PC as a standalone app without having to download and install the complete and complex Android SDK It can be installed and Android compatible apps can be tested on it br The official Android SDK Emulator a mobile device emulator which mimics all of the hardware and software features of a typical mobile device without the calls br TestiPhone a web browser based simulator for quickly testing iPhone web applications This tool has been tested and works using Internet Explorer Firefox and Safari br iPhoney gives a pixel accurate web browsing environment and it is powered by Safari It can be used while developing web sites for the iPhone It is not an iPhone simulator but instead is designed for web developers who want to create by or by websites for use with iPhones iPhoney will only run on OS X or later br BlackBerry Simulator There are a variety of official BlackBerry simulators available to emulate the functionality of actual BlackBerry products and test how the device software screen keyboard and trackwheel will work with the application br Windows UI Automation To test applications that use the Microsoft UI Automation technology it requires Windows Automation API It is pre installed on Windows Windows Server R and later versions of Windows On other operating systems you can install it using Windows Update or download it from the Microsoft Web site br MobiOne Developer a mobile Web integrated development environment IDE for Windows that helps developers to code test debug package and deploy mobile Web applications to devices such as iPhone BlackBerry Android and the Palm Pre MobiOne Developer was officially declared End of Life by the end of br Tools include br br eggPlant A GUI based automated test tool for mobile apps across all operating systems and devices br Ranorex Test automation tools for mobile web and desktop apps br Testdroid Real mobile devices and test automation tools for testing mobile and web apps br br br Design Principles for Creating Successful Mobile Apps br According to a Industry Report on Applications of mobile app users have stated that they have stopped using or uninstalled an app due to poor performance Design experts advocate for the following design principles to create successful and effective mobile apps br Clutter free screens Keeps interactions quick and simple allowing users to focus on one specific task rather than being overwhelmed with multiple features and tasks Design experts strongly advocate for one task per screen and recommend breaking down long forms into pages and progressively revealing new tasks or fields to minimize clutter br Reduce cognitive load Makes user journey through the app seamless and preserves natural flow through the app Design experts suggest incorporating autocomplete spell check prediction text assistance and dropdown menus to reduce cognitive load Design experts also recommend the state of the app be preserved when users temporarily leave the app and re enter so that users can continue their journey from where they have left off br Simple navigation Around of people have uninstalled apps due to their complicated interface Design experts state it is paramount to present the navigation bar visibly in your app to help users navigate to frequently used and high priority screens instantly They suggest the use of recognizable icons specific to the device operating system to help users easily take actions such as opening a menu changing settings going back a screen and searching within a page According to them a user should not be confused while navigating the app so an orderly clear and logical navigation flow drives engagement and discovery in the app br Notifications It s reported that around of users uninstall an app due to frequent push notifications Notifications should be sent with careful planning according to design experts Experts state notifications should be sent at a time most convenient to users in their time zone and the messages should be personalized to bring great value to them br Speed Appearance About of people uninstall apps due to hang up issues Design experts state it s important to make sure the app is fast and responsive so that users don t have to wait for content They state developers should deliver content faster or give the perception of progress Some approaches suggested by the experts are the use of skeleton screens which show the layout of the app with content grayed out progress bars or loading spinners tasks being carried out in the background and delivering the content quickly when the user requests for it or giving users some tasks or content while they are waiting for a page to load br Usability Approximately of mobile users use their phone with one hand thus design experts state it is important that the top level menu frequently used controls and common action items are within the reach of the user s thumb They also stress the importance of readability and it s recommended that the text size is at least point font so that users can read it at the typical reading distance without zooming in It is recommended that headers and titles on the app screens be San Francisco pt and Roboto sp for iOS and Android OS respectively The experts also state there should be minimum contrast ratio between text and the background color Design experts strongly encourage developers to make apps accessible for all users including people with disabilities so they suggest features such as voice navigation screen reader compatibility and user interface adaptability in mobile apps br br br Patents br Many patent applications are pending for new mobile phone apps Most of these are in the technological fields of business methods database management data transfer and operator interface br br br See also br br br
