starting price of US and positioned as a budget phone br Following the pattern of the first iPhone SE which shares the form factor of the iPhone s with the internal hardware of the iPhone s the second generation model shares the form factor of the iPhone with internal components from the iPhone lineup It has selected components from such as the Apple A Bionic system on chip which allows the phone

br History br A successor to the first generation iPhone SE had been a source of rumor stemmed in the year after original was released The name was also subject to speculation Guesses included most prevalently iPhone SE iPhone SE and iPhone due to design similarities with the iPhone br In March cases for the phone were reportedly being supplied to Best Buy showing an iPhone with an iPhone sized body and a single camera lens Belkin screen protectors for the iPhone SE were also listed on the online Apple Store cross compatible with the base models of the iPhones S and However references to the iPhone SE were quickly removed br On April the second generation iPhone SE was announced in a press release note on Apple s website It was marketed as A powerful new smartphone in a popular design and was released worldwide on April br The second generation iPhone SE was discontinued on March following the announcement of its successor the third generation iPhone SE br br br Specifications br br br Design br br The iPhone SE features an aluminum frame paired with a glass front and back It shares the same physical sizes and dimensions as the iPhone and is externally identical except for a centered Apple logo and the removal of the iPhone branding in the lower midsection As a result phone cases made to fit the iPhone will also fit the iPhone SE br The iPhone SE is available in three colors Black White and a Product Red edition Though the offered colors line up with those of the iPhone Silver Space Gray and Product Red respectively with no equivalent to the Gold model the iPhone SE uses a noticeably deeper shade of black a brighter shade of white and a lighter shade of Product Red The black and white colors are reminiscent of those on the iPhone XR while the Product Red looks very similar to that on the iPhone Unlike all prior white and silver iPhones from the iPhone to the iPhone except for the iPhone C the iPhone SE features black bezels around the display on all models matching the color schemes of the iPhone and iPhone XR br br br Size br With a screen diagonal of in mm the second generation of the iPhone SE was among the smallest mainstream in production smartphones at the time of its release However it is still thirty percent larger than the first generation variant whose screen diagonal measures in mm br Dan Seifert from The Verge declared the second generation SE a nail in the coffin for small phones This was affirmed by CNET who stated that Apple s decision to not build a brand new inch screen phone is telling It signals that the company will probably never bring back the tiny iPhone no matter how badly people crave it br br br Hardware br The iPhone SE incorporates the Apple A Bionic nm architecture system on a chip SoC with an integrated M motion coprocessor and third generation neural engine It is available in three internal storage configurations GB GB and GB The SE has the same IP rating for dust and water resistance as the iPhone The phone lacks the ultra wideband features enabled by the U chip found in the iPhone and Pro Despite the phone s smaller size which may lead to increased thermal throttling the SE s A SoC runs at the same peak CPU frequencies as the iPhone Like the iPhone and that were previously available in the same form factor but unlike the iPhone S and first generation iPhone SE the second generation iPhone SE does not feature a standard mm stereo headphone jack br br br Display br The iPhone SE features the same HD Retina display found on the iPhone using IPS technology with True Tone and wide color gamut Display P The display has a resolution of pixels like the previous in mm iPhones The pixel density is PPI the same as on all iPhones with LCDs since the introduction of the Retina display on the iPhone excluding the Plus models The pressure sensing D Touch feature found on the iPhone has been replaced with Haptic Touch on the iPhone SE which initially did not work for notifications but was later fixed in iOS It can play HDR and Dolby Vision content despite not having an HDR ready display done by down converting the HDR content to fit the display while still having some enhancements to dynamic range contrast and wide color gamut compared to standard content br br br Camera br The iPhone SE has a rear MP camera with a single lens similar to the single lens camera system of the iPhone capable of recording K video at or fps p HD video at or fps or p HD video at fps The camera has an aperture of autofocus optical image stabilization and a quad LED True Tone flash

QuickTake from the and Pro which allows the user to long press the shutter button to take a video The burst function can now be accessed by swiping the shutter button to the left br The new image signal processor and neural engine of the SE support several camera functions not supported on the iPhone Like the and Pro the rear camera supports next generation Smart HDR The rear camera also supports extended dynamic range video up to fps stereo recording and cinematic video stabilization Both the front and rear cameras of the iPhone SE support Portrait mode and Portrait Lighting Like the and Pro Portrait mode has depth control and an advanced bokeh effect blurring effect of the out of focus background around the portrait However the usage of older sensor hardware results in some limitations the iPhone SE does not support the Night Mode or Deep Fusion features of the iPhone and Pro The SE s implementation of Portrait mode only natively supports images of humans as the hardware does not produce depth maps through the use of focus pixels and instead relies on software based machine learning br br br Software br br The iPhone SE was originally supplied with iOS supporting Apple Pay and the Apple Card iOS an update fixing bugs related to Bluetooth and FaceTime was released on April a day prior to the device s official release making it a day one software update br The iPhone SE received updates to iOS iOS and iOS on their respective release dates in and The latest version of iOS it is compatible with is the current iOS It will be compatible with the upcoming iOS due to be released in late br br br Controversy br br br Power adapter and EarPods br Apple citing an environmental initiative removed the EarPods except in France and power adapter from all new iPhone boxes beginning in October including the iPhone SE nd generation Apple claimed that removing these items will reduce e waste and permit a smaller iPhone box allowing more devices to be shipped simultaneously to decrease carbon footprint However Apple now includes a USB C to Lightning cable incompatible with the existing USB A power adapters that Apple previously shipped with their devices Upgraders can still use their existing iPhone power adapters and cables but users wanting fast charging capabilities will have to purchase a USB C power adapter separately br br br See also br List of
