title: EPOC (operating system)
id: 37396729
EPOC is a mobile operating system developed by Psion a British company founded in It began as a bit operating system OS for Psion s own x compatible devices and was later replaced by a bit system for x and ARM Psion licensed the bit system to other hardware makers such as Ericsson br To distinguish it from the bit OS the bit version was sometimes called EPOC Technologically it was a major departure from the bit version which came to be called EPOC or SIBO In the bit version was renamed Symbian OS After Nokia acquired the rights to Symbian in they published Symbian s source code under the Eclipse Public License In Nokia rescinded the open source license for subsequent releases of the software br br br Name br The name EPOC comes from the word epoch the beginning of an era The name was shortened to four letters to accord with the names of such software innovations as Unix and Mach br Initially the operating system was capitalised as Epoc rather than EPOC since it is not an acronym The change to all capital letters was made on the recommendation of Psion s marketing department Thereafter a rumour circulated in the technical press that EPOC was an acronym for Electronic Piece of Cheese When Psion started developing a bit operating system in they kept it under the EPOC brand To avoid confusion within the company they started calling the old system EPOC and the new one EPOC Then it became conventional within the company to refer to EPOC as SIBO which was the codename of Psion s bit mobile computing initiative This change freed them use the name EPOC for EPOC br In June Psion formed a limited company named Symbian Ltd with the telecommunications corporations Nokia Ericsson and Motorola By buying into the new firm the telecommunications corporations each acquired a stake in Psion s EPOC operating system and other intellectual property Symbian Ltd changed the name of EPOC EPOC to Symbian OS which debuted in November on the Nokia Communicator smartphone br br br EPOC br br EPOC was developed at Psion a software and mobile device company founded in London in The company released its first pocket computer in an bit device named the Psion Organiser In they released a series of improved models under the Organiser II brand but the bit era was ending Psion saw a need to develop a bit operating system to drive their next generation of devices First however they needed to engineer a bit single board computer something that was extremely difficult at the time They codenamed the project SIBO for single board organiser or sixteen bit organiser To develop the SIBO hardware and software they needed samples of the bit microprocessors they would be programming but it took more than a year to secure the chips which caused a significant delay br By development of EPOC was underway It was a single user preemptive multitasking operating system designed to run in read only memory ROM The operating system and its programmes were written in Intel assembly language and C When the operating system started it opened the pre installed programmes in advance so that the system could switch between them quickly To enable users to write and run their own programmes EPOC featured an updated version of the Open Programming Language OPL which was first published with the Psion Organiser OPL was a simple interpreted language somewhat like BASIC br In Psion released the first bit computers to be equipped with the new operating system the MC and MC notebooks Each of these had an Intel C processor but differed in some other specifications such as memory capacity Among the later SIBO devices were the Psion Series A C Workabout series and the Siena K model The final EPOC device was the Psion Series mx br The user interface differed by device The notebook computers had a windows icons menus pointer WIMP graphical user interface GUI The handheld computers which had smaller screens and no pointing device accept input from a keyboard or a stylus On screen programmes were represented by icons but on smaller devices a user could also access them via specialised buttons br br br EPOC br In parallel with the production of their bit devices Psion had been developing a bit version of EPOC since late The move to bits was necessary to remain competitive and Psion wanted to have a mobile operating system they could license to other companies Thus the system needed to be more portable than their prior systems br For the bit operating system the engineers wrote a new object oriented codebase in C During the transition period the old system came to be called EPOC and new one EPOC Where EPOC was designed specifically for the Intel platform EPOC was built for ARM a computing platform called a reduced instruction set computer RISC which instruction set architecture is smaller and of more uniform length than in an alternative complex instruction set computer CISC Like EPOC EPOC was a single user pre emptive multitasking operating system It also featured memory protection which was an essential feature for modern operating systems br Psion licensed EPOC to other device manufacturers and made it possible for manufacturers to change or replace the system s GUI Because of the licensing arrangement Psion considered spinning off their software division as Psion Software Psion s own PDAs had a GUI named Eikon Visually Eikon was a refinement of design choices from Psion s and bit devices br br br Releases br br Early iterations of the EPOC were codenamed Protea The first published version called Release appeared on the Psion Series ROM v in June Release was never published but an updated ROM version for the Series featured Release The Series used Psion s new user interface Eikon br One of the first EPOC licensees was a short lived company named Geofox they halted production after selling fewer than units Another licensee Oregon Scientific released a budget device named Osaris it was the only EPOC device to ship with Release br br br Release br br EPOC Release premiered in March It ran on ARMv processors such as the StrongARM series In addition to its email messaging and data synchronisation features it introduced support for the Java Development Kit which made it capable of running a wider variety of programmes br In EPOC s GUI variations were replaced with three reference interfaces Crystal was for devices with a small keyboard Quartz was for communicator devices which had some telecommunication features and tended to be equipped with a thumb keyboard and Pearl was for mobile phones Each classification supported VGA graphics br Psion deployed Release on their mx series Revo netBook Series Revo Plus and netPad devices Ericsson rebranded the Psion Series mx as the MC and SONICblue rebranded the Revo as the Diamond Mako like the original devices the rebranded versions were released in br The Ericsson R smartphone released in November was the first device to be distributed with EPOC Release This release was also known as ER u the u indicated that the system supported the Unicode system of text encoding an important feature for the representation of diverse languages Psion developed an ER u enabled device codenamed Conan but it did not advance beyond the prototype stage The device was intended to be a Bluetooth enabled successor to the Revo br br br Symbian br br In June Psion Software became Symbian Ltd a major joint venture between Psion and phone manufacturers Ericsson Motorola and Nokia The next release of EPOC Release was rebranded Symbian OS It decoupled the user interface from the underlying operating system which afforded device manufacturers the ability or burden of implementing a graphical interface on their devices br The final version of Symbian OS to be released was v the final update was published in br br br br br br External links br Symbian on SourceForge br Wichary Marcin EPOC R on Psion Revo GUIdebook Retrieved August
