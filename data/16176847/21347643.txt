id: 21347643
Mac operating systems were developed by Apple Inc in a succession of two major series br In Apple debuted the operating system that is now known as the classic Mac OS with its release of the original Macintosh System Software The system rebranded Mac OS in was pre installed on every Macintosh until and offered on Macintosh clones shortly in the s It was noted for its ease of use and also criticized for its lack of modern technologies compared to its competitors br The current Mac operating system is macOS originally named Mac OS X until and then OS X until It was developed between and after Apple s purchase of NeXT It brought an entirely new architecture based on NeXTSTEP a Unix system that eliminated many of the technical challenges that the classic Mac OS faced such as problems with memory management The current macOS is pre installed with every Mac and receives a major update annually It is the basis of Apple s current system software for its other devices iOS iPadOS watchOS and tvOS br Prior to the introduction of Mac OS X Apple experimented with several other concepts releasing different products designed to bring the Macintosh interface or applications to Unix like systems or vice versa A UX MAE and MkLinux Apple s effort to expand upon and develop a replacement for its classic Mac OS in the s led to a few cancelled projects code named Star Trek Taligent and Copland br Although the classic Mac OS and macOS Mac OS X have different architectures they share a common set of GUI principles including a menu bar across the top of the screen the Finder shell featuring a desktop metaphor that represents files and applications using icons and relates concepts like directories and file deletion to real world objects like folders and a trash can and overlapping windows for multitasking br Before the arrival of the Macintosh in Apple s history of operating systems began with its Apple II series computers in which run Apple DOS ProDOS and GS OS the Apple III in runs Apple SOS and the Lisa in which runs Lisa OS and later MacWorks XL a Macintosh emulator Apple developed the Newton OS for its Newton personal digital assistant from to br Apple launched several new operating systems based on the core of macOS including iOS in for its iPhone iPad and iPod Touch mobile devices and in for its HomePod smart speakers watchOS in for the Apple Watch and tvOS in for the Apple TV set top box br br br Classic Mac OS br br The classic Mac OS is the original Macintosh operating system introduced in alongside the first Macintosh and remained in primary use on Macs until Mac OS X in br Apple released the original Macintosh on January its early system software is partially based on Lisa OS and inspired by the Alto computer which former Apple CEO Steve Jobs previewed at Xerox PARC It was originally named System Software or simply System Apple rebranded it as Mac OS in due in part to its Macintosh clone program that ended one year later br Classic Mac OS is characterized by its monolithic design Initial versions of the System Software run one application at a time System introduced cooperative multitasking System supports bit memory addressing and virtual memory allowing larger programs Later updates to the System enable the transition to the PowerPC architecture The system was considered user friendly but its architectural limitations were critiqued such as limited memory management lack of protected memory and access controls and susceptibility to conflicts among extensions br br br Releases br br Nine major versions of the classic Mac OS were released The name Classic that now signifies the system as a whole is a reference to a compatibility layer that helped ease the transition to Mac OS X br br Macintosh System

major version released in br br br Mac OS X OS X and macOS br br The system was launched as Mac OS X renamed OS X from and then renamed macOS as the current Mac operating system that officially succeeded the classic Mac OS in br The system was originally marketed as simply version of Mac OS but it has a history that is largely independent of the classic Mac OS It is a Unix based operating system built on NeXTSTEP and other NeXT technology from the late s until early when Apple purchased the company and its CEO Steve Jobs returned to Apple Precursors to Mac OS X include OPENSTEP Apple s Rhapsody project and the Mac OS X Public Beta br macOS is based on Apple s open source Darwin operating system which is based on the XNU kernel and BSD br macOS is the basis for some of Apple s other operating systems including iPhone OS iOS iPadOS watchOS tvOS and visionOS br br br Releases br br br Desktop br The first version of the system was released on March supporting the Aqua user interface Since then several more versions adding newer features and technologies have been released Since new releases have been offered annually br br Mac OS X codenamed Cheetah released Saturday

was released in as a technology preview It was followed by several more official server based releases Server functionality has instead been offered as an add on for the desktop system since br br Mac OS X Server code named Hera released in br Mac OS X Server later called OS X Server and macOS Server released between and br br br Other projects br br br Shipped br br br A ROSE br br The Apple Real time Operating System Environment A ROSE is a small embedded operating system which runs on the Macintosh Coprocessor Platform an expansion card for the Macintosh It is a single overdesigned hardware platform on which third party vendors build practically any product reducing the otherwise heavy workload of developing a NuBus based expansion card The first version of the system was ready for use in February br br br A UX br br In Apple released its first UNIX based OS A UX which is a UNIX operating system with the Mac OS look and feel It was not very competitive for its time due in part to the crowded UNIX market and Macintosh hardware lacking high end design features present on workstation class computers Most of its sales was to the U S government where MacOS lacks POSIX compliance br br br MAE br br The Macintosh Application Environment MAE is a software package introduced by Apple in that allows certain Unix based computer workstations to run Macintosh applications MAE uses the X Window System to emulate a Macintosh Finder style graphical user interface The last version MAE is compatible with System MAE was published for Sun Microsystems SPARCstation and Hewlett Packard systems It was discontinued on May br br br MkLinux br br Announced at the Worldwide Developers Conference WWDC MkLinux is an open source operating system that was started by the OSF Research Institute and Apple in February to port Linux to the PowerPC platform and thus Macintosh computers In mid the community led MkLinux Developers Association took over development of the operating system MkLinux is short for Microkernel Linux which refers to its adaptation of the monolithic Linux kernel to run as a server hosted atop the Mach microkernel version br br br Cancelled projects br br br Star Trek br br The Star Trek project as in to boldly go where no Mac has gone before was a secret prototype beginning in to port the classic Mac OS to Intel compatible x personal computers In partnership with Apple and with support from Intel the project was instigated by Novell which was looking to integrate its DR DOS with the Mac OS GUI as a mutual response to the monopoly of Microsoft s Windows and MS DOS A team consisting of four from Apple and four from Novell was got the Macintosh Finder and some basic applications such as QuickTime running smoothly The project was canceled one year later in early but was partially reused when porting the Mac OS to PowerPC br br br Taligent br br Taligent a portmanteau of talent and intelligent is an object oriented operating system and the company producing it Started as the Pink project within Apple to provide a replacement for the classic Mac OS it was later spun off into a joint venture with IBM as part of the AIM alliance with the purpose of building a competing platform to Microsoft Cairo and NeXTSTEP The development process never worked and has been cited as an example of a project death march Apple pulled out of the project in before the code had been delivered br br br Copland br br Copland was a project at Apple to create an updated version of the classic Mac OS It was to have introduced protected memory preemptive multitasking and new underlying operating system features yet still be compatible with existing Mac software They originally planned the follow up release Gershwin to add multithreading and other advanced features New features were added more rapidly than they could be completed and the completion date slipped into the future with no sign of a release In Apple canceled the project outright and sought a suitable third party replacement Copland development ended in August and in December Apple announced that it was buying NeXT for its NeXTSTEP operating system br br br Timeline br br br See
