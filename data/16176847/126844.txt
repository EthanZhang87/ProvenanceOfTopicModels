title: Internationalization and localization
id: 126844
In computing internationalization and localization American or internationalisation and localisation British often abbreviated i n and l n respectively are means of adapting computer software to different languages regional peculiarities and technical requirements of a target locale br Internationalization is the process of designing a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes Localization is the process of adapting internationalized software for a specific region or language by translating text and adding locale specific components br Localization which is potentially performed multiple times for different locales uses the infrastructure or flexibility provided by internationalization which is ideally performed only once before localization or as an integral part of ongoing development br br br Naming br The terms are frequently abbreviated to the numeronyms i n where stands for the number of letters between the first i and the last n in the word internationalization a usage coined at Digital Equipment Corporation in the s or s and l n for localization due to the length of the words Some writers have the latter term capitalized L n to help distinguish the two br Some companies like IBM and Oracle use the term globalization g n for the combination of internationalization and localization br Microsoft defines internationalization as a combination of world readiness and localization World readiness is a developer task which enables a product to be used with multiple scripts and cultures globalization and separates user interface resources in a localizable format localizability abbreviated to L y br Hewlett Packard and HP UX created a system called National Language Support or Native Language Support NLS to produce localizable software br Some vendors including IBM use the term National Language Version NLV for localized versions of software products supporting only one specific locale The term implies the existence of other alike NLV versions of the software for different markets this terminology is not used where no internationalization and localization was undertaken and a software product only supports one language and locale in any version br br br Scope br br According to Software without frontiers the design aspects to consider when internationalizing a product are data encoding data and documentation software construction hardware device support and user interaction while the key design areas to consider when making a fully internationalized product from scratch are user interaction algorithm design and data formats software services and documentation br Translation is typically the most time consuming component of language localization This may involve br br For film video and audio translation of spoken words or music lyrics often using either dubbing or subtitles br Text translation for printed materials and digital media possibly including error messages and documentation br Potentially altering images and logos containing text to contain translations or generic icons br Different translation lengths and differences in character sizes e g between Latin alphabet letters and Chinese characters can cause layouts that work well in one language to work poorly in others br Consideration of differences in dialect register or variety br Writing conventions like br Formatting of numbers especially decimal separator and digit grouping br Date and time format possibly including the use of different calendars e g the Islamic or the Japanese calendar br br br Standard locale data br Computer software can encounter differences above and beyond straightforward translation of words and phrases because computer programs can generate content dynamically These differences may need to be taken into account by the internationalization process in preparation for translation Many of these differences are so regular that a conversion between languages can be easily automated The Common Locale Data Repository by Unicode provides a collection of such differences Its data is used by major operating systems including Microsoft Windows macOS and Debian and by major Internet companies or projects such as Google and the Wikimedia Foundation Examples of such differences include br br Different scripts in different writing systems use different characters a different set of letters syllograms logograms or symbols Modern systems use the Unicode standard to represent many different languages with a single character encoding br Writing direction is left to right in most European languages right to left in Hebrew and Arabic or both in boustrophedon scripts and optionally vertical in some Asian languages br Complex text layout for languages where characters change shape depending on context br Capitalization exists in some scripts and not in others br Different languages and writing systems have different text sorting rules br Different languages have different numeral systems which might need to be supported if Western Arabic numerals are not used br Different languages have different pluralization rules which can complicate programs that dynamically display numerical content Other grammar rules might also vary e g genitive br Different languages use different punctuation e g quoting text using double quotes as in English or guillemets as in French br Keyboard shortcuts can only make use of buttons on the keyboard layout which is being localized for If a shortcut corresponds to a word in a particular language e g Ctrl s stands for save in English it may need to be changed br br br National conventions br Different countries have different economic conventions including variations in br br Paper sizes br Broadcast television systems and popular storage media br Telephone number formats br Postal address formats postal codes and choice of delivery services br Currency symbols positions of currency markers and reasonable amounts due to different inflation histories ISO codes are often used for internationalization br System of measurement br Battery sizes br Voltage and current standards br In particular the United States and Europe differ in most of these cases Other areas often follow one of these br Specific third party services such as online maps weather reports or payment service providers might not be available worldwide from the same carriers or at all br Time zones vary across the world and this must be taken into account if a product originally only interacted with people in a single time zone For internationalization UTC is often used internally and then converted into a local time zone for display purposes br Different countries have different legal requirements meaning for example br br Regulatory compliance may require customization for a particular jurisdiction or a change to the product as a whole such as br Privacy law compliance br Additional disclaimers on a website or packaging br Different consumer labelling requirements br Compliance with export restrictions and regulations on encryption br Compliance with an Internet censorship regime or subpoena procedures br Requirements for accessibility br Collecting different taxes such as sales tax value added tax or customs duties br Sensitivity to different political issues like geographical naming disputes and disputed borders shown on maps e g India has proposed a bill that would make failing to show Kashmir and other areas as intended by the government a crime br Government assigned numbers have different formats such as passports Social Security Numbers and other national identification numbers br Localization also may take into account differences in culture such as br br Local holidays br Personal name and title conventions br Aesthetics br Comprehensibility and cultural appropriateness of images and color symbolism br Ethnicity clothing and socioeconomic status of people and architecture of locations pictured br Local customs and conventions such as social taboos popular local religions or superstitions such as blood types in Japanese culture vs astrological signs in other cultures br br br Business process for internationalizing software br To internationalize a product it is important to look at a variety of markets that the product will foreseeably enter Details such as field length for street addresses unique format for the address ability to make the postal code field optional to address countries that do not have postal codes or the state field for countries that do not have states plus the introduction of new registration flows that adhere to local laws are just some of the examples that make internationalization a complex project A broader approach takes into account cultural factors regarding for example the adaptation of the business process logic or the inclusion of individual cultural behavioral aspects br Already in the s companies such as Bull used machine translation Systran on a large scale for all their translation activity human translators handled pre editing making the input machine readable and post editing br br br Engineering br Both in re engineering an existing software or designing a new internationalized software the first step of internationalization is to split each potentially locale dependent part whether code text or data into a separate module Each module can then either rely on a standard library dependency or be independently replaced as needed for each locale br The current prevailing practice is for applications to place text in resource files which are loaded during program execution as needed These strings stored in resource files are relatively easy to translate Programs are often built to reference resource libraries depending on the selected locale data br The storage for translatable and translated strings is sometimes called a message catalog as the strings are called messages The catalog generally comprises a set of files in a specific localization format and a standard library to handle said format One software library and format that aids this is gettext br Thus to get an application to support multiple languages one would design the application to select the relevant language resource file at runtime The code required to manage data entry verification and many other locale sensitive data types also must support differing locale requirements Modern development systems and operating systems include sophisticated libraries for international support of these types see also Standard locale data above br Many localization issues e g writing direction text sorting require more profound changes in the software than text translation For example OpenOffice org achieves this with compilation switches br br br Process br A globalization method includes after planning three implementation steps internationalization localization and quality assurance br To some degree e g for quality assurance development teams include someone who handles the basic central stages of the process which then enables all the others Such persons typically understand foreign languages and cultures and have some technical background Specialized technical writers are required to construct a culturally appropriate syntax for potentially complicated concepts coupled with engineering resources to deploy and test the localization elements br Once properly internationalized software can rely on more decentralized models for localization free and open source software usually rely on self localization by end users and volunteers sometimes organized in teams The GNOME project for example has volunteer translation teams for over languages MediaWiki supports over languages of which are mostly complete as of September br When translating existing text to other languages it is difficult to maintain the parallel versions of texts throughout the life of the product For instance if a message displayed to the user is modified all of the translated versions must be changed br br br Commercial considerations br In a commercial setting the benefit of localization is access to more markets In the early s Lotus took two years to separate program code and text and lost the market lead in Europe over Microsoft Multiplan MicroPro found that using an Austrian translator for the West German market caused its WordStar documentation to an executive said not have the tone it should have had br However there are considerable costs involved which go far beyond engineering Further business operations must adapt to manage the production storage and distribution of multiple discrete localized products which are often being sold in completely different currencies regulatory environments and tax regimes br Finally sales marketing and technical support must also facilitate their operations in the new languages to support customers for the localized products Particularly for relatively small language populations it may never be economically viable to offer a localized product Even where large language populations could justify localization for a given product and a product s internal structure already permits localization a given software developer or publisher may lack the size and sophistication to manage the ancillary functions associated with operating in multiple locales br br br See also br Subcomponents and standards br Bidirectional script support br
