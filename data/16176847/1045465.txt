OMA SpecWorks previously the Open Mobile Alliance OMA is a standards organization which develops open international technical standards for the mobile phone industry It is a nonprofit Non governmental organization NGO not a formal government sponsored standards organization as is the International Telecommunication Union ITU a forum for industry stakeholders to agree on common specifications for products and services br br br History br The OMA was created in June as an answer to the proliferation of industry forums each dealing with a few application protocols WAP Forum focused on browsing and device provisioning protocols the Wireless Village focused on instant messaging and presence The SyncML Initiative focused on data synchronization the Location Interoperability Forum the Mobile Games Interoperability Forum and the Mobile Wireless Internet Forum Each of these forums had its bylaws its decision taking procedures its release schedules and in some instances there was some overlap in the specifications causing duplication of work br Members include traditional wireless industry players such as equipment and mobile systems manufacturers Ericsson ZTE Nokia Qualcomm Rohde Schwarz and mobile operators AT T NTT Docomo Orange T Mobile Verizon and also software vendors Gemalto Mavenir and others br In March it merged with the IPSO Alliance to form OMA SpecWorks br Related standards bodies include rd Generation Partnership Project GPP rd Generation Partnership Project GPP Internet Engineering Task Force IETF and the World Wide Web Consortium W C br Its mission is to provide Interoperability of services across countries operators and mobile terminals br The OMA only standardises applicative protocols OMA specifications are intended to work with any cellular network technologies being used to provide networking and data transport These networking technology are specified by outside parties In particular OMA specifications for a given function are the same with either GSM UMTS or CDMA networks br Adherence to the standards is entirely voluntary the OMA does not have a mandative role br OMA members that own intellectual property rights e g patents on technologies that are essential to realizing a specification agree in advance to provide licenses to their technology on fair reasonable and non discriminatory licensing terms to other members br OMA is incorporated in California United States br br br Standard specifications br The OMA maintains many specifications including br br Browsing specifications now named Browser and Content formerly
