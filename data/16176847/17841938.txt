MobileMe branded iTools between and Mac until is a discontinued subscription based collection of online services and software offered by Apple Inc All services were gradually transitioned to and eventually replaced by the free iCloud and MobileMe ceased on June with transfers to iCloud being available until July or data being available for download until that date when the site finally closed completely On that date all data was deleted and email addresses of accounts not transferred to iCloud were marked as unused br Originally launched on January as iTools a free collection of Internet based services for Mac OS users Apple relaunched it as Mac on July when it became a paid subscription service primarily designed for Mac OS X users Apple relaunched the service again as MobileMe on July now targeting Mac OS X Microsoft Windows iPhone and iPod Touch users br On February Apple discontinued offering MobileMe at its retail stores and later from resellers New subscriptions were also stopped On October Apple launched iCloud to replace MobileMe for new users with current users having access until June when the service was to cease br br br Services br iTools and Mac were designed primarily to provide Internet services for Mac owners All members of iTools and Mac received a mac com email address showing the services tied to the Mac hardware However with the release of the iPhone G in the renamed service MobileMe began providing Internet services for OS X iOS and Windows Members of MobileMe were given a me com email address though users of the current mac com email address could also continue to use those with both domains being interchangeable with the same email account were also no longer restricted to OS X software such as Mail and iCal and they could access personal data from any computer connected to the Internet using the web interface at me com or a number of supported applications including Microsoft Outlook as long as the user used version or later Apple support for MobileMe was available via chat and telephone the latter restricted to US Canada users only br br br Backup br Backup was a backup utility made by Apple for Mac OS X It was available through Apple s MobileMe formerly Mac collection of Internet services Backup can be used in connection with either a user s online MobileMe iDisk or the Macintosh s CD RW or DVD R drive to make safe archival copies of critical files and folders With the release of iCloud Backup is no longer available and with the release of macOS Sierra it no longer works br The initial versions of Backup were regarded as feature sparse and frequently unstable However on November Apple released Backup which added new features and offered greater reliability than its predecessors br While Backup allowed for the creation of archive copies of important data overall it only had a basic feature set for backup software br Apple introduced Backup at the Paris Expo on September along with other upgrades to Mac This version offered more backup settings such as the ability to back up mail databases br At the Worldwide Developers Conference Apple announced the development of Time Machine a new backup application which is included in Mac OS X v Leopard Time Machine is a complete backup solution thus it has the ability to completely replace Backup as a general backup solution for most Mac users br br br Find My iPhone br br MobileMe allowed users to track the location of their iOS devices via the web portal at me com A user could see the device s approximate location on a map along with a circle showing the radius of inaccuracy display a message and or play a sound on the device even if it is set to silent change the password on the device and remotely erase its contents An app was also released by Apple which allowed users to locate their iPhone from another device running iOS The feature was first announced on June and was included in iOS as a feature for MobileMe users Find My iPhone was made free of charge with the release of iOS software update on November for devices introduced in br br br Storage br MobileMe had two different plans The Individual plan included GB of email and file storage and GB of monthly data transfer The Family Pack plan included GB of storage split among one GB individual primary and four GB sub accounts each sub account having its own email address online storage and being able to use all the MobileMe features Family members also had a Shared folder in their iDisk with which they could share access to data among themselves Both the primary account and sub accounts had read write access to this folder and were limited to the free space available in the primary user s iDisk br Individual plan was priced at Family Pack at br Members could buy additional storage in GB or GB allocations however sub account storage could not be upgraded In a family account the amount of storage is designated per account br Notes from the Mail app on a Mac computer and the Notes app on the iPhone were synced via the MobileMe service however were unable to be viewed or edited online To Do lists controlled from the Mail app and the iCal app on a Mac computer were viewable and editable through the MobileMe website under the Calendar tab but were not viewable or editable on an iPhone With the announcement of iOS the sync for Notes over IMAP including MobileMe was implemented br br br Address book and calendar br MobileMe maintained a synchronized address book and calendar feature using Push functions When a user made a change to a contact or event on one device it was automatically synced to the MobileMe servers and by extension all the user s other devices Supported devices included the iPhone Address Book and iCal on OS X or Microsoft Outlook or later on Microsoft Windows Subscription calendars in iCal on a Mac computer were not viewable on the online MobileMe service although Birthdays was viewable online as it gathered its information from Address Book rather than CalDAV or iCalendar ics subscription calendars Conversely on the iPhone Birthdays from Contacts on the iPhone were not viewable on the Calendar app nor any other method except looking them up individually in Contacts Birthdays Calendar was added on iOS but subscription calendars were available to view in Calendar by adding them through Settings Mail Contacts Calendar Add Account br br br MobileMe Gallery br MobileMe had a public photo and video gallery feature Photos and videos could be uploaded in the web browser at me com synced by iPhoto or Aperture on OS X or uploaded from the iPhone and iPod Touch Users could also upload movies from within applications available on the Mac including iPhoto and iMovie MobileMe also provided the user with an email address that is used only for uploading photos and videos All uploads by viewers of the Gallery either by the iPhone or iPod Touch me com or sent by the dedicated email address were synced back to iPhoto or Aperture Galleries could be made public or private or could be password protected but only through iPhoto or iMovie on OS X br br br iDisk br br MobileMe featured iDisk an online storage repository accessible via a web browser at me com Finder on OS X various apps for iOS devices or as a remote disk in Microsoft Windows It also allowed sharing of files by selecting a given file using me com iDisk or the iDisk iPhone app and then clicking a Share button that generated a unique link to this file protected by password that could then be shared by email Another way to use iDisk to share several files easily was by placing them in the iDisk Public Folder which could also be password protected br br br iWeb Publish br Users of Mac OS X v or later could use the iLife iLife or iLife application iWeb to publish websites hosted on their MobileMe account either to a domain name that they controlled or to a page on the me com website Users without iWeb could also publish websites by placing files to the Web Sites folder in iDisk However the web host didn t support any server side language such as PHP br br br Web applications br MobileMe used Ajax and Dynamic HTML to simulate the look and feel of desktop applications within the user s web browser Applications on me com included Mail Contacts Calendar Gallery Find My iPhone and iDisk access plus an Account section Most of the me com web applications were built on top of the open source SproutCore Javascript framework Users could also configure features such as email aliases or domain names for the iWeb Publish feature br Supported browsers for me com on both Mac and Windows were Safari or later and Firefox or later while Internet Explorer and Internet Explorer were Windows only Safari and Firefox would run the web applications but were not fully supported br MobileMe was accessible from Linux using Firefox despite a warning that would be presented to the user upon entry Success was also reported using the Konqueror browser on Linux however this was not confirmed by Apple br br br iChat AIM br MobileMe users could connect to the AIM service with their mac com or me com accounts MobileMe connections were secured by SSL encryption In addition iChat users using a MobileMe account could encrypt their chats with other MobileMe members using iChat Users could also access the MobileMe Chat account on iOS devices using the free or paid for versions of the AIM app provided by AOL or any other iOS app that supported the AIM protocol br br br PC syncing br Users who wished to sync their MobileMe data with a PC had to download and install Apple s MobileMe Control Panel To install the user first had to download and install the latest version of iTunes and then install MobileMe Control Panel After installation the user signed into the control panel using their username and password and could control sync settings for contacts calendars bookmarks and iDisk settings such as public folder access in a similar manner to the MobileMe preference panel built into Mac OS X br br br MobileMe Mail Beta br The MobileMe Mail Beta was released on May It included many new features such as photo inserting font changing wide screen views and much more It was released as a final version on June br br br MobileMe Calendar Beta br MobileMe Calendar Beta was released on July MobileMe Calendar Beta included a new web application at me com with redesigned day week and month views as well as a new list view to make scanning events easier Performance was also improved It also featured new sharing options that allowed invited users to edit a shared calendar It supported invitations through RSVPs which sent an email to invited persons which they answered by clicking a simple link they didn t have to be MobileMe members It also supported CalDAV standard for compatibility with multiple devices However with these updates came some decreased functionality The capability to publish iCal calendars as publicly viewable web pages was removed Users wishing to view a public calendar had to then manually subscribe with a CalDAV compatible calendar device Compatibility with Microsoft Outlook suffered too since Outlook users could not sync their primary Outlook calendar to a MobileMe calendar anymore the only way to integrate MobileMe with Outlook was then to have a MobileMe calendar linked in through CalDAV This meant that a MobileMe calendar was always seen by Outlook as a secondary calendar and alarms and notifications did not work br br br Pricing br The table below illustrates the pricing structure previous to Apple discontinuing purchases on June as part of the move to iCloud Current users were encouraged to use MobileMe services inside iCloud account migration happening automatically anyway but could continue to use their MobileMe services and access the me com website until it was shut down on June although limited access beyond that date was available to download content Users wishing to cancel MobileMe thus immediately end all services could gain full refunds if purchased within days of June or partial refunds if purchased days or more however it was unclear whether this refund policy applied when the iCloud service launched in Fall br br br Integration br br br Mac OS X br MobileMe like Mac and iTools before it was closely integrated with Mac OS X Having a MobileMe account extended the functions of many programs mostly within the iLife suite Most notably any iDisk could be mounted as any other volume on the Mac OS X desktop Furthermore it was possible to mount the public portion of another user s iDisk This mechanism was one of the early ways to receive free software as part of Mac It was possible to queue files for upload to an offline iDisk though they were only uploaded when the iDisk was mounted iDisk commands were located in the Go menu of the Finder br Additionally any Address Book entries iCal events and to do entries Safari bookmarks and keychains mail accounts mail rules mail signatures and smart mailboxes could be synced with the iDisk allowing easy synchronization between multiple computers iWeb allowed users to create web pages that could be uploaded to iDisk and published iPhoto could be used for one click web publishing of photo albums iCal could be used to publish calendars to the web Also Backup software could be used to make backups to iDisk or local media br With the prior Mac service the iPhoto iMovie GarageBand and iTunes libraries could easily be uploaded to any iDisk subject to various licensing agreements br br br iOS br MobileMe integrated with various applications on iOS devices This included iCal syncing with Calendar Address Book syncing with Contacts Mail syncing across devices Safari Bookmarks syncing across devices Apple later introduced the MobileMe iDisk app on July the MobileMe Gallery app on January and the Find My iPhone app on June that allowed mobile access to the Find My iPhone feature initially only available for MobileMe users later made free to all iOS device users While initially only iPhone and iPod Touch apps following updates they were made universal app compatible for iPhone iPod Touch and iPad In August Apple introduced a feature that allowed users to stream music that s stored on their iDisk in the background from their device br br br URL access points br There were subdirectory private and subdomain public access points to each MobileMe user s individual account functions These provided direct web access to each MobileMe user s account via links to each function directly See list br Private br br www me com user login br www me com gallery user photo video Gallery albums br www me com mail user Mail access br

but the later final iteration of MobileMe removed calendar publishing br br br History br br br iTools br br The original collection of Internet software and services now known as iCloud was first called iTools released on January and made available free of charge for Mac users br Services offered by iTools included the first availability of mac com email addresses which could only be accessed through an email client e g the Mail app iCards a free greeting card service iReview a collection of reviews of popular web sites HomePage a free web page publishing service the first version of iDisk an online data storage system and KidSafe a directory of family friendly web sites br iTools was primarily a Mac only offering and provided only limited discussion board based technical support However some features of iTools were accessible via non Mac platforms although a Mac was required to create an account br For example modifying HomePage content was possible using a web browser on Windows or via Linux br Although the original version of iDisk used AppleShare IP for transport and required Mac OS it was eventually updated to use WebDAV technology and therefore opened up access to non Mac operating systems including Windows XP br br br Mac br br As costs rose most particularly due to iDisk storage space the wide demand for mac com email accounts and increasing support needs iTools was renamed Mac on July as a subscription based suite of services with a dedicated technical support team br Mac offered several tools to subscribers including upgraded versions of HomePage the personal web hosting service iDisk the online disk storage service mac com the email service provider offering both POP and IMAP protocols and iCards the online greeting card service New services offered by Mac included Backup a personal backup solution that allowed users to archive data to their iDisk CD or DVD and McAfee Virex a virus scanner given to Mac subscribers until June br Apple announced on September that more than people had subscribed to Mac since its launch earlier that year Existing iTools accounts were transitioned to Mac accounts during a free trial period that ended on September This move generated a mixed reaction among Mac users some believing Mac was overpriced br Mac occasionally received new features In October Apple launched an update to its Mac Mail service whose interface was close to that of Mac OS X Mail The new functionality was built on top of Ajax and provided drag and drop a live updating three way split view and the ability to resize panels Mac OS X v Leopard used Mac to provide dynamic DNS services for its Back to My Mac feature a remote desktop service br On August Apple s CEO Steve Jobs announced new features for Mac including a new Web Gallery feature similar to a combination of the features of Flickr and YouTube Each Mac account now came with GB of storage space that could be divided between email storage for an mac com email address and the user s iDisk An account preference allowed the user to decide how much storage space to allocate to either service as they see fit Users who wanted additional storage capacity could buy up to a total of GB for a higher annual fee The storage space for both email and an iDisk could be used in any way the user wanted subject to the terms of the Mac license agreement br Mac was also offered in a boxed version available at stores and online as a physical product The box contained an activation code that was entered when registering or renewing a subscription br br br MobileMe br Initial speculation about a new service to replace Mac came in early June when Apple bought the me com domain name On June Apple announced that Mac would be replaced by MobileMe which was launched on July mac com was taken offline from to that day and the MobileMe service went live between and both Pacific Time MobileMe was taken offline a short time later leaving customers redirected to the MobileMe information page where there was no option to log in After several hours of infrequent service MobileMe officially went live during July br Several Mac features were removed after the transition to MobileMe br br Support for Mac OS X or earlier some features require Mac OS X or later such as iLife integration br iCards br Web access to bookmarks br Mac slides br Mac Groups with files uploaded to Groups being transferred to group owners Group Archive folder br The launch of MobileMe was plagued by various issues MobileMe as a Mac successor was initially criticized during its launch for being unstable and for having syncing problems There were reports of users being unable to access any of the Mail functions of MobileMe This was suspected to be related to the Mac to MobileMe switch over The free trial of MobileMe inadvertently charged some Australian and European customers credit cards leading Apple to issue refunds and extend the free trial to four months Because of the problems with switching over Mac accounts and other issues Apple created a status news page and revamped their support page br Initial versions of the Windows MobileMe Control Panel allowed synchronization of corporate Outlook accounts with MobileMe A mid update to the Control Panel removed the ability to synchronize Outlook to MobileMe when Outlook is using Microsoft Exchange Server Calendars and Contacts According to Apple Support this is by design and is not a bug that will be fixed There was no support for synchronizing even standalone Outlook Tasks and Notes to MobileMe br In May Fortune magazine reported that during the summer of after MobileMe had launched to mostly negative reviews Apple s CEO Steve Jobs summoned the MobileMe team to a meeting in the Town Hall auditorium at Infinite Loop After asking them what MobileMe is supposed to do when someone answered Jobs reportedly shot back So why the fuck doesn t it do that br In an internal email sent to Apple employees on August Jobs admitted that MobileMe was launched too hurriedly and not up to Apple s standards He wrote that it was a mistake to launch MobileMe at the same time as iPhone G iPhone software and the App Store On August it was announced that MobileMe subscribers would be offered a day extension in addition to the one month extension previously offered br br br iCloud br br From early onwards MobileMe retail boxes began being removed entirely from sale at all Apple Stores with stock slowly being discontinued from other stores and from June users were prevented from subscribing or renewing to the MobileMe service via Apple s website On June at WWDC iCloud s release was announced for sometime in fall entirely replacing the MobileMe service which would be discontinued however both would continue to be run concurrently for current MobileMe subscribers through June Because of MobileMe s perceived public failings Steve Jobs anticipated skepticism to his claim that iCloud just works and asked rhetorically Why should I believe them They re the ones that brought me MobileMe br On October alongside the release of iOS and iPhone S iCloud was released to new users with current MobileMe subscribers being able to move over to iCloud either immediately or anytime before June when MobileMe would be permanently discontinued except for limited download abilities In addition to MobileMe s email and calendar services iCloud syncs files across multiple devices As promised at WWDC Apple began the service during fall giving every user of either or both iOS or Mac OS X Lion GB of cloud data storage for the basic service free at the point of usage with additional paid for tiers for more data storage also being available me com was retained as the default email domain address for new iCloud users A year later around fall Apple started to sign up new users to free icloud com email addresses with previous me com users also able to continue using that email domain concurrently as done on previous service changes br br br Discontinuation br As a first step Apple sent days left emails to all existing users of MobileMe on June which they then followed with days left emails on June advising users Download your photos and files MobileMe ends June Remember to download your Gallery photos iDisk files and move your iWeb sites before that date br Then as previously advertised by Apple following the announcement of iCloud a year earlier the main MobileMe service was discontinued on June as most services were moved to iCloud and users were expected to have moved themselves over to the new service already by then given they had a year s notice to do so One exception was for MobileMe s Gallery and iDisk services which still had limited downloading abilities remaining with the online portal showing the banners MobileMe has ended with either You can still download your files for a limited time on the iDisk page or Download your photos now on the Gallery page The complete shut down of MobileMe occurred on July with a MobileMe is closed banner showing on the homepage and a redirect link to iCloud br The iOS apps for Gallery and iDisk also ceased operating from June MobileMe was later removed from the System Preferences in OS X on release of OS X Mountain Lion on July br br br
