MontaVista Software is a company that develops embedded Linux system software development tools and related software Its products are made for other corporations developing embedded systems such as automotive electronics communications equipment mobile phones and other electronic devices and infrastructure br MontaVista is based in Santa Clara California and was founded in by James Jim Ready formerly at Mentor Graphics and creator of Versatile Real Time Executive VRTX and others On November Cavium Networks announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to purchase MontaVista for million After Cavium got acquired by Marvell Montavista operated as an independent entity br br br Products br br br Linux br May MontaVista announced MontaVista Linux MVL comprising Market Specific Distributions MontaVista Integration Platform Software Development Kit MontaVista Zone Content Server and support and services There are several differences between MVL and prior MontaVista Linux products The main ones are br br Market Specific Distributions MSD Linux operating systems kernel userland optimized for each specific semiconductor vendor s hardware br MontaVista Integration Platform based on BitBake analogous to make which analyzes a set of directives and then builds a task dependency tree to satisfy a user command BitBake then executes the defined tasks to completion br MontaVista Zone Content Server accessed from behind a proxy server or local web mirror for offline operations to fetch software and updates Rather than depending on a mix of public HTTP Concurrent Versions System CVS Git and Subversion servers across the Internet there is one source for each original source archive and patch br MontaVista Linux formerly named Hard Hat Linux is a Linux distribution that has been enhanced to become a full real time operating system The work on real time performance has since continued to a point where MontaVista claims to support hard real time tasks on embedded Linux as of MontaVista Linux with response times as fast as other real time operating systems br MontaVista sells subscriptions which consist of software documentation and technical support The software includes a Linux kernel and toolchain aimed at a specific hardware configuration collectively called a Linux Support Package LSP and other integrated tools including the Eclipse based DevRocket integrated development environment IDE The distribution is available in three editions each aimed at different market segments Professional Edition Carrier Grade Edition and Mobilinux The MontaVista Linux toolkit includes specific code libraries to easily migrate from Wind River Systems VxWorks and the pSOS operating systems br br br OpenCGX br Project OpenCGX is an open and free to use embedded Linux distribution from MontaVista Software LLC OpenCGX is based on MontaVista s eleventh generation Carrier Grade Linux Engineers can quickly jumpstart their ARM and x development with a full embedded Linux distribution that is easily customizable OpenCGX in its introduction is based on Yocto with Linux Kernel or latest LTS kernel and GNU toolchain br br br Carrier Grade eXpress CGX br As a cornerstone in MontaVista s product lineup Carrier Grade eXpress CGX is a robust operating system equipped with Carrier Grade Linux CGL specifications ensuring unparalleled performance and security for a wide array of interconnected smart applications across industries br MontaVista Linux CGX the th generation of MontaVista s Carrier Grade Linux is built on the foundation of the Yocto Project LTS release and the Linux kernel LTS With the GCC and CLANG toolchain MontaVista CGX provides a commercially supported Linux distribution for creating diverse embedded products on major CPU architectures including x ARM PPC MIPS and RISC V br br br Carrier Grade Edition br MontaVista Linux Carrier Grade Edition CGE is a commercial grade Linux development platform for developers working with reliability availability and serviceability RAS managed hardware Hardware Platform Interface HPI Intelligent Platform Management Interface IPMI or custom hardware who need long term support and high availability br Carrier Grade Linux is governed by the Linux Foundation CGL working group br br br DevRocket br MontaVista DevRocket is a set of Eclipse plug ins for facilitating application and system development with MontaVista Linux DevRocket integrated development environment IDE runs on Linux Solaris and Windows It uses the Eclipse C Development Toolkit CDT Starting with DevRocket users can add MontaVista s plug ins into an existing Eclipse installation or install Eclipse with the plugins already loaded br DevRocket is available in two varieties a Platform Developer Kit PDK and Application Developer Kit ADK The Platform Developer Kit includes the ability to communicate with a target RSE SSH create and manage file systems debugging kgdb and performance tuning memory leak memory use system profiling The application developer kit includes a virtual target for developing applications earlier in the development cycle one click edit compile debug and performance tuning br br br Services br br br Custom Hardware Enablement br br br RTOS Legacy Migration br br br System Certification br MontaVista Linux is being used in applications within IT and telecom that need to be certified according to Common Criteria up to EAL level Evaluation Assurance Level EAL is commonly used to secure connectivity in critical environments such as fire and police departments or aviation and industry control systems With the help of EAL these critical environments can for example ensure secure and safe phone calls control communication in flight and for the assembly line and achieve secure internet access br br br Legacy products br Several legacy products are available from MontaVista under long term support agreements br br br Mobilinux br MontaVista Mobilinux is for wireless handsets and other mobile devices such as Global Positioning System GPS devices portable medical devices and wireless POS terminals Mobilinux s key features include dynamic power management real time performance fast booting and small memory footprint br br br Professional Edition br MontaVista Professional Edition Pro is for general embedded Linux developers Pro is for intelligent device markets including networking and communications instrumentation and control aerospace and defense small office home office SOHO devices and medical devices Future development of MontaVista Pro has been folded into MontaVista Linux effectively ending this as a separate edition starting version br br br Open source contributions br MontaVista has a history of being a major contributor to the Linux kernel and the open source community From the start Jim Ready said he wanted to make it pure Linux under the GPL The core changes to make MontaVista Linux into a real time operating system were made by Nigel Gamble and later updated by Robert Love Robert Love submitted the changes to the Linux kernel in The Linux stable kernel series is the first to include similar features such as priority based preemption As of MontaVista had contributed of the Linux kernel making it the th largest corporate contributor to the Linux kernel according to a survey by the Linux Foundation br MontaVista has also spun off independent open source projects based on several of its features including dynamic power management high resolution POSIX timers the pramfs file system and the openais implementation of the Service Availability Forum s SA Forum Application Interface Specification br br br Distribution br br Other versions of MontaVista Linux are used in devices made by a number of partners including Sony Bravia TVs NEC routers and others especially in Japan A version of MontaVista Linux OS is used in Dell Latitude E and E notebooks to provide the Latitude ON feature br Cisco NX OS is based on HardHat Linux br br br Mobile phones br Motorola became the first company to use Linux on a mobile phone when it released the Motorola A to the Chinese market on February Motorola chose to use MontaVista Linux in the Motorola A and future Linux based phones despite the fact that Motorola was a founding member of the competing Symbian OS Since then Motorola has increased focus on its Linux platform and publicly stated that the future platform for all its mid and high tier mobile phones will be Linux with Java and other phone manufacturers NEC and Panasonic have developed a common platform based on MontaVista Linux br br br See also br Green Hills Software br LynuxWorks br Versatile Real Time Executive VRTX br TimeSys br Cavium Networks br
