The iPhone is a smartphone that was designed developed and marketed by Apple Inc It is the fourth generation of the iPhone lineup succeeding the iPhone GS and preceding the iPhone s Following a number of notable leaks the iPhone was first unveiled on June at Apple s Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco and was released on June in the United States United Kingdom France Germany and Japan The iPhone introduced a new hardware design to the iPhone family which Apple s CEO Steve Jobs touted as the thinnest smartphone in the world at the time it consisted of a stainless steel frame which doubled as an antenna with internal components situated between two panels of aluminosilicate glass The iPhone introduced Apple s new high resolution Retina Display with a pixel density of pixels per inch while maintaining the same physical size and aspect ratio as its precursors Apple s A system on chip along with iOS which notably introduced multitasking functionality and app folders It was the first iPhone at the time to include a front facing camera which made possible Apple s new FaceTime video chat service and the first to be released in a version for CDMA networks ending AT T s period as the exclusive carrier of iPhone products in the United States br The iPhone received a largely positive reception with critics praising its revamped design and more powerful hardware in comparison to previous models While it was a market success with over pre orders within hours the release of the iPhone was plagued by highly publicized reports concerning abnormalities in its new antenna design that caused the device to lose its cellular signal if held in a certain way Most direct contact with the phone s outer edge would cause a significant decrease in signal strength Apple released iOS to try to fix these issues but were unsuccessful br The iPhone spent the longest time as Apple s flagship iPhone model at fifteen months Although the succeeding S was announced in October the continued to be sold as a midrange model until September and thereafter as the entry level offering in Apple s lineup until September with the announcement of the iPhone s and iPhone c The iPhone had one of the longest lifespans of any iPhone ever produced spanning close to four years and available in some developing countries until early br br br History br br br Prototypes br Before the official unveiling of the iPhone on June two prototypes were brought to the attention of the media breaching Apple s normally secretive development process Many of the speculations regarding technical specifications proved accurate br br br Engadget leak br On January gadget website Engadget received leaked images of the unreleased first generation iPad Unbeknownst to the editors and readers these images contained two unreleased iPhone models It wasn t until the subsequent Gizmodo release that they were aware of the complete contents of the images br br br Gizmodo leak br On April gadget website Gizmodo reported that they had purchased an iPhone prototype for and furthermore had conducted a product teardown of the device The prototype was reported to have been lost by an Apple employee Gray Powell in Redwood City California Shortly after Gizmodo published detailed information about the prototype Apple s legal associates formally requested for the phone to be returned to Apple and Gizmodo responded with the intent to cooperate br On April officers from the Rapid Enforcement Allied Computer Team REACT task force of the California HTTAP Program raided the home of Jason Chen the Gizmodo editor responsible for reviewing the prototype seizing all of his computers and hard drives The Electronic Frontier Foundation criticized the raid as violating journalist source protection laws that forbid the seizure of journalist computers as well as the suspicion that Apple had used its influence as a member of the steering committee which is charged with direction and oversight of the California REACT task force to push police into action in a way that would not normally be conducted for this type of incident Apple had already received the iPhone prototype before the raid when it was returned by Gizmodo The District Attorney stated that the investigation was suspended and discontinued searching through the Gizmodo editor s belongings as they determine whether the shield laws are applicable and cautioned that no charges have been issued at this point br br br Taoviet leak br Pictures and video of a second prototype were published on a Vietnamese website Taoviet on May It was almost identical to the first and used an A chip manufactured by Apple The website purchased the prototype for DigiTimes reported that the screen resolution of the new phone was by which was confirmed by Apple at the iPhone s official announcement br br br Release br br The iPhone was available for pre order on June Customers attempting to pre order the iPhone reported problems with the pre order process on the US and UK online Apple Stores which crashed due to the surge in traffic The same issue was reported with AT T and SoftBank Apple s exclusive partners in the United States and Japan respectively who suspended advance sales of the iPhone as demand threatened to exceed supply Retail stores were also unable to complete pre order transactions due to the servers crashing br Apple and its partner carriers received pre orders for the iPhone in the first hours the largest number of pre orders Apple had received in a single day for any device up to that point Engadget reported that at UTC all iPhone pre order suppliers had sold out million iPhone models were sold in its first three days of availability br The iPhone was also released through Orange in Tunisia and was available in eight cities at the launch On July iPhone was made available for sale in Australia New Zealand and other countries with free bumper cases In South Korea it was released by KT on September In Israel it was released too on September through Cellcom Pelephone and Orange It was launched in Thailand on September by AIS DTAC and True Move and in Malaysia on September in Kuala Lumpur and nationwide on September according to the Malaysian service provider Maxis br The iPhone was released in South Africa on September on the Vodacom and MTN networks in very limited quantities The iPhone was launched in Vietnam on September on VinaPhone and Viettel at first in three major cities Hanoi Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang and then all over the country by the end of October br The iPhone was launched in India on May by Aircel and Airtel br On January Verizon Wireless announced during a media event that it had reached an agreement with Apple and would begin selling a CDMA iPhone in the United States ending Apple s exclusivity agreement with AT T The Verizon iPhone went on sale on February and pre orders began on February The Verizon iPhone includes the Personal Hotspot feature which allows a user to use the iPhone as a wireless hotspot with up to five devices connecting at one time The February presale of the iPhone broke Verizon s first day sales records for a single device br On June Apple stated that the white iPhone models were proving more challenging to manufacture than expected and initially pushed the release date back to the second half of July There was a lot of speculation surrounding the delay of the white iPhone Among the most popular rumours are those concerning the phone s internal camera being adversely affected by light leaking in due to the semi translucent glass and the white paint Other sources report that the problem relates to Apple s inability to match the white colour of the front faceplate with that of the home button On April Apple announced that it would be releasing the white iPhone model on April for both GSM and CDMA The release of the white iPhone was carried out on April br During Apple s official unveiling of the iPhone s on October it was announced that Sprint would begin carrying the CDMA iPhone and the iPhone s in the US on October br br br Discontinuation br In September after the release of the iPhone s and iPhone c Apple stopped selling the iPhone in most of their stores as well as on their website It was replaced by the GB iPhone s br br br Hardware br br br Display br br The display of the iPhone was manufactured by LG under an exclusive contract with Apple It features an LED backlit TFT LCD capacitive touchscreen with a pixel density of pixels per inch ppi on a in cm diagonally measured display Each pixel is micrometers in width The display has a contrast ratio of The screen was marketed by Apple as the Retina display based on the assertion that a display of approximately ppi at a distance of millimetres in from one s eye or arcseconds per pixel is the maximum amount of detail that the human retina can perceive With the iPhone expected to be used at a distance of about inches from the eyes a higher resolution would allegedly have no effect on the image s apparent quality as the maximum potential of the human eye has already been met br This claim was widely disputed Raymond Soneira president of DisplayMate Technologies said in an interview with the Wired magazine that his claims by Jobs are something of an exaggeration It is reasonably close to being a perfect display but Steve pushed it a little too far Soneira stated that the resolution of the human retina is higher than claimed by Apple working out to PPI at inches mm from the eyes or arcseconds per pixel br However Phil Plait author of Bad Astronomy whose career includes a collaboration with NASA regarding the camera on the Hubble Space Telescope responded to the criticism by stating that if you have better than eyesight then at one foot away the iPhone s pixels are resolved The picture will look pixellated If you have average eyesight the picture will look just fine br br br Camera br br The iPhone features an additional front facing x camera and a backside illuminated megapixel rear facing camera with a mm f lens and an LED flash The rear facing megapixel camera is capable of recording HD video in p at frames per second Both cameras make use of the tap to focus feature part of iOS for photo and video recording The rear facing camera has a digital zoom br br br Connectivity br In contrast to Steve Jobs announcement at WWDC Federal Communications Commission documentation showed that in fact the iPhone contains a penta band G UMTS antenna not a quad band G UMTS radio as advertised by Apple According to the FCC documentation filed by Apple the radio inside the iPhone supports and MHz The MHz frequency which is most commonly used in Japanese mobile phones is not advertised as being supported by Apple However the MHz band is a subset of the MHz band which probably explains why the device was advertised as quad band The chip sets were manufactured by Skyworks Solutions and Infineon for GSM version br As with most of Apple s mobile products at the time the iPhone also used the pin dock connector as its only external data port br The iPhone is the first generation of iPhone to have a second microphone used for noise cancellation It is located on the top of the unit near the headphone jack the main microphone is on the bottom left br br br Gyroscope and accelerometer br The iPhone introduces a gyroscopic sensor that detects axis angular acceleration around the X Y and Z axes enabling precise calculation of yaw pitch and roll The gyroscope complements the accelerometer a sensor that has been present since the original iPhone which detects the device s acceleration shake vibration shock or fall by detecting linear acceleration along with one of three axes X Y and Z The combined data from the accelerometer and the gyroscope provides detailed and precise information about the device s axis movement in space The axes of the gyroscope combined with the axes of the accelerometer enable the device to recognize approximately how far fast and in which direction it has moved in space br br br Processor memory and storage br br The iPhone is powered by the Apple A chip which was designed by Intrinsity and like all prior iPhone models manufactured by Samsung This system on a chip is composed of an ARM Cortex A CPU integrated with a PowerVR SGX GPU The Apple A was also used in the first generation iPad released in where it was clocked at its rated speed of GHz The Apple A was the first ever mobile phone processor designed by Apple The clock speed in the iPhone was never disclosed All prior models of the iPhone had underclocked the CPU which typically extends battery life and lowers heat dissipation br The iPhone has MB of DRAM The additional DRAM supports increased performance and multi tasking As on prior models all data is stored in flash memory or GB and not on the SIM Unlike prior generations the storage capacity is not printed on the back of the unit br br br Micro SIM br br The GSM iPhone uses a micro SIM card which is positioned in an ejectable tray located on the right side of the device The CDMA iPhone however the phone connects to the network using an ESN All prior models have used regular mini SIM cards Depending on the operator micro SIM cards may not be available for all networks globally As a technical workaround it is possible to trim a mini SIM card with a knife or scissors so that it fits into the micro SIM tray br br br Design br br The iPhone features a redesigned structure designed by Jony Ive a design that would later be reused and adapted for the iPhone S S and first generation iPhone SE Most notably the bulges of the back panel as well as the band between the front and back are gone and have been replaced with flattened surfaces The redesign reflects the utilitarianism and uniformity of existing Apple products such as the iPad and the iMac The overall dimensions of the iPhone have been reduced from their predecessor br It is millimetres in high millimetres in wide and millimetres in deep compared to the iPhone GS which is millimetres in high millimetres in wide and millimetres in deep making the iPhone thinner than its predecessor the iPhone GS Steve Jobs claimed it to be the thinnest smartphone on the planet The reduced size of the device is primarily due to the externally placed antenna br The iPhone is structured around a stainless steel frame that wraps around the edge of the phone acting both as the primary structure for the device and as the iPhone s antennas This metal band features two slits on the GSM version of the phone one at the lower left and one at the top and a fake slit along the lower right to cosmetically mirror the one at the lower left that divide the band into two antenna sections the left section of the band serves as the Bluetooth Wi Fi and GPS antenna and the right and lower sections of the band act as the antenna for GSM and UMTS connectivity br On the CDMA version of the phone there are four slits in the metal band Two at the top on the left and right and two at the bottom This divides the metal band into four different segments which like the GSM version of the phone serve as different antennas for connectivity The top portion of the band divided by the top left and right slits is for connecting to the CDMA network The left portion of the metal band is for Bluetooth Wi Fi and GPS just like the GSM version The right side is not an antenna but serves to cosmetically mirror the left side and also to create a similar look to the GSM version of the phone br The internal components are situated between two panels of aluminosilicate glass described by Apple as being chemically strengthened to be times stiffer and times harder than plastic theoretically allowing it to be more scratch resistant and durable than the prior models br In fall pentalobe screws started to replace the Philips screws used in post repair units in the US and in production units in Japan br br br Software br br The iPhone shipped with iOS which was the newest version of Apple s iOS mobile operating system at the time iOS introduced a multitasking system allowing apps to remain suspended in memory perform certain operations in the background and allowing users to switch between apps using an on screen menu It also introduced FaceTime which allows users to perform video calls between other iPhone iPad iPod Touch and Mac OS X users br The iPhone supports up to iOS released in September Due to the relatively aged hardware of the iPhone most features available on newer iPhone models are not available on the device as of iOS they include Siri D maps and turn by turn navigation AirDrop AirPlay mirroring live camera filters panorama mode and certain visual effects introduced by iOS such as the blurring of translucent interface elements the parallax effect on the home screen and live wallpapers While still subject to the same limitations iOS did bring some slight performance improvements to the operating system on the iPhone iOS specifically iOS is the last version of iOS to support the iPhone Unlike the iPhone s the iPhone did not receive the iOS update due to performance issues br br br Accessories br br br Bumper br br Apple released a plastic and rubber case called the Bumper to protect the edges of the phone The case which also provided some screen protection included buttons and holes that enabled switch and connector access br Apple updated the bumper with a wider volume switch hole with the release of the iPhone for CDMA networks The updated bumper is also compatible with iPhone s the next generation iPhone that has the same exterior design and measurements as the CDMA model of the iPhone but with a SIM card slot as well br br br Reception br br br Pre release br Pre release reception was largely positive The announcement included information that had not been covered by Gizmodo Fox News commented that seeing it in action is far more informative than staring at Gizmodo s photos of a busted test unit Rhodri Marsden of The Independent said that aside from the introduction of face to face video calling it s not a staggering feature set instead focusing on how the device is more powerful than its predecessor speedier easier to use and will make previously laborious tasks seem like a cinch br br CNET reacted to the announcement by explaining how it believes that iMovie for iOS was the most exciting part of this year s WWDC Keynote The article noted how the iPhone unlike current cameras can record HD content and then edit it from the same device labeling it a true mobile editing suite br br br Reviews br Reviews of the iPhone were largely positive Walt Mossberg of The Wall Street Journal called the device the best device in its class Engadget named it the best smartphone on the market in June CNET gave the iPhone a rating of out of one of the highest ratings it had given any smartphone TechRadar gave the device stars Consumer Reports said the signal problem was the reason they did not rate it a recommended model although the other tests ranked it highest among smart phones br Joshua Topolsky of Engadget described the device s industrial design as being more detailed and sophisticated than its predecessor br br br Technical problems br Some users reported a yellow discoloration of the screen that disappeared after several days which was attributed to the glass lamination glue that was used It did not have time to dry fully before the unit reached consumers due to the speed of manufacturing Another issue reported by some users within days of the iPhone release was that during calls the proximity sensor can be insensitive so that facial contact with the touchscreen can end calls mute calls and dial other numbers Some users reported that particularly in low light conditions photos taken on the iPhone sometimes contained blue or green splotches Issues with white balance were also discovered particularly when using the flash br br br Antenna br br Shortly after the iPhone was launched some users reported that signal strength of the phone was reduced when touching the lower left edge of the phone bridging one of the two locations which separates the two antennas resulting in dropped calls in some areas with lower signal reception In response Apple issued a statement advising that customers should avoid gripping the phone in the lower left corner when making or receiving a call Internally senior antenna expert Ruben Caballero raised concerns to CEO Steve Jobs that the antenna design could lead to dropped calls br As a consequence of this problem it was reported on July that several iPhone users were planning on suing Apple and AT T for fraud by concealment negligence intentional misrepresentation and defective design The legal challenge was started by a law firm who set up a website to recruit disenchanted iPhone buyers for a lawsuit against Apple Later that day Apple issued another statement stating that it had discovered the cause of the dramatic drop in bars br Apple explained how the formula it used to calculate the number of bars to display was totally wrong Apple promised to correct the issue and release a software update within a few weeks that would address the mistake which had been present since the original iPhone The New York Times commented that the failure to detect this longstanding problem earlier is astonishing br Consumer Reports initially stated that the iPhone s signal issues are not unique and may not be serious and it continued to mention that signal loss is a problem that is faced by the entire smartphone industry It was such a problem that Apple made a formal apology onstage The next day the magazine altered their stance after encountering instances of dropped calls The magazine rejected Apple s explanation after conducting tests in a controlled environment and comparing the results against prior generations of iPhone It sarcastically pointed out that using a piece of tape to cover the lower left antenna gap was one way to fix the problem but recommended that consumers who want an iPhone that works well without a masking tape fix purchase the iPhone GS instead The magazine also tested the iPhone while it was wearing a Bumper a frame like cover sold by Apple that prevents direct contact with the antenna reporting that it did resolve the problem CNN repeated Consumer Reports statement that a small amount of duct tape had proven an effective fix to the iPhone s dropped call issue br On July at a press conference which included a private tour of Apple s antenna design lab for journalists Steve Jobs announced that Apple would provide all iPhone owners with a free case to help solve the antenna issue and a refund to those users who had already purchased a Bumper The free case offer would be valid until September when Apple would re evaluate the situation To get a free case owners were able to apply via an app installed on the phone found in the App Store from July to September Jobs also announced that Apple could not produce enough Bumpers for all owners of the phone but would source a supply and offer a range of cases Additionally Jobs cited figures from AppleCare which showed that only percent of all iPhone users have complained to the company about the issue while the number of phones returned to Apple was percent percentage points less than the number of iPhone GS models that were returned in the first month of the phone s launch br Consumer Reports noted that the solution was not permanent though a good first step However because Jobs did not specify a time line for fixing the problem and the offering for a free bumper only being a temporary solution PC World decided to remove the iPhone from its Top Cell Phones chart and reassign it to a pending rating br Despite the negative media attention regarding the antenna issues of iPhone users said that they were very satisfied with their iPhone according to an August survey by ChangeWave Research The GSM iPhone continued to be sold unchanged until its discontinuation in September while the CDMA iPhone and all models of the iPhone S featured a tweaked antenna design to prevent the issue from happening br br br iPhones in space br In two iPhone units equipped with a special application were taken to the International Space Station aboard the Space Shuttle on the STS mission The devices were used in various experiments utilizing sensors and a special app br br br See also br List of iPhone models br History of iPhone br Comparison of smartphones br Timeline of iPhone models br br br Notes br br br Notable Movies Shot With
