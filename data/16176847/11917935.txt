The PlayStation Portable system software is the official firmware for the PlayStation Portable PSP It uses the XrossMediaBar XMB as its user interface similar to the PlayStation console br br br Updates br Updates add new functionality as well as security patches to prevent unsigned code from being executed on the system Updates can be obtained in four ways br Direct download to the PSP over Wi Fi This can be performed by choosing Settings System Update from the XMB br Download to a PC then transfer to the PSP via a USB cable or Memory Stick br Included on the UMD of some games These games may not run with earlier firmware than the version on their UMD See also List of PlayStation Portable system software compatibilities br Download from a PS to a PSP system via USB cable Japanese and American version only br While system software updates can be used with consoles from any region Sony recommends only downloading system software updates released for the region corresponding to the system s place of purchase System software updates have added various features including a web browser Adobe Flash Player support additional codecs for images audio and video PlayStation connectivity as well as patches against several security exploits vulnerabilities and execution of homebrew programs The battery must be at least charged or else the system will prevent the update from installing If the power supply is lost while writing to the system software the console will no longer be able to operate unless the system is booted in service mode or sent to Sony for repair if still under warranty br The current version of the software was made available on January It is a minor update released more than three years after the release of the previous version in br br br Technology br br br Graphical shell br The PlayStation Portable uses the XrossMediaBar XMB as its graphical user interface which is also used in the PlayStation PS console a variety of Sony BRAVIA HDTVs Blu ray disc players and many more Sony products XMB displays icons horizontally across the screen that be seen as categories Users can navigate through them using the left and right buttons of the D pad which move the icons forward or back across the screen highlighting just one at a time as opposed to using any kind of pointer to select an option When one category is selected there are usually more specific options then available to select that are spread vertically above and below the selected icon Users may navigate among these options by using the up and down buttons of the D pad br The basic features offered by XMB implementations varies based on device and software version On the PSP console the XMB had top level icons for Photos Music Videos Games Networking which allows the use of the web browser Settings and Extras Also XMB offers a degree of multitasking With the PSP using the Home button while playing music would allow users to browse photos without stopping the music While XMB proved to be a successful user interface for Sony products such as PSP and PS the next generation Sony video game consoles such as the PlayStation and the PlayStation Vita no longer use this user interface For example the XMB is replaced by the LiveArea interface on the PS Vita br br br Web browser br br The PlayStation Portable comes with a web browser for browsing the Internet The web browser is a version of the NetFront browser made by Access Co Ltd and was released for free with the system software update The browser supports most common web technologies such as HTTP cookies forms CSS as well as basic JavaScript capabilities br The version upgrade added Unicode UTF character encoding and Auto Select as options in the browser s encoding menu and also introduced the saving of input history for online forms br Version of the PSP s system software introduced basic Flash capabilities to the browser However the player runs Flash version five iterations behind the current desktop version making some websites difficult to view br There are three different rendering modes Normal Just Fit and Smart Fit Normal will display the page with no changes Just Fit will attempt to shrink some elements to make the whole page fit on the screen and preserve layout and Smart Fit will display content in the order it appears in the HTML and with no size adjustments instead it will drop an element down below the preceding element if it starts to go off the screen br The browser also has basic tabbed browsing capabilities with a maximum of three tabs When a website tries to open a link in a new window the browser opens it in a new tab br Parents can limit content by enabling Browser Start Up Control which blocks all access to the web browser and creating a digit PIN under Settings in Security Additionally the browser can be configured to run under a proxy server and can be protected by the security PIN to enable the use of web filtering or monitoring software through a network Recently TrendMicro for PSP was added as a feature that can be enabled via a subscription to filter or monitor content on the PSP br The PSP browser is slower compared to modern browsers and often runs out of memory due to limitations put in place by Sony Alternatively homebrew alternatives to the browser have been released that utilize all MB of the PSP s RAM which allows the browser to load pages faster and have more memory for larger pages Opera Mini can also be used on PSP through PSPKVM a homebrew application which is a Sun Java Virtual Machine It was claimed to provide much faster loading times than the default browser and provides better web page compatibility br br br Other features br Like many other video game consoles the PlayStation Portable is capable of photo audio and video playback in a variety of formats However unlike Sony s home consoles such as the PlayStation and the PlayStation it is not possible to play Blu ray or DVD movies on the PlayStation Portable directly since it lacks a standard Blu ray or DVD drive While it does have a UMD drive and there exist UMD movies the UMD format never saw implementation on any device other than the PlayStation Portable and as a result the market is very limited compared to those for other optical media formats There have been no more movies released on UMD since with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part being one of the final releases on the format br The PlayStation Portable also supports a feature known as Remote Play which allows the PSP to access many features of a PlayStation console from a remote location using the PS s WLAN capabilities a home network or the Internet However unlike the later Remote Play feature between the PlayStation Vita and the PlayStation the Remote Play capabilities between the PSP and the PS are much more limited Although most of the PS s capabilities related to its main user interface are accessible with Remote Play playback of DVDs Blu ray Discs PlayStation games most PlayStation games and copy protected files stored on the PS s hard drive are not supported Actual Remote Play between the PSP and the PS games are only supported by a select very few PS titles br Furthermore PSP PSP and PSP N can use the Skype VoIP service starting with system software version The service allows Skype calls to be made over Wi Fi and on the PSP Go over the Bluetooth Modem feature It is not possible to use the VoIP service on the original PSP console due to hardware limitations There also existed other services for the PSP such as the Room for PlayStation Portable similar to the PlayStation s online community based service known as PlayStation Home br Go Messenger a free instant messaging program jointly developed by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe and BT Group was announced on August at the Leipzig Games Convention and was released on February also with firmware version It allowed the Go Cam to be used for video conferencing and voice chat PSP users could communicate with PC users through Go Messenger if the PC was running BT Softphone Because use of the service did not meet Sony and BT s expectations it was discontinued on March Subsequently firmware version removed the program s icon br SensMe channels for music files was added to the PSP starting with firmware version Also SHOUTCast Radio can be listened to via an inbuilt app on most PSPs br br br Custom firmware br Homebrew development was very popular during the time of the PlayStation Portable Besides the official firmware OFW made by Sony custom firmware also written as Custom Firmware or simply CFW is also commonly seen in the PlayStation Portable handheld consoles br Custom firmware allows the running of unsigned code such as homebrew applications UMD ISO files emulators for other consoles and PS games when the disc images are converted into an EBOOT file This is in stark contrast to the official system software where only code that has been signed by Sony can run br Notable custom firmware versions include the M Custom Firmware by Dark AleX as well as those made by others such as the Custom Firmware GEN series Minimum Edition ME LME CFW and the PRO CFW br All legally and illegally obtained content can be played on custom firmware assuming that it is at the latest version currently br During the early days of the PSP hacking scene it was discovered that firmware allowed unsigned code to run While this firmware only existed on PSP models from Japan many users imported these models to run and develop homebrew An exploit was later discovered in firmware that also allowed unsigned code to run This opened up North American PSP systems for homebrew Firmware acted as the standard firmware for homebrew until the creation of eLoaders which use various exploits to launch a homebrew menu savegame exploits in games such as Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories and Lumines Puzzle Fusion and eventually DarkAlex s custom firmware releases which all allowed PSPs shipped after the update s release to run homebrew br Sony had put significant effort into blocking custom firmware and other third party devices content from the PSP but their effort was in vain In July Dark AleX officially stopped his work on the PSP citing perceived problems with Sony as one of the reasons for his departure but other custom firmware versions continue to be developed or updated In a homebrew tool known as Infinity was developed which allows users to permanently install CFW such as LME or PRO on all PSP models This tool requires firmware or br br br See also br Media Go br XrossMediaBar br LocationFree Player br PlayStation Network br Other gaming platforms from Sony br br PlayStation system software br PlayStation
