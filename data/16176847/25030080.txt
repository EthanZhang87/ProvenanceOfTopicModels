Bada stylized as bada Korean was a mobile operating system developed by Samsung Electronics for devices such as mid to high end smartphones and tablet computers The name is derived from bada meaning ocean or sea in Korean All phones running Bada were branded with the name Wave unlike Samsung s Android devices which are branded as Galaxy br To foster adoption of Bada Samsung reportedly considered releasing the source code under an open source license and expanding device support to include Smart TVs In June Samsung announced its intention to merge Bada into the Tizen project while still using it in parallel with Google s Android OS and Microsoft s Windows Phone on its smartphones br Bada is based on Mentor Graphics Nucleus RTOS kernel or Linux kernel and was planned to become as middleware separated from an OS kernel but development was discontinued br On February Samsung announced that it would stop developing Bada moving development to Tizen instead Bug reporting was terminated in April br br br History br br After the announcement of Bada the Wave S which would eventually turn to be the first Bada based phone was first shown to the public at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February Alongside Bada itself some applications running on Bada were exhibited including mobile videogames like Gameloft s Asphalt br The Wave S was released in May that year and sold one million handsets over the first four weeks on the market br According to Samsung companies such as Twitter EA Capcom Gameloft and Blockbuster revealed their support for the Bada platform by having arranged development partnerships with Samsung since before the launch and shared a few insights about their vision for the future of mobile apps and how Bada would play a role in it These were a showcase of what could be heard in a series of events held across the world during the year called Developer Days In addition it was made public the announcement of an incoming Bada Developer Challenge with a total prize of USD throughout the launch event br In May Samsung released a beta of their Bada software development kit SDK making it available to the general public as it had done with partners the previous December to entice potential developers of applications for this platform br In August Samsung released version of the Bada SDK A year later in August version of the Bada SDK was released br br br Versions br The Samsung S Wave was launched with version of the Bada operating system Samsung soon released version which included minor fixes for European users Version was released with the

and Samsung feature phones br Samsung created a new app store for its subsequent mobile OS Tizen br br br Architecture br br Architecture of bada br The bada architecture consists of the following four layers br br Kernel br This layer contains either the real time operating system or the Linux kernel depending on device hardware configuration br br Device br Service br Framework br br Bada was defined by Samsung as not an operating system itself but a platform with a kernel configurable architecture which allowed using either a proprietary real time operating system hybrid RTOS kernel or the Linux kernel According to copyrights displayed by Samsung Wave S it used code from FreeBSD NetBSD and OpenBSD br The device layer provided core functions such as graphics protocols telephony and security The service layer provided more service centric features such as SMS mapping and in app purchasing handled by a Bada Server The top layer the framework layer provided an application programming interface API in C for application developers to use br Bada provided various UI controls to developers and a web browser control based on the open source WebKit and featured Adobe Flash supporting Flash versions to Flash Lite with ActionScript support in Bada Both of the latter could be embedded inside native Bada applications It supported the OpenGL ES D graphics API and offered interactive mapping with point of interest POI features which could also be embedded inside native applications It supported pinch to zoom tabbed browsing and cut copy and paste features br Bada s interaction methods that could be incorporated into applications included sensors such as motion sensing vibration control face detection accelerometer magnetometer tilt Global Positioning System GPS and multi touch br Native applications were developed in C with the Bada SDK and the Eclipse based integrated development environment IDE GNU based tool chains were used for building and debugging applications The IDE also contained a drag and drop application for designing application interfaces and an emulator for apps br br br Criticism of Bada x br br Some publications criticized Bada x over the following issues br br In the beginning all VoIP over Wi Fi applications were banned which meant that popular applications such as Skype could not be used In March the restriction was removed br The external sensor API was not open ended preventing new types of sensors or unexpected technology developments from being added in the future by third parties br Due to performance and privacy issues Bada x applications cannot access the SMS MMS inbox or receive incoming SMS MMS notifications This limit was removed in version br Bada versions x only allowed one Bada third party application to run at a time Multitasking applications was only possible between the base applications and one Bada third party application This limit is removed since version br The best GPS facility was poor in Bada It was further updated in Bada br The lack of availability of popular applications was arguably one of the most important factors in the demise of Bada The lack of developer and consumer support that caused this deficit could not be rectified by the Bada update br br br Bada br The Bada version was shown at IFA in Berlin and was released in the end of December with a lot of new functions and improvements compared to version introducing features such as br br Full HTML support br WAC compatibility br Full multitasking br WiFi Direct technology br Adobe Flash Lite mobile Flash Player
