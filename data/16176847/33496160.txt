A mobile application or app is a computer program or software application designed to run on a mobile device such as a phone tablet or watch Mobile applications often stand in contrast to desktop applications which are designed to run on desktop computers and web applications which run in mobile web browsers rather than directly on the mobile device br Apps were originally intended for productivity assistance such as email calendar and contact databases but the public demand for apps caused rapid expansion into other areas such as mobile games factory automation GPS and location based services order tracking and ticket purchases so that there are now millions of apps available Many apps require Internet access Apps are generally downloaded from app stores which are a type of digital distribution platforms br The term app short for application has since become very popular in it was listed as Word of the Year by the American Dialect Society br Apps are broadly classified into three types native apps hybrid and web apps Native applications are designed specifically for a mobile operating system typically iOS or Android Web apps are written in HTML or CSS and typically run through a browser Hybrid apps are built using web technologies such as JavaScript CSS and HTML and function like web apps disguised in a native container br br br Overview br br Most mobile devices are sold with several apps bundled as pre installed software such as a web browser email client calendar mapping program and an app for buying music other media or more apps Some pre installed apps can be removed by an ordinary uninstall process thus leaving more storage space for desired ones Where the software does not allow this some devices can be rooted to eliminate the undesired apps br Apps that are not preinstalled are usually available through distribution platforms called app stores These may operated by the owner of the device s mobile operating system such as the App Store or Google Play Store by the device manufacturers such as the Galaxy Store and Huawei AppGallery or by third parties such as the Amazon Appstore and F Droid br Usually they are downloaded from the platform to a target device but sometimes they can be downloaded to laptops or desktop computers Apps can also be installed manually for example by running an Android application package on Android devices br Some apps are freeware while others have a price which can be upfront or a subscription Some apps also include microtransactions and or advertising In any case the revenue is usually split between the application s creator and the app store The same app can therefore cost a different price depending on the mobile platform br Mobile apps were originally offered for general productivity and information retrieval including email calendar contacts the stock market and weather information However public demand and the availability of developer tools drove rapid expansion into other categories such as those handled by desktop application software packages As with other software the explosion in number and variety of apps made discovery a challenge which in turn led to the creation of a wide range of review recommendation and curation sources including blogs magazines and dedicated online app discovery services In government regulatory agencies began trying to regulate and curate apps particularly medical apps Some companies offer apps as an alternative method to deliver content with certain advantages over an official website br With a growing number of mobile applications available at app stores and the improved capabilities of smartphones people are downloading more applications to their devices Usage of mobile apps has become increasingly prevalent across mobile phone users A May comScore study reported that during the previous quarter more mobile subscribers used apps than browsed the web on their devices vs respectively Researchers found that usage of mobile apps strongly correlates with user context and depends on user s location and time of the day Mobile apps are playing an ever increasing role within healthcare and when designed and integrated correctly can yield many benefits br Market research firm Gartner predicted that billion apps would be downloaded in of them free which would generate billion in the US up on s US billion By Q the Google Play and Apple stores alone generated billion An analyst report estimates that the app economy creates revenues of more than billion per year within the European Union while over jobs have been created in EU states due to the growth of the app market br br br Types br Mobile applications may be classified by numerous methods A common scheme is to distinguish native web based and hybrid apps br br br Native app br All apps targeted toward a particular mobile platform are known as native apps Therefore an app intended for Apple device does not run in Android devices As a result most businesses develop apps for multiple platforms br While developing native apps professionals incorporate best in class user interface modules This accounts for better performance consistency and good user experience Users also benefit from wider access to application programming interfaces and make limitless use of all apps from the particular device Further they also switch over from one app to another effortlessly br The main purpose for creating such apps is to ensure best performance for a specific mobile operating system br br br Web based app br A web based app is implemented with the standard web technologies of HTML CSS and JavaScript Internet access is typically required for proper behavior or being able to use all features compared to offline usage Most if not all user data is stored in the cloud br The performance of these apps is similar to a web application running in a browser which can be noticeably slower than the equivalent native app It also may not have the same level of features as the native app br br br Hybrid app br The concept of the hybrid app is a mix of native and web based apps Apps developed using Apache Cordova Flutter Xamarin React Native Sencha Touch and other frameworks fall into this category br These are made to support web and native technologies across multiple platforms Moreover these apps are easier and faster to develop It involves use of single codebase which works in multiple mobile operating systems br Despite such advantages hybrid apps exhibit lower performance Often apps fail to bear the same look and feel in different mobile operating systems br br br Development br br Developing apps for mobile devices requires considering the constraints and features of these devices Mobile devices run on battery and have less powerful processors than personal computers and also have more features such as location detection and cameras Developers also have to consider a wide array of screen sizes hardware specifications and configurations because of intense competition in mobile software and changes within each of the platforms although these issues can be overcome with mobile device detection br Mobile application development requires the use of specialized integrated development environments Mobile apps are first tested within the development environment using emulators and later subjected to field testing Emulators provide an inexpensive way to test applications on mobile phones to which developers may not have physical access br Mobile user interface UI Design is also essential Mobile UI considers constraints and contexts screen input and mobility as outlines for design The user is often the focus of interaction with their device and the interface entails components of both hardware and software User input allows for the users to manipulate a system and device s output allows the system to indicate the effects of the users manipulation Mobile UI design constraints include limited attention and form factors such as a mobile device s screen size for a user s hand Mobile UI contexts signal cues from user activity such as location and scheduling that can be shown from user interactions within a mobile application Overall mobile UI design s goal is primarily for an understandable user friendly interface br Mobile UIs or front ends rely on mobile back ends to support access to enterprise systems The mobile back end facilitates data routing security authentication authorization working off line and service orchestration This functionality is supported by a mix of middleware components including mobile app servers Mobile Backend as a service MBaaS and SOA infrastructure br Conversational interfaces display the computer interface and present interactions through text instead of graphic elements They emulate conversations with real humans There are two main types of conversational interfaces voice assistants like the Amazon Echo and chatbots br Conversational interfaces are growing particularly practical as users are starting to feel overwhelmed with mobile apps a term known as app fatigue br David Limp Amazon s senior vice president of devices says in an interview with Bloomberg We believe the next big platform is voice br br br Distribution br br The three biggest app stores are Google Play for Android App Store for iOS and Microsoft Store for Windows Windows Mobile and Xbox One br br br Google Play br br Google Play formerly known as the Android Market is an international online software store developed by Google for Android devices It opened in October In July the number of apps downloaded via the Google Play Store surpassed billion of the over million apps available As of September according to Statista the number of apps available exceeded million Over of apps in the Google Play Store are free to download The store generated a revenue of billion U S dollars in br br br App Store br br Apple s App Store for iOS and iPadOS was not the first app distribution service but it ignited the mobile revolution and was opened on July and as of September reported over billion downloads The original AppStore was first demonstrated to Steve Jobs in by Jesse Tayler at NeXTWorld Expo As of June there were apps available which had been downloaded by million iOS users During Apple s Worldwide Developers Conference CEO Tim Cook announced that the App Store has available apps to download as well as billion apps downloaded from the app store until that date From an alternative perspective figures seen in July by the BBC from tracking service Adeven indicate over two thirds of apps in the store are zombies barely ever installed by consumers br br br Microsoft Store br br Microsoft Store formerly known as the Windows Store was introduced by Microsoft in for its Windows and Windows RT platforms While it can also carry listings for traditional desktop programs certified for compatibility with Windows it is primarily used to distribute Windows Store apps which are primarily built for use on tablets and other touch based devices but can still be used with a keyboard and mouse and on desktop computers and laptops br br br Others br br Amazon Appstore is an alternative application store for the Android operating system It was opened in March and as of June the app store has nearly apps The Amazon Appstore s Android Apps can also be installed and run on BlackBerry devices br BlackBerry World is the application store for BlackBerry and BlackBerry OS devices It opened in April as BlackBerry App World br Ovi Nokia for Nokia phones was launched internationally in May In May Nokia announced plans to rebrand its Ovi product line under the Nokia brand and Ovi Store was renamed Nokia Store in October Nokia Store will no longer allow developers to publish new apps or app updates for its legacy Symbian and MeeGo operating systems from January br Windows Phone Store was introduced by Microsoft for its Windows Phone platform which was launched in October As of October it has over apps available br Samsung Apps was introduced in September As of October Samsung Apps reached million downloads The store is available in countries and it offers apps for Windows Mobile Android and Bada platforms br The Electronic AppWrapper was the first electronic distribution service to collectively provide encryption and purchasing electronically br F Droid Free and open Source Android app repository br Opera Mobile Store is a platform independent app store for iOS Java BlackBerry OS Symbian iOS and Windows Mobile and Android based mobile phones It was launched internationally in March br There are numerous other independent app stores for Android devices br br br Enterprise management br br Mobile application management MAM describes software and services responsible for provisioning and controlling access to internally developed and commercially available mobile apps used in business settings The strategy is meant to off set the security risk of a Bring Your Own Device BYOD work strategy When an employee brings a personal device into an enterprise setting mobile application management enables the corporate IT staff to transfer required applications control access to business data and remove locally cached business data from the device if it is lost or when its owner no longer works with the company Containerization is an alternate approach to security Rather than controlling an employee s entire device containerization apps create isolated pockets separate from personal data Company control of the device only extends to that separate container br br br App wrapping vs native app management br Especially when employees bring your own device BYOD mobile apps can be a significant security risk for businesses because they transfer unprotected sensitive data to the Internet without knowledge and consent of the users Reports of stolen corporate data show how quickly corporate and personal data can fall into the wrong hands Data theft is not just the loss of confidential information but makes companies vulnerable to attack and blackmail br Professional mobile application management helps companies protect their data One option for securing corporate data is app wrapping But there also are some disadvantages like copyright infringement or the loss of warranty rights Functionality productivity and user experience are particularly limited under app wrapping The policies of a wrapped app can not be changed If required it must be recreated from scratch adding cost An app wrapper is a mobile app made wholly from an existing website or platform with few or no changes made to the underlying application The wrapper is essentially a new management layer that allows developers to set up usage policies appropriate for app use Examples of these policies include whether or not authentication is required allowing data to be stored on the device and enabling disabling file sharing between users Because most app wrappers are often websites first they often do not align with iOS or Android Developer guidelines br Alternatively it is possible to offer native apps securely through enterprise mobility management This enables more flexible IT management as apps can be easily implemented and policies adjusted at any time br br br
