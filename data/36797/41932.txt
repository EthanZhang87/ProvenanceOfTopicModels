title: Accuracy and precision
id: 41932
Accuracy and precision are two measures of observational error br Accuracy is how close a given set of measurements observations or readings are to their true value br Precision is how close the measurements are to each other br In other words br br Precision is a description of random errors a measure of statistical variability br Accuracy has two definitions per ISO br More commonly a description of systematic errors a measure of statistical bias of a given measure of central tendency Low accuracy causes a difference between a result and a true value This secondary measure is referred to as trueness by ISO br A combination of both types of observational error random and systematic so high accuracy requires both high precision and high trueness br In the first more common definition of accuracy above the concept is independent of precision so a particular set of data can be said to be accurate precise both or neither br In simpler terms given a statistical sample or set of data points from repeated measurements of the same quantity the sample or set can be said to be accurate if their average is close to the true value of the quantity being measured while the set can be said to be precise if their standard deviation is relatively small br br br Common technical definition br In the fields of science and engineering the accuracy of a measurement system is the degree of closeness of measurements of a quantity to that quantity s true value The precision of a measurement system related to reproducibility and repeatability is the degree to which repeated measurements under unchanged conditions show the same results Although the two words precision and accuracy can be synonymous in colloquial use they are deliberately contrasted in the context of the scientific method br The field of statistics where the interpretation of measurements plays a central role prefers to use the terms bias and variability instead of accuracy and precision bias is the amount of inaccuracy and variability is the amount of imprecision br A measurement system can be accurate but not precise precise but not accurate neither or both For example if an experiment contains a systematic error then increasing the sample size generally increases precision but does not improve accuracy The result would be a consistent yet inaccurate string of results from the flawed experiment Eliminating the systematic error improves accuracy but does not change precision br A measurement system is considered valid if it is both accurate and precise Related terms include bias non random or directed effects caused by a factor or factors unrelated to the independent variable and error random variability br The terminology is also applied to indirect measurements that is values obtained by a computational procedure from observed data br In addition to accuracy and precision measurements may also have a measurement resolution which is the smallest change in the underlying physical quantity that produces a response in the measurement br In numerical analysis accuracy is also the nearness of a calculation to the true value while precision is the resolution of the representation typically defined by the number of decimal or binary digits br In military terms accuracy refers primarily to the accuracy of fire justesse de tir the precision of fire expressed by the closeness of a grouping of shots at and around the centre of the target br br br Quantification br br In industrial instrumentation accuracy is the measurement tolerance or transmission of the instrument and defines the limits of the errors made when the instrument is used in normal operating conditions br Ideally a measurement device is both accurate and precise with measurements all close to and tightly clustered around the true value The accuracy and precision of a measurement process is usually established by repeatedly measuring some traceable reference standard Such standards are defined in the International System of Units abbreviated SI from French Syst me international d unit s and maintained by national standards organizations such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the United States br This also applies when measurements are repeated and averaged In that case the term standard error is properly applied the precision of the average is equal to the known standard deviation of the process divided by the square root of the number of measurements averaged Further the central limit theorem shows that the probability distribution of the averaged measurements will be closer to a normal distribution than that of individual measurements br With regard to accuracy we can distinguish br br the difference between the mean of the measurements and the reference value the bias Establishing and correcting for bias is necessary for calibration br the combined effect of that and precision br A common convention in science and engineering is to express accuracy and or precision implicitly by means of significant figures Where not explicitly stated the margin of error is understood to be one half the value of the last significant place For instance a recording of m or m or m would imply a margin of m the last significant place is the tenths place while a recording of m would imply a margin of error of m the last significant digits are the units br A reading of m with trailing zeros and no decimal point is ambiguous the trailing zeros may or may not be intended as significant figures To avoid this ambiguity the number could be represented in scientific notation m indicates that the first zero is significant hence a margin of m while m indicates that all three zeros are significant giving a margin of m Similarly one can use a multiple of the basic measurement unit km is equivalent to m It indicates a margin of km m However reliance on this convention can lead to false precision errors when accepting data from sources that do not obey it For example a source reporting a number like with precision looks like it has precision Under the convention it would have been rounded to br Alternatively in a scientific context if it is desired to indicate the margin of error with more precision one can use a notation such as m meaning a range of between and m br Precision includes br br repeatability the variation arising when all efforts are made to keep conditions constant by using the same instrument and operator and repeating during a short time period and br reproducibility the variation arising using the same measurement process among different instruments and operators and over longer time periods br In engineering precision is often taken as three times Standard Deviation of measurements taken representing the range that of measurements can occur within For example an ergonomist measuring the human body can be confident that of their extracted measurements fall within cm if using the GRYPHON processing system or cm if using unprocessed data br br br ISO definition ISO br br A shift in the meaning of these terms appeared with the publication of the ISO series of standards in which is also reflected in the issue of the BIPM International Vocabulary of Metrology VIM items and br According to ISO the general term accuracy is used to describe the closeness of a measurement to the true value When the term is applied to sets of measurements of the same measurand it involves a component of random error and a component of systematic error In this case trueness is the closeness of the mean of a set of measurement results to the actual true value and precision is the closeness of agreement among a set of results br ISO and VIM also avoid the use of the term bias previously specified in BS because it has different connotations outside the fields of science and engineering as in medicine and law br br br In classification br br br In binary classification br br Accuracy is also used as a statistical measure of how well a binary classification test correctly identifies or excludes a condition That is the accuracy is the proportion of correct predictions both true positives and true negatives among the total number of cases examined As such it compares estimates of pre and post test probability To make the context clear by the semantics it is often referred to as the Rand accuracy or Rand index It is a parameter of the test br The formula for quantifying binary accuracy is br br br br br br Accuracy br br br br br br T br P br br T br N br br br T br P br br T br N br br F br P br br F br N br br br br br br displaystyle text Accuracy frac TP TN TP TN FP FN br br br where TP True positive FP False positive TN True negative FN False negative br In this context the concepts of trueness and precision as defined by ISO are not applicable One reason is that there is not a single true value of a quantity but rather two possible true values for every case while accuracy is an average across all cases and therefore takes into account both values However the term precision is used in this context to mean a different metric originating from the field of information retrieval see below br br br In multiclass classification br When computing accuracy in multiclass classification accuracy is simply the fraction of correct classifications br br br br br br Accuracy br br br br br correct classifications br all classifications br br br br br displaystyle text Accuracy frac text correct classifications text all classifications br br br This is usually expressed as a percentage For example if a classifier makes ten predictions and nine of them are correct the accuracy is br Accuracy is also called top accuracy to distinguish it from top accuracy common in convolutional neural network evaluation To evaluate top accuracy the classifier must provide relative likelihoods for each class When these are sorted a classification is considered correct if the correct classification falls anywhere within the top predictions made by the network Top accuracy was popularized by the ImageNet challenge It is usually higher than top accuracy as any correct predictions in the nd through th positions will not improve the top score but do improve the top score br br br In psychometrics and psychophysics br In psychometrics and psychophysics the term accuracy is interchangeably used with validity and constant error Precision is a synonym for reliability and variable error The validity of a measurement instrument or psychological test is established through experiment or correlation with behavior Reliability is established with a variety of statistical techniques classically through an internal consistency test like Cronbach s alpha to ensure sets of related questions have related responses and then comparison of those related question between reference and target population br br br In logic simulation br br In logic simulation a common mistake in evaluation of accurate models is to compare a logic simulation model to a transistor circuit simulation model This is a comparison of differences in precision not accuracy Precision is measured with respect to detail and accuracy is measured with respect to reality br br br In information systems br Information retrieval systems such as databases and web search engines are evaluated by many different metrics some of which are derived from the confusion matrix which divides results into true positives documents correctly retrieved true negatives documents correctly not retrieved false positives documents incorrectly retrieved and false negatives documents incorrectly not retrieved Commonly used metrics include the notions of precision and recall In this context precision is defined as the fraction of retrieved documents which are relevant to the query true positives divided by true false positives using a set of ground truth relevant results selected by humans Recall is defined as the fraction of relevant documents retrieved compared to the total number of relevant documents true positives divided by true positives false negatives Less commonly the metric of accuracy is used is defined as the total number of correct classifications true positives plus true negatives divided by the total number of documents br None of these metrics take into account the ranking of results Ranking is very important for web search engines because readers seldom go past the first page of results and there are too many documents on the web to manually classify all of them as to whether they should be included or excluded from a given search Adding a cutoff at a particular number of results takes ranking into account to some degree The measure precision at k for example is a measure of precision looking only at the top ten k search results More sophisticated metrics such as discounted cumulative gain take into account each individual ranking and are more commonly used where this is important br br br In cognitive systems br In cognitive systems accuracy and precision is used to characterize and measure results of a cognitive process performed by biological or artificial entities where a cognitive process is a transformation of data information knowledge or wisdom to a higher valued form DIKW Pyramid Sometimes a cognitive process produces exactly the intended or desired output but sometimes produces output far from the intended or desired Furthermore repetitions of a cognitive process do not always produce the same output Cognitive accuracy CA is the propensity of a cognitive process to produce the intended or desired output Cognitive precision CP is the propensity of a cognitive process to produce only the intended or desired output To measure augmented cognition in human cog ensembles where one or more humans work collaboratively with one or more cognitive systems cogs increases in cognitive accuracy and cognitive precision assist in measuring the degree of cognitive augmentation br br br See also br br br br br br External links br br BIPM Guides in metrology Guide to the Expression of
