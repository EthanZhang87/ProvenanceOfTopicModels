Abductive reasoning also called abduction abductive inference or retroduction is a form of logical inference that seeks the simplest and most likely conclusion from a set of observations It was formulated and advanced by American philosopher and logician Charles Sanders Peirce beginning in the latter half of the th century br Abductive reasoning unlike deductive reasoning yields a plausible conclusion but does not definitively verify it Abductive conclusions do not eliminate uncertainty or doubt which is expressed in retreat terms such as best available or most likely While inductive reasoning draws general conclusions that apply to many situations abductive conclusions are confined to the particular observations in question br In the s as computing power grew the fields of law computer science and artificial intelligence research spurred renewed interest in the subject of abduction br Diagnostic expert systems frequently employ abduction br br br Deduction induction and abduction br br br Deduction br br Deductive reasoning allows deriving br br br br b br br br displaystyle b br br from br br br br a br br br displaystyle a br br only where br br br br b br br br displaystyle b br br is a formal logical consequence of br br br br a br br br displaystyle a br br In other words deduction derives the consequences of the assumed Given the truth of the assumptions a valid deduction guarantees the truth of the conclusion For example given that Wikis can be edited by anyone br br br br br a br br br br br br br displaystyle a br br and Wikipedia is a wiki br br br br br a br br br br br br br displaystyle a br br it follows that Wikipedia can be edited by anyone br br br br b br br br displaystyle b br br br br br Induction br br Inductive reasoning is the process of inferring some general principle br br br br b br br br displaystyle b br br from a body of knowledge br br br br a br br br displaystyle a br br where br br br br b br br br displaystyle b br br does not necessarily follow from br br br br a br br br displaystyle a br br br br br br a br br br displaystyle a br br might give us very good reason to accept br br br br b br br br displaystyle b br br but does not ensure br br br br b br br br displaystyle b br br For example if it is given that percent of the elephants are gray and Louise is an elephant one can induce that Louise is gray Still this is not necessarily the case percent of the time this conclusion will be wrong br However an inference being derived from statistical data is not sufficient to classify it as inductive For example if all swans that a person has observed so far are white they may instead abduce the possibility that all swans are white They have good reason to believe the conclusion from the premise because it is the best explanation for their observations and the truth of the conclusion is still not guaranteed Indeed it turns out that some swans are black br br br Abduction br Abductive reasoning allows inferring br br br br a br br br displaystyle a br br as an explanation of br br br br b br br br displaystyle b br br As a result of this inference abduction allows the precondition br br br br a br br br displaystyle a br br to be abducted from the consequence br br br br b br br br displaystyle b br br Deductive reasoning and abductive reasoning thus differ in which end left or right of the proposition br br br br a br br br displaystyle a br br entails br br br br b br br br displaystyle b br br serves as conclusion For example in a billiard game after glancing and seeing the eight ball moving towards us we may abduce that the cue ball struck the eight ball The strike of the cue ball would account for the movement of the eight ball It serves as a hypothesis that best explains our observation Given the many possible explanations for the movement of the eight ball our abduction does not leave us certain that the cue ball in fact struck the eight ball but our abduction still useful can serve to orient us in our surroundings Despite many possible explanations for any physical process that we observe we tend to abduce a single explanation or a few explanations for this process in the expectation that we can better orient ourselves in our surroundings and disregard some possibilities Properly used abductive reasoning can be a useful source of priors in Bayesian statistics br One can understand abductive reasoning as inference to the best explanation although not all usages of the terms abduction and inference to the best explanation are equivalent br br br Formalizations of abduction br br br Logic based abduction br In logic explanation is accomplished through the use of a logical theory br br br br T br br br displaystyle T br br representing a domain and a set of observations br br br br O br br br displaystyle O br br Abduction is the process of deriving a set of explanations of br br br br O br br br displaystyle O br br according to br br br br T br br br displaystyle T br br and picking out one of those explanations For br br br br E br br br displaystyle E br br to be an explanation of br br br br O br br br displaystyle O br br according to br br br br T br br br displaystyle T br br it should satisfy two conditions br br br br br O br br br displaystyle O br br follows from br br br br E br br br displaystyle E br br and br br br br T br br br displaystyle T br br br br br br br E br br br displaystyle E br br is consistent with br br br br T br br br displaystyle T br br br In formal logic br br br br O br br br displaystyle O br br and br br br br E br br br displaystyle E br br are assumed to be sets of literals The two conditions for br br br br E br br br displaystyle E br br being an explanation of br br br br O br br br displaystyle O br br according to theory br br br br T br br br displaystyle T br br are formalized as br br br br br T br br E br br O br br br br displaystyle T cup E models O br br br br br br T br br E br br br displaystyle T cup E br br is consistent br Among the possible explanations br br br br E br br br displaystyle E br br satisfying these two conditions some other condition of minimality is usually imposed to avoid irrelevant facts not contributing to the entailment of br br br br O br br br displaystyle O br br being included in the explanations Abduction is then the process that picks out some member of br br br br E br br br displaystyle E br br Criteria for picking out a member representing the best explanation include the simplicity the prior probability or the explanatory power of the explanation br A proof theoretical abduction method for first order classical logic based on the sequent calculus and a dual one based on semantic tableaux analytic tableaux have been proposed The methods are sound and complete and work for full first order logic without requiring any preliminary reduction of formulae into normal forms These methods have also been extended to modal logic br Abductive logic programming is a computational framework that extends normal logic programming with abduction It separates the theory br br br br T br br br displaystyle T br br into two components one of which is a normal logic program used to generate br br br br E br br br displaystyle E br br by means of backward reasoning the other of which is a set of integrity constraints used to filter the set of candidate explanations br br br Set cover abduction br A different formalization of abduction is based on inverting the function that calculates the visible effects of the hypotheses Formally we are given a set of hypotheses br br br br H br br br displaystyle H br br and a set of manifestations br br br br M br br br displaystyle M br br they are related by the domain knowledge represented by a function br br br br e br br br displaystyle e br br that takes as an argument a set of hypotheses and gives as a result the corresponding set of manifestations In other words for every subset of the hypotheses br br br br br H br br br br H br br br displaystyle H subseteq H br br their effects are known to be br br br br e br br br H br br br br br br displaystyle e H br br br Abduction is performed by finding a set br br br br br H br br br br H br br br displaystyle H subseteq H br br such that br br br br M br br e br br br H br br br br br br displaystyle M subseteq e H br br In other words abduction is performed by finding a set of hypotheses br br br br br H br br br br br displaystyle H br br such that their effects br br br br e br br br H br br br br br br displaystyle e H br br include all observations br br br br M br br br displaystyle M br br br A common assumption is that the effects of the hypotheses are independent that is for every br br br br br H br br br br H br br br displaystyle H subseteq H br br it holds that br br br br e br br br H br br br br br br br br h br br br H br br br br br e br br br h br br br br br displaystyle e H bigcup h in H e h br br If this condition is met abduction can be seen as a form of set covering br br br Abductive validation br Abductive validation is the process of validating a given hypothesis through abductive reasoning This can also be called reasoning through successive approximation Under this principle an explanation is valid if it is the best possible explanation of a set of known data The best possible explanation is often defined in terms of simplicity and elegance see Occam s razor Abductive validation is common practice in hypothesis formation in science moreover Peirce claims that it is a ubiquitous aspect of thought br br Looking out my window this lovely spring morning I see an azalea in full bloom No no I don t see that though that is the only way I can describe what I see That is a proposition a sentence a fact but what I perceive is not proposition sentence fact but only an image which I make intelligible in part by means of a statement of fact This statement is abstract but what I see is concrete I perform an abduction when I so much as express in a sentence anything I see The truth is that the whole fabric of our knowledge is one matted felt of pure hypothesis confirmed and refined by induction Not the smallest advance can be made in knowledge beyond the stage of vacant staring without making an abduction at every step br br It was Peirce s own maxim that Facts cannot be explained by a hypothesis more extraordinary than these facts themselves and of various hypotheses the least extraordinary must be adopted After obtaining possible hypotheses that may explain the facts abductive validation is a method for identifying the most likely hypothesis that should be adopted br br br Subjective logic abduction br Subjective logic generalises probabilistic logic by including degrees of epistemic uncertainty in the input arguments i e instead of probabilities the analyst can express arguments as subjective opinions Abduction in subjective logic is thus a generalization of probabilistic abduction described above The input arguments in subjective logic are subjective opinions which can be binomial when the opinion applies to a binary variable or multinomial when it applies to an n ary variable A subjective opinion thus applies to a state variable br br br br X br

epistemic uncertainty about the input argument probabilities can be explicitly expressed and taken into account during the analysis It is thus possible to perform abductive analysis in the presence of uncertain arguments which naturally results in degrees of uncertainty in the output conclusions br br br History br The idea that the simplest most easily verifiable solution should be preferred over its more complicated counterparts is a very old one To this point George P lya in his treatise on problem solving makes reference to the following Latin truism simplex sigillum veri simplicity is the seal of truth br br br Introduction and development by Peirce br br br Overview br The American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce introduced abduction into modern logic Over the years he called such inference hypothesis abduction presumption and retroduction He considered it a topic in logic as a normative field in philosophy not in purely formal or mathematical logic and eventually as a topic also in economics of research br As two stages of the development extension etc of a hypothesis in scientific inquiry abduction and also induction are often collapsed into one overarching concept the hypothesis That is why in the scientific method known from Galileo and Bacon the abductive stage of hypothesis formation is conceptualized simply as induction Thus in the twentieth century this collapse was reinforced by Karl Popper s explication of the hypothetico deductive model where the hypothesis is considered to be just a guess in the spirit of Peirce However when the formation of a hypothesis is considered the result of a process it becomes clear that this guess has already been tried and made more robust in thought as a necessary stage of its acquiring the status of hypothesis Indeed many abductions are rejected or heavily modified by subsequent abductions before they ever reach this stage br Before Peirce treated abduction as the use of a known rule to explain an observation For instance it is a known rule that if it rains grass gets wet so to explain the fact that the grass on this lawn is wet one abduces that it has rained Abduction can lead to false conclusions if other rules that might explain the observation are not taken into account e g the grass could be wet from dew This remains the common use of the term abduction in the social sciences and in artificial intelligence br Peirce consistently characterized it as the kind of inference that originates a hypothesis by concluding in an explanation though an unassured one for some very curious or surprising anomalous observation stated in a premise As early as he wrote that all conceptions of cause and force are reached through hypothetical inference in the s he wrote that all explanatory content of theories is reached through abduction In other respects Peirce revised his view of abduction over the years br In later years his view came to be br br Abduction is guessing It is very little hampered by rules of logic Even a well prepared mind s individual guesses are more frequently wrong than right But the success of our guesses far exceeds that of random luck and seems born of attunement to nature by instinct some speak of intuition in such contexts br Abduction guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a plausible instinctive economical way for a surprising or very complicated phenomenon That is its proximate aim br Its longer aim is to economize inquiry itself Its rationale is inductive it works often enough is the only source of new ideas and has no substitute in expediting the discovery of new truths Its rationale especially involves its role in coordination with other modes of inference in inquiry It is inference to explanatory hypotheses for selection of those best worth trying br Pragmatism is the logic of abduction Upon the generation of an explanation which he came to regard as instinctively guided the pragmatic maxim gives the necessary and sufficient logical rule to abduction in general The hypothesis being insecure needs to have conceivable implications for informed practice so as to be testable and through its trials to expedite and economize inquiry The economy of research is what calls for abduction and governs its art br Writing in Peirce admits that in almost everything I printed before the beginning of this century I more or less mixed up hypothesis and induction and he traces the confusion of these two types of reasoning to logicians too narrow and formalistic a conception of inference as necessarily having formulated judgments from its premises br He started out in the s treating hypothetical inference in a number of ways which he eventually peeled away as inessential or in some cases mistaken br br as inferring the occurrence of a character a characteristic from the observed combined occurrence of multiple characters which its occurrence would necessarily involve for example if any occurrence of A is known to necessitate occurrence of B C D E then the observation of B C D E suggests by way of explanation the occurrence of A But by he no longer regarded such multiplicity as common to all hypothetical inference Wikisource br as aiming for a more or less probable hypothesis in and but not in anyway by the justification is not probability but the lack of alternatives to guessing and the fact that guessing is fruitful by he speaks of the likely in the sense of nearing the truth in an indefinite sense by he discusses plausibility as instinctive appeal In a paper dated by editors as circa he discusses instinct and naturalness along with the kind of considerations low cost of testing logical caution breadth and incomplexity that he later calls methodeutical br as induction from characters but as early as he characterized abduction as guessing br as citing a known rule in a premise rather than hypothesizing a rule in the conclusion but by he allowed either approach br as basically a transformation of a deductive categorical syllogism but in he offered a variation on modus ponens instead and by he was unconvinced that any one form covers all hypothetical inference br br br The Natural Classification of Arguments br In Peirce s On the Natural Classification of Arguments hypothetical inference always deals with a cluster of characters call them P P P etc known to occur at least whenever a certain character M occurs Note that categorical syllogisms have elements traditionally called middles predicates and subjects For example All men middle are mortal predicate Socrates subject is a man middle ergo Socrates subject is mortal predicate Below M stands for a middle P for a predicate S for a subject Peirce held that all deduction can be put into the form of the categorical syllogism Barbara AAA br br br Deduction Induction and Hypothesis br In in Deduction Induction and Hypothesis there is no longer a need for multiple characters or predicates in order for an inference to be hypothetical although it is still helpful Moreover Peirce no longer poses hypothetical inference as concluding in a probable hypothesis In the forms themselves it is understood but not explicit that induction involves random selection and that hypothetical inference involves response to a very curious circumstance The forms instead emphasize the modes of inference as rearrangements of one another s propositions without the bracketed hints shown below br br br A Theory of Probable Inference br Peirce long treated abduction in terms of induction from characters or traits weighed not counted like objects explicitly so in his influential A theory of probable inference in which he returns to involving probability in the hypothetical conclusion Like Deduction Induction and Hypothesis in it was widely read see the historical books on statistics by Stephen Stigler unlike his later amendments of his conception of abduction Today abduction remains most commonly understood as induction from characters and extension of a known rule to cover unexplained circumstances br Sherlock Holmes used this method of reasoning in the stories of Arthur Conan Doyle although Holmes refers to it as deductive reasoning br br br Minute Logic and after br In Peirce wrote that he now regarded the syllogistical forms and the doctrine of extension and comprehension i e objects and characters as referenced by terms as being less fundamental than he had earlier thought In he offered the following form for abduction br br The surprising fact C is observed br But if A were true C would be a matter of course br Hence there is reason to suspect that A is true br The hypothesis is framed but not asserted in a premise then asserted as rationally suspectable in the conclusion Thus as in the earlier categorical syllogistic form the conclusion is formulated from some premise s But all the same the hypothesis consists more clearly than ever in a new or outside idea beyond what is known or observed Induction in a sense goes beyond observations already reported in the premises but it merely amplifies ideas already known to represent occurrences or tests an idea supplied by hypothesis either way it requires previous abductions in order to get such ideas in the first place Induction seeks facts to test a hypothesis abduction seeks a hypothesis to account for facts br Note that the hypothesis A could be of a rule It need not even be a rule strictly necessitating the surprising observation C which needs to follow only as a matter of course or the course itself could amount to some known rule merely alluded to and also not necessarily a rule of strict necessity In the same year Peirce wrote that reaching a hypothesis may involve placing a surprising observation under either a newly hypothesized rule or a hypothesized combination of a known rule with a peculiar state of facts so that the phenomenon would be not surprising but instead either necessarily implied or at least likely br Peirce did not remain quite convinced about any such form as the categorical syllogistic form or the form In he wrote I do not at present feel quite convinced that any logical form can be assigned that will cover all Retroductions For what I mean by a Retroduction is simply a conjecture which arises in the mind br br br Pragmatism br In Peirce wrote There would be no logic in imposing rules and saying that they ought to be followed until it is made out that the purpose of hypothesis requires them In Peirce called pragmatism the logic of abduction and said that the pragmatic maxim gives the necessary and sufficient logical rule to abduction in general The pragmatic maxim is br br Consider what effects that might conceivably have practical bearings we conceive the object of our conception to have Then our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object br It is a method for fruitful clarification of conceptions by equating the meaning of a conception with the conceivable practical implications of its object s conceived effects Peirce held that that is precisely tailored to abduction s purpose in inquiry the forming of an idea that could conceivably shape informed conduct In various writings in the s he said that the conduct of abduction or retroduction is governed by considerations of economy belonging in particular to the economics of research He regarded economics as a normative science whose analytic portion might be part of logical methodeutic that is theory of inquiry br br br Three levels of logic about abduction br Peirce came over the years to divide philosophical logic into three departments br br Stechiology or speculative grammar on the conditions for meaningfulness Classification of signs semblances symptoms symbols etc and their combinations as well as their objects and interpretants br Logical critic or logic proper on validity or justifiability of inference the conditions for true representation Critique of arguments in their various modes deduction induction abduction br Methodeutic or speculative rhetoric on the conditions for determination of interpretations Methodology of inquiry in its interplay of modes br Peirce had from the start seen the modes of inference as being coordinated together in scientific inquiry and by the s held that hypothetical inference in particular is inadequately treated at the level of critique of arguments To increase the assurance of a hypothetical conclusion one needs to deduce implications about evidence to be found predictions which induction can test through observation so as to evaluate the hypothesis That is Peirce s outline of the scientific method of inquiry as covered in his inquiry methodology which includes pragmatism or as he later called it pragmaticism the clarification of ideas in terms of their conceivable implications regarding informed practice br br br Classification of signs br As early as Peirce held that br Hypothesis abductive inference is inference through an icon also called a likeness br Induction is inference through an index a sign by factual connection a sample is an index of the totality from which it is drawn br Deduction is inference through a symbol a sign by interpretive habit irrespective of resemblance or connection to its object br In Peirce wrote that in abduction It is recognized that the phenomena are like i e constitute an Icon of a replica of a general conception or Symbol br br br Critique of arguments br At the critical level Peirce examined the forms of abductive arguments as discussed above and came to hold that the hypothesis should economize explanation for plausibility in terms of the feasible and natural In Peirce described this plausibility in some detail It involves not likeliness based on observations which is instead the inductive evaluation of a hypothesis but instead optimal simplicity in the sense of the facile and natural as by Galileo s natural light of reason and as distinct from logical simplicity Peirce does not dismiss logical simplicity entirely but sees it in a subordinate role taken to its logical extreme it would favor adding no explanation to the observation at all Even a well prepared mind guesses oftener wrong than right but our guesses succeed better than random luck at reaching the truth or at least advancing the inquiry and that indicates to Peirce that they are based in instinctive attunement to nature an affinity between the mind s processes and the processes of the real which would account for why appealingly natural guesses are the ones that oftenest or least seldom succeed to which Peirce added the argument that such guesses are to be preferred since without a natural bent like nature s people would have no hope of understanding nature In Peirce made a three way distinction between probability verisimilitude and plausibility and defined plausibility with a normative ought By plausibility I mean the degree to which a theory ought to recommend itself to our belief independently of any kind of evidence other than our instinct urging us to regard it favorably For Peirce plausibility does not depend on observed frequencies or probabilities or on verisimilitude or even on testability which is not a question of the critique of the hypothetical inference as an inference but rather a question of the hypothesis s relation to the inquiry process br The phrase inference to the best explanation not used by Peirce but often applied to hypothetical inference is not always understood as referring to the most simple and natural hypotheses such as those with the fewest assumptions However in other senses of best such as standing up best to tests it is hard to know which is the best explanation to form since one has not tested it yet Still for Peirce any justification of an abductive inference as good is not completed upon its formation as an argument unlike with induction and deduction and instead depends also on its methodological role and promise such as its testability in advancing inquiry br br br Methodology of inquiry br At the methodeutical level Peirce held that a hypothesis is judged and selected for testing because it offers via its trial to expedite and economize the inquiry process itself toward new truths first of all by being testable and also by further economies in terms of cost value and relationships among guesses hypotheses Here considerations such as probability absent from the treatment of abduction at the critical level come into play For examples br br Cost A simple but low odds guess if low in cost to test for falsity may belong first in line for testing to get it out of the way If surprisingly it stands up to tests that is worth knowing early in the inquiry which otherwise might have stayed long on a wrong though seemingly likelier track br Value A guess is intrinsically worth testing if it has instinctual plausibility or reasoned objective probability while subjective likelihood though reasoned can be treacherous br Interrelationships Guesses can be chosen for trial strategically for their br caution for which Peirce gave as an example the game of Twenty Questions br breadth of applicability to explain various phenomena and br incomplexity that of a hypothesis that seems too simple but whose trial may give a good leave as the billiard players say and be instructive for the pursuit of various and conflicting hypotheses that are less simple br br br Uberty br Peirce indicated that abductive reasoning is driven by the need for economy in research the expected fact based productivity of hypotheses prior to deductive and inductive processes of verification A key concept proposed by him in this regard is uberty the expected fertility and pragmatic value of reasoning This concept seems to be gaining support via association to the Free Energy Principle br br br Gilbert Harman br Gilbert Harman is a professor of philosophy at Princeton University Harman s account of the role of inference to the best explanation inferring the existence of that which we need for the best explanation of observable phenomena has been very influential br br br Stephen Jay Gould br Stephen Jay Gould in answering the Omphalos hypothesis claimed that only hypotheses that can be proved incorrect lie within the domain of science and only these hypotheses are good explanations of facts worth inferring to W hat is so desperately wrong with Omphalos Only this really and perhaps paradoxically that we can devise no way to find out whether it is wrong or for that matter right Omphalos is the classic example of an utterly untestable notion for the world will look exactly the same in all its intricate detail whether fossils and strata are prochronic signs of a fictitious past or products of an br extended history Science is a procedure for testing and rejecting hypotheses not a compendium of certain knowledge Claims that can be proved incorrect lie within its domain But theories that cannot be tested in principle are not part of science W e reject Omphalos as useless not wrong br br br Applications br br br Artificial intelligence br Applications in artificial intelligence include fault diagnosis belief revision and automated planning The most direct application of abduction is that of automatically detecting faults in systems given a theory relating faults with their effects and a set of observed effects abduction can be used to derive sets of faults that are likely to be the cause of the problem br br br Medicine br In medicine abduction can be seen as a component of clinical evaluation and judgment br br br Automated planning br Abduction can also be used to model automated planning Given a logical theory relating action occurrences with their effects for example a formula of the event calculus the problem of finding a plan for reaching a state can be modeled as the problem of abducting a set of literals implying that the final state is the goal state br br br Intelligence analysis br In intelligence analysis analysis of competing hypotheses and Bayesian networks probabilistic abductive reasoning is used extensively Similarly in medical diagnosis and legal reasoning the same methods are being used although there have been many examples of errors especially caused by the base rate fallacy and the prosecutor s fallacy br br br Belief revision br br Belief revision the process of adapting beliefs in view of new information is another field in which abduction has been applied The main problem of belief revision is that the new information may be inconsistent with the prior web of beliefs while the result of the incorporation cannot be inconsistent The process of updating the web of beliefs can be done by the use of abduction once an explanation for the observation has been found integrating it does not generate inconsistency br G rdenfors paper contains a brief survey of the area of belief revision and its relation to updating of logical databases and explores the relationship between belief revision and nonmonotonic logic br This use of abduction is not straightforward as adding propositional formulae to other propositional formulae can only make inconsistencies worse Instead abduction is done at the level of the ordering of preference of the possible worlds Preference models use fuzzy logic or utility models br br br Philosophy of science br In the philosophy of science abduction has been the key inference method to support scientific realism and much of the debate about scientific realism is focused on whether abduction is an acceptable method of inference br br br Historical linguistics br In historical linguistics abduction during language acquisition is often taken to be an essential part of processes of language change such as reanalysis and analogy br br br Applied linguistics br In applied linguistics research abductive reasoning is starting to be used as an alternative explanation to inductive reasoning in recognition of anticipated outcomes of qualitative inquiry playing a role in shaping the direction of analysis It is defined as The use of an unclear premise based on observations pursuing theories to try to explain it Rose et al p br br br Anthropology br In anthropology Alfred Gell in his influential book Art and Agency defined abduction after Eco as a case of synthetic inference where we find some very curious circumstances which would be explained by the supposition that it was a case of some general rule and thereupon adopt that supposition Gell criticizes existing anthropological studies of art for being too preoccupied with aesthetic value and not preoccupied enough with the central anthropological concern of uncovering social relationships specifically the social contexts in which artworks are produced circulated and received Abduction is used as the mechanism for getting from art to agency That is abduction can explain how works of art inspire a sensus communis the commonly held views shared by members that characterize a given society br The question Gell asks in the book is how does it initially speak to people He answers by saying that No reasonable person could suppose that art like relations between people and things do not involve at least some form of semiosis However he rejects any intimation that semiosis can be thought of as a language because then he would have to admit to some pre established existence of the sensus communis that he wants to claim only emerges afterwards out of art Abduction is the answer to this conundrum because the tentative nature of the abduction concept Peirce likened it to guessing means that not only can it operate outside of any pre existing framework but moreover it can actually intimate the existence of a framework As Gell reasons in his analysis the physical existence of the artwork prompts the viewer to perform an abduction that imbues the artwork with intentionality A statue of a goddess for example in some senses actually becomes the goddess in the mind of the beholder and represents not only the form of the deity but also her intentions which are adduced from the feeling of her very presence Therefore through abduction Gell claims that art can have the kind of agency that plants the seeds that grow into cultural myths The power of agency is the power to motivate actions and inspire ultimately the shared understanding that characterizes any given society br br br Computer programming br In formal methods logic is used to specify and prove properties of computer programs Abduction has been used in mechanized reasoning tools to increase the level of automation of the proof activity br A technique known as bi abduction which mixes abduction and the frame problem was used to scale reasoning techniques for memory properties to millions of lines of code logic based abduction was used to infer pre conditions for individual functions in a program relieving the human of the need to do so It led to a program proof startup company which was acquired by Facebook and the Infer program analysis tool which led to thousands of bugs being prevented in industrial codebases br In addition to inference of function preconditions abduction has been used to automate inference of invariants for program loops inference of specifications of unknown code and in synthesis of the programs themselves br br br See also br br br Notes br br br br br br
