 Pataphysics French pataphysique is a philosophy of science invented by French writer Alfred Jarry intended to be a parody of science Difficult to be simply defined or pinned down it has been described as the science of imaginary solutions br br br Introduction br Pataphysics was a concept expressed by Jarry in a mock scientific manner with undertones of spoofing and quackery as expounded in his novel Exploits and Opinions of Dr Faustroll Pataphysician Here Jarry toyed with conventional concepts and interpretations of reality Another attempt at a definition interprets pataphysics as an idea that the virtual or imaginary nature of things as glimpsed by the heightened vision of poetry or science or love can be seized and lived as real Jarry defines pataphysics in a number of statements and examples including that it is the science of imaginary solutions which symbolically attributes the properties of objects described by their virtuality to their lineaments A practitioner of pataphysics is a pataphysician or a pataphysicist br br br Definitions br One definition of pataphysics is that it is a branch of philosophy or science that examines imaginary phenomena that exist in a world beyond metaphysics it is the science of imaginary solutions Jean Baudrillard defines pataphysics as the imaginary science of our world the imaginary science of excess of excessive parodic paroxystic effects particularly the excess of emptiness and insignificance br There are over one hundred definitions of pataphysics Some examples are shown below br br Pataphysics is the science of that which is superinduced upon metaphysics whether within or beyond the latter s limitations extending as far beyond metaphysics as the latter extends beyond physics Pataphysics will be above all the science of the particular despite the common opinion that the only science is that of the general Pataphysics will examine the laws governing exceptions and will explain the universe supplementary to this one br br Pataphysics is patient Pataphysics is benign Pataphysics envies nothing is never distracted never puffed up it has neither aspirations nor seeks not its own it is even tempered and thinks not evil it mocks not iniquity It is enraptured with scientific truth it supports everything believes everything has faith in everything and upholds everything that is br br Pataphysics passes easily from one state of apparent definition to another Thus it can present itself under the aspect of a gas a liquid or a solid br br Pataphysics the science of the particular does not therefore study the rules governing the general recurrence of a periodic incident the expected case so much as study the games governing the special occurrence of a sporadic accident the excepted case Jarry performs humorously on behalf of literature what Nietzsche performs seriously on behalf of philosophy Both thinkers in effect attempt to dream up a gay science whose joie de vivre thrives wherever the tyranny of truth has increased our esteem for the lie and wherever the tyranny of reason has increased our esteem for the mad br br br Etymology br The word pataphysics is a contracted formation that derives from the Greek t ep t metaphusik It is a phrase expression that mean that which is above metaphysics It is itself a sly variation on the title of Aristotle s Metaphysics which in Greek is t met t phusik br br Jarry mandated the inclusion of the apostrophe in both the words pataphysique and pataphysics to avoid a simple pun The words pataphysician or pataphysicist and the adjective pataphysical should not include the apostrophe Only when consciously referring to Jarry s science itself should the word pataphysics carry the apostrophe br The term pataphysics is a paronym considered a kind of pun in French of metaphysics Since the apostrophe in no way affects the meaning or pronunciation of pataphysics this spelling of the term is a sly notation to the reader suggesting a variety of puns that listeners may hear or be aware of These puns include patte physique physics paw as interpreted by Jarry scholars Keith Beaumont and Roger Shattuck pas ta physique not your physics and p te physique physics paste br br br History br The term first appeared in print in the text of Alfred Jarry s play Guignol in the April issue of L cho de Paris litt raire illustr but it has been suggested that the word has its origins in the same school pranks at the lyc e in Rennes that led Jarry to write Ubu Roi Jarry considered Ibicrates and Sophrotatos the Armenian as the fathers of this science br br br The Coll ge de Pataphysique br The Coll ge de Pataphysique founded in in Paris France is a society committed to learned and inutilious research The word inutilious is synonymous with useless The motto of the college is Latin Eadem mutata resurgo I arise again the same though changed br The permanent head of the college is the Inamovable Curator Dr Faustroll assisted by Bosse de Nage Starosta both are fictional br The Vice Curator is the first and most senior living entity in the college s hierarchy The Vice Curatrice as of is Tanya Peixoto of the London Institute of Pataphysics and Bookartbookshop She was elected in to succeed Her Magnificence Lutembi a crocodile who succeeded Opach the Baron Mollet and Doctor Sandomir br Jean Christophe Averty was

subcommittee of the college br br br Offshoots of the Coll ge de Pataphysique br Although France had been always the centre of the pataphysical globe there are followers in different cities around the world In Juan Esteban Fassio was commissioned to draw the map of the Coll ge de Pataphysique and its institutes abroad br The college stopped its public activities between and referred to as its occultation However through that time Germany Sweden Switzerland Canada The Netherlands and many other countries showed that the internationalization of pataphysics was irreversible br In the s Buenos Aires in the Western Hemisphere and Milan in Europe were the first cities to have pataphysical institutes London Edinburgh Budapest and Li ge as well as many other European cities caught up in the sixties br br br Czechoslovakia br During the communist era a small group of pataphysicists in Czechoslovakia started a journal called PAKO or Pataphysical Collegium Jarry s plays had a lasting impression on the country s underground philosophical scene br br br London Institute of Pataphysics br The London Institute of Pataphysics was established in September to promote pataphysics in the English speaking world The institute has various publications including a journal and has six departments Bureau for the Investigation of Subliminal Images Committee for Hirsutism and Pogonotrophy

to friends colleagues and occasionally to outside observers The museum is presented as a hybrid between an automaton theatre and a cabinet of curiosities and contains works representing the field of Patamechanics an artistic practice and area of study chiefly inspired by pataphysics br Examples of exhibits include a troupe of singing animatronic chipmunks a time machine the museum says is the world s largest automated phenakistoscope an olfactory clock a chandelier of singing animatronic nightingales an Undigestulator a device that purportedly reconstitutes digested foods a peanuts enlarger a syzygistic oracle the earolin a inch tall holographic ear that plays the violin and a machine for capturing the dreams of bumble bees br br br Pataphysics Institute in Vilnius br A Pataphysics Institute opened in Vilnius Lithuania in May br br br Concepts br Clinamen br A clinamen is the unpredictable swerve of atoms that poet Christian B k calls the smallest possible aberration that can make the greatest possible difference An example is Jarry s merdre a swerve of French merde shit br Antinomy br An antinomy is the mutually incompatible It represents the duality of things the echo or symmetry the good and the evil at the same time Hugill mentions various examples including the plus minus the faust troll the haldern ablou the yes but the ha ha and the paradox br Syzygy br The syzygy originally comes from astronomy and denotes the alignment of three celestial bodies in a straight line In a pataphysical context it is the pun It usually describes a conjunction of things something unexpected and surprising Serendipity is a simple chance encounter but the syzygy has a more scientific purpose B k mentions Jarry suggesting that the fall of a body towards a centre might not be preferable to the ascension of a vacuum towards a periphery br Absolute br The absolute is the idea of a transcended reality br Anomaly br An anomaly represents the exception Jarry said that Pataphysics will examine the laws governing exceptions and will explain the universe supplementary to this one B k calls it the repressed part of a rule which ensures that the rule does not work br Pataphor br A pataphor is an unusually extended metaphor based on pataphysics As Jarry claimed that pataphysics exists as far from metaphysics as metaphysics extends from regular reality a pataphor attempts to create a figure of speech that exists as far from metaphor as metaphor exists from non figurative language br br br Pataphysical calendar br The pataphysical calendar is a variation of the Gregorian calendar The Coll ge de Pataphysique created the calendar in The pataphysical era E P started on Jarry s birthday September vulg When converting pataphysical dates to Gregorian dates the appendage vulg for vulgate common is added br The week starts on a Sunday Every st th th and nd is a Sunday and every th day of a month falls on a Friday see Friday the th Each day is assigned a specific name or saint For example the Haha November vulg is called French Occultation d Alfred Jarry or the Sable December vulg is the day of French Don Quichote champion du monde br The year has a total of months each with days The th day of each month is imaginary with two exceptions br br the Gidouille July vulg is always non imaginary br the Gueules February vulg is non imaginary during leap years br The table below shows the names and order of months in a pataphysical year with their corresponding Gregorian dates and approximate translations or meanings by Hugill br br For example br br September vulg Absolu br January vulg D cervelage br November vulg Saturday As Sunday br br br Works influenced by Pataphysics br In the s pataphysics was used as a conceptual principle within various fine art forms especially pop art and popular culture Works within the pataphysical tradition tend to focus on the processes of their creation and elements of chance or arbitrary choices are frequently key in those processes Select pieces from the artist Marcel Duchamp and the composer John Cage characterize this At around this time Asger Jorn a pataphysician and member of the Situationist International referred to pataphysics as a new religion br br br In literature br In Raymond Queneau Jean Genet and Eug ne Ionesco founded Coll ge de pataphysique and published OULIPO br

as such for some part of his life br Pablo Lopez has developed an extension of pataphysics called the pataphor br br br In music br In the song Maxwell s Silver Hammer on the Beatles album Abbey Road pataphysical science is mentioned as a course of study for Joan the first victim of Maxwell Edison br The debut album by Ron Pate s Debonairs featuring Reverend Fred Lane his first appearance on vinyl is titled Raudelunas Pataphysical Revue a live theatrical performance A review in The Wire magazine said No other record has ever come as close to realising Alfred Jarry s desire to make the soul monstrous or even had the vision or invention to try Pate note the pataphysical apostrophe and Lane were central members in the Raudelunas art collective in Tuscaloosa Alabama br Professor Andrew Hugill of de Montfort University is a practitioner of pataphysical music He curated Pataphysics for the Sonic Arts Network s CD series and in some of his own music was issued by UHRecordings under the

dissolved founded radio station KUSP in Santa Cruz California for then non conventional radio programming br br br In visual art br In American artist James E Brewton developed a style of abstract expressionism he called Graffiti Pataphysic A survey of Brewton s pataphysics related work was shown in in Philadelphia br American artist Thomas Chimes developed an interest in Jarry s pataphysics which became a lifelong passion inspiring much of the painter s creative work br In The Laboratory of Feminist Pataphysics was founded by Canadian visual artist writer and scholar Mireille Perron The Laboratory of Feminist Pataphysics has been shown at the Nickle Arts Museum The New Gallery and Stride Gallery in Calgary Alberta br In American artist Kevin Ferreira began a visual exploration into the imaginary solutions for the constructs of reality pataphysics pata art The exhibit SpektrumMEK that resulted from this endeavor has been put into his book SpektrumMEK A pataphysical gestation to the birth of Lil t br The League of Imaginary Scientists a Los Angeles based art collective specializing in pataphysics based interactive experiments In they exhibited a series of projects at Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles br Brian Reffin Smith a Berlin based British artist and Regent of Catachemistry and Speculative Metallurgy in the Coll ge de Pataphysique Paris often shows art based upon or influenced by Pataphysics and conducts performances at Pataphysical events He was part of a group of German and Czech artists who exhibited at Patadata in Zl n Czech Republic br br br In online fiction br The SCP Foundation has multiple articles referencing pataphysical concepts such as SCP As below so above where the pataphysical reality is described as layers of metafictional narrative and the anomaly in question ascends the narratives to destroy them Pataphysics articles often deal with the fictional nature of the Foundation For example SCP Where We Go When We Fade Fade Away features Foundation scientists attempting to manipulate the real life website s article deletion feature to destroy problematic SCP objects and SCP which is an attempt at killing the authors of the site itself br br br In architecture br Le Corbusier developed an interest in Jarry s work br br br Pataphor br The pataphor Spanish pat fora French pataphore is a term coined by writer and musician Pablo Lopez for an unusually extended metaphor based on Alfred Jarry s science of pataphysics br As Jarry claimed that pataphysics existed as far from metaphysics as metaphysics extends from regular reality a pataphor attempts to create a figure of speech that exists as far from metaphor as metaphor exists from non figurative language Whereas a metaphor compares a real object or event to a seemingly unrelated subject to emphasize their similarities the pataphor uses the newly created metaphorical similarity as a reality on which to base itself In going beyond mere ornamentation of the original idea the pataphor seeks to describe a new and separate world in which an idea or aspect has taken on a life of its own br Like pataphysics itself pataphors essentially describe two degrees of separation from reality rather than merely one degree of separation which is the world of metaphors and metaphysics The pataphor may also be said to function as a critical tool describing the world of assumptions based on assumptions such as belief systems or rhetoric run amok The following is an example br br Non figurative br Tom and Alice stood side by side in the lunch line br Metaphor br Tom and Alice stood side by side in the lunch line two pieces positioned on a chessboard br Pataphor br Tom took a step closer to Alice and made a date for Friday night checkmating Rudy was furious at losing to Margaret so easily and dumped the board on the rose colored quilt stomping downstairs br br Thus the pataphor has created a world where the chessboard exists including the characters who live in that world entirely abandoning the original context br The pataphor has been subject to commercial interpretations usage in speculative computer applications applied to highly imaginative problem solving methods and even politics on the international level The Firesign Theatre is a comedy troupe whose jokes often rely on pataphors There is a band called Pataphor and an interactive fiction in the Interactive Fiction Database called PataNoir based on pataphors Pataphor is used by the Writer s Program at the University of North Florida and has appeared in works affiliated with the Maria Curie Sk odowska University br Pataphors have been the subject of art exhibits as in Tara Strickstein s Pataphor exhibit at Next Art Fair Art Chicago other artworks and architectural works Pataphors have also been used in literary criticism and mentioned in Art in America br There is also a book of pataphorical art called Pataphor by Dutch artist Hidde van Schie br In The Disappearance of Literature Blanchot Agamben and the Writers of the No Aaron Hillyer writes br br While metaphysics and metaphors attain one degree of separation from reality pataphors and pataphysics move beyond by two degrees This allows an idea to assume its own life a sort of plasticity freed from the harness of rigid representation In other words metaphors operate on the level of the same They juxtapose apparently unrelated material in order to draw out subtle identities Pataphors unsettle this mechanism they use the facade of metaphorical similarity as a basis for establishing an entirely new range of references and outlandish articulations a new world in the midst of the old the novel taking to the streets Just as Kafka sought to forge a new form of life on the basis of absolute separation from historical progress on cultural intransmissibility and just as Blanchot pursued the pure novel that exists in a relationship of absolute refusal of the established world so the pataphysician seeks to initiate a new world on the grounds of a tenuous unreality br br br See also br br br Footnotes br br br br br br Bibliography br br br External links br Coll ge de pataphysique College of Pataphysics
