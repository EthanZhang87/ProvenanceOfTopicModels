A turboshaft engine is a form of gas turbine that is optimized to produce shaft horsepower rather than jet thrust In concept turboshaft engines are very similar to turbojets with additional turbine expansion to extract heat energy from the exhaust and convert it into output shaft power They are even more similar to turboprops with only minor differences and a single engine is often sold in both forms br Turboshaft engines are commonly used in applications that require a sustained high power output high reliability small size and light weight These include helicopters auxiliary power units boats and ships tanks hovercraft and stationary equipment br br br Overview br A turboshaft engine may be made up of two major parts assemblies the gas generator and the power section The gas generator consists of the compressor combustion chambers with ignitors and fuel nozzles and one or more stages of turbine The power section consists of additional stages of turbines a gear reduction system and the shaft output The gas generator creates the hot expanding gases to drive the power section Depending on the design the engine accessories may be driven either by the gas generator or by the power section br In most designs the gas generator and power section are mechanically separate so they can each rotate at different speeds appropriate for the conditions referred to as a free power turbine A free power turbine can be an extremely useful design feature for vehicles as it allows the design to forgo the weight and cost of complex multiple ratio transmissions and clutches br An unusual example of the turboshaft principle is the Pratt Whitney F PW turbofan engine for the STOVL Lockheed F B Lightning II in conventional mode it operates as a turbofan but when powering the Rolls Royce LiftSystem it switches partially to turboshaft mode to send horsepower forward through a shaft and partially to turbofan mode to continue to send thrust to the main engine s fan and rear nozzle br Large helicopters use two or three turboshaft engines The Mil Mi uses two Lotarev D at hp each while the Sikorsky CH E Super Stallion uses three General Electric T at hp each br br br History br The first gas turbine engine considered for an armoured fighting vehicle the GT which was based on the BMW turbojet was tested in a Panther tank in mid br The first turboshaft engine for rotorcraft was built by the French engine firm Turbomeca led by its founder Joseph Szydlowski In they built the first French designed turbine engine the shp Originally conceived as an auxiliary power unit it was soon adapted to aircraft propulsion and found a niche as a powerplant for turboshaft driven helicopters in the s In Turbomeca used its work from the to develop the larger shp Artouste which was widely used on the A rospatiale Alouette II and other helicopters This was following the experimental installation of a Boeing T turboshaft in an example of the Kaman K synchropter on December as the world s first ever turboshaft powered helicopter of any type to fly br The T tank which entered service with the Soviet Army in was the first tank to use a gas turbine as its main engine Since the US Army has operated the M Abrams tank which also has a gas turbine engine Most tanks use reciprocating piston diesel engines The Swedish Stridsvagn was the first tank to utilize a gas turbine as a secondary high horsepower sprint engine to augment its primary piston engine s performance The turboshaft engines used in all these tanks have considerably fewer parts than the piston engines they replace or supplement mechanically are very reliable produce reduced exterior noise and run on virtually any fuel petrol gasoline diesel fuel and aviation fuels However turboshaft engines have significantly higher fuel consumption than the diesel engines that are used in the majority of modern main battle tanks br br br See also br Jet engine br Wave disk engine br MTT Turbine Superbike a turboshaft powered superbike br Turbine electric transmission br br br
