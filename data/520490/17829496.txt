Bluebird K is a jet engined hydroplane in which Britain s Donald Campbell set seven world water speed records between and K was the first successful jet powered hydroplane and was considered revolutionary when launched in January Campbell and K were responsible for adding almost miles per hour km h to the water speed record taking it from existing mark of miles per hour km h to just over miles per hour km h Donald Campbell was killed in an accident with a much modified K on January whilst making a bid for his eighth water speed record with his aim to raise the record to over miles per hour km h on Coniston Water br In a diving team using sonar equipment started an underwater survey locating anew the K wreckage Subsequently it was recovered between and while Campbell s body was recovered in br br br Design and engineering br Donald Campbell began his record breaking career in following the death of his father Sir Malcolm Campbell Initially he had been using his father s built Rolls Royce R type powered propeller driven hydroplane Blue Bird K for his attempts but he met with little success and suffered a number of frustrating setbacks In K which had been modified to a prop rider configuration to increase its performance potential was destroyed after suffering a structural failure when its V drive gearbox sheared its mountings which were punched through the floor of the hull br Following rival record breaker John Cobb s death in his jet boat Crusader which broke up at over miles per hour km h during a record attempt in September Campbell began development of his own advanced all metal jet powered Bluebird K hydroplane to challenge the record by then held by the American prop rider hydroplane Slo Mo Shun IV br br Designed by Norris Brothers Ken and Lew the K was a steel framed aluminium bodied three point hydroplane built at Samlesbury by Samlesbury Engineering powered by a Metropolitan Vickers Beryl axial flow turbojet engine using electric start with external battery pack producing pound force kN of thrust Like Slo Mo Shun but unlike Cobb s tricycle Crusader the three planing points were arranged with two forward and one aft in a pickle fork layout prompting Bluebird s early comparison to a blue lobster K was of very advanced design and construction and its load bearing steel space frame ultra rigid It had a design speed of miles per hour km h and remained the only successful jet boat in the world until the late s br From the brief of the mid s Blubird K was designed to br br To attain a speed of mph commensurate with an adequate margin of static and dynamic stability in yaw pitch and roll br Very high structural strength and stiffness the g loadings were to be some three times that of Crusader and five times that of the old Bluebird br Low frontal profile area to minimise aerodynamic drag br Every attempt to minimise aerodynamic lifting moments forward of the Centre of Gravity CG br Paired forward sponsons mounted on outriggers to reduce loadings at the front planes br Planes to have high lift and low drag with good anti porpoising capability sponson under surfaces to permit good transition from the displacement to the planing condition and good anti dive characteristics br Low CG to minimise potential pitching oscillations at the natural frequency of the craft br Turbojet propulsion with low thrust line to minimise thrust on off moment effects br Fuel tank at or near the CG to minimise effects on trim due to fuel state br The designation K was derived from its RYA unlimited rating registration It was carried on a prominent white roundel on its sponsons underneath an infinity symbol Bluebird K was the seventh boat registered with the RYA in the Unlimited hydroplane series br br br Bluebird K records br Campbell set seven world water speed records in K between July and December The first of these marks was set at Ullswater on July where he achieved a speed of mph km h but only after many months of trials changes to the inlet splash guards and a major redesign of Bluebird s forward sponson attachments points by the raising of her front spar Campbell achieved a steady series of subsequent speed record increases with the boat during the rest of the decade beginning with a mark of mph km h in on Lake Mead in Nevada Subsequently four new marks were registered on Coniston Water where Campbell and Bluebird became an annual fixture in the later half of the fifties enjoying significant sponsorship from the Mobil oil company and then BP Campbell made an unsuccessful attempt in at Canandaigua in New York state in the summer of which failed due to lack of suitable calm water conditions Bluebird K became a well known attraction and as well as her annual Coniston appearances K was displayed extensively in the UK USA Canada and Europe and then subsequently in Australia during Campbell s prolonged attempt on the land speed record in br In order to extract more speed and endow the boat with greater high speed stability in both pitch and yaw K was subtly modified in the second half of the s to incorporate more effective streamlining with a blown Perspex cockpit canopy and fluting to the lower part of the main hull In a small wedge shaped tail fin housing an arrester parachute modified sponson fairings that gave a significant reduction in forward aerodynamic lift and a fixed hydrodynamic stabilising fin attached to the transom to aid directional stability and exert a marginal down force on the nose were incorporated into the design to increase the safe operating envelope of the hydroplane Thus she reached mph km h in where an unprecedented peak speed of mph km h was achieved on the first run mph km h in mph km h in and mph km h in br Campbell then turned his attention to the land speed record with the aim of establishing a land speed record of mph km h plus He also planned to set a seventh water speed record in the same year and so become the first person to establish the land speed record and water speed record in the same year He set out for the Bonneville Salt Flats in August and was lucky to survive a mph km h crash in his Norris Brothers designed Bluebird CN turbine powered car later that September Bluebird CN was rebuilt in and Campbell subsequently spent a frustrating two years in the Australian desert battling adverse track conditions Finally after Campbell exceeded the land speed record on Lake Eyre on July at mph km h in Bluebird CN he snared his seventh water speed record on December at Dumbleyung Lake Western Australia when he reached mph km h with two runs at mph km h and mph km h completed with only hours to spare on New Year s Eve br This latest success made Campbell and K the world s most prolific holders of the water speed record and in addition Campbell realised his double when he became the first and so far only person to break both the land speed record and the water speed record in the same year Following on from this success Campbell stated that K would be most likely retired and become a museum exhibit Her hull was ten years old her engine fourteen and her design speed of mph km h had been exceeded by over mph km h on a number of occasions br br br Donald Campbell s water speed records br br Donald Campbell had two Metrovick Beryl engines that were interchangeable during K s life These were used in achieving all of his seven K records The Beryl engines were used from until br br br Final record attempt and death of Donald Campbell br In June Campbell decided to once more try for a water speed record with K his target mph km h br To add more power Campbell received a pound force kN Bristol Siddeley Orpheus engine on loan from the Ministry of Defence This was both lighter and more powerful than the original engine Campbell also purchased a crash damaged Folland Gnat which used the Orpheus engine as a source of spare parts The vertical stabiliser from the Gnat was also used on the rebuilt K and a new hydraulic water brake designed to slow the boat down on the five mile Coniston course Also changed in the redesign was the start system The compressed air starting system designed and manufactured by Rotax Ltd for the Orpheus engine in the Hunting H and Folland Gnat aircraft was adapted for use in Bluebird The system comprised two spherical air bottles containing lbs of dehumidified air compressed to over psi The bottles were charged by means of a high pressure three stage compressor complete with air drying and cleaning facility housed in a specially adapted Land Rover vehicle br The boat returned to Coniston for trials in November These did not go well the weather was appalling and K destroyed her engine when the air intakes collapsed under the demands of the more powerful engine and debris was drawn into the compressor blades The engine was replaced using the engine from the Gnat aircraft that he had purchased at the project s start The original Orpheus remained outside the team s lakeside workshop for the rest of the project shrouded in a tarpaulin br By the end of November after further modifications to alter K s weight distribution some high speed runs were made but these were timed at well below the existing record Problems with the fuel system meant that the engine could not develop maximum power By the middle of December Campbell had made a number of timed attempts but the highest speed achieved was mph and therefore still shy of the existing record Eventually further modifications to K s fuel system involving the fitting of a booster pump fixed the fuel starvation problem It was now the end of December and Campbell was all set to proceed pending only the arrival of suitable weather conditions br br br Final runs br On January Campbell mounted his record attempt Bluebird had completed an initial north south run at an average of mph km h and Campbell used the new water brake to slow K from a peak speed of mph km h when he left the measured kilometre Instead of coming to a stop and opting to refuel he decided to perform a quick turnaround and immediately head back up the course before the wash of his first run had time to be reflected back towards the centre of the lake Both options had been discussed in the pre attempt briefing br The second run was even faster as K passed the start of the measured kilometre she was travelling at over mph km h However her stability had begun to break down as she travelled at a speed she had never achieved before and the front of the boat started to bounce out of the water on the starboard side yards metres from the end of the measured kilometre K lifted from the surface and after about seconds gradually lifted from the water at an ever increasing angle then took off at a degree angle to the water surface She somersaulted and plunged back into the lake nose first then cartwheeled across the water before coming to rest The impact broke K forward of the air intakes where Campbell was sitting and the main hull sank shortly afterwards br Campbell had been killed instantly Mr Whoppit his teddy bear mascot was found among the floating debris and his helmet was recovered Royal Navy divers were able to locate the wreck of K but called off the search for Campbell s body after two weeks br Campbell s last words recorded from the radio intercom were br br Pitching a bit down here Probably from my own wash Straightening up now on track Rather closer to Peel Island Tramping like mad and er Full power Tramping like hell here I can t see much and the water s very bad indeed I can t get over the top I m galloping over the top I m getting a lot of bloody row in here I can t see anything I ve got the bows out I m going ugh br br br Accident analysis br There are varying theories about the cause of the crash Not waiting to refuel meant the boat was lighter The wash from the first run would have been made worse by use of the water brake however the wash had not had time to reflect back to the centre of the course and Campbell had used the water brake well to the south The still photographs taken of the latter part of the final run clearly show that the water brake was not deployed then and also that when K became airborne the jet engine was no longer functioning the exhaust would have very noticeably disturbed the water The engine had therefore flamed out It is impossible to be certain why fuel starvation damage to a structural element during the bouncing disturbance of the airstream into the intakes during pitching or a combination of causes are all possible The most likely ultimate cause is that Bluebird exceeded its aerodynamic static stability limit with loss of engine thrust damage to the port spar fairing and the then little understood ground effect lift enhancement all adding to the instability br As a result of meticulous frame by frame study of high quality colour footage filmed on that day and by examining all available photographs Keith Mitchell Neil Sheppard reported that they had identified aerodynamic instability partially due to earlier damage to the port side forward spar which gave rise to the starboard sponson lifting off the surface of the water for some seconds The front spar that had been dented in collision with the duck the previous day was examined by Norris but as it was only the fairing and not the load bearing structure beneath it was decided to leave it alone This instability was evident in the north south outward run but only in the light of retrospective viewing of the film obtained from a camera position at the southern end of the lake and therefore looking up the lake to the measured km The team out on the lake were not in a position to have witnessed what the filming later revealed The occurrence towards the end of measured km gave cause for concern and Campbell was almost certainly aware of the lift Just as he DMC left the measured kilometre the engine flamed out for some inexplicable reason DC referred to relighting the engine in his commentary and then said relight made normal This was as K left the measured km and the loss of engine thrust and asymmetrical damage were undoubtedly contributory factors to the brief airborne episode br On the final northward run instability was exacerbated as Donald Campbell pushed the speed of Bluebird K above mph The starboard sponson bounced free of the water twice in quick succession lasting and seconds respectively Still accelerating her speed peaked later calculated at mph Her starboard sponson continued to bounce clear of the water for a fifth and final time Bluebird exceeded her safe pitching angle of degrees above horizontal and slowly took to the air Mitchell and Sheppard refer to a report in the Express newspaper dated January telling the reader that Ken Norris was intimately involved with every aspect of the RAF crash investigation Norris stated that at mph the take off angle was calculated at degrees to horizontal No mention was made of the flame out of the engine on the first of the two runs or that the engine could have possibly flamed out on the return run as it was throttled back The report concluded that Campbell had sensed he was out of control and had lifted his foot from the accelerator since there was no thrust disturbance from the jet pipe The engine had actually flamed out on the return run as it was either throttled back or starved of air by the pitch up angle fuel system malfunction The accident had been caused by a combination of circumstances which Donald and Bluebird were capable of overcoming in isolation but not together br br br Recovery br The wreckage of Bluebird was discovered on the lake bed on January A man Royal Navy diving team arrived at Coniston late on the day of the accident They set off for their first attempt to locate Campbell and Bluebird at pm the next day Some had been made calculations to guide the dive team to the boat s likely resting point br The first three dives found small pieces of wreckage On the fourth dive the main hull of K was found in feet of water resting in her correct attitude but facing to the south east A subsequent and prolonged search located many pieces of wreckage and various items were brought to the surface including Bluebird s broken steering wheel and column However the body of Campbell was not located and the search was called off on January The Campbell family and team let it be known that they did not wish to have the hull of K recovered in the absence of finding Campbell s body They also felt they would learn nothing from its recovery br Using adapted sonar technology a diving team led by Bill Smith who originally described himself as an amateur diver was responsible for locating anew the wreckage Brian Gilgeous and Smith worked together towards K s subsequent recovery The wreckage was recovered between October when the first small sections were raised May when Campbell s body was recovered and March The largest section representing approximately two thirds of the main hull was salvaged on March The recovery was witnessed by a small group of onlookers including Ken Norris and Campbell s widow Tonia In Mike Rossiter from BBC TV had approached the Bluebird Project team with a view to filming the wreck He was also there at the time K was brought ashore br Bill Smith returned in to locate and recover more pieces of K from Coniston Water br Campbell s body was retrieved from the lake on May He was interred in Coniston cemetery on September that year after a funeral service at St Andrews Church in Coniston Campbell s sister Jean Wales had been against the recovery of the boat and her brother s body out of respect for his stated wish that in the event of something going wrong Skipper and boat stay together br br br Restoration and rebuilding of Bluebird K br br br Consent for the works to proceed br As the work to recover K and the body of Donald Campbell from the lakebed was underway Paul Foulkes Halbard a former business associate of Campbell and owner of Filching Manor Motor Museum in Polegate had claimed he acquired ownership of the boat in the course of business dealings with DMC His museum already had an extensive collection of Campbell related exhibits including Bluebird K His claim was rejected by a consent order lodged at the High Court in London on September which declared Tonia Bern Campbell and the executors of Campbell s will as the rightful owners On behalf of the Campbell family Gina Campbell directed that the wreckage raised in March should be kept at the premises of Bill Smith in Newcastle upon Tyne from the March date pending the court s decision on K s future ownership The Argus also reported in September It is the family s intention that the boat will be displayed at the Ruskin Museum in Coniston which will now have to be extended to accommodate it br In November a few months after the wreck of K had been recovered Gina Campbell Donald s daughter in an interview with the BBC s Kevin Bocquet in Cumbria spoke of her plans to fully restore the Bluebird craft in memory of her father It would be my own tribute to my father who was the bravest man I ever knew We had two choices said Gina Either we could lock her away and she would never have been seen again or we could completely restore her back to her old beauty We could never display her in the state she is in I do not want people to see her like this I would be worried about how children would react to her I think they would find it too frightening I want Bluebird to be restored and to go on display in Coniston so that people will always remember what a fantastic brave man my father was br On December Gina Campbell by Deed of gift and on behalf of the Campbell Family Heritage Trust formally transferred ownership of Bluebird K the associated parts of the vessel both recovered and unrecovered and all other associated items and objects recovered and or unrecovered including clothing and overalls of Donald Campbell to the Ruskin Museum in Coniston In agreement with the Trust and the museum Bill Smith agreed to organise the restoration of the boat free of charge br In background information provided to accompany an interview with Gina Campbell in Leatherhead District Local History Society published the following In May permission was given for a one off set of proving trials on Coniston Water where it would be tested to a safe speed for demonstration purposes only K was to be housed in its own purpose built wing at the Ruskin Museum while remaining in the care of the Bluebird Project br Future running and care was later superseded by agreement via the Tomlin order and an open letter from the Ruskin Museum br In January on the occasion of the fifty third anniversary of Donald Campbell s death The Guardian reported Gina Campbell clashed with vessel s restorer over its return to scene of father s death in Lake District br br br Scope of restoration works br Gina Campbell described the rebuilding of Bluebird K as nothing short of a miracle The restoration continued throughout a number of phases using the Norris Brothers original drawings together with access to Neil Sheppard s collection of photographs and illustrations br br Assessment of the dozen or so pieces recovered from the wreck as to which parts could be repaired and reused and which others would be remade br Evaluating the effects of long term corrosion on the various metals used in the construction of the craft The steel frame itself was almost inert The Nimonic Stainless steel jetpipe was inert Other metals used in the construction of the craft were lead ballast copper plumbing pipe for the fire extinguishers various grades of aluminium skins and a magnesium engine casing br Decision to proceed with full restoration for running br Reinstatement of the central steel space frame to recreate a rigid core structure free from bend twist or uneven deflection under load When the frame was stripped down and subjected to X ray testing for Weld quality assurance it was found to be in poor condition not only as a result of crash damage and corrosion but also due to the inferior welding quality of the fabrication D scanning of the space frame indicated anomalies in the alignment which might have predated the WSR attempt on Coniston Water Repair and rebuilding of the frame required plating riveting and welding using Tungsten Inert Gas TIG welding sets It was blasted then wet painted with Interzinc a zinc rich primer then polyester powder coat on top The inside of every tube was opened with a mm hole all dust and rivet stems removed then misted internally with Ardrox AV aerospace inhibitor then the holes closed with a rubber grommet On reassembly every rivet stem entering the frame was wet riveted using Naftoseal polysulphide sealant supplied by Airbus br Reinstatement of aluminium body panels engine cover hull and sponsons involved time consuming traditional light engineering skills including where necessary machine tools such as guillotine brake press English wheel and power hammer for intricate panel forming repair or for remaking br Locate a suitable Bristol Siddeley Orpheus engine recondition and test it to the same performance level of its counterpart lost when K went down in The replacement engine was donated by De Havilland Aviation in The Orpheus engine required modification to suit the rebuilt craft br Install engine with cockpit controls fuel delivery systems inboard fire extinguishing system fuel tanks pumps and lines hydraulics including motors valves pumps and lines rudders and water brake br Restoration and installation of K s air starter including introduction of new seals by using original drawings and Inspection test procedure ITP sourced from the archives of Rotax Ltd Willesden London NW the system s manufacturer br Make ready for crew training and shakedown br By early K had been substantially restored in a workshop at Kiltech Industrial Units on Hudson Street North Shields Tyne and Wear by The Bluebird Project to a high standard of working condition using a significant proportion of her original fabric but with a replacement Bristol Siddeley Orpheus engine loaned to them by Geoff Beck former CEO of De Havilland Aviation of a similar type albeit incorporating many original components br On March Bluebird K arrived back in Coniston after a successful legal ownership campaign and was collected by the Ruskin Museum from Bill Smith s property in North Tyneside where excluding its visit to Bute in it had been since March br br br Re floating br On March the restoration was featured on the BBC s The One Show It was announced that Bluebird K would return to the water on Loch Fad on the Isle of Bute in Scotland in August for handling trials once the restoration work on Bluebird was sufficiently advanced to be able to do so She was transported to Loch Fad where she was refloated in the presence of Gina Campbell on August Following initial engine tests on August Bluebird completed a series of test runs on the loch reaching speeds of around mph br The team confirmed that K conformed to its design standards throughout the trials The thrust from the BS Orpheus engine initially peaked at some throttle as the craft climbed out of the displacement mode and started to plane This phenomenon is known as Hump Drag as the craft requires additional power to overcome the turbulence caused by its own ploughing movement Once in planing mode the pilot was able to throttle back to some of output allowing the craft to maintain a constant speed of approximately mph When slowing down it was noticed that the planing mode was maintained down to speed of mph before returning to displacement mode br The paramount characteristic of K s design was the ease and elegance with which it sped across the water holding firm once it was in planing mode The remarkable feature of K is its capacity to displace so little water At record equalling speed the wetted areas for each front plane rear tip of each sponson was calculated to be square inches and square inches for the rear trailing edge of the hull Furthermore The immersion depth was a tiny at the front and even less at the rear br br br Civil litigation br On February The Ruskin Museum served legal papers on Bill Smith and Bluebird Project Ltd to ensure that the rebuilt Bluebird K was handed to its owners since the Deed of gift granted in December The case was settled prior to a hearing after Smith decided to walk away resulting in a Tomlin order which confirmed that neither Bill Smith or the Bluebird Project had any further right title or interest in the restored but engineless Bluebird K and all its parts It also clarified an agreed proportion of the costs to be paid to the Ruskin museum and ensured that K would be housed in the purpose built Bluebird wing of the museum br br br Future running br In December The Ruskin Museum announced Lancashire based WEC Group Ltd as its chosen engineering partners to maintain Bluebird K once she is returned to Coniston Three Orpheus engines have also been donated to the Museum as The Ruskin Museum plan to run K on Coniston Water once it is returned The models of Orpheus the Ruskin have been gifted to date are two s and a single The s were made for the Fiat G aircraft and the s for the Folland Gnat aircraft br As of April just one month since her return to Coniston there had been visits to see K at the Ruskin Museum and that to date is more public views than at any time since the s br The museum have announced that they have plans to run K on Coniston Water in br br br br br br
