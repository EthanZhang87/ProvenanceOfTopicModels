The Vietnam War was a conflict in Vietnam Laos and Cambodia from November to the fall of Saigon on April It was the second of the Indochina Wars and a major conflict of the Cold War While the war was officially fought between North Vietnam and South Vietnam the north was supported by the Soviet Union China and other communist states while the south was supported by the US and anti communist allies This made it a proxy war between the US and Soviet Union It lasted almost years with direct US military involvement ending in The conflict spilled into the Laotian and Cambodian civil wars which ended with all three countries becoming communist in br After the fall of French Indochina with the Geneva Conference the country gained independence from France but was divided into two parts the Viet Minh took control of North Vietnam while the US assumed financial and military support for South Vietnam The Viet Cong VC a South Vietnamese common front under the direction of the north initiated guerrilla war in the south The People s Army of Vietnam PAVN engaged in more conventional warfare with US and Army of the Republic of Vietnam ARVN forces North Vietnam invaded Laos in establishing the Ho Chi Minh trail to supply and reinforce the VC By the north had sent soldiers to fight in the south US involvement increased under President John F Kennedy from military advisors in to by br Following the Gulf of Tonkin incident in the US Congress passed a resolution that gave President Johnson authority to increase military presence without a declaration of war Johnson ordered deployment of combat units and dramatically increased American troops to US and South Vietnamese forces relied on air supremacy and overwhelming firepower to conduct search and destroy operations The US conducted a strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam and built up its forces despite little progress In North Vietnam launched the Tet Offensive a tactical defeat but a strategic victory as it caused US domestic support to fade In North Vietnam declared the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam The deposing of Cambodia s monarch resulted in a PAVN invasion of the country and then a US ARVN counter invasion escalating Cambodia s Civil War After Richard Nixon s election in a policy of Vietnamization began which saw the conflict fought by an expanded ARVN while US forces withdrew due to domestic opposition US ground forces had mostly withdrawn by the Paris Peace Accords saw all US forces withdrawn and were broken almost immediately fighting continued for two years Phnom Penh fell to the Khmer Rouge in April while the spring offensive saw the Fall of Saigon to the PAVN marking the end of the war North and South Vietnam were reunified on July the following year br The war exacted enormous human cost estimates of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed range from to million Some Cambodians Laotians and US service members died Its end would precipitate the Vietnamese boat people and the larger Indochina refugee crisis which saw millions leave Indochina an estimated perished at sea The Khmer Rouge carried out the Cambodian genocide while conflict between them and the unified Vietnam escalated into the Cambodian Vietnamese War In response China invaded Vietnam with border conflicts lasting until Within the US the war gave rise to Vietnam syndrome a public aversion to American overseas military involvement which with the Watergate scandal contributed to the crisis of confidence that affected America throughout the s The US destroyed of South Vietnam s jungle and of the mangrove forests by spraying over million U S gallons million liters of toxic herbicides a notable example of ecocide br br br Names br Various names have been applied and have shifted over time though Vietnam War is the most commonly used title in English It has been called the Second Indochina War since it spread to Laos and Cambodia the Vietnam Conflict and Nam colloquially Nam In Vietnam it is commonly known as Kh ng chi n ch ng M lit Resistance War against America The Vietnamese Government officially refers to it as the Resistance War against America to Save the Nation It is sometimes called the American War br br br Background br br Vietnam had been under French control as part of French Indochina since the mid th century Under French rule Vietnamese nationalism was suppressed so revolutionary groups conducted their activities abroad in France and China One such nationalist Nguyen Sinh Cung established the Indochinese Communist Party in a Marxist Leninist political organization which operated primarily in Hong Kong and the Soviet Union The party aimed to overthrow French rule and establish an independent communist state in Vietnam br br br Japanese occupation of Indochina br br In September Japan invaded French Indochina following France s capitulation to Nazi Germany French influence was suppressed by the Japanese and in Cung now known as Ho Chi Minh returned to Vietnam to establish the Viet Minh an anti Japanese resistance movement that advocated for independence The Viet Minh received aid from the Allies namely the US Soviet Union and China Beginning in the US Office of Strategic Services O S S provided the Viet Minh with weapons ammunition and training to fight the occupying Japanese and Vichy French forces President Franklin D Roosevelt was an ardent supporter of Vietnamese resistance and proposed Vietnam s independence be granted following the war br Following the surrender of Japan in the Viet Minh launched the August Revolution overthrowing the Japanese backed Empire of Vietnam and seizing weapons from the surrendering Japanese forces On September Ho Chi Minh proclaimed the Declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam DRV However on September French forces overthrew the DRV and reinstated French rule American support for the Viet Minh promptly ended and O S S forces left as the French sought to reassert control br br br First Indochina War br br Tensions between the Viet Minh and French authorities had erupted into full scale war by a conflict which soon became entwined into the Cold War On March US President Harry S Truman announced the Truman Doctrine an anticommunist foreign policy which pledged US support to nations resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures In January the communist states of China and the Soviet Union recognized the Viet Minh s Democratic Republic of Vietnam based in Hanoi as the legitimate government The following month the capitalist countries of the US and UK recognized the French backed State of Vietnam in Saigon led by former Emperor B o i as the legitimate government The outbreak of the Korean War in June convinced Washington policymakers that the war in Indochina was another example of communist expansionism directed by the Soviet Union br Military advisors from China began assisting the Viet Minh in July Chinese weapons expertise and laborers transformed the Viet Minh from a guerrilla force into a regular army In September the US enforced the Truman Doctrine by creating a Military Assistance and Advisory Group MAAG to screen French requests for aid advise on strategy and train Vietnamese soldiers By the US had spent billion in support of the French military effort shouldering of the cost of the war br br br Battle of Dien Bien Phu br br During the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in US carriers sailed to the Gulf of Tonkin and the US conducted reconnaissance flights France and the US discussed the use of tactical nuclear weapons though reports of how seriously this was considered and by whom are vague According to then Vice President Richard Nixon the Joint Chiefs of Staff drew up plans to use nuclear weapons to support the French Nixon a so called hawk suggested the US might have to put American boys in President Dwight D Eisenhower made American participation contingent on British support but the British were opposed Eisenhower wary of involving the US in an Asian land war decided against intervention Throughout the conflict US intelligence estimates remained skeptical of France s chance of success br On May the French garrison at Dien Bien Phu surrendered The defeat marked the end of French military involvement in Indochina At the Geneva Conference they negotiated a ceasefire with the Viet Minh and independence was granted to Cambodia Laos and Vietnam br br br Transition period br br At the Geneva Conference Vietnam was temporarily partitioned at the th parallel Ho Chi Minh wished to continue war in the south but was restrained by Chinese allies who convinced him he could win control by electoral means Under the Geneva Accords civilians were allowed to move freely between the two provisional states for a day period Elections throughout the country were to be held in to establish a unified government However the US represented by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles objected to the resolution Dulles objection was supported only by the representative of B o i Roughly one million northerners mainly minority Catholics fled south fearing persecution by the Communists This followed an American psychological warfare campaign headed by the CIA under director Allen Dulles which exaggerated anti Catholic sentiment among the Viet Minh and distributed propaganda attributed to Viet Minh threatening an American attack on Hanoi with atomic bombs The exodus was coordinated by a U S funded million relocation program which included the Seventh Fleet to ferry refugees The northern mainly Catholic refugees gave the later Ng nh Di m regime a strong anti communist constituency br Over Revolutionary Regroupees went to the north for regroupment expecting to return south within two years The Viet Minh left roughly to cadres in the south as a base for insurgency The last French soldiers left South Vietnam in April and the PRC completed its withdrawal from North Vietnam br br Between and the North Vietnamese government instituted agrarian reforms including rent reduction and land reform which resulted in political oppression During land reform North Vietnamese witnesses suggested a ratio of one execution for every village residents which extrapolates to executions Because the campaign was mainly in the Red River Delta area executions became accepted by scholars However declassified documents from Vietnamese and Hungarian archives indicate executions were much lower though likely greater than In leaders in Hanoi admitted to excesses in implementing this program and restored much of the land to the original owners br The south meanwhile constituted the State of Vietnam with B o i as Emperor and Ng nh Di m as prime minister Neither the US nor Di m s State of Vietnam signed anything at the Geneva Conference The non communist Vietnamese delegation objected strenuously to any division of Vietnam but lost when the French accepted the proposal of Viet Minh delegate Ph m V n ng who proposed Vietnam eventually be united by elections under the supervision of local commissions The US countered with what became known as the American Plan with the support of South Vietnam and the UK It provided for unification elections under the supervision of the UN but was rejected by the Soviet delegation The US said With respect to the statement made by the representative of the State of Vietnam the United States reiterates its traditional position that peoples are entitled to determine their own future and that it will not join in any arrangement which would hinder this br US President Eisenhower wrote in br br I have never talked or corresponded with a person knowledgeable in Indochinese affairs who did not agree that had elections been held as of the time of the fighting possibly of the population would have voted for the Communist Ho Chi Minh as their leader rather than Chief of State B o i Indeed the lack of leadership and drive on the part of B o i was a factor in the feeling prevalent among Vietnamese that they had nothing to fight for br br According to the Pentagon Papers which commented on Eisenhower s observation Di m would have been a more popular candidate than B o i against H stating that It is almost certain that by the proportion which might have voted for Ho in a free election against Diem would have been much smaller than In independent observers from India Poland and Canada representing the International Control Commission ICC stated that fair elections were impossible with the ICC reporting that neither South nor North Vietnam had honored the armistice agreement br From April to June Di m eliminated political opposition in the south by launching operations against religious groups the Cao i and H a H o of Ba C t The campaign also attacked the B nh Xuy n organized crime group which was allied with members of the communist party secret police and had military elements The group was defeated in April following a battle in Saigon As broad based opposition to his harsh tactics mounted Di m increasingly sought to blame the communists br In a referendum on the future of the State of Vietnam in October Di m rigged the poll supervised by his brother Ng nh Nhu and was credited with of the vote including in Saigon His American advisors had recommended a more modest winning margin of to percent Di m however viewed the election as a test of authority He declared South Vietnam to be an independent state under the name Republic of Vietnam ROV with him as president Likewise Ho Chi Minh and other communists won at least of the vote in North Vietnamese elections br The domino theory which argued that if a country fell to communism all surrounding countries would follow was first proposed by the Eisenhower administration John F Kennedy then a senator said in a speech to the American Friends of Vietnam Burma Thailand India Japan the Philippines and obviously Laos and Cambodia are among those whose security would be threatened if the Red Tide of Communism overflowed into Vietnam br br br Di m era br br br Rule br br A devout Roman Catholic Di m was fervently anti communist nationalist and socially conservative Historian Luu Doan Huynh notes Di m represented narrow and extremist nationalism coupled with autocracy and nepotism Most Vietnamese were Buddhist and alarmed by Di m s actions like his dedication of the country to the Virgin Mary br In the summer of Di m launched the Denounce the Communists campaign during which suspected communists and other anti government elements were arrested imprisoned tortured or executed He instituted the death penalty in August against activity deemed communist The North Vietnamese government claimed that by November over individuals were imprisoned and killed in the process According to Gabriel Kolko political prisoners had been jailed by the end of In October Di m launched a land reform program limiting the size of rice farms per owner m acres of farm land became available for purchase by landless people By the process had stalled because many of Diem s biggest supporters were large landowners br In May Di m undertook a day state visit to the US President Eisenhower pledged his continued support and a parade was held in Di m s honor But Secretary of State Dulles privately conceded Di m had to be backed because they could find no better alternative br br br Insurgency in the South br br Between and the Di m government succeeded in preventing large scale organized unrest in the countryside In April insurgents launched an assassination campaign referred to as extermination of traitors people were killed in the Ch u c massacre at a bar in July and in September a district chief was killed with his family By early Di m had come to regard the violence as an organized campaign and implemented Law which made political violence punishable by death and property confiscation There had been division among former Viet Minh whose main goal was to hold elections promised in the Geneva Accords leading to wildcat activities separate from the other communists and anti GVN activists Douglas Pike estimated that insurgents carried out abductions and assassinations of government officials village chiefs hospital workers and teachers from to Violence between insurgents and government forces increased drastically from clashes in January to clashes in September br In September COSVN North Vietnam s southern headquarters ordered a coordinated uprising in South Vietnam against the government and a third of the population was soon living in areas of communist control In December North Vietnam formally created the Viet Cong with the intent of uniting all anti GVN insurgents including non communists It was formed in Memot Cambodia and directed through COSVN The Viet Cong placed heavy emphasis on the withdrawal of American advisors and influence on land reform and liberalization of the GVN on coalition government and the neutralization of Vietnam The identities of the leaders of the organization were often kept secret br Support for the VC was driven by resentment of Diem s reversal of Viet Minh land reforms in the countryside The Viet Minh had confiscated large private landholdings reduced rents and debts and leased communal lands mostly to poorer peasants Diem brought the landlords back people who had been farming land for years had to return it to landlords and pay years of back rent Marilyn B Young wrote that The divisions within villages reproduced those that had existed against the French support for the NLF trying to remain neutral and firmly pro government br br br North Vietnamese involvement br br In March southern communist leader L Du n presented a plan to revive the insurgency entitled The Road to the South to the Politburo in Hanoi However as China and the Soviets opposed confrontation his plan was rejected Despite this the North Vietnamese leadership approved tentative measures to revive southern insurgency in December Communist forces were under a single command structure set up in In May North Vietnamese forces seized the transportation hub at Tchepone in Southern Laos near the demilitarized zone between North and South Vietnam br The North Vietnamese Communist Party approved a people s war on the South at a session in January and in May Group was established to maintain and upgrade the Ho Chi Minh trail at this time a six month mountain trek through Laos On July North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces invaded Laos fighting the Royal Lao Army all along the border About of the regroupees of were sent south on the trail during its first year of operation The first arms delivery via the trail was completed in August In April North Vietnam imposed universal military conscription for men About communist soldiers infiltrated the south from to br br br Kennedy s escalation br br In the U S presidential election Senator John F Kennedy defeated incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon Although Eisenhower warned Kennedy about Laos and Vietnam Europe and Latin America loomed larger than Asia on his sights In June he bitterly disagreed with Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev when they met in Vienna to discuss key U S Soviet issues Only months later the Cuban Missile Crisis October played out on television worldwide It was the closest the Cold War came to nuclear war br The Kennedy administration remained committed to the Cold War foreign policy inherited from the Truman and Eisenhower administrations In the US had troops based in South Korea and Kennedy faced four crisis situations the failure of the Bay of Pigs Invasion he had approved in April settlement negotiations between the pro Western government of Laos and the Pathet Lao communist movement in May construction of the Berlin Wall in August and the Cuban Missile Crisis in October Kennedy believed another failure to stop communist expansion would irreparably damage US credibility He was determined to draw a line in the sand and prevent a communist victory in Vietnam He told James Reston of The New York Times after the Vienna summit with Khrushchev Now we have a problem making our power credible and Vietnam looks like the place br Kennedy s policy toward South Vietnam assumed Di m and his forces had to defeat the guerrillas on their own He was against the deployment of American combat troops and observed to introduce U S forces in large numbers there today while it might have an initially favorable military impact would almost certainly lead to adverse political and in the long run adverse military consequences The quality of the South Vietnamese military however remained poor Poor leadership corruption and political promotions weakened the ARVN The frequency of guerrilla attacks rose as the insurgency gathered steam While Hanoi s support for the Viet Cong played a role South Vietnamese governmental incompetence was at the core of the crisis br br One major issue Kennedy raised was whether the Soviet space and missile programs had surpassed those of the US Although Kennedy stressed long range missile parity with the Soviets he was interested in using special forces for counterinsurgency warfare in Third World countries threatened by communist insurgencies Although they were intended for use behind front lines after a conventional Soviet invasion of Europe Kennedy believed guerrilla tactics employed by special forces such as the Green Berets would be effective in a brush fire war in Vietnam br Kennedy advisors Maxwell Taylor and Walt Rostow recommended US troops be sent to South Vietnam disguised as flood relief workers Kennedy rejected the idea but increased military assistance In April John Kenneth Galbraith warned Kennedy of the danger we shall replace the French as a colonial force in the area and bleed as the French did Eisenhower put advisors in Vietnam and by November Kennedy had put military personnel there br The Strategic Hamlet Program was initiated in late This joint U S South Vietnamese program attempted to resettle the rural population into fortified villages It was implemented in early and involved some forced relocation and segregation of rural South Vietnamese into new communities where the peasantry would be isolated from the Viet Cong It was hoped these new communities would provide security for the peasants and strengthen the tie between them and the central government However by November the program had waned and it ended in In July nations including China South Vietnam the Soviet Union North Vietnam and the US signed an agreement promising to respect Laos neutrality br br br Ousting and assassination of Ng nh Di m br br The inept performance of the ARVN was exemplified by failed actions such as the Battle of p B c on January in which a band of Viet Cong won a battle against a much larger and better equipped South Vietnamese force many of whose officers seemed reluctant even to engage in combat The South Vietnamese lost soldiers and US war helicopters serving to ferry troops shot down by Vietcong forces while the Vietcong lost only soldiers The ARVN forces were led by Di m s most trusted general Hu nh V n Cao Cao was a Catholic promoted due to religion and fidelity rather than skill and his main job was to preserve his forces to stave off coups Policymakers in Washington began to conclude Di m was incapable of defeating the communists and might even make a deal with Ho Chi Minh He seemed concerned only with fending off coups and had become paranoid after attempts in and which he partly attributed to US encouragement As Robert F Kennedy noted Di m wouldn t make even the slightest concessions He was difficult to reason with Historian James Gibson summed up the situation br br Strategic hamlets had failed The South Vietnamese regime was incapable of winning the peasantry because of its class base among landlords Indeed there was no longer a regime in the sense of a relatively stable political alliance and functioning bureaucracy Instead civil government and military operations had virtually ceased The National Liberation Front had made great progress and was close to declaring provisional revolutionary governments in large areas br Discontent with Di m s policies exploded in May following the Hu Ph t n shootings of Buddhists protesting the ban on displaying the Buddhist flag on Vesak Buddha s birthday This resulted in mass protests the Buddhist crisis against discriminatory policies that gave privileges to Catholics over the Buddhist majority Di m s elder brother Ng nh Th c was the Archbishop of Hu and aggressively blurred the separation between church and state Thuc s anniversary celebrations occurred shortly before Vesak had been bankrolled by the government and Vatican flags were displayed prominently There had been reports of Catholic paramilitaries demolishing Buddhist pagodas throughout Di m s rule Di m refused to make concessions to the Buddhist majority or take responsibility for the deaths On August the ARVN Special Forces of Colonel L Quang Tung loyal to Di m s younger brother Ng nh Nhu raided pagodas causing widespread destruction and leaving a death toll into the hundreds br br US officials began discussing regime change during the middle of The United States Department of State wanted to encourage a coup while the Pentagon favored Di m Chief among the proposed changes was removal of Di m s younger brother Nhu who controlled the secret police and special forces and was seen as being behind the Buddhist repression and the architect of the Ng family s rule This proposal was conveyed to the US embassy in Saigon in Cable The CIA contacted generals planning to remove Di m and told them the US would not oppose such a move nor punish them by cutting off aid Di m was executed along with his brother on November When Kennedy was informed Maxwell Taylor remembered he rushed from the room with a look of shock and dismay on his face Kennedy had not anticipated Di m s murder The U S ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge invited the coup leaders to the embassy and congratulated them Lodge informed Kennedy that the prospects now are for a shorter war Kennedy wrote Lodge a letter congratulating him for a fine job br Following the coup chaos ensued Hanoi took advantage and increased its support for the guerrillas South Vietnam entered extreme political instability as one military government toppled another in quick succession Increasingly each new regime was viewed by the communists as a puppet of the Americans whatever the failings of Di m his credentials as a nationalist had been impeccable US advisors were embedded at every level of the South Vietnamese armed forces They were however criticized for ignoring the political nature of the insurgency The Kennedy administration sought to refocus US efforts on pacification which in this case was defined as countering the growing threat of insurgency and winning the hearts and minds of the population Military leadership in Washington however was hostile to any role for U S advisors other than troop training General Paul Harkins the commander of U S forces in South Vietnam confidently predicted victory by Christmas The CIA was less optimistic however warning that the Viet Cong by and large retain de facto control of much of the countryside and have steadily increased the overall intensity of the effort br Paramilitary officers from the CIA s Special Activities Division trained and led Hmong tribesmen in Laos and into Vietnam The indigenous forces were in the tens of thousands and conducted direct action missions led by paramilitary officers against the Communist Pathet Lao forces and their North Vietnamese supporters The CIA ran the Phoenix Program and participated in the Military Assistance Command Vietnam Studies and Observations Group MAC V SOG br br br Gulf of Tonkin and Johnson s escalation br br President Kennedy was assassinated on November Vice President Lyndon B Johnson had not been heavily involved with policy toward Vietnam however upon becoming president he immediately focused it On November he said the battle against communism must be joined with strength and determination Johnson knew he had inherited a deteriorating situation in South Vietnam but adhered to the widely accepted domino argument for defending the South Should they retreat or appease either action would imperil other nations Findings from RAND s Viet Cong Motivation and Morale Project bolstered his confidence that an air war would weaken the Viet Cong Some argue the policy of North Vietnam was not to topple other non communist governments in South East Asia br The military revolutionary council meeting in lieu of a strong South Vietnamese leader had members It was headed by General D ng V n Minh whom journalist Stanley Karnow recalled as a model of lethargy Lodge cabled home about Minh Will he be strong enough to get on top of things Minh s regime was overthrown in January by General Nguy n Kh nh There was persistent instability in the military several coups not all successful occurred in a short period of time br br br Gulf of Tonkin incident br br On August USS Maddox on an intelligence mission along North Vietnam s coast allegedly fired upon and damaged torpedo boats stalking it in the Gulf of Tonkin A second attack was reported two days later on USS Turner Joy and Maddox The circumstances were murky Johnson commented to Undersecretary of State George Ball that those sailors out there may have been shooting at flying fish An NSA publication declassified in revealed there was no attack on August br The second attack led to retaliatory airstrikes and prompted Congress to approve the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution on August The resolution granted the president power to take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the United States and to prevent further aggression and Johnson relied on this as giving him authority to expand the war Johnson pledged he was not committing American boys to fighting a war that I think ought to be fought by the boys of Asia to help protect their own land br The National Security Council recommended a three stage escalation of the bombing of North Vietnam Following an attack on a U S Army base on February airstrikes were initiated while Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin was on a state visit to North Vietnam Operation Rolling Thunder and Operation Arc Light expanded aerial bombardment and ground support operations The bombing campaign which lasted years was intended to force North Vietnam to cease its support for the Viet Cong by threatening to destroy North Vietnamese air defenses and infrastructure It was additionally aimed at bolstering South Vietnamese morale Between March and November Rolling Thunder deluged the north with a million tons of missiles rockets and bombs br br br Bombing of Laos br br Bombing was not restricted to North Vietnam Other aerial campaigns targeted different parts of the Viet Cong and PAVN infrastructure These included the Ho Chi Minh trail supply route which ran through Laos and Cambodia The ostensibly neutral Laos had become the scene of a civil war pitting the Laotian government backed by the US against the Pathet Lao and its North Vietnamese allies br Massive aerial bombardment against the Pathet Lao and PAVN forces was carried out by the US to prevent the collapse of the Royal central government and deny use of the Ho Chi Minh Trail Between and the U S dropped two million tons of bombs on Laos nearly equal to the million tons of bombs it dropped on Europe and Asia during World War II making Laos the most heavily bombed country in history relative to its population br The objective of stopping North Vietnam and the Viet Cong was never reached The Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force Curtis LeMay however had long advocated saturation bombing in Vietnam and wrote of the communists that we re going to bomb them back into the Stone Age br br br The offensive br br Following the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution Hanoi anticipated the arrival of US troops and began expanding the Viet Cong as well as sending increasing numbers of North Vietnamese personnel southwards They were outfitting the Viet Cong forces and standardizing their equipment with AK rifles and other supplies as well as forming the th Division From a strength of approximately at the start of the Viet Cong s ranks grew to about at the end of Between and the Army s strength rose from about to nearly a million men U S troop numbers deployed to Vietnam during the same period were much lower in rising to in The use of captured equipment decreased while greater numbers of ammunition and supplies were required to maintain regular units Group was tasked with expanding the Ho Chi Minh trail in light of the bombardment by US warplanes The war had shifted into the final conventional phase of Hanoi s three stage protracted warfare model The Viet Cong was now tasked with destroying the ARVN and capturing and holding areas however it was not yet strong enough to assault major towns and cities br In December ARVN forces suffered heavy losses at the Battle of B nh Gi in a battle both sides viewed as a watershed Previously the VC had utilized hit and run guerrilla tactics At Binh Gia however they defeated a strong ARVN force in a conventional battle and remained in the field for four days Tellingly South Vietnamese forces were again defeated in June at the Battle of ng Xo i br br br American ground war br br On March U S Marines were landed near Da Nang South Vietnam This marked the beginning of the American ground war U S public opinion overwhelmingly supported the deployment The Marines initial assignment was defense of Da Nang Air Base The first deployment of in March was increased to nearly by December U S military had long been schooled in offensive warfare Regardless of political policies U S commanders were institutionally and psychologically unsuited to a defensive mission br General William Westmoreland informed Admiral U S Grant Sharp Jr commander of U S Pacific forces that the situation was critical I am convinced that U S troops with their energy mobility and firepower can successfully take the fight to the NLF Viet Cong With this recommendation Westmoreland was advocating an aggressive departure from America s defensive posture and the sidelining of the South Vietnamese By ignoring ARVN units the U S commitment became open ended Westmoreland outlined a three point plan to win the war br br Phase Commitment of U S and allied forces necessary to halt the losing trend by the end of br Phase U S and allied forces mount major offensive actions to seize the initiative to destroy guerrilla and organized enemy forces This phase would end when the enemy had been worn down and driven back from major populated areas br Phase If the enemy persisted a period of months following Phase would be required for final destruction of enemy forces remaining in remote base areas br The plan was approved by Johnson and marked a profound departure from the insistence that South Vietnam was responsible for defeating the guerrillas Westmoreland predicted victory by the end of Johnson did not communicate this change in strategy to the media Instead he emphasized continuity The change in policy depended on matching the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong in a contest of attrition and morale The opponents were locked in a cycle of escalation Westmoreland and McNamara touted the body count system for gauging victory a metric that would prove flawed br br The American buildup transformed the South Vietnamese economy and had a profound effect on society South Vietnam was inundated with manufactured goods Washington encouraged its SEATO allies to contribute troops Australia New Zealand Thailand and the Philippines agreed to do so South Korea would ask to join the Many Flags program in return for economic compensation Major allies however notably NATO countries Canada and the UK declined troop requests br The U S and its allies mounted complex search and destroy operations In November the U S engaged in its first major battle with the PAVN the Battle of Ia Drang The operation was the first large scale helicopter air assault by the U S and first to employ Boeing B Stratofortress strategic bombers in support These tactics continued in however the PAVN VC insurgents remained elusive and demonstrated tactical flexibility By the war had generated large scale internal refugees million in South Vietnam with people evacuated and rendered homeless during Operation Masher alone which was the largest search and destroy operation to that point Operation Masher would have negligible impact however as the PAVN VC returned to the province just four months after it ended Despite major operations which the Viet Cong and PAVN would typically evade the war was characterized by smaller unit contacts or engagements The Viet Cong and PAVN would initiate of large firefights and thus the PAVN Viet Cong would retain strategic initiative despite overwhelming US force and fire power deployment The PAVN and Viet Cong had developed strategies capable of countering US military doctrines and tactics see NLF and PAVN battle tactics br Meanwhile the political situation in South Vietnam began to stabilize with the arrival of prime minister Air Marshal Nguy n Cao K and figurehead chief of state General Nguy n V n Thi u in mid at the head of a junta In Thieu became president with Ky as his deputy after rigged elections Although they were nominally a civilian government Ky was supposed to maintain real power through a behind the scenes military body However Thieu outmanoeuvred and sidelined Ky Thieu was accused of murdering Ky loyalists through contrived military accidents Thieu remained president until having won a one candidate election in br Johnson employed a policy of minimum candor with the media Military information officers sought to manage coverage by emphasizing stories that portrayed progress This policy damaged the public trust in official pronouncements As coverage of the war and the Pentagon diverged a so called credibility gap developed Despite Johnson and Westmoreland publicly proclaiming victory and Westmoreland stating the end is coming into view internal reports in the Pentagon Papers indicate that Viet Cong forces retained strategic initiative and controlled their losses Viet Cong attacks against static US positions accounted for of engagements Viet Cong PAVN ambushes and encirclements for American ambushes against Viet Cong PAVN forces for and American forces attacking Viet Cong emplacements only br br br Tet Offensive br br In late the PAVN lured American forces into the hinterlands at k T and at the Marine Khe Sanh combat base where the U S fought The Hill Fights These were part of a diversionary strategy meant to draw US forces towards the Central Highlands Preparations were underway for the Tet Offensive with the intention of V n Ti n D ng forces to launch direct attacks on the American and puppet nerve centers Saigon Hu Danang all the cities towns and main bases Le Duan sought to placate critics of the stalemate by planning a decisive victory He reasoned this could be achieved through sparking an uprising within the towns and cities along with mass defections among ARVN units who were on leave during the truce period br The Tet Offensive began on January as over cities were attacked by over VC PAVN troops including assaults on military installations headquarters and government buildings including the U S Embassy in Saigon U S and South Vietnamese forces were shocked by the scale intensity and deliberative planning as infiltration of personnel and weapons into the cities was accomplished covertly the offensive constituted an intelligence failure on the scale of Pearl Harbor Most cities were recaptured within weeks except the former imperial capital Hu which PAVN Viet Cong troops held on for days They executed approximately unarmed Hu civilians and foreigners they considered to be spies In the following Battle of Hu American forces employed massive firepower that left of the city in ruins At Qu ng Tr City the ARVN Airborne Division the st Division and a regiment of the US st Cavalry Division managed to hold out and overcome an assault intended to capture the city In Saigon Viet Cong PAVN fighters had captured areas in and around the city attacking key installations before US and ARVN forces dislodged them after three weeks During one battle Peter Arnett reported an infantry commander saying of the Battle of B n Tre that it became necessary to destroy the village in order to save it br br During the first month of the offensive Americans and other allied troops ARVN and civilians were killed After two months nearly ARVN and over U S forces had been killed and wounded The U S claimed of the PAVN and Viet Cong had been killed and wounded A month later a second offensive known as the May Offensive was launched it demonstrated the Viet Cong were still capable of carrying out orchestrated nationwide offensives Two months later a third offensive was launched Phase III Offensive PAVN records of their losses across all three offensives was killed and total casualties It had become the bloodiest year up to then The failure to spark a general uprising and lack of defections among the ARVN units meant both war goals of Hanoi had fallen flat at enormous cost By the end of the VC insurgents held almost no territory in South Vietnam and their recruitment dropped by over signifying a drastic reduction in guerrilla operations necessitating increased use of PAVN regular soldiers from the north br Prior to Tet in November Westmoreland had spearheaded a public relations drive for the Johnson administration to bolster flagging public support In a speech to the National Press Club he said a point had been reached where the end comes into view Thus the public was shocked and confused when Westmoreland s predictions were trumped by the Tet Offensive Public approval of his performance dropped from to and endorsement for the war fell from to The public and media began to turn against Johnson as the offensives contradicted claims of progress br At one point in Westmoreland considered the use of nuclear weapons in a contingency plan codenamed Fracture Jaw which was abandoned when it became known to the White House Westmoreland requested additional troops which was leaked to the media and the fallout combined with intelligence failures caused him to be removed from command in March succeeded by his deputy Creighton Abrams br On May peace talks began between the US and North Vietnam in Paris Negotiations stagnated for five months until Johnson gave orders to halt the bombing of North Vietnam Hanoi realized it could not achieve a total victory and employed a strategy known as talking while fighting fighting while talking in which offensives would occur concurrently with negotiations br Johnson declined to run for re election as his approval rating slumped from to His escalation of the war divided Americans cost American lives by that point and was regarded to have destroyed his presidency Refusal to send more troops was seen as Johnson s admission that the war was lost As Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara noted the dangerous illusion of victory by the United States was therefore dead br Vietnam was a major political issue during the United States presidential election in The election was won by Republican Richard Nixon who claimed to have a secret plan to end the war br br br Vietnamization br br br Nuclear threats and diplomacy br President Nixon began troop withdrawals in His plan to build up the ARVN so it could take over the defense of South Vietnam became known as Vietnamization As the PAVN VC recovered from their losses and avoided contact Creighton Abrams conducted operations aimed at disrupting logistics with better use of

of the US government pays Vietnam veterans and their families more than billion a year in war related claims br br br Impact on the U S military br br More than million Americans served in the war million of whom saw combat James Westheider wrote that At the height of American involvement in for example American military personnel were stationed in Vietnam but only were considered combat troops Conscription in the US existed since World War II but ended in br American soldiers were killed more than wounded and at least permanently disabled The average age of US troops killed was According to Dale Kueter Of those killed in combat were white were black Approximately veterans suffered posttraumatic stress disorder This unprecedented number was because the military had routinely provided heavy psychoactive drugs to servicemen which left them unable to process trauma Drug use racial tensions and the growing incidence of fragging attempting to kill unpopular officers with grenades or other weapons created problems for the military and impacted its capability to undertake operations Americans left for Canada to avoid the draft and approximately servicemen deserted In President Jimmy Carter granted an unconditional pardon to all Vietnam era draft evaders with Proclamation br The war called into question army doctrine Marine general Victor H Krulak criticized Westmoreland s attrition strategy calling it wasteful of American lives with small likelihood of a successful outcome Doubts surfaced about the ability of the military to train foreign forces There was found to be considerable flaws and dishonesty by commanders due to promotions being tied to the body count system touted by Westmoreland and McNamara Secretary of Defense McNamara wrote to President Johnson his doubts The picture of the world s greatest superpower killing or seriously injuring noncombatants a week while trying to pound a tiny backward nation into submission on an issue whose merits are hotly disputed is not a pretty one br br br Effects of U S chemical defoliation br br One of the most controversial aspects of the US military effort was the widespread use of chemical defoliants between and million gallons of toxic herbicides like Agent Orange were sprayed on million acres of forests and crops by the air force They were used to defoliate large parts of the countryside to prevent the Viet Cong from being able to hide weaponry and encampments under the foliage and deprive them of food Defoliation was used to clear sensitive areas including base perimeters and possible ambush sites along roads and canals More than of South Vietnam s forests and of its cultivated land was sprayed at least once of herbicide use was directed at forest defoliation The chemicals used continue to change the landscape cause diseases and birth defects and poison the food chain US military records have listed figures including the destruction of of the jungles of South Vietnam and of the mangrove forests The environmental destruction caused was described by Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme lawyers historians and other academics as an ecocide br Agent Orange and similar chemical substances used by the US have caused many deaths and injuries in the intervening years including among the US Air Force crews that handled them Scientific reports have concluded that refugees exposed to chemical sprays while in South Vietnam continued to experience pain in the eyes and skin as well as gastrointestinal upsets In one study of participants suffered incessant fatigue others reported monstrous births Analysis of studies on the association between Agent Orange and birth defects have found a statistically significant correlation such that having a parent who was exposed to Agent Orange at any point will increase one s likelihood of possessing or acting as a genetic carrier of birth defects The most common deformity appears to be spina bifida There is substantial evidence that birth defects carry on for three generations or more In the US and Vietnam began a cooperative cleaning toxic chemicals on Danang International Airport marking the first time Washington has been involved in cleaning up Agent Orange in Vietnam br br Vietnamese victims affected by Agent Orange attempted a class action lawsuit against Dow Chemical and other US chemical manufacturers but a US District Court dismissed their case They appealed but the dismissal was cemented in by an appeals court As of the Vietnamese government estimated there were over victims of dioxin poisoning in Vietnam although the US government denies any conclusive scientific links between Agent Orange and Vietnamese victims of dioxin poisoning In some areas of southern Vietnam dioxin levels remain at over times the accepted international standard On August the Paris Court of Appeals is expected to rule on the lawsuit filed by Tran To Nga against US chemical corporations that supplied Agent Orange for the US military br The U S Veterans Administration has listed prostate cancer respiratory cancers multiple myeloma Diabetes mellitus type B cell lymphomas soft tissue sarcoma chloracne porphyria cutanea tarda peripheral neuropathy as presumptive diseases associated with exposure to Agent Orange or other herbicides during military service Spina bifida is the sole birth defect in children of veterans recognized as being caused by exposure to Agent Orange br br br In popular culture br br The war has featured extensively in television film video games music and literature In Vietnam a notable film

in the historiography of the war and have become part of the culture of the United States Discussion of myth has focused on US experiences but changing myths of war have played a role in Vietnamese

that the My Lai massacre was caused by drug use According to Kuzmarov Nixon is primarily responsible for creating the drug myth Michael Allen in Until The Last Man Comes Home accuses Nixon of
