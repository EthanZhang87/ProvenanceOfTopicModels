title: Newton's laws of motion
id: 55212
Newton s laws of motion are three physical laws that describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it These laws which provide the basis for Newtonian mechanics can be paraphrased as follows br br A body remains at rest or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line except insofar as it is acted upon by a force br At any instant of time the net force on a body is equal to the body s acceleration multiplied by its mass or equivalently the rate at which the body s momentum is changing with time br If two bodies exert forces on each other these forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions br The three laws of motion were first stated by Isaac Newton in his Philosophi Naturalis Principia Mathematica Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy originally published in Newton used them to investigate and explain the motion of many physical objects and systems In the time since Newton new insights especially around the concept of energy built the field of classical mechanics on his foundations Limitations to Newton s laws have also been discovered new theories are necessary when objects move at very high speeds special relativity are very massive general relativity or are very small quantum mechanics br br br Prerequisites br Newton s laws are often stated in terms of point or particle masses that is bodies whose volume is negligible This is a reasonable approximation for real bodies when the motion of internal parts can be neglected and when the separation between bodies is much larger than the size of each For instance the Earth and the Sun can both be approximated as pointlike when considering the orbit of the former around the latter but the Earth is not pointlike when considering activities on its surface br The mathematical description of motion or kinematics is based on the idea of specifying positions using numerical coordinates Movement is represented by these numbers changing over time a body s trajectory is represented by a function that assigns to each value of a time variable the values of all the position coordinates The simplest case is one dimensional that is when a body is constrained to move only along a straight line Its position can then be given by a single number indicating where it is relative to some chosen reference point For example a body might be free to slide along a track that runs left to right and so its location can be specified by its distance from a convenient zero point or origin with negative numbers indicating positions to the left and positive numbers indicating positions to the right If the body s location as a function of time is br br br br s br br t br br br br displaystyle s t br br then its average velocity over the time interval from br br br br br t br br br br br br br displaystyle t br br to br br br br br t br br br br br br br displaystyle t br br is br br br br br br br br s br br br br t br br br br br br br br s br br br t br br br br br br br s br br br t br br br br br br br br br t br br br br br br br t br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle frac Delta s Delta t frac s t s t t t br br Here the Greek letter br br br br br br br displaystyle Delta br br delta is used per tradition to mean change in A positive average velocity means that the position coordinate br br br br s br br br displaystyle s br br increases over the interval in question a negative average velocity indicates a net decrease over that interval and an average velocity of zero means that the body ends the time interval in the same place as it began Calculus gives the means to define an instantaneous velocity a measure of a body s speed and direction of movement at a single moment of time rather than over an interval One notation for the instantaneous velocity is to replace br br br br br br br displaystyle Delta br br with the symbol br br br br d br br br displaystyle d br br for example br br br br v br br br br br d br s br br br d br t br br br br br br br displaystyle v frac ds dt br br This denotes that the instantaneous velocity is the derivative of the position with respect to time It can roughly be thought of as the ratio between an infinitesimally small change in position br br br br d br s br br br displaystyle ds br br to the infinitesimally small time interval br br br br d br t br br br displaystyle dt br br over which it occurs More carefully the velocity and all other derivatives can be defined using the concept of a limit A function br br br br f br br t br br br br displaystyle f t br br has a limit of br br br br L br br br displaystyle L br br at a given input value br br br br br t br br br br br br br displaystyle t br br if the difference between br br br br f br br br displaystyle f br br and br br br br L br br br displaystyle L br br can be made arbitrarily small by choosing an input sufficiently close to br br br br br t br br br br br br br displaystyle t br br One writes br br br br br lim br br t br br br t br br br br br br br f br br t br br br L br br br br displaystyle lim t to t f t L br br Instantaneous velocity can be defined as the limit of the average velocity as the time interval shrinks to zero br br br br br br br d br s br br br d br t br br br br br br lim br br br t br br br br br br br br s br br t br br br t br br br s br br t br br br br br t br br br br br br br displaystyle frac ds dt lim Delta t to frac s t Delta t s t Delta t br br Acceleration is to velocity as velocity is to position it is the derivative of the velocity with respect to time Acceleration can likewise be defined as a limit br br br br a br br br br br d br v br br br d br t br br br br br br lim br br br t br br br br br br br br v br

derivative of position often written br br br br br br br br d br br br br br s br br br d br br t br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle frac d s dt br br br Position when thought of as a displacement from an origin point is a vector a quantity with both magnitude and direction Velocity and acceleration are vector quantities as well The mathematical tools of vector algebra provide the means to describe motion in two three or more dimensions Vectors are often denoted with an arrow as in br br br br br s br br br br displaystyle mathbf s br br or in bold typeface such as br br br br br br s br br br br br displaystyle bf s br br Often vectors are represented visually as arrows with the direction of the vector being the direction of the arrow and the magnitude of the vector indicated by the length of the arrow Numerically a vector can be represented as a list for example a body s velocity vector might be br br br br br v br br br br br br br m br br br br s br br br br br br m br br br br s br br br br br displaystyle mathbf v mathrm m s mathrm m s br br indicating that it is moving at metres per second along the horizontal axis and metres per second along the vertical axis The same motion described in a different coordinate system will be represented by different numbers and vector algebra can be used to translate between these alternatives br The study of mechanics is complicated by the fact that household words like energy are used with a technical meaning Moreover words which are synonymous in everyday speech are not so in physics force is not the same as power or pressure for example and mass has a different meaning than weight The physics concept of force makes quantitative the everyday idea of a push or a pull Forces in Newtonian mechanics are often due to strings and ropes friction muscle effort gravity and so forth Like displacement velocity and acceleration force is a vector quantity br br br Laws br br br First law br br Translated from Latin Newton s first law reads br br Every object perseveres in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a right line except insofar as it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon br Newton s first law expresses the principle of inertia the natural behavior of a body is to move in a straight line at constant speed A body s motion preserves the status quo but external forces can perturb this br The modern understanding of Newton s first law is that no inertial observer is privileged over any other The concept of an inertial observer makes quantitative the everyday idea of feeling no effects of motion For example a person standing on the ground watching a train go past is an inertial observer If the observer on the ground sees the train moving smoothly in a straight line at a constant speed then a passenger sitting on the train will also be an inertial observer the train passenger feels no motion The principle expressed by Newton s first law is that there is no way to say which inertial observer is really moving and which is really standing still One observer s state of rest is another observer s state of uniform motion in a straight line and no experiment can deem either point of view to be correct or incorrect There is no absolute standard of rest Newton himself believed that absolute space and time existed but that the only measures of space or time accessible to experiment are relative br br br Second law br The change of motion of an object is proportional to the force impressed and is made in the direction of the straight line in which the force is impressed br By motion Newton meant the quantity now called momentum which depends upon the amount of matter contained in a body the speed at which that body is moving and the direction in which it is moving In modern notation the momentum of a body is the product of its mass and its velocity br br br br br br p br br br m br br v br br br br br br displaystyle mathbf p m mathbf v br br br where all three quantities can change over time br Newton s second law in modern form states that the time derivative of the momentum is the force br br br br br br F br br br br br br d br br p br br br br d br t br br br br br br br br displaystyle mathbf F frac d mathbf p dt br br br If the mass br br br br m br br br displaystyle m br br does not change with time then the derivative acts only upon the velocity and so the force equals the product of the mass and the time derivative of the velocity which is the acceleration br br br br br br F br br br m br br br br d br br v br br br br d br t br br br br br m br br a br br br br br br displaystyle mathbf F m frac d mathbf v dt m mathbf a br br br As the acceleration is the second derivative of position with respect to time this can also be written br br br br br br F br br br m br br br br br d br br br br br br s br br br br d br br t br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle mathbf F m frac d mathbf s dt br br br The forces acting on a body add as vectors and so the total force on a body depends upon both the magnitudes and the directions of the individual forces When the net force on a body is equal to zero then by Newton s second law the body does not accelerate and it is said to be in mechanical equilibrium A state of mechanical equilibrium is stable if when the position of the body is changed slightly the body remains near that equilibrium Otherwise the equilibrium is unstable br A common visual representation of forces acting in concert is the free body diagram which schematically portrays a body of interest and the forces applied to it by outside influences For example a free body diagram of a block sitting upon an inclined plane can illustrate the combination of gravitational force normal force friction and string tension br Newton s second law is sometimes presented as a definition of force i e a force is that which exists when an inertial observer sees a body accelerating In order for this to be more than a tautology acceleration implies force force implies acceleration some other statement about force must also be made For example an equation detailing the force might be specified like Newton s law of universal gravitation By inserting such an expression for br br br br br F br br br br displaystyle mathbf F br br into Newton s second law an equation with predictive power can be written Newton s second law has also been regarded as setting out a research program for physics establishing that important goals of the subject are to identify the forces present in nature and to catalogue the constituents of matter br br br Third law br To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal and directed to contrary parts br br Overly brief paraphrases of the third law like action equals reaction might have caused confusion among generations of students the action and reaction apply to different bodies For example consider a book at rest on a table The Earth s gravity pulls down upon the book The reaction to that action is not the support force from the table holding up the book but the gravitational pull of the book acting on the Earth br Newton s third law relates to a more fundamental principle the conservation of momentum The latter remains true even in cases where Newton s statement does not for instance when force fields as well as material bodies carry momentum and when momentum is defined properly in quantum mechanics as well In Newtonian mechanics if two bodies have momenta br br br br br br p br br br br br br br br displaystyle mathbf p br br and br br br br br br p br br br br br br br br displaystyle mathbf p br br respectively then the total momentum of the pair is br br br br br p br br br br br p br br br br br br br br br p br br br br br br br br displaystyle mathbf p mathbf p mathbf p br br and the rate of change of br br br br br p br br br br displaystyle mathbf p br br is br br br br br br br d br br p br br br br d br t br br br br br br br br d br br br p br br br br br br br br d br t br br br br br br br br d br br br p br br br br br br br br d br t br br br br br br br displaystyle frac d mathbf p dt frac d mathbf p dt frac d mathbf p dt br br By Newton s second law the first term is the total force upon the first body and the second term is the total force upon the second body If the two bodies are isolated from outside influences the only force upon the first body can be that from the second and vice versa By Newton s third law these forces have equal magnitude but opposite direction so they cancel when added and br br br br br p br br br br displaystyle mathbf p br br is constant Alternatively if br br br br br p br br br br displaystyle mathbf p br br is known to be constant it follows that the forces have equal magnitude and opposite direction br br br Candidates for additional laws br Various sources have proposed elevating other ideas used in classical mechanics to the status of Newton s laws For example in Newtonian mechanics the total mass of a body made by bringing together two smaller bodies is the sum of their individual masses Frank Wilczek has suggested calling attention to this assumption by designating it Newton s Zeroth Law Another candidate for a zeroth law is the fact that at any instant a body reacts to the forces applied to it at that instant Likewise the idea that forces add like vectors or in other words obey the superposition principle and the idea that forces change the energy of a body have both been described as a fourth law br br br Examples br The study of the behavior of massive bodies using Newton s laws is known as Newtonian mechanics Some example problems in Newtonian mechanics are particularly noteworthy for conceptual or historical reasons br br br Uniformly accelerated motion br br If a body falls from rest near the surface of the Earth then in the absence of air resistance it will accelerate at a constant rate This is known as free fall The speed attained during free fall is proportional to the elapsed time and the distance traveled is proportional to the square of the elapsed time Importantly the acceleration is the same for all bodies independently of their mass This follows from combining Newton s second law of motion with his law of universal gravitation The latter states that the magnitude of the gravitational force from the Earth upon the body is br br br br br F br br br br br G br M br m br br br r br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle F frac GMm r br br br where br br br br m br br br displaystyle m br br is the mass of the falling body br br br br M br br br displaystyle M br br is the mass of the Earth br br br br G br br br displaystyle G br br is Newton s constant and br br br br r br br br displaystyle r br br is the distance from the center of the Earth to the body s location which is very nearly the radius of the Earth Setting this equal to br br br br m br a br br br displaystyle ma br br the body s mass br br br br m br br br displaystyle m br br cancels from both sides of the equation leaving an acceleration that depends upon br br br br G br br br displaystyle G br br br br br br M br br br displaystyle M br br and br br br br r br br br displaystyle r br br and br br br br r br br br displaystyle r br br can be taken to be constant This particular value of acceleration is typically denoted br br br br g br br br displaystyle g br br br br br br br g br br br br br G br M br br br r br br br br br br br br br br br m br br br br br s br br br br br br br br br displaystyle g frac GM r approx mathrm m s br br br If the body is not released from rest but instead launched upwards and or horizontally with nonzero velocity then free fall becomes projectile motion When air resistance can be neglected projectiles follow parabola shaped trajectories because gravity affects the body s vertical motion and not its horizontal At the peak of the projectile s trajectory its vertical velocity is zero but its acceleration is br br br br g br br br displaystyle g br br downwards as it is at all times Setting the wrong vector equal to zero is a common confusion among physics students br br br Uniform circular motion br br When a body is in uniform circular motion the force on it changes the direction of its motion but not its speed For a body moving in a circle of radius br br br br r br br br displaystyle r br br at a constant speed br br br br v br br br displaystyle v br br its acceleration has a magnitude br br br br a br br br br br v br br br br br r br br br br br displaystyle a frac v r br br and is directed toward the center of the circle The force required to sustain this acceleration called the centripetal force is therefore also directed toward the center of the circle and has magnitude br br br br m br br v br br br br br br br br r br br br displaystyle mv r br br Many orbits such as that of the Moon around the Earth can be approximated by uniform circular motion In such cases the centripetal force is gravity and by Newton s law of universal gravitation has magnitude br br br br G br M br m br br br br br r br br br br br br br displaystyle GMm r br br where br br br br M br br br displaystyle M br br is the mass of the larger body being orbited Therefore the mass of a body can be calculated from observations of another body orbiting around it br Newton s cannonball is a thought experiment that interpolates between projectile motion and uniform circular motion A cannonball that is lobbed weakly off the edge of a tall cliff will hit the ground in the same amount of time as if it were dropped from rest because the force of gravity only affects the cannonball s momentum in the downward direction and its effect is not diminished by horizontal movement If the cannonball is launched with a greater initial horizontal velocity then it will travel farther before it hits the ground but it will still hit the ground in the same amount of time However if the cannonball is launched with an even larger initial velocity then the curvature of the Earth becomes significant the ground itself will curve away from the falling cannonball A very fast cannonball will fall away from the inertial straight line trajectory at the same rate that the Earth curves away beneath it in other words it will be in orbit imagining that it is not slowed by air resistance or obstacles br br br Harmonic motion br br Consider a body of mass br br br br m br br br displaystyle m br br able to move along the br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br axis and suppose an equilibrium point exists at the position br br br br x br br br br br displaystyle x br br That is at br br br br x br br br br br displaystyle x br br the net force upon the body is the zero vector and by Newton s second law the body will not accelerate If the force upon the body is proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium point and directed to the equilibrium point then the body will perform simple harmonic motion Writing the force as br br br br F br br br k br x br br br displaystyle F kx br br Newton s second law becomes br br br br br m br br br br br d br br br br br x br br br d br br t br br br br br br br br br br k br x br br br br br displaystyle m frac d x dt kx br br br This differential equation has the solution br br br br br x br br t br br br A br cos br br br t br br B br sin br br br t br br br br displaystyle x t A cos omega t B sin omega t br br br where the frequency br br br br br br br displaystyle omega br br is equal to br br br br br br k br br br br m br br br br br displaystyle sqrt k m br br and the constants br br br br A br br br displaystyle A br br and br br br br B br br br displaystyle B br br can be calculated knowing for example the position and velocity the body has at a given time like br br br br t br br br br br displaystyle t br br br One reason that the harmonic oscillator is a conceptually important example is that it is good approximation for many systems near a stable mechanical equilibrium For example a pendulum has a stable equilibrium in the vertical position if motionless there it will remain there and if pushed slightly it will swing back and forth Neglecting air resistance and friction in the pivot the force upon the pendulum is gravity and Newton s second law becomes br br br br br br br br d br br br br br br br br d br br t br br br br br br br br br br br br g br L br br br sin br br br br br br displaystyle frac d theta dt frac g L sin theta br br where br br br br L br br br displaystyle L br br is the length of the pendulum and br br br br br br br displaystyle theta br br is its angle from the vertical When the angle br br br br br br br displaystyle theta br br is small the sine of br br br br br br br displaystyle theta br br is nearly equal to br br br br br br br displaystyle theta br br see Taylor series and so this expression simplifies to the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator with frequency br br br br br br br br g br br br br L br br br br br displaystyle omega sqrt g L br br br A harmonic oscillator can be damped often by friction or viscous drag in which case energy bleeds out of the oscillator and the amplitude of the oscillations decreases over time Also a harmonic oscillator can be driven by an applied force which can lead to the phenomenon of resonance br br br Objects with variable mass br br Newtonian physics treats matter as being neither created nor destroyed though it may be rearranged It can be the case that an object of interest gains or loses mass because matter is added to or removed from it In such a situation Newton s laws can be applied to the individual pieces of matter keeping track of which pieces belong to the object of interest over time For instance if a rocket of mass br br br br M br br t br br br br displaystyle M t br br moving at velocity br br br br br v br br br t br br br br displaystyle mathbf v t br br ejects matter at a velocity br br br br br u br br br br displaystyle mathbf u br br relative to the rocket then br br br br br br F br br br M br br br br d br br v br br br br d br t br br br br br br u br br br br br d br M br br br d br t br br br br br br br displaystyle mathbf F M frac d mathbf v dt mathbf u frac dM dt br br br where br br br br br F br br br br displaystyle mathbf F br br is the net external force e g a planet s gravitational pull br br br Work and energy br Physicists developed the concept of energy after Newton s time but it has become an inseparable part of what is considered Newtonian physics Energy can broadly be classified into kinetic due to a body s motion and potential due to a body s position relative to others Thermal energy the energy carried by heat flow is a type of kinetic energy not associated with the macroscopic motion of objects but instead with the movements of the atoms and molecules of which they are made According to the work energy theorem when a force acts upon a body while that body moves along the line of the force the force does work upon the body and the amount of work done is equal to the change in the body s kinetic energy In many cases of interest the net work done by a force when a body moves in a closed loop starting at a point moving along some trajectory and returning to the initial point is zero If this is the case then the force can be written in terms of the gradient of a function called a scalar potential br br br br br br F br br br br br br br U br br br br br displaystyle mathbf F mathbf nabla U br br br This is true for many forces including that of gravity but not for friction indeed almost any problem in a mechanics textbook that does not involve friction can be expressed in this way The fact that the force can be written in this way can be understood from the conservation of energy Without friction to dissipate a body s energy into heat the body s energy will trade between potential and non thermal kinetic forms while the total amount remains constant Any gain of kinetic energy which occurs when the net force on the body accelerates it to a higher speed must be accompanied by a loss of potential energy So the net force upon the body is determined by the manner in which the potential energy decreases br br br Rigid body motion and rotation br A rigid body is an object whose size is too large to neglect and which maintains the same shape over time In Newtonian mechanics the motion of a rigid body is often understood by separating it into movement of the body s center of mass and movement around the center of mass br br br Center of mass br br Significant aspects of the motion of an extended body can be understood by imagining the mass of that body concentrated to a single point known as the center of mass The location of a body s center of mass depends upon how that body s material is distributed For a collection of pointlike objects with masses br br br br br m br br br br br br br br br m br br N br br br br br displaystyle m ldots m N br br at positions br br br br br br r br br br br br br br br br br br r br br br N br br br br br displaystyle mathbf r ldots mathbf r N br br the center of mass is located at br br br br br R br br br br br br i br br br br br N br br br br br br br m br br i br br br br br r br br br i br br br br M br br br br br br displaystyle mathbf R sum i N frac m i mathbf r i M br br where br br br br M br br br displaystyle M br br is the total mass of the collection In the absence of a net external force the center of mass moves at a constant speed in a straight line This applies for example to a collision between two bodies If the total external force is not zero then the center of mass changes velocity as though it were a point body of mass br br br br M br br br displaystyle M br br This follows from the fact that the internal forces within the collection the forces that the objects exert upon each other occur in balanced pairs by Newton s third law In a system of two bodies with one much more massive than the other the center of mass will approximately coincide with the location of the more massive body br br br Rotational analogues of Newton s laws br When Newton s laws are applied to rotating extended bodies they lead to new quantities that are analogous to those invoked in the original laws The analogue of mass is the moment of inertia the counterpart of momentum is angular momentum and the counterpart of force is torque br Angular momentum is calculated with respect to a reference point If the displacement vector from a reference point to a body is br br br br br r br br br br displaystyle mathbf r br br and the body has momentum br br br br br p br br br br displaystyle mathbf p br br then the body s angular momentum with respect to that point is using the vector cross product br br br br br L br br br br r br br br br p br br br br br displaystyle mathbf L mathbf r times mathbf p br br Taking the time derivative of the angular momentum gives br br br br br br br d br br L br br br br d br t br br br br br br br br br br d br br r br br br br d br t br br br br br br br br p br br br br r br br

mathbf r times frac d mathbf p dt mathbf v times m mathbf v mathbf r times mathbf F br br The first term vanishes because br br br br br v br br br br displaystyle mathbf v br br and br br br br m br br v br br br br displaystyle m mathbf v br br point in the same direction The remaining term is the torque br br br br br br br br br r br br br br F br br br br br displaystyle mathbf tau mathbf r times mathbf F br br When the torque is zero the angular momentum is constant just as when the force is zero the momentum is constant The torque can vanish even when the force is non zero if the body is located at the reference point br br br br br r br br br br br br displaystyle mathbf r br br or if the force br br br br br F br br br br displaystyle mathbf F br br and the displacement vector br br br br br r br br br br displaystyle mathbf r br br are directed along the same line br The angular momentum of a collection of point masses and thus of an extended body is found by adding the contributions from each of the points This provides a means to characterize a body s rotation about an axis by adding up the angular momenta of its individual pieces The result depends on the chosen axis the shape of the body and the rate of rotation br br br Multi body gravitational system br br Newton s law of universal gravitation states that any body attracts any other body along the straight line connecting them The size of the attracting force is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them Finding the shape of the orbits that an inverse square force law will produce is known as the Kepler problem The Kepler problem can be solved in multiple ways including by demonstrating that the Laplace Runge Lenz vector is constant or by applying a duality transformation to a dimensional harmonic oscillator However it is solved the result is that orbits will be conic sections that is ellipses including circles parabolas or hyperbolas The eccentricity of the orbit and thus the type of conic section is determined by the energy and the angular momentum of the orbiting body Planets do not have sufficient energy to escape the Sun and so their orbits are ellipses to a good approximation because the planets pull on one another actual orbits are not exactly conic sections br If a third mass is added the Kepler problem becomes the three body problem which in general has no exact solution in closed form That is there is no way to start from the differential equations implied by Newton s laws and after a finite sequence of standard mathematical operations obtain equations that express the three bodies motions over time Numerical methods can be applied to obtain useful albeit approximate results for the three body problem The positions and velocities of the bodies can be stored in variables within a computer s memory Newton s laws are used to calculate how the velocities will change over a short interval of time and knowing the velocities the changes of position over that time interval can be computed This process is looped to calculate approximately the bodies trajectories Generally speaking the shorter the time interval the more accurate the approximation br br br Chaos and unpredictability br br br Nonlinear dynamics br br Newton s laws of motion allow the possibility of chaos That is qualitatively speaking physical systems obeying Newton s laws can exhibit sensitive dependence upon their initial conditions a slight change of the position or velocity of one part of a system can lead to the whole system behaving in a radically different way within a short time Noteworthy examples include the three body problem the double pendulum dynamical billiards and the Fermi Pasta Ulam Tsingou problem br Newton s laws can be applied to fluids by considering a fluid as composed of infinitesimal pieces each exerting forces upon neighboring pieces The Euler momentum equation is an expression of Newton s second law adapted to fluid dynamics A fluid is described by a velocity field i e a function br br br br br v br br br br x br br br t br br br br displaystyle mathbf v mathbf x t br br that assigns a velocity vector to each point in space and time A small object being carried along by the fluid flow can change velocity for two reasons first because the velocity field at its position is changing over time and second because it moves to a new location where the velocity field has a different value Consequently when Newton s second law is applied to an infinitesimal portion of fluid the acceleration br br br br br a br br br br displaystyle mathbf a br br has two terms a combination known as a total or material derivative The mass of an infinitesimal portion depends upon the fluid density and there is a net force upon it if the fluid pressure varies from one side of it to another Accordingly br br br br br a br br br br F br br br br br m br br br displaystyle mathbf

themselves away so forcefully that they fly off to infinity in a finite time This unphysical behavior known as a noncollision singularity depends upon the masses being pointlike and able to approach one another arbitrarily closely as well as the lack of a relativistic speed limit in Newtonian physics br It is not yet known whether or not the Euler and Navier Stokes equations exhibit the analogous behavior of initially smooth solutions blowing up in finite time The question of existence and smoothness of Navier Stokes solutions is one of the Millennium Prize Problems br br br Relation to other formulations of classical physics br Classical mechanics can be mathematically formulated in multiple different ways other than the Newtonian description which itself of course incorporates contributions from others both before and after Newton The physical content of these different formulations is the same as the Newtonian but they provide different insights and facilitate different types of calculations For example Lagrangian mechanics helps make apparent the connection between symmetries and conservation laws and it is useful when calculating the motion of constrained bodies like a mass restricted to move along a curving track or on the surface of a sphere Hamiltonian mechanics is convenient for statistical physics leads to further insight about symmetry and can be developed into sophisticated techniques for perturbation theory Due to the breadth of these topics the discussion here will be confined to concise treatments of how they reformulate Newton s laws of motion br br br Lagrangian br Lagrangian mechanics differs from the Newtonian formulation by considering entire trajectories at once rather than predicting a body s motion at a single instant It is traditional in Lagrangian mechanics to denote position with br br br br q br br br displaystyle q br br and velocity with br br br br br br br q br br br br br br br displaystyle dot q br br The simplest example is a massive point particle the Lagrangian for which can be written as the difference between its kinetic and potential energies br br br br br L br br q br br br br br q br br br br

initial point br br br br br q br br i br br br br br displaystyle q i br br and a final point br br br br br q br br f br br br br br displaystyle q f br br is the path for which the integral of the Lagrangian is stationary That is the physical path has the property that small perturbations of it will to a first approximation not change the integral of the Lagrangian Calculus of variations provides the mathematical tools for finding this path Applying the calculus of variations to the task of finding the path yields the Euler Lagrange equation for the particle br br br br br br br d br

momentum and the right hand side is the force represented in terms of the potential energy br Landau and Lifshitz argue that the Lagrangian formulation makes the conceptual content of classical mechanics more clear than starting with Newton s laws Lagrangian mechanics provides a convenient framework in which to prove Noether s theorem which relates symmetries and conservation laws The conservation of momentum can be derived by applying Noether s theorem to a Lagrangian for a multi particle system and so Newton s third law is a theorem rather than an assumption br br br Hamiltonian br br In Hamiltonian mechanics the dynamics of a system are represented by a function called the Hamiltonian which in many cases of interest is equal to the total energy of the system The Hamiltonian is a function of the positions and the momenta of all the bodies making up the system and it may also depend explicitly upon time The time derivatives of the position and momentum variables are given by partial derivatives of the Hamiltonian via Hamilton s equations The simplest example is a point mass br br br br m br br br displaystyle m br br constrained to move in a straight line under the effect of a potential Writing br br br br q br br br displaystyle q br br for the position coordinate and br br br br p br br br displaystyle p br br for the body s momentum the Hamiltonian is br br

Evaluating these partial derivatives the former equation becomes br br br br br br br br d br q br br br d br t br br br br br br br p br m br br br br br br displaystyle frac dq dt frac p m br br br which reproduces the familiar statement that a body s momentum is the product of its mass and velocity The time derivative of the momentum is br br br br br br br br d br p br br br d br t br br br br br br br br br d br V br br br d br q br br br br br br br displaystyle frac dp dt frac dV dq br br br which upon identifying the negative derivative of the potential with the force is just Newton s second law once again br As in the Lagrangian formulation in Hamiltonian mechanics the conservation of momentum can be derived using Noether s theorem making Newton s third law an idea that is deduced rather than assumed br Among the proposals to reform the standard introductory physics curriculum is one that teaches the concept of energy before that of force essentially introductory Hamiltonian mechanics br br br Hamilton Jacobi br The Hamilton Jacobi equation provides yet another formulation of classical mechanics one which makes it mathematically analogous to wave optics This formulation also uses Hamiltonian functions but in a different way than the formulation described above The paths taken by bodies or collections of bodies are deduced from a function br br br br S br br br br q

Bodies move over time in such a way that their trajectories are perpendicular to the surfaces of constant br br br br S br br br displaystyle S br br analogously to how a light ray propagates in the

Relation to other physical theories br br br Thermodynamics and statistical physics br br In statistical physics the kinetic theory of gases applies Newton s laws of motion to large numbers typically on the order of the Avogadro number of particles Kinetic theory can explain for example the pressure that a gas exerts upon the container holding it as the aggregate of many impacts of atoms each imparting a tiny amount of momentum br The Langevin equation is a special case of Newton s second law adapted for the case of describing a small object bombarded stochastically by even smaller ones It can be written br br br br m br br a br br br br br br v br br br br br br br br br displaystyle m mathbf a gamma mathbf v mathbf xi br br where br br br br br br br displaystyle gamma br br is a drag coefficient and br br br br br br br br br displaystyle mathbf xi br br is a force that varies randomly from instant to instant representing the net effect of collisions with the surrounding particles This is used to model Brownian motion br br br Electromagnetism br Newton s three laws can be applied to phenomena involving electricity and magnetism though subtleties and caveats exist br Coulomb s law for the electric force between two stationary electrically charged bodies has much the same mathematical form as Newton s law of universal gravitation the force is proportional to the product of the charges inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them and directed along the straight line between them The Coulomb force that a charge br br br br br q br br br br br br br displaystyle q br br exerts upon a charge br br br br br q br br br br br br br displaystyle q br br is equal in magnitude to the force that br br br br br q br br br br br br br displaystyle q br br exerts upon br br br br br q br br br br br br br displaystyle q br br and it points in the exact opposite direction Coulomb s law is thus consistent with Newton s third law br Electromagnetism treats forces as produced by fields acting upon charges The Lorentz force law provides an expression for the force upon a charged body that can be plugged into Newton s second law in order to calculate its acceleration According to the Lorentz force law a charged body in an electric field experiences a force in the direction of that field a force proportional to its charge br br br br q br br br displaystyle q br br and to the strength of the electric field In addition a moving charged body in a magnetic field experiences a force that is also proportional to its charge in a direction

s motion just as in the case of uniform circular motion studied above and the charge will circle or more generally move in a helix around the magnetic field lines at the cyclotron frequency br br br br br br q br B br br br br m br br br displaystyle omega qB m br br Mass spectrometry works by applying electric and or magnetic fields to moving charges and measuring the resulting acceleration which by the Lorentz force law yields the mass to charge ratio br Collections of charged bodies do not always obey Newton s third law there can be a change of one body s momentum without a compensatory change in the momentum of another The discrepancy is accounted for by momentum carried by the electromagnetic field itself The momentum per unit volume of the electromagnetic field is proportional to the Poynting vector br There is subtle conceptual conflict between electromagnetism and Newton s first law Maxwell s theory of electromagnetism predicts that electromagnetic waves will travel through empty space at a constant definite speed Thus some inertial observers seemingly have a privileged status over the others namely those who measure the speed of light and find it to be the value predicted by the Maxwell equations In other words light provides an absolute standard for speed yet the principle of inertia holds that there should be no such standard This tension is resolved in the theory of special relativity which revises the notions of space and time in such a way that all inertial observers will agree upon the speed of light in vacuum br br br Special relativity br br In special relativity the rule that Wilczek called Newton s Zeroth Law breaks down the mass of a composite object is not merely the sum of the masses of the individual pieces Newton s first law inertial motion remains true A form of Newton s second law that force is the rate of change of momentum also holds as does the conservation of momentum However the definition of momentum is modified Among the consequences of this is the fact that the more quickly a body moves the harder it is to accelerate and so no matter how much force is applied a body cannot be accelerated to the speed of light Depending on the problem at hand momentum in special relativity can be represented as a three dimensional vector br br br br br p br br br m br br br v br br br br displaystyle mathbf p m gamma mathbf v br br where br br br br m br br br displaystyle m br br is the body s rest mass and br br br br br br br displaystyle gamma br br is the Lorentz factor which depends upon the body s speed Alternatively momentum and force can be represented as four vectors br Newton s third law must be modified in special relativity The third law refers to the forces between two bodies at the same moment in time and a key feature of special relativity is that simultaneity is relative Events that happen at the same time relative to one observer can happen at different times relative to another So in a given observer s frame of reference action and reaction may not be exactly opposite and the total momentum of interacting bodies may not be conserved The conservation of momentum is restored by including the momentum stored in the field that describes the bodies interaction br Newtonian mechanics is a good approximation to special relativity when the speeds involved are small compared to that of light br br br General relativity br General relativity is a theory of gravity that advances beyond that of Newton In general relativity the gravitational force of Newtonian mechanics is reimagined as curvature of spacetime A curved path like an orbit attributed to a gravitational force in Newtonian mechanics is not the result of a force deflecting a body from an ideal straight line path but rather the body s attempt to fall freely through a background that is itself curved by the presence of other masses A remark by John Archibald Wheeler that has become proverbial among physicists summarizes the theory Spacetime tells matter how to move matter tells spacetime how to curve Wheeler himself thought of this reciprocal relationship as a modern generalized form of Newton s third law The relation between matter distribution and spacetime curvature is given by the Einstein field equations which require tensor calculus to express br The Newtonian theory of gravity is a good approximation to the predictions of general relativity when gravitational effects are weak and objects are moving slowly compared to the speed of light br br br Quantum mechanics br Quantum mechanics is a theory of physics originally developed in order to understand microscopic phenomena behavior at the scale of molecules atoms or subatomic particles Generally and loosely speaking the smaller a system is the more an adequate mathematical model will require understanding quantum effects The conceptual underpinning of quantum physics is very different from that of classical physics Instead of thinking about quantities like position momentum and energy as properties that an object has one considers what result might appear when a measurement of a chosen type is performed Quantum mechanics allows the physicist to calculate the probability that a chosen measurement will elicit a particular result The expectation value for a measurement is the average of the possible results it might yield weighted by their probabilities of occurrence br The Ehrenfest theorem provides a connection between quantum expectation values and Newton s second law a connection that is necessarily inexact as quantum physics is fundamentally different from classical In quantum physics position and momentum are represented by mathematical entities known as Hermitian operators and the Born rule is used to calculate the expectation values of a position measurement or a momentum measurement These expectation values will generally change over time that is depending on the time at which for example a position measurement is performed the probabilities for its different possible outcomes will vary The Ehrenfest theorem says roughly speaking that the equations describing how these expectation values change over time have a form reminiscent of Newton s second law However the more pronounced quantum effects are in a given situation the more difficult it is to derive meaningful conclusions from this resemblance br br br History br br The concepts invoked in Newton s laws of motion mass velocity momentum force have predecessors in earlier work and the content of Newtonian physics was further developed after Newton s time Newton combined knowledge of celestial motions with the study of events on Earth and showed that one theory of mechanics could encompass both br br br Antiquity and medieval background br br The subject of physics is often traced back to Aristotle but the history of the concepts involved is obscured by multiple factors An exact correspondence between Aristotelian and modern concepts is not simple to establish Aristotle did not clearly distinguish what we would call speed and force used the same term for density and viscosity and conceived of motion as always through a medium rather than through space In addition some concepts often termed Aristotelian might better be attributed to his followers and commentators upon him These commentators found that Aristotelian physics had difficulty explaining projectile motion Aristotle divided motion into two types natural and violent The natural motion of terrestrial solid matter was to fall downwards whereas a violent motion could push a body sideways Moreover in Aristotelian physics a violent motion requires an immediate cause separated from the cause of its violent motion a body would revert to its natural behavior Yet a javelin continues moving after it leaves the thrower s hand Aristotle concluded that the air around the javelin must be imparted with the ability to move the javelin forward John Philoponus a Byzantine Greek thinker active during the sixth century found this absurd the same medium air was somehow responsible both for sustaining motion and for impeding it If Aristotle s idea were true Philoponus said armies would launch weapons by blowing upon them with bellows Philoponus argued that setting a body into motion imparted a quality impetus that would be contained within the body itself As long as its impetus was sustained the body would continue to move In the following centuries versions of impetus theory were advanced by individuals including Nur ad Din al Bitruji Avicenna Abu l Barak t al Baghd d John Buridan and Albert of Saxony In retrospect the idea of impetus can be seen as a forerunner of the modern concept of momentum The intuition that objects move according to some kind of impetus persists in many students of introductory physics br br br Inertia and the first law br br The French philosopher Ren Descartes introduced the concept of inertia by way of his laws of nature in The World Trait du monde et de la lumi re written However The World purported a heliocentric worldview and in this view had given rise a great conflict between Galileo Galilei and the Roman Catholic Inquisition Descartes knew about this controversy and did not wish to get involved The World was not published until ten years after his death br br The modern concept of inertia is credited to Galileo Based on his experiments Galileo concluded that the natural behavior of a moving body was to keep moving until something else interfered with it In Two New Sciences Galileo wrote Imagine any particle projected along a horizontal plane without friction then we know from what has been more fully explained in the preceding pages that this particle will move along this same plane with a motion which is uniform and perpetual provided the plane has no limits Galileo recognized that in projectile motion the Earth s gravity affects vertical but not horizontal motion However Galileo s idea of inertia was not exactly the one that would be codified into Newton s first law Galileo thought that a body moving a long distance inertially would follow the curve of the Earth This idea was corrected by Isaac Beeckman Descartes and Pierre Gassendi who recognized that inertial motion should be motion in a straight line Descartes published his laws of nature laws of motion with this correction in Principles of Philosophy Principia Philosophiae in with the heliocentric part toned down br br First Law of Nature Each thing when left to itself continues in the same state so any moving body goes on moving until something stops it Second Law of Nature Each moving thing if left to itself moves in a straight line so any body moving in a circle always tends to move away from the centre of the circle br According to American philosopher Richard J Blackwell Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens had worked out his own concise version of the law in It was not published until eight years after his death in the opening paragraph of De Motu Corporum ex Percussione br br Hypothesis I Any body already in motion will continue to move perpetually with the same speed and in a straight line unless it is impeded br According to Huygens this law was already known by Galileo and Descartes among others br br br Force and the second law br br Christiaan Huygens in his Horologium Oscillatorium put forth the hypothesis that By the action of gravity whatever its sources it happens that bodies are moved by a motion composed both of a uniform motion in one direction or another and of a motion downward due to gravity Newton s second law generalized this hypothesis from gravity to all forces br One important characteristic of Newtonian physics is that forces can act at a distance without requiring physical contact For example the Sun and the Earth pull on each other gravitationally despite being separated by millions of kilometres This contrasts with the idea championed by Descartes among others that the Sun s gravity held planets in orbit by swirling them in a vortex of transparent matter aether Newton considered aetherial explanations of force but ultimately rejected them The study of magnetism by William Gilbert and others created a precedent for thinking of immaterial forces and unable to find a quantitatively satisfactory explanation of his law of gravity in terms of an aetherial model Newton eventually declared I feign no hypotheses whether or not a model like Descartes s vortices could be found to underlie the Principia s theories of motion and gravity the first grounds for judging them must be the successful predictions they made And indeed since Newton s time every attempt at such a model has failed br br br Momentum conservation and the third law br br Johannes Kepler suggested that gravitational attractions were reciprocal that for example the Moon pulls on the Earth while the Earth pulls on the Moon but he did not argue that such pairs are equal and opposite In his Principles of Philosophy Descartes introduced the idea that during a collision between bodies a quantity of motion remains unchanged Descartes defined this quantity somewhat imprecisely by adding up the products of the speed and size of each body where size for him incorporated both volume and surface area Moreover Descartes thought of the universe as a plenum that is filled with matter so all motion required a body to displace a medium as it moved br During the s Huygens studied collisions between hard spheres and deduced a principle that is now identified as the conservation of momentum Christopher Wren would later deduce the same rules for elastic collisions that Huygens had and John Wallis would apply momentum conservation to study inelastic collisions Newton cited the work of Huygens Wren and Wallis to support the validity of his third law br Newton arrived at his set of three laws incrementally In a manuscript written to Huygens he listed four laws the principle of inertia the change of motion by force a statement about relative motion that would today be called Galilean invariance and the rule that interactions between bodies do not change the motion of their center of mass In a later manuscript Newton added a law of action and reaction while saying that this law and the law regarding the center of mass implied one another Newton probably settled on the presentation in the Principia with three primary laws and then other statements reduced to corollaries during br br br After the Principia br br Newton expressed his second law by saying that the force on a body is proportional to its change of motion or momentum By the time he wrote the Principia he had already developed calculus which he called the science of fluxions but in the Principia he made no explicit use of it perhaps because he believed geometrical arguments in the tradition of Euclid to be more rigorous Consequently the Principia does not express acceleration as the second derivative of position and so it does not give the second law as br br br br F br br m br a br br br displaystyle F ma br br This form of the second law was written for the special case of constant force at least as early as by Jakob Hermann Leonhard Euler would employ it as a basic premise in the s Euler pioneered the study of rigid bodies and established the basic theory of fluid dynamics Pierre Simon Laplace s five volume Trait de m canique c leste forsook geometry and developed mechanics purely through algebraic expressions while resolving questions that the Principia had left open like a full theory of the tides br The concept of energy became a key part of Newtonian mechanics in the post Newton period Huygens solution of the collision of hard spheres showed that in that case not only is momentum conserved but kinetic energy is as well or rather a quantity that in retrospect we can identify as one half the total kinetic energy The question of what is conserved during all other processes like inelastic collisions and motion slowed by friction was not resolved until the th century Debates on this topic overlapped with philosophical disputes between the metaphysical views of Newton and Leibniz and variants of the term force were sometimes used to denote what we would call types of energy For example in milie du Ch telet wrote Dead force consists of a simple tendency to motion such is that of a spring ready to relax living force is that which a body has when it is in actual motion In modern terminology dead force and living force correspond to potential energy and kinetic energy respectively Conservation of energy was not established as a universal principle until it was understood that the energy of mechanical work can be dissipated into heat With the concept of energy given a solid grounding Newton s laws could then be derived within formulations of classical mechanics that put energy first as in the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations described above br Modern presentations of Newton s laws use the mathematics of vectors a topic that was not developed until the late th and early th centuries Vector algebra pioneered by Josiah Willard Gibbs and Oliver Heaviside stemmed from and largely supplanted the earlier system of quaternions invented by William Rowan Hamilton br br br See
