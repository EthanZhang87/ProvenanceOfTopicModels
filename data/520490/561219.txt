Hydroplane racing also known as hydro racing is a sport involving racing hydroplanes on lakes rivers and bays It is a popular spectator sport in several countries br br br Racing circuits br br br International professional outboard hydroplane racing br The Union Internationale Motonautique or UIM headquartered in Europe sanctions many different hydroplane categories of hydroplane powerboat racing International UIM F F F and F Circuit powerboat races are very popular in Europe Asia and the United States UIM s O series hydroplane Formula Circuit racing events are some of the most prestigious Professional Racing Outboard PRO hydroplane events in the world National powerboat racing teams compete for national and international titles in these hydroplane racing circuits The American Power Boat Association APBA sanction similar PRO class national title events in the United States Professional F series World Cup Title powerboat races are held at Europe United States and western Asia race site locations every year Equivalent APBA PRO classes are ccH UIM O ccH UIM O ccH UIM O ccH UIM O ccH UIM O ccH APBA only and ccH classes PRO classes using cc and larger displacement racing motors must be equipped with an enclosed re enforced capsule a certified racing harness restraint system and a self contained oxygen system for the driver The faster classes of PRO hydroplanes with straightaway speeds from around to miles per hour use cycle outboard motors running highly filtered methanol race fuel mixed with a pure castor or synthetic castor based lubricating oil All methanol fueled and gasoline fueled PRO racing outboard motors are direct drive no gear reduction and equipped with high performance motorcycle racing style magneto ignition and carburetor systems cc through cc PRO series hydroplanes are not entry level classes in outboard powerboat racing Investment costs are moderately high compared to similar APBA stock and modified outboard racing classes K PRO an APBA entry class is the only PRO hydroplane class running modified recreational outboard motors all other PRO hydroplane classes use stroke outboard motors designed and manufactured specifically for PRO circuit racing purposes Entry level classes for the PRO series classes are gasoline fueled K PRO APBA sanctions only and OSY sanctioned by both UIM and APBA International UIM teams have a formal crew that usually consists of family members motor mechanic hull builder sponsor and owner driver team in order to be successful at racing international F through F Circuit hydroplanes Some hydroplane hull builders sponsor more than one team in a formula series circuit PRO outboard hydroplane hulls are constructed with lightweight wood composite and hybrid wood composite aluminum materials Outboard Performance Craft hydroplanes sometimes called tunnel boats are a different racing series of UIM and APBA outboard powerboat classes Limited hydroplane racing classes are inboard engine powered boats that use high performance gasoline fuel br br br Grand Prix hydroplane racing br Grand Prix GP is a class of boats featuring supercharged big block V piston engines producing as much as horsepower The to foot craft are fast routinely attaining speeds in excess of miles per hour km h in the straights This class of boat races in the United States Canada Australia and New Zealand br br br Unlimited hydroplane racing br br Although bit of a misnomer as the boats aren t without limits unlimited hydroplanes have much fewer restrictions than with limited hydroplane racing These foot lbs boats most often powered by a Lycoming T L turbine engine used from the Vietnam era to the present day in the CH Chinook military helicopter which is capable of up to horsepower with current restrictions The T L powerplant creates high speed rotational energy which is transferred through a gearbox at around gear reduction to reduce propeller RPM Unlimited hydroplanes are capable of speeds of mph on the straightaways and qualifying average lap speeds range from mph Modern hulls are constructed of composite materials such as honeycomb aluminum fiberglass laminated resin and carbon fiber Many of the restored fully operable unlimited hydroplanes at the Hydroplane Raceboat Museum in Kent Washington such as the Miss Wahoo and Miss Thriftway vintage restorations still use piston powered inline aircraft engines The primary racing circuit for unlimited racing is the H Unlimited whose season runs from mid February through September consisting of five races H Unlimited races occur throughout the United States and the Middle East br br br Stock and modified outboard racing br Stock Outboard Racing uses both hydroplane and runabout or monoplane hulls with racing engines that use a service outboard powerhead and a racing lower unit with a direct drive i e start in gear no gear reduction Racing in this form ranges from classes designated as follows A Class B Class C Class and D Class There is also a Junior or J Class for kids between the ages of and years of age The engine sizes range from horsepower kW to horsepower kW with speeds from miles per hour km h to miles per hour km h In the C Stock Class the Yamato Motor Company engines used in Ky tei boat racing with parimutuel betting in Japan are reconditioned shipped to the United States and used for racing in these classes br Modified Outboard Hydroplane Racing classes are powered by modified stock outboard class motors Motor modifications are limited to strict motor specifications and equipment alterations defined and published in APBA category rule books for these outboard hydroplane racing classes Both stock and modified outboard classes run on a circular or triangular race course using a minute milling warm up period before a flying clock start Heats usually consist of three laps around a closed race course Drivers are disqualified if they cross the starting line before the official heat s clock start time called jumping the gun Just like the Stock PRO hydroplane racing categories of APBA the Modified hydroplane racing category membership has its own governing powerboat racing committee and rules book br br br Safety improvements br In the early days of hydroplane racing accidents and even the deaths of drivers were considered somewhat routine which was also the case on most early motor racing As top speeds increased more attention was paid to driver safety much like with driver safety programs being instituted in most motor racing series today such as NASCAR Formula One INDYCAR Grand Prix motorcycle racing and others Governing UIM and APBA powerboat racing organizations have promoted and specified many modern technology safety measures and rules for international hydroplane racing Modern safety technology applications like composite fiber re enforced Kevlar cockpits capsule enclosed driver modules with improved safety harness systems in PRO OPC and limited unlimited inboard hydroplanes flip over incident escape hatches engine shut off features oxygen system aircraft quality windscreen canopies for capsule hulls and advanced ballistic impact resistant suits with improved helmet neck brace wear all of these improvements making the boats and specialized personal protection gear safer for the present day driver The HANS device developed by sportscar racer Jim Downing has become mandatory in many classes and future advanced head and spine protection applications driver upper body control stabilization during high G force events are being tested in future hydroplane capsule designs br br br Notable figures br br br Current unlimited hydroplane drivers br Jimmy Shane br Jeff Bernard br Dave Villwock br br br Notable unlimited hydroplanes present
