A rudder is a primary control surface used to steer a ship boat submarine hovercraft airship or other vehicle that moves through a fluid medium usually air or water On an airplane the rudder is used primarily to counter adverse yaw and p factor and is not the primary control used to turn the airplane A rudder operates by redirecting the fluid past the hull or fuselage thus imparting a turning or yawing motion to the craft In basic form a rudder is a flat plane or sheet of material attached with hinges to the craft s stern tail or after end Often rudders are shaped so as to minimize hydrodynamic or aerodynamic drag On simple watercraft a tiller essentially a stick or pole acting as a lever arm may be attached to the top of the rudder to allow it to be turned by a helmsman In larger vessels cables pushrods or hydraulics may be used to link rudders to steering wheels In typical aircraft the rudder is operated by pedals via mechanical linkages or hydraulics br br br History of the rudder br Generally a rudder is part of the steering apparatus of a boat or ship that is fastened outside the hull that is denoting all different types of oars paddles and rudders More specifically the steering gear of ancient vessels can be classified into side rudders and stern mounted rudders depending on their location on the ship A third term steering oar can denote both types In a Mediterranean context side rudders are more specifically called quarter rudders as the later term designates more exactly the place where the rudder was mounted Stern mounted rudders are uniformly suspended at the back of the ship in a central position br Although some classify a steering oar as a rudder others argue that the steering oar used in ancient Egypt and Rome was not a true rudder and define only the stern mounted rudder used in ancient Han dynasty China as a true rudder The steering oar has the capacity to interfere with the handling of the sails limiting any potential for long ocean going voyages while it was fit more for small vessels on narrow rapid water transport the rudder did not disturb the handling of the sails took less energy to operate by its helmsman was better fit for larger vessels on ocean going travel and first appeared in ancient China during the st century AD In regards to the ancient Phoenician BC use of the steering oar without a rudder in the Mediterranean Leo Block writes br br A single sail tends to turn a vessel in an upwind or downwind direction and rudder action is required to steer a straight course A steering oar was used at this time because the rudder had not yet been invented With a single sail a frequent movement of the steering oar was required to steer a straight course this slowed down the vessel because a steering oar or rudder course correction acts as a brake The second sail located forward could be trimmed to offset the turning tendency of the mainsail and minimize the need for course corrections by the steering oar which would have substantially improved sail performance br The steering oar or steering board is an oversized oar or board to control the direction of a ship or other watercraft prior to the invention of the rudder It is normally attached to the starboard side in larger vessels though in smaller ones it is rarely if ever attached br br br Steering oar gear br br br Ancient Egypt br br Rowing oars set aside for steering appeared on large Egyptian vessels long before the time of Menes BC In the Old Kingdom BC BC as many as five steering oars are found on each side of passenger boats The tiller at first a small pin run through the stock of the steering oar can be traced to the fifth dynasty BC Both the tiller and the introduction of an upright steering post abaft reduced the usual number of necessary steering oars to one each side Single steering oars put on the stern can be found in a number of tomb models of the time particularly during the Middle Kingdom when tomb reliefs suggests them commonly employed in Nile navigation The first literary reference appears in the works of the Greek historian Herodotus BC who had spent several months in Egypt They make one rudder and this is thrust through the keel probably meaning the crotch at the end of the keel as depicted in the Tomb of Menna br In Iran oars mounted on the side of ships for steering are documented from the rd millennium BCE in artwork wooden models and even remnants of actual boats br br br Ancient Rome br br Roman navigation used sexillie quarter steering oars that went in the Mediterranean through a long period of constant refinement and improvement so that by Roman times ancient vessels reached extraordinary sizes The strength of the steering oar lay in its combination of effectiveness adaptability and simpleness Roman quarter steering oar mounting systems survived mostly intact through the medieval period br By the first half of the st century AD steering gear mounted on the stern were also quite common in Roman river and harbour craft as proved from reliefs and archaeological finds Zwammerdam Woerden A tomb plaque of Hadrianic age shows a harbour tug boat in Ostia with a long stern mounted oar for better leverage The boat already featured a spritsail adding to the mobility of the harbour vessel Further attested Roman uses of stern mounted steering oars includes barges under tow transport ships for wine casks and diverse other ship types A large river barge found at the mouth of the Rhine near Zwammerdam featured a large steering gear mounted on the stern According to new research the advanced Nemi ships the palace barges of emperor Caligula AD may have featured m long rudders br br br Sternpost mounted rudder br br br Ancient China br br The world s oldest known depiction of a sternpost mounted rudder can be seen on a pottery model of a Chinese junk dating from the st century AD during the Han dynasty predating their appearance in the West by a thousand years In China miniature models of ships that feature steering oars have been dated to the Warring States period c BC Sternpost mounted rudders started to appear on Chinese ship models starting in the st century AD However the Chinese continued to use the steering oar long after they invented the rudder since the steering oar still had practical use for inland rapid river travel One of oldest known depictions of the Chinese stern mounted rudder du can be seen on a foot cm pottery model of a junk dating from the st century AD during the Han dynasty BC AD It was discovered in Guangzhou in an archaeological excavation carried out by the Guangdong Provincial Museum and Academia Sinica of Taiwan in Within decades several other Han dynasty ship models featuring rudders were found in archaeological excavations The first solid written reference to the use of a rudder without a steering oar dates to the th century br Chinese rudders are attached to the hull by means of wooden jaws or sockets while typically larger ones were suspended from above by a rope tackle system so that they could be raised or lowered into the water Also many junks incorporated fenestrated rudders rudders with holes in them supposedly allowing for better control Detailed descriptions of Chinese junks during the Middle Ages are known from various travellers to China such as Ibn Battuta of Tangier Morocco and Marco Polo of Venice Italy The later Chinese encyclopedist Song Yingxing and the th century European traveler Louis Lecomte wrote of the junk design and its use of the rudder with enthusiasm and admiration br br Paul Johnstone and Sean McGrail state that the Chinese invented the median vertical and axial sternpost mounted rudder and that such a kind of rudder preceded the pintle and gudgeon rudder found in the West by roughly a millennium br br br Ancient India br A Chandraketugarh West Bengal seal dated between the st and rd centuries AD depicts a steering mechanism on a ship named Indra of the Ocean Jaladhisakra which indicates that it was a sea bound vessel br br br Medieval Near East br Arab ships also used a sternpost mounted rudder On their ships the rudder is controlled by two lines each attached to a crosspiece mounted on the rudder head perpendicular to the plane of the rudder blade The earliest evidence comes from the Ahsan al Taqasim fi Marifat al Aqalim The Best Divisions for the Classification of Regions written by al Muqaddasi in br br The captain from the crow s nest carefully observes the sea When a rock is espied he shouts Starboard or Port Two youths posted there repeat the cry The helmsman with two ropes in his hand when he hears the calls tugs one or the other to the right or left If great care is not taken the ship strikes the rocks and is wrecked br br br Medieval Europe br br Oars mounted on the side of ships evolved into quarter steering oars which were used from antiquity until the end of the Middle Ages in Europe As the size of ships and the height of the freeboards increased quarter steering oars became unwieldy and were replaced by the more sturdy rudders with pintle and gudgeon attachment While steering oars were found in Europe on a wide range of vessels since Roman times including light war galleys in Mediterranean the oldest known depiction of a pintle and gudgeon rudder can be found on church carvings of Zedelgem and Winchester dating to around br br While earlier rudders were mounted on the stern by the way of rudderposts or tackles the iron hinges allowed the rudder to be attached to the entire length of the sternpost in a permanent fashion However its full potential could only to be realized after the introduction of the vertical sternpost and the full rigged ship in the th century From the Age of Discovery onwards European ships with pintle and gudgeon rudders sailed successfully on all seven seas br Historians like Joseph Needham hold that the stern mounted rudder was transferred from China to Europe and the Islamic world during the Middle Ages br br br Modern rudders br Conventional rudders have been essentially unchanged since Isambard Kingdom Brunel introduced the balanced rudder on the SS Great Britain in and the steering engine in the SS Great Eastern in If a vessel requires extra maneuverability at low speeds the rudder may be supplemented by a manoeuvring thruster in the bow or be replaced entirely by azimuth thrusters br br br Boat rudders details br Boat rudders may be either outboard or inboard Outboard rudders are hung on the stern or transom Inboard rudders are hung from a keel or skeg and are thus fully submerged beneath the hull connected to the steering mechanism by a rudder post that comes up through the hull to deck level often into a cockpit Inboard keel hung rudders which are a continuation of the aft trailing edge of the full keel are traditionally deemed the most damage resistant rudders for off shore sailing Better performance with faster handling characteristics can be provided by skeg hung rudders on boats with smaller fin keels br Rudder post and mast placement defines the difference between a ketch and a yawl as these two masted vessels are similar Yawls are defined as having the mizzen mast abaft i e aft of the rudder post ketches are defined as having the mizzen mast forward of the rudder post br Small boat rudders that can be steered more or less perpendicular to the hull s longitudinal axis make effective brakes when pushed hard over However terms such as hard over hard to starboard etc signify a maximum rate turn for larger vessels Transom hung rudders or far aft mounted fin rudders generate greater moment and faster turning than more forward mounted keel hung rudders Rudders on smaller craft can be operated by means of a tiller that fits into the rudder stock that also forms the fixings to the rudder foil Craft where the length of the tiller could impede movement of the helm can be split with a rubber universal joint and the part adjoined the tiller termed a tiller extension Tillers can further be extended by means of adjustable telescopic twist locking extension br There is also the barrel type rudder where the ship s screw is enclosed and can be swiveled to steer the vessel Designers claim that this type of rudder on a smaller vessel will answer the helm faster br br br Rudder control br br Large ships over ton gross tonnage have requirements on rudder turnover time To comply with this high torque rudder controls are employed One commonly used system is the ram type steering gear It employs four hydraulic rams to rotate the rudder stock rotation axis in turn rotating the rudder br br br Aircraft rudders br br On an aircraft a rudder is the directional control surface along with the rudder like elevator usually attached to the horizontal tail structure if not a slab elevator and ailerons attached to the wings that control pitch and roll respectively The rudder is usually attached to the fin or vertical stabilizer which allows the pilot to control yaw about the vertical axis i e change the horizontal direction in which the nose is pointing br Unlike a ship both aileron and rudder controls are used together to turn an aircraft with the ailerons imparting roll and the rudder imparting yaw and also compensating for a phenomenon called adverse yaw A rudder alone will turn a conventional fixed wing aircraft but much more slowly than if ailerons are also used in conjunction Sometimes pilots may intentionally operate the rudder and ailerons in opposite directions in a maneuver called a slip or sideslip This may be done to overcome crosswinds and keep the fuselage in line with the runway or to lose altitude by increasing drag or both br Another technique for yaw control used on some tailless aircraft and flying wings is to add one or more drag creating surfaces such as split ailerons on the outer wing section Operating one of these surfaces creates drag on the wing causing the plane to yaw in that direction These surfaces are often referred to as drag rudders br br br See also br br Ship s wheel Mechanism used to steer a ship or
