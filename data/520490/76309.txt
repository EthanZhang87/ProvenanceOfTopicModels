The Allison V aircraft engine designed and produced by the Allison Engine Company was the only US developed V liquid cooled engine to see service during World War II Versions with a turbocharger gave excellent performance at high altitude in the twin engined Lockheed P Lightning and turbo superchargers were fitted to experimental single engined fighters with similar results br The United States Army Air Corps USAAC preference for turbochargers early in the V s development program meant that less effort was spent on developing suitable mechanically driven centrifugal superchargers for the Allison V design as other V designs from friendly nations like the British Rolls Royce Merlin were already using br When smaller dimensioned or lower cost versions of the V were desired they generally had poor performance at higher altitudes The V nevertheless gave excellent service when turbocharged notably in the P Lightning which accounted for much of the extensive production run br br br Design and development br The Allison Division of General Motors began developing an ethylene glycol cooled engine in to meet a USAAC need for a modern hp kW engine to fit into a new generation of streamlined bombers and fighters To ease production the new design could be equipped with different propeller gearing systems and superchargers allowing a single production line to build engines for various fighters and bombers br The United States Navy USN hoped to use the V in its rigid airships Akron and Macon but both were equipped with German built Maybach VL II engines as the V was still in testing when the Macon was lost in February the Akron having been lost in April The USAAC purchased its first V in December The Great Depression slowed development and it was not until December that the engine next flew in the Consolidated XA A testbed The V C successfully completed the USAAC hour Type Test on April at hp kW the first engine of any type to do so The engine was then offered to aircraft manufacturers where it powered the prototype Curtiss XP s All entrants in the new pursuit competition were designed around it powering the Lockheed P Bell P and Curtiss P When war material procurement agents from the United Kingdom asked North American Aviation to build the P under license NAA instead proposed their own improved aircraft design using the V in their NA br br br Technical description br The V has cylinders with a bore and stroke of by in by mm in V format for a displacement of cu in L with a compression ratio of The valvetrain has a single overhead camshaft per bank of cylinders and four valves per cylinder br br br Versatility and reversibility of rotation br The engine design benefited from the General Motors philosophy of built in production and installation versatility embracing a philosophy of modular design for aviation powerplants The engine was constructed around a basic power section from which different installation requirements could be met by fitting the appropriate accessories section at the rear and an appropriate power output drive at the front A turbo supercharger could be used if desired br The P P and Douglas XB Mixmaster used V Es exchanging the integral reduction gear for an extension shaft driving a remotely located reduction gear and propeller Aircraft such as the P P P A and North American P E used close coupled propeller reduction gears a feature of the V F series br The accessory end had a one or two speed engine driven supercharger that might have a second stage with or without an intercooler the ignition magnetos and the customary assortment of oil and fuel pumps all dictated by the application requirements The front of the engine could have one of a number of different output drives The drive might be a long nose or close coupled propeller reduction gear an extension drive to a remote gearbox or a gearbox that could drive two wing mounted propellers from a fuselage mounted engine Another key feature of the V design was its ability to turn the output shaft clockwise or counter clockwise by assembling the engine with the crankshaft turned end for end by installing an idler gear in the drive train to the supercharger camshafts and accessories installing a starter turning the proper direction and re arranging the ignition wiring on the right side to accommodate a changed firing order No change to the oil pump nor coolant pump circuits was needed The ability to reverse the direction of rotation with a minimum of extra parts to achieve the task allowed the use of either a tractor or pusher propeller This approach allowed easy changes of the supercharger s and supercharger drive gear ratio That gave different critical altitude the maximum altitude at which the engine could produce full power ratings ranging from to feet to m br br br Supercharger br The V has often been criticized for not having a high altitude supercharger The comparison is usually to the later two stage versions of the Rolls Royce Merlin series engines also built by Packard as the V and used in the P B Mustang and subsequent variants The USAAC had specified that the V was to be a single stage supercharged engine and if a higher altitude capability was desired the aircraft could use their newly developed turbo supercharger as was featured in the XP YP P and XP br The benefits of a two stage supercharger eventually became so clear that Allison did make some efforts in this direction Allison attached an auxiliary supercharger in various configurations to the existing engine mounted supercharger and carburetor Early versions of these two stage supercharger engines were used on the P No intercooler aftercooler or backfire screen flame trap were incorporated into these two stage V engines except for the V used on the experimental P J which had an aftercooler The two stage Merlin engines had all of these features which were designed to prevent detonation from charge heating and backfire into the supercharger The G series V s installed on the F E F G models had only anti detonation injection ADI to deal with these problems and not surprisingly had severe reliability and maintenance problems In one record it was stated that the F required hours of maintenance for each hour of flight br Although the early V powered P P and P A were limited to combat operations at a maximum of about feet m they were available in comparatively large numbers and were the mainstay of some Allied Air Forces in all but the European theater of war The engines proved to be robust and little affected by machine gun fire In total over percent of the post June USAAF s pursuit aircraft operated during WWII were powered by the V br Allison slowly but continuously improved the engine during the war The initial rating of hp kW was incrementally increased the final V G R L was rated for hp kW By the War Emergency Power rating on the P L was hp kW br The most powerful factory variant was the V designed to produce hp kW at low altitude and hp kW at feet m This engine was static tested at hp kW and was planned for installation in an XP H aircraft The end of the war ended this development so this promising experiment never flew The extra power of this version was derived from using exhaust turbines not to drive a turbo supercharger but to return that energy to turning the crankshaft called a turbo compound engine br Improvements in manufacturing brought the cost to produce each engine from down to and allowed the installed lifetime of the engine to be increased from hours to as much as hours for the less stressed power plants Weight increases needed to accomplish this were minimal with the result that all models were able to produce more than hp lb kW kg at their takeoff rating br There was also a high degree of commonality of parts throughout the series The individual parts of the Allison series were produced to a high degree of standardization and reliability using the best technology available at the time Even after the war racing Merlins used Allison connecting rods As stated previously General Motors policies regarding versatility meant that their Allison division would also employ modular design features on the V from its long block core V unit outwards so that it was capable of being mated to many different styles of turbo superchargers and various other accessories although the variety of turbo superchargers available for installation was limited due to the constraints of single engine fighter design Since it was produced in large numbers and was highly standardised the engine has been used in many postwar racing designs Its reliability and well mannered operation allowed it to operate at high rpm for extended periods br Following the war North American built P E F for air defense roles into the early s This was the final military role for the V br br br Turbo supercharger br The USAAC had earlier decided to concentrate on turbo superchargers for high altitude boost believing that further development of turbo superchargers would allow their engines to outperform European rivals using displacement superchargers Turbo superchargers are powered by the engine exhaust and so do not draw much power from the engine crankshaft whereas displacement superchargers are coupled directly by shafts and gears to the engine crankshaft Turbo superchargers do increase the exhaust back pressure and thus do cause a very small decrease in engine power but the power increase due to increased induction pressures more than makes up for that decrease Crankshaft driven superchargers require an increase in directly driven percentage of engine power as altitude increases the two stage supercharger of the Merlin series engines consumed some hp kW at ft m General Electric was the sole source for research and production of American turbo superchargers during this period from its four decades worth of steam turbine engineering experience br Turbo superchargers were highly successful in U S bombers which were exclusively powered by radial engines The P fighter had the same combination of radial engine R and turbo supercharger and was also successful apart from its large bulk which was caused by the need for the ductwork for the aft mounted turbo supercharger br However mating the turbocharger with the Allison V proved to be problematic As a result designers of the fighter planes that used the V were invariably forced to choose between the poor high altitude performance of the V versus the increased problems brought on by addition of the turbo supercharger The fates of all of the V powered fighters of World War II would thus hinge on that choice br The original XP was built with a V augmented by a General Electric Type B turbo supercharger as specified by Fighter Projects Officer Lieutenant Benjamin S Kelsey and his colleague Gordon P Saville Numerous changes were made to the design during a period of time when Kelsey s attention was focused elsewhere and Bell engineers NACA aero dynamic specialists and the substitute fighter project officer determined that dropping the turbocharger would be among the drag reduction measures indicated by borderline wind tunnel test results an unnecessary step according to aviation engineer and historian Warren M Bodie The production P was thus stuck with poor high altitude performance and proved unsuitable for the air war in Western Europe which was largely conducted at high altitudes The P was rejected by the British but used by the U S in the Mediterranean and the early Pacific air war as well as shipped to the Soviet Union in large numbers under the Lend Lease program The Soviets were able to make good use of P s because of its excellent manoeuvrability and because the air war on the Eastern Front in Europe was primarily short ranged tactical and conducted at lower altitudes In the P Soviet pilots scored the highest number of individual kills made on any American or British fighter type The P which also had only the single stage single speed supercharged V had similar problems with high altitude performance br The P was the only fighter to make it into combat during World War II with turbo supercharged V s The operating conditions of the Western European air war flying for long hours in intensely cold weather at feet m revealed several problems with these engines They had a poor manifold fuel air distribution and poor temperature regulation of the turbo supercharger air which resulted in frequent engine failures detonation occurred as the result of persistent uneven fuel air mixture across the cylinders caused by the poor manifold design Specially formulated fuels were a necessity for the P as were specific spark plugs needed for specific cylinders The turbo supercharger had additional problems with getting stuck in the freezing air in either high or low boost mode the high boost mode could cause detonation in the engine while the low boost mode would be manifested as power loss in one engine resulting in sudden fishtailing in flight These problems were aggravated by sub optimal engine management techniques taught to many pilots during the first part of WWII including a cruise setting that ran the engine at high RPM and low manifold pressure with a rich mixture These settings can contribute to over cooling of the engine fuel condensation problems accelerated mechanical wear and the likelihood of components binding or freezing up Details of the failure patterns were described in a report by General Doolittle to General Spatz in January In March the first Allison engines appearing over Berlin belonged to a group of P Hs of th Fighter Group engine troubles contributing to a reduction of the force to half strength over the target It was too late to correct these problems in the production lines of Allison or GE and as the numbers of Merlin engined P Mustangs based in England mounted up through the end of and into the P s were steadily withdrawn from Europe until October when they were no longer used for bomber escort duty with the Eighth Air Force A few P s would remain in the European theater as the F for photo reconnaissance br The P had fewer engine failures in the Pacific Theater where operating techniques were better developed such as those recommended by Charles Lindbergh during his development work in the theater and the Japanese did not operate at such high altitudes Using the same P Gs which were proving difficult to maintain in England Pacific based pilots were able to use the aircraft to good advantage including in April Operation Vengeance the interception and downing of the Japanese bomber carrying Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto New P models with ever increasing power from more advanced Allisons were eagerly accepted by Pacific air groups br When Packard started building Merlin V engines in America in certain American fighter designs using the Allison V were changed to use the Merlin The P F a Lend Lease export to Britain was one of the first American fighters to be converted to a Packard Merlin engine However the installed engine was the V a Packard produced Merlin XX with a slightly improved single stage two speed supercharger yielding only modest gains over the Allison V br The last Allison powered P the Mustang I II P A used the single stage single speed Allison V with a blower ratio This allowed the P A to reach a maximum speed of mph km h kn at ft m and maintain mph km h kn at ft m This was more than mph km h kn faster than the Merlin powered Spitfire V at ft m and more than mph km h kn faster at ft m Its speed impressed the British and the RAF quickly realized the airplane would possess excellent high altitude performance if the Allison V engine were replaced by the Series Merlin A similar proposal to cure the P s problems by replacing its Allisons with Merlins was quashed by the USAAF after protests from Allison br br Starting with the V around after the P had been fitted with a Merlin by Rolls Royce Allison attached an auxiliary supercharger to some of its engines in an effort to improve high altitude performance The two stage supercharged Allison was essentially developed as an add on to the single stage engine and required minimal changes to the base engine While it lacked the refinement compactness and after cooler of the two stage Merlin the Allison used a pressure altitude governed variable speed first stage Various configurations of this auxiliary supercharger were used in production versions of the V that powered aircraft such as the Bell P and North American P E F G series In addition it was tried or studied as the powerplant for many experimental and test aircraft such as the Curtiss XP Ascender North American XP J lightweight Mustang Boeing XB Flying Fortress and Republic XP A AP both of the latter with turbo superchargers br br br Post war br The V powered F did not arrive in time for World War II but did see brief action in the Korean War although the type was completely withdrawn from Korea by the end of It had a short service life that was probably due to a combination of factors poor reliability from the G series V engines low numbers of F s produced and the arrival of jet fighters The initial production P B had Merlin engines but North American was forced to use the Allison V for the E F G models when Packard stopped production of the Merlin engine br In total V s were built by Allison during the war all in Indianapolis Indiana br br br Other uses br The V s useful life continued as thousands were available on the surplus market In the s many drag racers and land speed racers attracted by its reliability and good power output adopted the V Art Arfons and brother Walt in particular used one in Green Monster It proved unsuccessful as a drag racing engine being unable to accelerate rapidly but could taxi all day at Unlimited hydroplane racing also became a big sport across the U S at this time and V s were often tuned for racing at up to hp kW power levels that were beyond design criteria and significantly reduced durability br Later as purpose built V engines became available for drag racing and unlimited boats shifted to turboshaft power tractor pullers began using the Allison engine again developing unimagined power Finally the warbird movement began to restore and return to the air examples of the classic fighters of the war and many V powered pursuit airplanes began to fly again with freshly overhauled engines The reliability maintainability and availability of the engine has led others to use it to power flying examples of aircraft whose original engines are unobtainable This includes newly manufactured Russian Yak and Yak airplanes originally powered by Klimov V s in World War II and the two so far airworthy examples of the Ilyushin Il taking the place of the Mikulin V it originally used as well as ambitious projects such as a replica Douglas World Cruiser and Focke Wulf Fw D by Flug Werk of Germany br br br Variants br Allison s internal model designation for the V started with the letter A and proceeded to the letter H Each letter designated a family of engines that shared major components but differed in specific design details Each of these designs were identified by a number starting with number The last letter which was introduced when both right hand turning and left hand turning engines were built identified by the letter R or L respectively br
