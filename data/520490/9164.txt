Donald Malcolm Campbell March January was a British speed record breaker who broke eight absolute world speed records on water and on land in the s and s He remains the only person to set both world land and water speed records in the same year He died during a water speed record attempt at Coniston Water in the Lake District England br br br Family and personal life br Donald Malcolm Campbell was born at Canbury House Kingston upon Thames Surrey the son of Malcolm later Sir Malcolm Campbell holder of world speed records in the s and s in the Bluebird cars and boats and his second wife Dorothy Evelyn n e Whittall br Campbell attended St Peter s School Seaford in East Sussex and Uppingham School in Rutland At the outbreak of the Second World War he volunteered for the Royal Air Force but was unable to serve because of a case of childhood rheumatic fever He joined Briggs Motor Bodies Ltd in West Thurrock where he became a maintenance engineer Subsequently he was a shareholder in a small engineering company called Kine Engineering producing machine tools Following his father s death on December and aided by Malcolm s chief engineer Leo Villa the younger Campbell strove to set speed records first on water and then land br He married three times to Daphne Harvey in producing daughter Georgina Gina Campbell born on September to Dorothy McKegg in and to Tonia Bern in December which union lasted until his death in Campbell was intensely superstitious hating the colour green the number thirteen and believing nothing good ever happened on a Friday He also had some interest in the paranormal which he nurtured as a member of the Ghost Club br br br Water speed records br br Campbell began his speed record attempts in the summer of using his father s old boat Blue Bird K which he renamed Bluebird K His initial attempts that summer were unsuccessful although he did come close to raising his father s existing record The team returned to Coniston Water Lancashire in for further trials While there they heard that an American Stanley Sayres had raised the record from to mph to km h beyond K s capabilities without substantial modification br In late and Bluebird K was modified to make it a prop rider as opposed to her original immersed propeller configuration This greatly reduced hydrodynamic drag The third planing point would now be the propeller hub meaning one of the two propeller blades was always out of the water at high speed She now sported two cockpits the second one being for Leo Villa br Bluebird K now had a chance of exceeding Sayres record and also enjoyed success as a circuit racer winning the Oltranza Cup in Italy in the spring of that year Returning to Coniston in September they finally got Bluebird up to mph after further trials only to suffer a structural failure at mph km h which wrecked the boat Sayres raised the record the following year to mph km h in Slo Mo Shun IV br Along with Campbell Britain had another potential contender for water speed record honours John Cobb He had commissioned the world s first purpose built turbojet Hydroplane Crusader with a target speed of over mph km h and began trials on Loch Ness in autumn Cobb was killed later that year when Crusader broke up during an attempt on the record Campbell was devastated at Cobb s loss but he resolved to build a new Bluebird boat to bring the water speed record back to Britain br In early Campbell began development of his own advanced all metal jet powered Bluebird K hydroplane to challenge the record by now held by the American prop rider hydroplane Slo Mo Shun IV Designed by Ken and Lew Norris the K was a steel framed aluminium bodied three point hydroplane with a Metropolitan Vickers Beryl axial flow turbojet engine producing pound force kN of thrust br Like Slo Mo Shun but unlike Cobb s tricycle Crusader the three planing points were arranged with two forward on outrigged sponsons and one aft in a pickle fork layout prompting Bluebird s early comparison to a blue lobster K was of very advanced design and construction and its load bearing steel space frame ultra rigid and stressed to g exceeding contemporary military jet aircraft It had a design speed of miles per hour kilometres per hour and remained the only successful jet boat in the world until the late s br The designation K was derived from its Lloyd s unlimited rating registration It was carried on a prominent white roundel on each sponson underneath an infinity symbol Bluebird K was the seventh boat registered at Lloyds in the Unlimited series br Campbell set seven world water speed records in K between July and December The first of these marks was set at Ullswater on July where he achieved a speed of mph km h but only after many months of trials and a major redesign of Bluebird s forward sponson attachments points Campbell achieved a steady series of subsequent speed record increases with the boat during the rest of the decade beginning with a mark of mph km h in on Lake Mead in Nevada Subsequently four new marks were registered on Coniston Water where Campbell and Bluebird became an annual fixture in the latter half of the s enjoying significant sponsorship from the Mobil oil company and then subsequently BP br Campbell also made an attempt in the summer of at Canandaigua New York which failed due to lack of suitable calm water conditions Bluebird K became a well known and popular attraction and as well as her annual Coniston appearances K was displayed extensively in the UK United States Canada and Europe and then subsequently in Australia during Campbell s prolonged attempt on the land speed record in br To extract more speed and endow the boat with greater high speed stability in both pitch and yaw K was subtly modified in the second half of the s to incorporate more effective streamlining with a blown Perspex cockpit canopy and fluting to the lower part of the main hull In a small wedge shaped tail fin housing an arrester parachute modified sponson fairings that gave a significant reduction in forward aerodynamic lift and a fixed hydrodynamic stabilising fin attached to the transom to aid directional stability and exert a marginal down force on the nose were incorporated into the design to increase the safe operating envelope of the hydroplane Thus she reached mph km h in where an unprecedented peak speed of mph km h was achieved on one run mph km h in mph km h in and mph km h in br Campbell was awarded the Command of the British Empire CBE in January for his water speed record breaking and in particular his record at Lake Mead in the United States which earned him and Britain very positive acclaim br On November Campbell achieved the Australian water speed record of miles per hour km h on Lake Bonney Riverland in South Australia although he was unable to break the world record on that attempt br br br Land speed record attempt br br It was after the Lake Mead water speed record success in that the seeds of Campbell s ambition to hold the land speed record as well were planted The following year the serious planning was under way to build a car to break the land speed record which then stood at mph km h set by John Cobb in The Norris brothers designed Bluebird Proteus CN with mph km h in mind br The British motor industry in the guise of Dunlop BP Smiths Industries Lucas Automotive Rubery Owen as well as many others became heavily involved in the project to build the most advanced car the world had yet seen CN was powered by a specially modified Bristol Siddeley Proteus free turbine engine of shp kW driving all four wheels Bluebird CN was designed to achieve mph and was completed by the spring of br Following low speed tests conducted at the Goodwood motor racing circuit in Sussex in July the CN was taken to the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah United States scene of his father s last land speed record triumph some years earlier in September The trials initially went well and various adjustments were made to the car On the sixth run in CN Campbell lost control at over mph and crashed It was the car s tremendous structural integrity that saved his life He was hospitalised with a fractured skull and a burst eardrum as well as minor cuts and bruises but CN was a write off Almost immediately Campbell announced he was determined to have another go Sir Alfred Owen whose Rubery Owen industrial group had built CN offered to rebuild it for him That single decision was to have a profound influence on the rest of Campbell s life His original plan had been to break the land speed record at over mph in return to Bonneville the following year to really bump up the speed to something near to mph get his seventh water speed record with K and then retire br Campbell decided not to go back to Utah for the new trials He felt the Bonneville course was too short at mile km and the salt surface was in poor condition BP offered to find another venue and eventually after a long search Lake Eyre in South Australia was chosen It hadn t rained there for nine years and the vast dry bed of the salt lake offered a course of up to mile km By the summer of Bluebird CN was rebuilt some nine months later than Campbell had hoped It was essentially the same car but with the addition of a large stabilising tail fin and a reinforced fibreglass cockpit cover At the end of CN was shipped out to Australia ready for the new attempt Low speed runs had just started when the rains came The course was compromised and further rain meant that by May Lake Eyre was flooded to a depth of inches causing the attempt to be abandoned Campbell was heavily criticised in the press for alleged time wasting and mismanagement of the project despite the fact that he could hardly be held responsible for the unprecedented weather br To make matters worse for Campbell American Craig Breedlove drove his pure thrust jet car Spirit of America to a speed of miles per hour km h at Bonneville in July Although the car did not conform to FIA Federation Internationale de L Automobile regulations that stipulated it had to be wheel driven and have a minimum of four wheels in the eyes of the world Breedlove was now the fastest man on Earth br Campbell returned to Australia in March but the Lake Eyre course failed to fulfil the early promise it had shown in and there were further spells of rain BP pulled out as his main sponsor after a dispute but he was able to secure backing from Australian oil company Ampol br The track never properly dried out and Campbell was forced to make the best of the conditions Finally in July he was able to post some speeds that approached the record On the th of that month he took advantage of a break in the weather and made two courageous runs along the shortened and still damp track posting a new land speed record of mph km h The surreal moment was captured in a number of well known images by photographers including Australia s Jeff Carter br Campbell was bitterly disappointed with the record as the vehicle had been designed for much higher speeds CN covered the final third of the measured mile at an average of mph km h peaking as it left the measured distance at over mph km h He resented the fact that it had all been so difficult We ve made it we got the bastard at last was his reaction to the success Campbell s mph represented the official land speed record br In after Campbell s fatal accident his widow Tonia Bern Campbell negotiated a deal with Lynn Garrison president of Craig Breedlove and Associates that would see Craig Breedlove run Bluebird on Bonneville s Salt Flats This concept was cancelled when the parallel Spirit of America supersonic car project failed to find support br br br Double records br br Campbell now planned to go after the water speed record one more time with Bluebird K to do what he had aimed for so many years earlier during the initial planning stages of CN break both records in the same year After more delays he finally achieved his seventh water speed record at Lake Dumbleyung near Perth Western Australia on the last day of at a speed of mph km h He had become the first and so far only person to set both land and water speed records in the same year br Campbell s land speed record was short lived because FIA rule changes meant that pure jet cars would be eligible to set records from October Campbell s mph km h speed on his final Lake Eyre run remained the highest speed achieved by a wheel driven car until Bluebird CN is now on display at the National Motor Museum at Beaulieu in Hampshire England its potential only partly realised br br br Rocket car plans and final water speed record attempt br br br Bluebird Mach br br Campbell decided a massive jump in speed was called for following his successful land speed record attempt in Bluebird CN His vision was of a supersonic rocket car with a potential maximum speed of mph km h Norris Brothers were requested to undertake a design study Bluebird Mach was a design for a rocket powered supersonic land speed record car Campbell chose a lucky date to hold a press conference at the Charing Cross Hotel on July to announce his future record breaking plans br br In terms of speed on the Earth s surface my next logical step must be to construct a Bluebird car that can reach Mach The Americans are already making plans for such a vehicle and it would be tragic for the world image of British technology if we did not compete in this great contest and win The nation whose technologies are first to seize the faster than sound record on land will be the nation whose industry will be seen to leapfrog into the s or s We can have the car on the track within three years br Bluebird Mach was to be rocket powered Ken Norris had calculated using rocket motors would result in a vehicle with very low frontal area greater density and lighter weight than if he were to employ a jet engine Bluebird Mach would also be a relatively compact and simple design Norris specified two off the shelf Bristol Siddeley BS rocket engines The had been developed as a rocket assisted take off engine for military aircraft and was fuelled with kerosene using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidiser Each engine was rated at lbf kN thrust In Bluebird Mach application the combined lbf kN thrust would be equivalent of bhp kW PS at mph km h br br br Final record attempt br To increase publicity for his rocket car venture in the spring of Campbell decided to try once more for a water speed record This time the target was mph km h Bluebird K was fitted with a lighter and more powerful Bristol Orpheus engine taken from a Folland Gnat jet aircraft which developed pounds force N of thrust The modified boat was taken back to Coniston in the first week of November The trials did not go well The weather was very poor and K suffered an engine failure when her air intakes collapsed and debris was drawn into the engine By the middle of December some high speed runs were made in excess of mph km h but still well below Campbell s existing record Problems with Bluebird s fuel system meant that the engine could not reach full speed and so would not develop maximum power Eventually by the end of December after further modifications to her fuel system and the replacement of a fuel pump the fuel starvation problem was fixed and Campbell awaited better weather to mount an attempt br br br Death br br On January weather conditions were finally suitable for an attempt Campbell commenced the first run of his last record attempt at just after am Bluebird moved slowly out towards the middle of the lake where she paused briefly as Campbell lined her up With a deafening blast of power Campbell now applied full throttle and Bluebird began to surge forward Clouds of spray issued from the jet pipe water poured over the rear spar and after a few hundred yards at miles per hour km h Bluebird unstuck from the surface and rocketed off towards the southern end of the lake producing her characteristic comet s tail of spray She entered the measured kilometre at am Leo Villa witnessed her passing the first marker buoy at about mph km h in perfect steady planing trim her nose slightly down still accelerating seconds later Keith Harrison saw her leave the measured kilometre at a speed of over mph km h br The average speed for the first run was mph km h Campbell lifted his foot from the throttle about of a second before passing the southern kilometre marker As Bluebird left the measured kilometre Keith Harrison and Eric Shaw in a course boat at the southern end of the measured kilometre both noticed that she was very light around the bows riding on her front stabilising fins Her planing trim was no worse than she had exhibited when equipped with the Beryl engine but it was markedly different from that observed by Leo Villa at the northern end of the kilometre when she was under full acceleration Campbell had made his usual commentary throughout the run br Campbell s words on his first run were via radio intercom br br I m under way all systems normal brake swept up er air pressure warning light on I m coming onto track now and er I ll open up just as soon as I am heading down the lake er doesn t look too smooth from here doesn t matter here we go Here we go pause seconds Passing through four five coming up a lot of water nose beginning to lift water all over the front of the engine again and the nose is up low pressure fuel warning light going left OK we re up and away and passing through er tramping very hard at very hard indeed FULL POWER Passing through out of the way tramping like hell Leo I don t think I can get over the top but I ll try FULL HOUSE and I can t see where I am FULL HOUSE FULL HOUSE FULL HOUSE POWER OFF NOW I M THROUGH power garbled er passing through vector off Peel Island passing through I m lighting like mad brake gone down er engine lighting up now relighting passing Peel Island relight made normal and now down at Brown Howe passing through er nose hasn t dropped yet nose down br Instead of refuelling and waiting for the wash of this run to subside Campbell decided to make the return run immediately This was not an unprecedented diversion from normal practice as Campbell had used the advantage presented i e no encroachment of water disturbances on the measured kilometre by the quick turnaround in many previous runs The second run was even faster once severe tramping subsided on the run up from Peel Island caused by the water brake disturbance Once smooth water was reached some metres yd or so from the start of the kilometre K demonstrated cycles of ground effect hovering before accelerating hard at g to a peak speed of mph km h some metres or so from the southern marker buoy Bluebird was now experiencing bouncing episodes of the starboard sponson with increasing ferocity br At the peak speed the most intense and long lasting bounce precipitated a severe decelerating episode miles per hour km h to miles per hour km h g as K dropped back onto the water Engine flame out then occurred and shorn of thrust nose down momentum K experienced a gliding episode in strong ground effect with increasing angle of attack before completely leaving the water at her static stability pitch up limit of Bluebird then executed an almost complete backflip and slightly off axis before plunging into the water port sponson marginally in advance of the starboard approximately metres from the end of the measured kilometre The boat then cartwheeled across the water before coming to rest The impact killed Campbell instantly and broke K forward of the air intakes where Campbell was sitting and the main hull sank shortly afterwards br Mr Whoppit Campbell s teddy bear mascot was found among the floating debris and the pilot s helmet was recovered Royal Navy divers made efforts to find and recover the body but although the wreck of K was found they called off the search after two weeks without locating his body Campbell s body was finally located in br Campbell s last words during a second transmission on his final run were via radio intercom br br Full nose up Pitching a bit down here coming through our own wash er getting straightened up now on track rather closer to Peel Island and we re tramping like mad and er FULL POWER er tramping like hell OVER I can t see much and the water s very bad indeed I m galloping over the top and she s giving a hell of a bloody row in here I can t see anything I ve got the bows out I m going U hh br The cause of the crash has been variously attributed to several possible causes or a combination of these causes br br Campbell did not wait to refuel after doing a first run of mph km h and hence the boat was lighter and travelled through the wash caused by his first run a wash made much worse by the use of the water brake These factors have since been found to be not particularly important The water brake was used well to the south of the measured distance and only from approx mph km h The area in the centre of the course where Bluebird was travelling at peak speed on her return run was flat calm and not disturbed by the wash from the first run which had not had time to be reflected back on the course Campbell knew this and as discussed previously adopted his well practised quick turn around strategy br Bluebird may have exceeded its aerodynamic static stability limit complicated by the additional destabilising influences of loss of engine thrust There is also evidence to point to the fact that K s dynamic stability limit had been exceeded The cause s of the engine flame out cannot be established unequivocally It could have been due to fuel starvation damage to some ancillary structural element associated with engine function following the worst bouncing episode disturbance of the airstream into the intakes during the pitching episodes or indeed a combination of all three Further evidence of lost engine thrust may be seen in both cinematographic and still film recordings of the latter part of the run as Bluebird left the water jet exhaust from a functioning engine would have severely disturbed the water surface no such disturbance or accompanying spray is evident Also close examination of such records show no evidence to the effect that the water brake was deployed br Analysis of film footage suggests that Bluebird may have hit a duck during test runs which may have affected the aerodynamic shape of the boat making it harder to control at extreme speeds br On January Campbell was posthumously awarded the Queen s Commendation for Brave Conduct for courage and determination in attacking the world water speed record br br br Recovery of Bluebird K and Campbell s body br The wreckage of Campbell s craft was recovered by Gilgeous Diving Services GDS Extreme Engineering Liverpool along with amateur diver Bill Smith Lifting K was run and overseen by GDS Extreme Engineering and Smith s team The main section hull first raised in March and later in May when Campbell s body was recovered The largest section comprising approximately two thirds of the centre hull was raised on March The project began when Smith was inspired to look for the wreck after hearing the Marillion song Out of This World from the album Afraid of Sunlight which was written about Campbell and Bluebird br The remains of Campbell s body were located just over two months later and recovered from the lake on May still wearing his blue nylon overalls On the night before his death while playing cards he had drawn the queen and the ace of spades Reflecting upon the fact that Mary Queen of Scots had drawn the same two cards the night before she was beheaded he told his mechanics who were playing cards with him that he had a fearful premonition that he was going to get the chop It was not possible to determine the cause of Campbell s death though a consultant engineer giving evidence to the inquest said that the force of the impact could have caused him to be decapitated br br Campbell was buried in Coniston Cemetery on September after his coffin was carried down the lake and through the measured kilometre on a launch one last time A funeral service was then held at St Andrew s Church in Coniston after an earlier and positive DNA examination had been carried out The funeral was attended by his widow Tonia daughter Gina other members of his family members of his former team and admirers The funeral was overshadowed in the media by coverage of the attacks in the United States br Campbell s sister Jean Wales had been against the recovery of her brother s body out of respect for his stated wish that in the event of something going wrong Skipper and boat stay together br When Campbell was buried in Coniston Cemetery on September she did not attend the service Steve Hogarth lead singer for Marillion was present at the funeral and performed the song Out of This World solo br br br Legacy br br Between them Campbell and his father had set speed records on water and on land br The story of Campbell s last attempt at the water speed record on Coniston Water was told in the BBC television film Across the Lake in with Anthony Hopkins as Campbell Nine years earlier Robert Hardy had played Campbell s father Sir Malcolm Campbell in the BBC Playhouse television drama Speed King both were written by Roger Milner and produced by Innes Lloyd In the BBC showed a documentary reconstruction of Campbell s fateful water speed record attempt in an episode of Days That Shook the World It featured a mixture of modern reconstruction and original film footage All of the original colour clips were taken from a film capturing the event Campbell at Coniston by John Lomax a local amateur filmmaker from Wallasey England Lomax s film won awards worldwide in the late s for recording the final weeks of Campbell s life br In Campbell was surprised by Eamonn Andrews for the seventh episode of the new television show This Is Your Life br An English Heritage blue plaque commemorates Campbell and his father at Canbury School Kingston Hill Kingston upon Thames where they lived br In the village of Coniston the Ruskin Museum has a display of Campbell memorabilia and the Bristol Orpheus engine recovered in is also displayed The engine s casing is mostly missing having acted as a sacrificial anode in its time underwater but the internals
