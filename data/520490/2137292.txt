In fluid dynamics drag sometimes referred to as fluid resistance is a force acting opposite to the relative motion of any object moving with respect to a surrounding fluid This can exist between two fluid layers two solid surfaces or between a fluid and solid surface Drag forces tend to decrease fluid velocity relative to the solid object in the fluid s path br Unlike other resistive forces drag force depends on velocity This is because drag force is proportional to the velocity of low speed flow and the squared velocity for high speed flow This distinction between low and high speed flow is measured by the Reynolds number br br br Examples br Examples of drag include br br Net aerodynamic or hydrodynamic force Drag acting opposite to the direction of movement of a solid object such as cars aircraft and boat hulls br Viscous drag of fluid in a pipe Drag force on the immobile pipe decreases fluid velocity relative to the pipe br In the physics of sports drag force is necessary to explain the motion of balls javelins arrows and frisbees and the performance of runners and swimmers br br br Types br Types of drag are generally divided into the following categories br form drag or pressure drag due to the size and shape of a body br skin friction drag or viscous drag due to the friction between the fluid and a surface which may be the outside of an object or inside such as the bore of a pipe br The effect of streamlining on the relative proportions of skin friction and form drag is shown for two different body sections An airfoil which is a streamlined body and a cylinder which is a bluff body Also shown is a flat plate illustrating the effect that orientation has on the relative proportions of skin friction and pressure difference between front and back br A body is known as bluff or blunt when the source of drag is dominated by pressure forces and streamlined if the drag is dominated by viscous forces For example road vehicles are bluff bodies For aircraft pressure and friction drag are included in the definition of parasitic drag Parasite drag is often expressed in terms of a hypothetical br br br Parasitic drag experienced by aircraft br This is the area of a flat plate perpendicular to the flow It is used when comparing the drag of different aircraft For example the Douglas DC has an equivalent parasite area of m sq ft and the McDonnell Douglas DC with years of advancement in aircraft design an area of m sq ft although it carried five times as many passengers br br lift induced drag appears with wings or a lifting body in aviation and with semi planing or planing hulls for watercraft br wave drag aerodynamics is caused by the presence of shockwaves and first appears at subsonic aircraft speeds when local flow velocities become supersonic The wave drag of the supersonic Concorde prototype aircraft was reduced at Mach by by applying the area rule which extended the rear fuselage m ft on the production aircraft br wave resistance ship hydrodynamics or wave drag occurs when a solid object is moving along a fluid boundary and making surface waves br boat tail drag on an aircraft is caused by the angle with which the rear fuselage or engine nacelle narrows to the engine exhaust diameter br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Lift induced drag and parasitic drag br br br Lift induced drag br br Lift induced drag also called induced drag is drag which occurs as the result of the creation of lift on a three dimensional lifting body such as the wing or propeller of an airplane Induced drag consists primarily of two components drag due to the creation of trailing vortices vortex drag and the presence of additional viscous drag lift induced viscous drag that is not present when lift is zero The trailing vortices in the flow field present in the wake of a lifting body derive from the turbulent mixing of air from above and below the body which flows in slightly different directions as a consequence of creation of lift br With other parameters remaining the same as the lift generated by a body increases so does the lift induced drag This means that as the wing s angle of attack increases up to a maximum called the stalling angle the lift coefficient also increases and so too does the lift induced drag At the onset of stall lift is abruptly decreased as is lift induced drag but viscous pressure drag a component of parasite drag increases due to the formation of turbulent unattached flow in the wake behind the body br br br Parasitic drag br br Parasitic drag or profile drag is drag caused by moving a solid object through a fluid Parasitic drag is made up of multiple components including viscous pressure drag form drag and drag due to surface roughness skin friction drag Additionally the presence of multiple bodies in relative proximity may incur so called interference drag which is sometimes described as a component of parasitic drag br In aviation induced drag tends to be greater at lower speeds because a high angle of attack is required to maintain lift creating more drag However as speed increases the angle of attack can be reduced and the induced drag decreases Parasitic drag however increases because the fluid is flowing more quickly around protruding objects increasing friction or drag At even higher speeds transonic wave drag enters the picture Each of these forms of drag changes in proportion to the others based on speed The combined overall drag curve therefore shows a minimum at some airspeed an aircraft flying at this speed will be at or close to its optimal efficiency Pilots will use this speed to maximize endurance minimum fuel consumption or maximize gliding range in the event of an engine failure br br br The drag equation br br Drag depends on the properties of the fluid and on the size shape and speed of the object One way to express this is by means of the drag equation br br where br br br br br br F br br D br br br br

displaystyle R e br br for the case of a sphere Since the power needed to overcome the drag force is the product of the force times speed the power needed to overcome drag will vary as the square of the speed at low Reynolds numbers and as the cube of the speed at high numbers br It can be demonstrated that drag force can be expressed as a function of a dimensionless number which is dimensionally identical to the Bejan number Consequently drag force and drag coefficient can be a function of Bejan number In fact from the expression of drag force it has been obtained br br and consequently allows expressing the drag coefficient br br br br br C br br D br br br br br displaystyle C D br br as a function of Bejan number and the ratio between wet area br br br br br A br br w br br br br

e high Reynolds number Re This is also called quadratic drag br br The derivation of this equation is presented at Drag equation Derivation br The reference area A is often the orthographic projection of the object or the frontal area on a plane perpendicular to the direction of motion For objects with a simple shape such as a sphere this is the cross sectional area Sometimes a body is a composite of different parts each with a different reference area drag coefficient corresponding to each of those different areas must be determined br In the case of a wing the reference areas are the same and the drag force is in the same ratio as the lift force Therefore the reference for a wing is often the lifting area sometimes referred to as wing area rather than the frontal area br For an object with a smooth surface and non fixed separation points like a sphere or circular cylinder the drag coefficient may vary with Reynolds number Re up to extremely high values Re of the order br br For an object with well defined fixed separation points like a circular disk with its plane normal to the flow direction the drag coefficient is constant for Re br The further the drag coefficient Cd is in general a function of the orientation of the flow with respect to the object apart from symmetrical objects like a sphere br br br Power br Under the assumption that the fluid is not moving relative to the currently used reference system the power required to overcome the aerodynamic drag is given by br br The power needed to push an object through a fluid increases as the cube of the velocity increases For example a car cruising on a highway at mph km h may require only horsepower kW to overcome aerodynamic drag but that same car at mph km h requires hp kW With a doubling of speeds the drag force quadruples per the formula Exerting times the force over a fixed distance produces times as much work At twice the speed the work resulting in displacement over a fixed distance is done twice as fast Since power is the rate of doing work times the work done in half the time requires times the power br When the fluid is moving relative to the reference system for example a car driving into headwind the power required to overcome the aerodynamic drag is given by the following formula br br Where br br br br br v br br w br br br br br displaystyle v w br br is the wind speed and br br br br br v br br o br br br br br displaystyle v o br br is the object speed both relative to ground br br br Velocity of a falling object br br Velocity as a function of time for an object falling through a non dense medium and released at zero relative velocity v at time t is roughly given by a function involving a hyperbolic tangent tanh br br The hyperbolic tangent has a limit value of one for large time t In other words velocity asymptotically approaches a maximum value called the terminal velocity vt br br For an object falling and released at relative velocity v vi at time t with vi vt is also defined in terms of the hyperbolic tangent function br br For vi vt the velocity function is defined in terms of the hyperbolic cotangent function br br The hyperbolic cotangent also has a limit value of one for large time t Velocity asymptotically tends to the terminal velocity vt strictly from above vt br For vi vt the velocity is constant br br These functions are defined by the solution of the following differential equation br br Or more generically where F v are the forces acting on the object beyond drag br br For a potato shaped object of average diameter d and of density obj terminal velocity is about br br For objects of water like density raindrops hail live objects mammals birds insects etc falling in air near Earth s surface at sea level the terminal

displaystyle v t br br m s and so on Terminal velocity for very small objects pollen etc at low Reynolds numbers is determined by Stokes law br In short terminal velocity is higher for larger creatures and thus potentially more deadly A creature such as a mouse falling at its terminal velocity is much more likely to survive impact with the ground than a human falling at its terminal velocity br br br Low Reynolds numbers Stokes drag br br The equation for viscous resistance or linear drag is appropriate for objects or particles moving through a fluid at relatively slow speeds assuming there is no turbulence Purely laminar flow only exists up to Re under this definition In this case the force of drag is approximately proportional to velocity The equation for viscous

the fluid drag force that acts on any moving solid body in the direction of the air s freestream flow br br From the body s perspective near field approach the drag results from forces due to pressure distributions over the body surface symbolized br br br br br D br br p br r br br br br br displaystyle D pr br br br Forces due to skin friction which is a result of viscosity denoted br br br br br D br br f br br br br br displaystyle D f br br br Alternatively calculated from the flow field perspective far field approach the drag force results from three natural phenomena shock waves vortex sheet and viscosity br br br Overview of aerodynamics br When the airplane produces lift another drag component results Induced drag symbolized br br br br br D br br i br br br br br displaystyle D i br br is due to a modification of the pressure distribution due to the trailing vortex system that accompanies the lift production An alternative perspective on lift and drag is gained from considering the change of momentum of the airflow The wing intercepts the airflow and forces the flow to move downward This results in an equal and opposite force acting upward on the wing which is the lift force The change of momentum of the airflow downward results in a reduction of the rearward momentum of the flow which is the result of a force acting forward on the airflow and applied by the wing to the air flow an equal but opposite force acts on the wing rearward which is the induced drag Another drag component namely wave drag br br br br br D br br w br br br br br displaystyle D w br br results from shock waves in transonic and supersonic flight speeds The shock waves induce changes in the boundary layer and pressure distribution over the body surface br Therefore there are three ways of categorizing drag br br Pressure drag and friction drag br Profile drag and induced drag br Vortex drag wave drag and wake drag br br br Additional information for aerodynamics br The pressure distribution acting on a body s surface exerts normal forces on the body Those forces can be added together and the component of that force that acts downstream represents the drag force br br br br br D br br p br r br br br br br displaystyle D pr br br The nature of these normal forces combines shock wave effects vortex system generation effects and wake viscous mechanisms br Viscosity of the fluid has a major effect on drag In the absence of viscosity the pressure forces acting to hinder the vehicle are canceled by a pressure force further aft that acts to push the vehicle forward this is called pressure recovery and the result is that the drag is zero That is to say the work the body does on the airflow is reversible and is recovered as there are no frictional effects to convert the flow energy into heat Pressure recovery acts even in the case of viscous flow Viscosity however results in pressure drag and it is the dominant component of drag in the case of vehicles with regions of separated flow in which the pressure recovery is infective br The friction drag force which is a tangential force on the aircraft surface depends substantially on boundary layer configuration and viscosity The net friction drag br br br br br D br br f br br br br br displaystyle D f br br is calculated as the downstream projection of the viscous forces evaluated over the body s surface The sum of friction drag and pressure form drag is called viscous drag This drag component is due to viscosity br br br History br The idea that a moving body passing through air or another fluid encounters resistance had been known since the time of Aristotle According to Mervyn O Gorman this was named drag by Archibald Reith Low Louis Charles Breguet s paper of began efforts to reduce drag by streamlining Breguet went on to put his ideas into practice by designing several record breaking aircraft in the s and s Ludwig Prandtl s boundary layer theory in the s provided the impetus to minimise skin friction A further major call for streamlining was made by Sir Melvill Jones who provided the theoretical concepts to demonstrate emphatically the importance of streamlining in aircraft design br In his paper The Streamline Airplane presented to the Royal Aeronautical Society was seminal He proposed an ideal aircraft that would have minimal drag which led to the concepts of a clean monoplane and retractable undercarriage The aspect of Jones s paper that most shocked the designers of the time was his plot of the horse power required versus velocity for an actual and an ideal plane By looking at a data point for a given aircraft and extrapolating it horizontally to the ideal curve the velocity gain for the same power can be seen When Jones finished his presentation a member of the audience described the results as being of the same level of importance as the Carnot cycle in thermodynamics br br br Power curve in aviation br br The interaction of parasitic and induced drag vs airspeed can be plotted as a characteristic curve illustrated here In aviation this is often referred to as the power curve and is important to pilots because it shows that below a certain airspeed maintaining airspeed counterintuitively requires more thrust as speed decreases rather than less The consequences of being behind the curve in flight are important and are taught as part of pilot training At the subsonic airspeeds where the U shape of this curve is significant wave drag has not yet become a factor and so it is not shown in the curve br br br Wave drag in transonic and supersonic flow br br Wave drag sometimes referred to as compressibility drag is drag that is created when a body moves in a compressible fluid and at the speed that is close to the speed of sound in that fluid In aerodynamics wave drag consists of multiple components depending on the speed regime of the flight br In transonic flight wave drag is the result of the formation of shockwaves in the fluid formed when local areas of supersonic Mach number greater than flow are created In practice supersonic flow occurs on bodies traveling well below the speed of sound as the local speed of air increases as it accelerates over the body to speeds above Mach However full supersonic flow over the vehicle will not develop until well past Mach Aircraft flying at transonic speed often incur wave drag through the normal course of operation In transonic flight wave drag is commonly referred to as transonic compressibility drag Transonic compressibility drag increases significantly as the speed of flight increases towards Mach dominating other forms of drag at those speeds br In supersonic flight Mach numbers greater than wave drag is the result of shockwaves present in the fluid and attached to the body typically oblique shockwaves formed at the leading and trailing edges of the body In highly supersonic flows or in bodies with turning angles sufficiently large unattached shockwaves or bow waves will instead form Additionally local areas of transonic flow behind the initial shockwave may occur at lower supersonic speeds and can lead to the development of additional smaller shockwaves present on the surfaces of other lifting bodies similar to those found in transonic flows In supersonic flow regimes wave drag is commonly separated into two components supersonic lift dependent wave drag and supersonic volume dependent wave drag br The closed form solution for the minimum wave drag of a body of revolution with a fixed length was found by Sears and Haack and is known as the Sears Haack Distribution Similarly for a fixed volume the shape for minimum wave drag is the Von Karman Ogive br The Busemann biplane theoretical concept is not subject to wave drag when operated at its design speed but is incapable of generating lift in this condition br br br d Alembert s paradox br br In d Alembert proved that potential flow the th century state of the art inviscid flow theory amenable to mathematical solutions resulted in the prediction of zero drag This was in contradiction with experimental evidence and became known as d Alembert s paradox In the th century the Navier Stokes equations for the description of viscous flow were developed by Saint Venant Navier and Stokes Stokes derived the drag around a sphere at very low Reynolds numbers the result of which is called Stokes law br In the limit of high Reynolds numbers the Navier Stokes equations approach the inviscid Euler equations of which the potential flow solutions considered by d Alembert are solutions However all experiments at high Reynolds numbers showed there is drag Attempts to construct inviscid steady flow solutions to the Euler equations other than the potential flow solutions did not result in realistic results br The notion of boundary layers introduced by Prandtl in founded on both theory and experiments explained the causes of drag at high Reynolds numbers The boundary layer is the thin layer of fluid close to the object s boundary where viscous effects remain important even when the viscosity is very small or equivalently the Reynolds number is very large br br br See also br br br br br Improved Empirical Model for Base Drag Prediction on Missile Configurations based on New Wind Tunnel Data Frank G Moore et al NASA Langley Center
