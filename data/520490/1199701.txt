Sponsons are projections extending from the sides of land vehicles aircraft or watercraft to provide protection stability storage locations mounting points for weapons or other devices or equipment housing br br br Watercraft br On watercraft a sponson is a projection that extends outward usually from the hull but sometimes other parts of the vessel to improve stability while floating or to act as a securing point for other equipment Vessels with unstable body shapes or unevenly distributed weight are likely to feature sponsons to help prevent capsizing or other instabilities On many vessels these projections from the main body of the vessel can be attached and removed quickly and fairly easily br Canoes and kayaks sometimes feature sponson attachments as well for stability in rough waters These differ from outriggers which extend a significant distance away from the body of the craft and are employed on craft designed for open waters A sponson s terminus is close to the craft thereby allowing the boat to maneuver through narrower spaces and so is more likely to be used on smaller craft that still require maneuverability through narrow passages br In the mid s advances in sponson design made sponsons a tool for better handling at high speeds and they began being added to racing boats br There are essentially three types of sponsons for watercraft available on the market today the basic block type the hooked or winged type and the paddle or rudder type br br br Block sponsons br The block type is the simplest type The leading end is usually rounded or pointed for reduced drag Its main function is to provide additional lift on the back of the hull mostly during acceleration It can also help provide better side to side stability at speed and reduce porpoising by providing a bit more hull surface at the rear of the craft br br br Winged hooked sponsons br Winged or hooked sponsons are the most common type In addition to added lift during acceleration better side to side stability and reduced porpoising they provide improved handling The outside edge provides grip in turns allowing you to turn sharper and faster without fear of the back end sliding out They can also provide a pivot point for the hull in turns One of the most overlooked benefits of this type of sponson is that riders can lean into turns more making watercraft easier to push to their limits br br br Paddle rudder sponsons br Paddle or rudder type sponsons which use a flat paddle shaped rudder attached vertically to a block type sponson do essentially the same thing but the effect can be even more dramatic because the flat paddle or rudder portion of the sponson provides a sharper and more pronounced edge to catch the water br br br Aircraft br br On flying boats as first patented by Claudius Dornier and first used on the Kaiserliche Marine s German World War I flying boat the Zeppelin Lindau Rs IV a sponson can help extend the hull higher in the water reducing drag and providing additional lift when the plane is taking off br Helicopters may also feature one or more sponsons and though most helicopters are not designed to land in or take off from water these safety features are important should the aircraft crash land in water Sponsons on a helicopter can also store fuel or landing gear e g the Sikorsky S and the Bell When mounted on aircraft they must be adjusted properly for aerodynamics when the aircraft is in flight if they are not adjusted properly the aircraft might become unstable or damage to the aircraft might occur br br br Military br br On land vessels such as tanks or other military vehicles and on naval warships a sponson may refer to a mounting or enclosure projecting from the side or top of the structure hull that is not used for buoyancy but for armaments such as machine guns or for purposes of visibility In the case of warships of the late th to early th centuries the sponson could be enclosed and combined with a casemate similar to those of early British heavy tanks Alternatively a sponson could be open topped for a pivoting gun which could be fitted with a backless blast shield or unshielded Often a collapsing bulwark would be mounted around the edge of an sponson to improve seaworthiness Later examples of open topped sponsons on warships were even used to mount fully enclosed turrets upon and were sometimes combined with an embrasure of the hull It can be used for storage as well as a transport platform for people entering or leaving the vehicle It may also provide layers of bulletproof protection and storage space as found over the tracks of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle br br br See also br Anti torpedo bulge aka blister br Costa Concordia salvage an example of sponsons in use br Ship camel related technology of external flotation tanks affixed on a ship to reduce her draught br br br
