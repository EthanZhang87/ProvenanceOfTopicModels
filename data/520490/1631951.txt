title: Water speed record
id: 1631951
The world unlimited Water Speed Record is the officially recognised fastest speed achieved by a water borne vehicle irrespective of propulsion method The current unlimited record is km h mph achieved by Australian Ken Warby in the Spirit of Australia in br The record is one of the sporting world s most hazardous competitions Seven of the thirteen people who have attempted the record since June have died Two official attempts to beat Ken Warby s record resulted in the pilot s death Lee Taylor and Craig Arfons Despite this there are several teams currently working to make further attempts br The record is ratified by the Union Internationale Motonautique UIM br br br Before br br Until steam powered propeller driven vehicles held world water speed records br br Nathanael Herreshoff s Stiletto km h mph br William B Cogswell s Feiseen km h mph br Charles Algernon Parsons Turbinia km h mph br Charles R Flint s Arrow km h mph br br br s br In a m ft stepped planing hull Dixie IV designed by Clinton Crane became the first gasoline powered vessel to break the water speed record br In March the Maple Leaf III which was powered by two twelve cylinder motors producing hp each set a new water speed record of mph km h on The Solent br Beginning in Alexander Graham Bell and engineer Frederick W Casey Baldwin began experimenting with powered watercraft In with Baldwin piloting their HD hydrofoil a new world water speed record of km h mph was set on Bras d Or Lake at Baddeck Nova Scotia br br br s br In Garfield Wood set a new water speed record of mph km h on the Detroit River using a new boat called Miss America In the following twelve years Wood built nine more Miss Americas and broke the record five times Increased public interest generated by the speeds achieved by Wood and others led to an official speed record being ratified in The first person to try a record attempt was Wood s brother George On September he drove Miss America VII to km h mph on the Detroit River The next year Gar Wood took the same boat up a waterway Indian Creek Miami Beach and reached km h mph br br br s br Like the land speed record the water record was destined to become a scrap for national honour between the United Kingdom and the United States American success in setting records spurred Castrol Oil chairman Lord Wakefield to sponsor a project to bring the water record to Britain Famed land speed racer and racing driver Sir Henry Segrave was hired to pilot a new boat Miss England Although the boat was not capable of beating Wood s Miss America the British team did gain experience which was put into an improved boat Miss England II was powered by two Rolls Royce aircraft engines and seemed capable of beating Wood s record br On June Segrave piloted Miss England II to a new record of km h mph average speed during two runs on Windermere in Britain s Lake District Having set the record Segrave set off on a third run to try to improve the record further Unfortunately the boat flipped during the run with both Segrave and his co driver receiving fatal injuries br Following Segrave s death Miss England II was salvaged and repaired Kaye Don was chosen as the new driver for However during this time Gar Wood recaptured the record for the U S at km h mph A month later on Lake Garda Don got the record back with km h mph In February Wood responded nudging the mark to km h mph br In response to the continued American challenge the British team built a new boat Miss England III The design was an evolution of the predecessor with a squared off stern and twin propellers being the main improvements Don took the new boat to Loch Lomond Scotland on July improved the record first to km h mph then to km h mph on a second run br Determined to have the last word over his great rival Gar Wood built another new Miss America Miss America X was metres ft long powered by four supercharged Packard aeroplane engines On September Wood broke the km h mph barrier driving his new boat to km h mph It would prove the end of an era Don declined to attempt any further records Wood also opted to scale down his involvement in racing and returned to running his businesses Somewhat ironically both record breakers lived into their s Wood died in and Don in br br br Boat design changes br Wood s last record would be one of the final records for a conventional single keel boat In June Malcolm Campbell the world famous land speed record breaker drove Blue Bird K to a new record of km h mph at Lake Maggiore Compared to the massive Miss America X K was a much more compact craft It was metres shorter and had one engine to X s four br Despite his success Campbell was unsatisfied with the relatively small increase in speed He commissioned a new Blue Bird to be built Blue Bird K was a three pointer hydroplane Unlike conventional powerboats which have a single keel with an indent or step cut from the bottom to reduce drag a hydroplane has a concave base with two sponsons fitted to the front and a third point at the rear of the hull When the boat increases in speed most of the hull lifts out of the water and runs on the three contact points The positive effect is reduced drag the downside is that the three pointer is much less stable than the single keel boat If the hydroplane s angle of attack is upset at speed the craft can somersault into the air or nose dive into the water br Campbell s new boat was a success In on the eve of the Second World War he took it to Coniston Water and increased his record by km h mph to km h mph br br br s br The return of peace in brought a new form of power for the record breaker the jet engine Campbell immediately renovated Blue Bird K with a De Havilland Goblin jet engine The result was a curious looking craft whose shoe like profile led to it being nicknamed The Coniston Slipper The jet powered experiment was unsuccessful and Campbell retired from record attempts He died in br br br s br br On June Slo Mo Shun IV improved on Campbell s record by km h mph Powered by an Allison V aircraft engine the boat was built by Seattle Chrysler dealer Stanley Sayres and was able to run km h mph because her hull was designed to lift the top of the propeller out of water when running at high speed This phenomenon called prop riding further reduced drag br In Sayres drove Slo Mo Shun to km h mph a km h mph increase on his previous record br The renewed American success persuaded Malcolm Campbell s son Donald who had already driven Blue Bird K within sight of his father s record to further push for the record However Blue Bird K was then years old with a year old engine and Campbell struggled to reach the speeds of the Seattle built boat In late it was written off after suffering a structural failure at km h mph on Coniston Water br At this time yet another land speed driver entered the fray Englishman John Cobb was hoping to reach km h mph in his jet powered Crusader A radical design the Crusader reversed the three pointer design placing the sponsons at the rear of the hull On September Cobb tried to beat the world record on Loch Ness but while travelling at an estimated km h mph Crusader s front plane collapsed and the craft instantly disintegrated Cobb was retrieved from the water but had already died br Two years later on October another man would die trying for the record Italian textile magnates Mario Verga and Francesco Vitetta responding to a prize offer of million lire from the Italian Motorboat Federation to any Italian who broke the world record built a sleek piston engined hydroplane to claim the record Named Laura III after Verga s daughter the boat was fast but unstable Travelling across Lake Iseo in Northern Italy at close to km h mph Verga lost control of Laura III and was thrown out into the water when the boat somersaulted Like Cobb he died br Following Cobb s death Donald Campbell started working on a new Bluebird K a jet powered hydroplane Learning the many lessons from Cobb s ill starred Crusader K was designed as a classic pointer with sponsons forward alongside the cockpit She was designed by Ken and Lewis Norris in and was completed in early She was powered by a Metropolitan Vickers Beryl turbojet of kN lbf thrust K was of all metal construction and proved to have extremely high rigidity br Campbell and K set a new record of km h mph on Ullswater in July Campbell and K went on to break the record a further six times over the next nine years in the US and England Coniston Water finally increasing it to km h mph at Lake Dumbleyung in Western Australia in Campbell thus became the most prolific water speed record breaker of all time br At the time Campbell set the absolute record the piston powered propeller driven record was held by the George Simons Miss U S I at km h mph Roy Duby set this record at Guntersville Alabama in and stood for years br br br br br Donald Campbell s Bluebird K had been re engined with a Bristol Siddeley Orpheus jet rated at lbf kN of thrust On January he tried again His first run averaged km h mph and a new record seemed in sight Campbell applied K s water brake to slow the craft down from her peak speed of km h mph clear of the measured kilometre to a speed around km h mph Rather than waiting for the lake to settle again before starting the mandatory return leg Campbell immediately turned around at the end of the lake and began his return run At around km h mph just as she entered the measured kilometre Bluebird began to lose stability and m before the end of the kilometre Bluebird s nose lifted beyond its critical pitch angle and she started to rise out of the water at a degree angle The boat took off somersaulted and then plunged nose first into the lake breaking up as she cartwheeled across the surface Campbell was killed instantly Over the next two weeks prolonged searches discovered the wreck but it was not until May that Campbell s body was finally located and recovered Campbell was buried in the churchyard at Coniston on September The television drama Across the Lake recreates the attempt br Lee Taylor a Californian boat racer in Hustler during a test run on Lake Havasu on April was unable to shut down the jet and crashed into the lakeside at over km h mph Hustler was wrecked and Taylor was severely injured He spent the following years recuperating and rebuilding his boat On June on Lake Guntersville Taylor and Hustler tried for the record Still the wake of some spectators boats disturbed the water forcing Taylor to slow down his second run and he came up km h mph short He tried again the same day and set a new record of km h mph br br br and br Until November every official water speed record had been set by an American Canadian Irishman or Briton That day Ken Warby became the first Australian holder when he piloted his Spirit of Australia to km h mph kn to beat Lee Taylor s record Warby who had built the craft in his backyard used the publicity to find sponsorship to pay for improvements to the Spirit On October Warby travelled to Blowering Dam Australia and broke both the mph km h kn and km h mph kn barriers with an average speed of km h mph kn As he exited the course his peak speed as measured on a radar gun was approximately km h mph kn br Warby s record still stands There have only been two official attempts to break it resulting in the driver s death br br br s br Lee Taylor tried to get the record back in Inspired by the land speed record cars Blue Flame and Budweiser Rocket he built a rocket powered boat Discovery II The foot m long craft was a reverse three point design similar to John Cobb s Crusader but of much greater length br Originally Taylor tested the boat on Walker Lake in Nevada but his backers demanded a more accessible location so he switched to Lake Tahoe An attempt was set for November but when conditions on the lake proved unfavourable he decided against trying for the record Not wanting to disappoint the assembled spectators and media he did a test run instead At km h mph Discovery II started to become unstable It has been speculated that it may have hit a swell Its unstable lateral oscillations caused the left sponson to collapse sending the boat plunging into the water The cockpit section with Taylor s body was recovered three days later The cockpit had not floated as intended and Taylor drowned br br On July Craig Arfons son of Walt Arfons builder of the world s first jet car and nephew of record breaker Art Arfons tried for the record in his all composite fiberglass and Kevlar Rain X Challenger At am less than seconds into his run the hydroplane somersaulted at more than mph km h The cockpit remained intact underwater with Arfons remaining inside upside down Two divers from a rescue team reached the wreckage and extracted him within three minutes of the initial incident While he still had a pulse after cardiopulmonary resuscitation was administered he did not respond to the medical personnel He was taken to the Highlands Regional Medical Center but was pronounced dead at am hour and minutes after the initial incident br br br Current projects br Despite the high fatality rate the record is still coveted by boat enthusiasts and racers Ongoing projects aimed at breaking the record include the following br br br Quicksilver br The British Quicksilver project is managed by Nigel Macknight br The design was initially based on concepts for a rear sponsoned configuration by Ken Norris who had worked with the Campbells on their Bluebird designs The design is of modular construction with the main body consisting of a front section with a steel spaceframe incorporating the engine a Rolls Royce Spey Mk and the rear section a monocoque extending to the tail The front sponsons are also modules one of which contains the driver br br br Spirit of Australia II br Ken Warby was working with his son David on a new boat powered by a jet engine from a Fiat G to break the record The team conducting a series of trials had as of August increased the speed to km h Earlier in Ken Warby had built another boat Aussie Spirit for a record attempt After Ken Warby s death in February the project continued under David s leadership with test runs made in May and September at Blowering Dam with further runs planned in November that year br br br K Team for Great Britain br The K Team combines engineers boat racers boat builders gas turbine specialists and Windermere Boat Racing Club members They built a controversial visual copy of Donald Campbell s Bluebird K However during its sole public appearance on Coniston Water in it failed to plane partially sank and ultimately collapsed its air intake trunking A test on Loch Ken in southwest Scotland in October was also unsuccessful although the boat did not sink it was again unable to plane br br br Dartagnan SP br Daniel Dehaemers was the Belgian challenger for the absolute water speed record The SP is of full carbon composite construction It is powered by a Rolls Royce Adour turbojet engine The boat was planned to be tested in However after
