title: Hydrofoil
id: 13761
A hydrofoil is a lifting surface or foil that operates in water They are similar in appearance and purpose to aerofoils used by aeroplanes Boats that use hydrofoil technology are also simply termed hydrofoils As a hydrofoil craft gains speed the hydrofoils lift the boat s hull out of the water decreasing drag and allowing greater speeds br br br Description br The hydrofoil usually consists of a winglike structure mounted on struts below the hull or across the keels of a catamaran in a variety of boats see illustration As a hydrofoil equipped watercraft increases in speed the hydrofoil elements below the hull s develop enough lift to raise the hull out of the water which greatly reduces hull drag This provides a corresponding increase in speed and fuel efficiency br Wider adoption of hydrofoils is prevented by the increased complexity of building and maintaining them Hydrofoils are generally prohibitively more expensive than conventional watercraft above a certain displacement so most hydrofoil craft are relatively small and are mainly used as high speed passenger ferries where the relatively high passenger fees can offset the high cost of the craft itself However the design is simple enough that there are many human powered hydrofoil designs Amateur experimentation and development of the concept is popular br br br Hydrodynamic mechanics br br Since air and water are governed by similar fluid equations albeit with different levels of viscosity density and compressibility the hydrofoil and airfoil both types of foil create lift in identical ways The foil shape moves smoothly through the water deflecting the flow downward which following the Euler equations exerts an upward force on the foil This turning of the water creates higher pressure on the bottom of the foil and reduced pressure on the top This pressure difference is accompanied by a velocity difference via Bernoulli s principle so the resulting flow field about the foil has a higher average velocity on one side than the other br When used as a lifting element on a hydrofoil boat this upward force lifts the body of the vessel decreasing drag and increasing speed The lifting force eventually balances with the weight of the craft reaching a point where the hydrofoil no longer lifts out of the water but remains in equilibrium Since wave resistance and other impeding forces such as various types of drag physics on the hull are eliminated as the hull lifts clear turbulence and drag act increasingly on the much smaller surface area of the hydrofoil and decreasingly on the hull creating a marked increase in speed br br br Foil configurations br Early hydrofoils used V shaped foils Hydrofoils of this type are known as surface piercing since portions of the V shape hydrofoils rise above the water surface when foilborne Some modern hydrofoils use fully submerged inverted T shape foils Fully submerged hydrofoils are less subject to the effects of wave action and therefore more stable at sea and more comfortable for crew and passengers This type of configuration however is not self stabilizing The angle of attack on the hydrofoils must be adjusted continuously to changing conditions a control process performed by sensors a computer and active surfaces br br br History br br br Prototypes br The first evidence of a hydrofoil on a vessel appears on a British patent granted in to Emmanuel Denis Farcot a Parisian He claimed that adapting to the sides and bottom of the vessel a series or inclined planes or wedge formed pieces which as the vessel is driven forward will have the effect of lifting it in the water and reducing the draught Italian inventor Enrico Forlanini began work on hydrofoils in and used a ladder foil system Forlanini obtained patents in Britain and the United States for his ideas and designs br Between and British boat designer John Thornycroft worked on a series of models with a stepped hull and single bow foil In his company built the full scale foot m long boat Miranda III Driven by a hp kW engine it rode on a bowfoil and flat stern The subsequent Miranda IV was credited with a speed of kn km h mph br br In May a hydrofoil boat was described being tested on the River Seine in the neighbourhood of Paris This boat was designed by Comte de Lambert This had variable pitch fins on the hull beneath the water so inclined that when the boat begins to move the boat rises and the planes come to the surface with the result that it skims over the surface with little but the propellers beneath the surface The boat had twin hulls foot long connected by a single deck foot wide and was fitted with a HP De Dion Bouton motor the boat was reported to have reached mph It was stated that The boat running practically on its fins resembles an aeroplane br A March Scientific American article by American hydrofoil pioneer William E Meacham explained the basic principle of hydrofoils Alexander Graham Bell considered the invention of the hydroplane now regarded as a distinct type but also employing lift a very significant achievement and after reading the article began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydrofoil boat With his chief engineer Casey Baldwin Bell began hydrofoil experiments in the summer of Baldwin studied the work of the Italian inventor Enrico Forlanini and began testing models based on those designs which led to the development of hydrofoil watercraft During Bell s world tour of Bell and Baldwin met with Forlanini in Italy where they rode in his hydrofoil boat over Lake Maggiore Baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying br On returning to Bell s large laboratory at his Beinn Bhreagh estate near Baddeck Nova Scotia they experimented with a number of designs culminating in Bell s HD Using Renault engines a top speed of km h kn mph was achieved accelerating rapidly taking waves without difficulty steering well and showing good stability Bell s report to the United States Navy permitted him to obtain two kW hp engines On September the HD set a world marine speed record of km h kn mph which stood for two decades A full scale replica of the HD is viewable at the Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site museum in Baddeck Nova Scotia br In the early s an English couple built the White Hawk a jet powered hydrofoil water craft in an attempt to beat the absolute water speed record However in tests White Hawk could barely top the record breaking speed of the HD The designers had faced an engineering phenomenon that limits the top speed of even modern hydrofoils cavitation disturbs the lift created by the foils as they move through the water at speed above kn km h mph bending the lifting foil br br br First passenger boats br German engineer Hanns von Schertel worked on hydrofoils prior to and during World War II in Germany After the war the Russians captured Schertel s team As Germany was not authorized to build fast boats Schertel went to Switzerland where he established the Supramar company In Supramar launched the first commercial hydrofoil PT Freccia d Oro Golden Arrow in Lake Maggiore between Switzerland and Italy The PT is of surface piercing type it can carry passengers and travel at knots km h mph In the Bahraini born banker Hussain Najadi acquired the Supramar AG and expanded its operations into Japan Hong Kong Singapore the UK Norway and the US General Dynamics of the United States became its licensee and the Pentagon awarded its first R D naval research project in the field of supercavitation Hitachi Shipbuilding of Osaka Japan was another licensee of Supramar as well as many leading ship owners and shipyards in the OECD countries br From to Supramar designed many models of hydrofoils PT PT PT PT and PT All are of surface piercing type except the PT combining a surface piercing foil forward with a fully submerged foil in the aft location Over of Supramar s design were built most of them by Rodriquez headed at the time by Engineer Carlo Rodriquez in Sicily Italy br During the same period the Soviet Union experimented extensively with hydrofoils constructing hydrofoil river boats and ferries with streamlined designs during the cold war period and into the s Such vessels include the Raketa type followed by the larger Meteor type and the smaller Voskhod type One of the most successful Soviet designer inventor in this area was Rostislav Alexeyev who some consider the father of the modern hydrofoil due to his s era high speed hydrofoil designs Later circa s Alexeyev combined his hydrofoil experience with the surface effect principle to create the Ekranoplan Extensive investment in this type of technology in the USSR resulted in the largest civil hydrofoil fleet

minefields but was prone to damage and noisier br br br Canada br br In Canada during World War II Baldwin worked on an experimental smoke laying hydrofoil later called the Comox Torpedo that was later superseded by other smoke laying technology and an experimental target towing hydrofoil The forward two foil assemblies of what is believed to be the latter hydrofoil were salvaged in the mid s from a derelict hulk in Baddeck Nova Scotia by Colin MacGregor Stevens These were donated to the Maritime Museum in Halifax Nova Scotia br The Canadian Armed Forces built and tested a number of hydrofoils e g Baddeck and two vessels named Bras d Or which culminated in the high speed anti submarine hydrofoil HMCS Bras d Or in the late s However the program was cancelled in the early s due to
