A hull is the watertight body of a ship boat submarine or flying boat The hull may open at the top such as a dinghy or it may be fully or partially covered with a deck Atop the deck may be a deckhouse and other superstructures such as a funnel derrick or mast The line where the hull meets the water surface is called the waterline br br br General features br br There is a wide variety of hull types that are chosen for suitability for different usages the hull shape being dependent upon the needs of the design Shapes range from a nearly perfect box in the case of scow barges to a needle sharp surface of revolution in the case of a racing multihull sailboat The shape is chosen to strike a balance between cost hydrostatic considerations accommodation load carrying and stability hydrodynamics speed power requirements and motion and behavior in a seaway and special considerations for the ship s role such as the rounded bow of an icebreaker or the flat bottom of a landing craft br In a typical modern steel ship the hull will have watertight decks and major transverse members called bulkheads There may also be intermediate members such as girders stringers and webs and minor members called ordinary transverse frames frames or longitudinals depending on the structural arrangement The uppermost continuous deck may be called the upper deck weather deck spar deck main deck or simply deck The particular name given depends on the context the type of ship or boat the arrangement or even where it sails br In a typical wooden sailboat the hull is constructed of wooden planking supported by transverse frames often referred to as ribs and bulkheads which are further tied together by longitudinal stringers or ceiling Often but not always there is a centerline longitudinal member called a keel In fiberglass or composite hulls the structure may resemble wooden or steel vessels to some extent or be of a monocoque arrangement In many cases composite hulls are built by sandwiching thin fiber reinforced skins over a lightweight but reasonably rigid core of foam balsa wood impregnated paper honeycomb or other material br Perhaps the earliest proper hulls were built by the Ancient Egyptians who by BC knew how to assemble wooden planks into a hull br br br Hull shapes br Hulls come in many varieties and can have composite shape e g a fine entry forward and inverted bell shape aft but are grouped primarily as follows br br Chined and hard chined Examples are the flat bottom chined v bottom and multi chine hull several gentler hard chines still not smooth These types have at least one pronounced knuckle throughout all or most of their length br Moulded round bilged or soft chined These hull shapes all have smooth curves Examples are the round bilge semi round bilge and s bottom hull br br br Planing and displacement hulls br br Displacement hull here the hull is supported exclusively or predominantly by buoyancy Vessels that have this type of hull travel through the water at a limited rate that is defined by the waterline length except for especially narrow hulls such as sailing multihulls that are less limited this way br Planing hull here the planing hull form is configured to develop positive dynamic pressure so that its draft decreases with increasing speed The dynamic lift reduces the wetted surface and therefore also the drag They are sometimes flat bottomed sometimes V bottomed and more rarely round bilged The most common form is to have at least one chine which makes for more efficient planing and can throw spray down Planing hulls are more efficient at higher speeds although they still require more energy to achieve these speeds An effective planing hull must be as light as possible with flat surfaces that are consistent with good sea keeping Sailboats that plane must also sail efficiently in displacement mode in light winds br Semi displacement or semi planing here the hull form is capable of developing a moderate amount of dynamic lift however most of the vessel s weight is still supported through buoyancy br br br Hull forms br At present the most widely used form is the round bilge hull br With a small payload such a craft has less of its hull below the waterline giving less resistance and more speed With a greater payload resistance is greater and speed lower but the hull s outward bend provides smoother performance in waves As such the inverted bell shape is a popular form used with planing hulls br br br Chined and hard chined hulls br br A chined hull does not have a smooth rounded transition between bottom and sides Instead its contours are interrupted by sharp angles where predominantly longitudinal panels of the hull meet The sharper the intersection the more acute the angle the harder the chine More than one chine per side is possible br The Cajun pirogue is an example of a craft with hard chines br Benefits of this type of hull include potentially lower production cost and a usually fairly flat bottom making the boat faster at planing A hard chined hull resists rolling in smooth water more than does a hull with rounded bilges the chine creates turbulence and drag resisting the rolling motion as it moves through the water the rounded bilge provides less flow resistance around the turn In rough seas this can make the boat roll more as the motion drags first down then up on a chine round bilge boats are more seakindly in waves as a result br Chined hulls may have one of three shapes br br Flat bottom chined hulls br Multi chined hulls br V bottom chined hulls Sometimes called hard chine br Each of these chine hulls has its own unique characteristics and use The flat bottom hull has high initial stability but high drag To counter the high drag hull forms are narrow and sometimes severely tapered at bow and stern This leads to poor stability when heeled in a sailboat This is often countered by using heavy interior ballast on sailing versions They are best suited to sheltered inshore waters Early racing power boats were fine forward and flat aft This produced maximum lift and a smooth fast ride in flat water but this hull form is easily unsettled in waves The multi chine hull approximates a curved hull form It has less drag than a flat bottom boat Multi chines are more complex to build but produce a more seaworthy hull form They are usually displacement hulls V or arc bottom chine boats have a V shape between and This is called the deadrise angle The flatter shape of a degree hull will plane with less wind or a lower horsepower engine but will pound more in waves The deep V form between and degrees is only suited to high powered planing boats They require more powerful engines to lift the boat onto the plane but give a faster smoother ride in waves Displacement chined hulls have more wetted surface area hence more drag than an equivalent round hull form for any given displacement br br br Smooth curve hulls br br Smooth curve hulls are hulls that use just like the curved hulls a centreboard or an attached keel br Semi round bilge hulls are somewhat less round The advantage of the semi round is that it is a nice middle between the S bottom and chined hull Typical examples of a semi round bilge hull can be found in the Centaur and Laser sailing dinghies br br S bottom hulls are sailing boat hulls with a midships transverse half section shaped like an s In the s bottom the hull has round bilges and merges smoothly with the keel and there are no sharp corners on the hull sides between the keel centreline and the sheer line Boats with this hull form may have a long fixed deep keel or a long shallow fixed keel with a centreboard swing keel inside Ballast may be internal external or a combination This hull form was most popular in the late th and early to mid th centuries Examples of small sailboats that use this s shape are the Yngling and Randmeer br br br Appendages br br Control devices such as a rudder trim tabs or stabilizing fins may be fitted br A keel may be fitted on a hull to increase the transverse stability directional stability or to create lift br Retractable appendages include centreboards and daggerboards br A forward protrusion below the waterline is called a bulbous bow These are fitted on some hulls to reduce the wave making resistance drag and thereby increase fuel efficiency br br br Terms br br Baseline is a level reference line from which vertical distances are measured br Bow is the front part of the hull br Amidships is the middle portion of the vessel in the fore and aft direction br Port is the left side of the vessel when facing the bow from on board br Starboard is the right side of the vessel when facing the bow from on board br Stern is the rear part of the hull br Waterline is an imaginary line circumscribing the hull that matches the surface of the water when the hull is not moving br br br Metrics br br Hull forms are defined as follows br Block measures that define the principal dimensions They are br br Beam or breadth B is the width of the hull ex BWL is the maximum beam at the waterline br Draft d or T is the vertical distance from the bottom of the keel to the waterline br Freeboard FB is depth plus the height of the keel structure minus draft br Length at the waterline LWL is the length from the forwardmost point of the waterline measured in profile to the stern most point of the waterline br Length between perpendiculars LBP or LPP is the length of the summer load waterline from the stern post to the point where it crosses the stem see also p p br Length overall LOA is the extreme length from one end to the other br Moulded depth D is the vertical distance measured from the top of the keel to the underside of the upper deck at side br Form derivatives that are calculated from the shape and the block measures They are br br Displacement is the weight of water equivalent to the immersed volume of the hull br Longitudinal centre of buoyancy LCB is the longitudinal position of the centroid of the displaced volume often given as the distance from a point of reference often midships to the centroid of the static displaced volume Note that the longitudinal centre of gravity or centre of the weight of the vessel must align with the LCB when the hull is in equilibrium br Longitudinal centre of flotation LCF is the longitudinal position of the centroid of the waterplane area usually expressed as longitudinal distance from a point of reference often midships to the centre of the area of the static waterplane This can be visualized as being the area defined by the water s surface and the hull br Vertical centre of buoyancy VCB is the vertical position of the centroid of displaced volume generally given as a distance from a point of reference such as the baseline to the centre of the static displaced volume br Volume V or is the volume of water displaced by the hull br br Coefficients help compare hull forms as well br br Block coefficient Cb is the volume V divided by the LWL BWL TWL If you draw a box around the submerged part of the ship it is the ratio of the box volume occupied by the ship It gives a sense of how much of the block defined by the LWL beam B draft T is filled by the hull Full forms such as oil tankers will have a high Cb where fine shapes such as sailboats will have a low Cb br br br br br C br br b br br br br br br V br br br L br br W br L br br br br br B br br W br L br br br br br T br br W br L br br br br br br br
