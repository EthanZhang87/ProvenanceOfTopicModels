The Westinghouse J company designation Westinghouse C was a turbojet engine developed by Westinghouse Aviation Gas Turbine Division in the late s Essentially an enlarged version of the earlier Westinghouse J the J produced pounds of thrust twice as much as the J Later models produced as much as lb with the addition of an afterburner It first flew in The J engine was developed as a larger more powerful version of Westinghouse s J engine about larger br br br Development br Built in an era of rapidly advancing gas turbine engine technology the J was largely obsolete before it saw service and often served as an interim engine For instance the Douglas X Stiletto was equipped with two J engines when the intended Westinghouse J engine proved to be unsuitable The Stiletto was developed to investigate the design of an aircraft at sustained supersonic speeds However equipped with the J instead of its intended engines it was seriously underpowered and could not exceed Mach in level flight br Developed during the transition from piston engined aircraft to jets the J was sometimes fitted to aircraft as a supplement to other powerplants as with the Lockheed P Neptune and Douglas D Skyrocket fitted with radial piston engines and a rocket engine respectively br The afterburner was developed by Solar Aircraft the first U S company to produce a practical afterburner br br br Variants br J WE br lbf kN thrust br XJ WE br lbf kN thrust originally designated J br XJ WE br lbf kN thrust br J WE br Similar to with short afterburner br J WE br lbf kN thrust br J WE br Similar to lbf kN thrust with short afterburner br J WE br lbf kN thrust br J WE br Similar to lbf kN thrust lbf kN thrust with long afterburner br J WE br lbf kN thrust br J WE br C B lbf kN thrust br J WE br C C lbf kN thrust lbf kN thrust with afterburner br J WE A br lbf kN thrust lbf kN thrust with afterburner br J WE br Similar to lbf kN thrust lbf kN thrust with long afterburner br J WE br C D lbf kN thrust br J WE A br lbf kN thrust br J WE br C E lbf kN thrust br J WE A br lbf kN thrust br J WE br lbf kN thrust br J WE br lbf kN thrust br J WE br lbf kN thrust lbf kN thrust with afterburner br J WE br lbf kN thrust br J WE br Single stage turbine Contract awarded br W br Commercial version of the WE br C B br company designation for WE br C C br company designation for WE br C D br company designation for WE br C br company designation for WE br br br Applications br br br Aircraft br Convair F Y Sea Dart br Curtiss Wright XF Blackhawk br Douglas D Skyrocket br Douglas F D Skyknight br Douglas X Stiletto br Fairchild C Flying Boxcar civilian variant modification br Grumman OV A Pittsburgh Institute of Aeronautics br Lockheed P E G H Neptune br Lockheed XF br McDonnell prototype only br McDonnell F H Banshee br McDonnell XF Goblin br McDonnell XF Voodoo br North American T A Buckeye br Ryan XFR Fireball br Vought F U Pirate br Vought F U Cutlass br br br Others br Shockwave jet truck br Snowzilla snow remover br Spirit of Australia jet boat br br br Engines on display br A Westinghouse J is on public display at the Aerospace Museum of California br br br Specifications J WE br Data from br br br General characteristics br Type Turbojet br Length in m br Diameter in m br Dry weight lb kg br br br Components br Compressor Single Spool stage Axial br Combustors Annular br Turbine stage turbine br br br Performance br Maximum thrust lbf kN br Overall pressure ratio br Air mass flow lb s br Specific fuel consumption lb lbf h g kN s br Thrust to weight ratio br br br See also br br Related development br br Westinghouse J br br Comparable engines br br Heinkel HeS br Related lists br br List of aircraft engines br br br br br br Notes br br br Bibliography br br br External links br br http www arkairmuseum org engines engine westinghouse php br http www globalsecurity org military systems aircraft systems j htm
