Lake Washington Lushootseed x a u is a large freshwater lake adjacent to the city of Seattle Washington United States It is the largest lake in King County and the second largest natural lake in the state of Washington after Lake Chelan It borders the cities of Seattle on the west Bellevue and Kirkland on the east Renton on the south and Kenmore on the north and encloses Mercer Island The lake is fed by the Sammamish River at its north end and the Cedar River at its south br Lake Washington has been known to the Duwamish and other Indigenous peoples living on the lake for millennia as x a u lit lake in Lushootseed At the time of European settlement it was recorded as At sar kal in a map sketched by engineer Abiel W Tinkham and the Chinook Jargon name Hyas Chuck great large water was also used Other English names historically used for the lake include Lake Geneva by Isaac N Ebey and Lake Duwamish in railroad surveys under Governor Isaac Stevens Lake Washington received its present name in after Thomas Mercer suggested it be named after George Washington as the new Washington Territory had been named the year before br The lake provides boating and sport fishing opportunities Some fish species found in its waters include sockeye salmon coho salmon Chinook salmon rainbow trout largemouth bass smallmouth bass yellow perch and black crappie br Lake Washington has two passenger seaplane bases Kenmore Air Harbor on its north end and Will Rogers Wiley Post Memorial Seaplane Base on its south end adjacent to Renton Municipal Airport br br br Geography br A ribbon lake Lake Washington is long narrow and finger like Ribbon lakes are excavated by glaciers As the Puget lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet flowed south near the end of the Late Pleistocene it met bands of harder and softer rock Erosion of the softer rock was faster and a linear depression was created in the flow direction When the glacier melted the lake filled with the meltwater which was retained by moraine deposits A dam can also be created by the bands of harder rock either side of the softer rock There is usually a river at both ends of a ribbon lake one being the inlet and the other the outlet but in the case of present day Lake Washington inlet rivers are at both ends and a man made outlet is in the middle The lake was previously drained by the Black river to the south br br br Creeks and rivers br br The main inflowing rivers are the Sammamish and Cedar Rivers with the Cedar supplying most of the water Seasonal changes in the flow of the Sammamish are moderated by a weir at the Lake Sammamish inlet br The lake is drained by the Lake Washington Ship Canal br In addition there are numerous small creeks and rivers which feed the lake including br br Historically construction of the Lake Washington Ship Canal drastically changed the inflow and outflow of the lake Before construction of the canal in Lake Washington s outlet was the Black River which joined the Duwamish River and emptied into Elliott Bay When the canal was opened the level of the lake dropped nearly nine feet m The canal became the lake s sole outlet causing the Black River to dry up and disappear Before construction the Sammamish River was the primary source of water for Lake Washington and the lowering of the lake slightly increased its flow As part of the ship canal project the Cedar River was diverted into Lake Washington to become the lake s primary source br br br Canals and bridges br br The Montlake Cut part of the Lake Washington Ship Canal connects the lake to Lake Union and ultimately Puget Sound br Concrete floating bridges are employed to span the lake because Lake Washington s depth and muddy bottom prevented the emplacement of the pilings or towers necessary for the construction of a causeway or suspension bridge The bridges consist of hollow concrete pontoons that float atop the lake anchored with cables to each other and to weights on the lake bottom The roadway is constructed atop these concrete pontoons Three floating bridges cross Lake Washington the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge officially the SR Albert D Rosellini Evergreen Point Floating Bridge carries State Route from Seattle s Montlake neighborhood to Medina while the Lacey V Murrow Memorial Bridge and the Third Lake Washington Bridge officially the Homer M Hadley Memorial Bridge carry Interstate from Seattle s Mount Baker neighborhood to Mercer Island The East Channel Bridge carries Interstate from Mercer Island to Bellevue The Evergreen Point Lacey V Murrow and Third Lake Washington bridges are the longest second longest and fifth longest floating bridges in the world respectively br Many questioned the wisdom of concrete floating bridge technology after the sinking of a portion of the Lacey V Murrow bridge on November However a Washington State Department of Transportation WSDOT investigation revealed that the incident resulted from the improper handling of hydrodemolition water being used during bridge renovations rather than in any basic flaw in the bridge s concept or design Concrete floating bridges continue to remain a viable means for the conveyance of vehicle traffic over Lake Washington br In approximately one year after the tolls were removed from the Murrow bridge the inland ferry system on the lake came to an end having operated since the s br br br Shoreline cities and towns br br The cities and towns bordering the lake going clockwise from the west are Seattle Lake Forest Park Kenmore Kirkland Yarrow Point Hunts Point Medina Bellevue Beaux Arts Village and Renton The city of Mercer Island occupies the island of the same name in the southern half of the lake br br br Water purity br Around Seattle began discharging sewage into Lake Washington During the s and s eleven sewage treatment plants were sending state of the art treated water into the lake at a rate of million gallons per day At the same time phosphate based detergents came into wide use The lake responded to the massive input of nutrients by developing unpleasant blooms of noxious blue green algae cyanobacteria The water lost its clarity the desirable fish populations declined and masses of dead algae accumulated on the shores of the lake After significant pollution the October issue of the Post Intelligencer referred to the lake as Lake Stinko Citizen concern led to the creation of a system that diverted the treatment plant effluents into nearby Puget Sound where tidal flushing would mix them with open ocean water br The diversion was completed in and the lake responded quickly The algal blooms diminished the water regained its clarity and by recovery was complete Careful studies by a group of limnologists from the University of Washington showed that phosphate was the culprit Since then Lake Washington has undergone major improvements drastically improving the ecology and water quality making the water twice as clear as it was in br br br See also br Mount Baker Crew rowing club br Seafair Cup hydroplane races br Lake Sammamish br br br Notes br br br
