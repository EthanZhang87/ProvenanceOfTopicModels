A V engine is a twelve cylinder piston engine where two banks of six cylinders are arranged in a V configuration around a common crankshaft V engines are more common than V engines However they are less common than V engines br The first V engine was built in for use in racing boats Due to the balanced nature of the engine and the smooth delivery of power V engines were found in early luxury automobiles boats aircraft and tanks Aircraft V engines reached their apogee during World War II following which they were mostly replaced by jet engines In Formula One racing V engines were common during the late s and early s br Applications of V engines in the st century have been as marine engines in railway locomotives as large stationary power as well as in some European sports and luxury cars br br br Design br br br Balance and smoothness br Each bank of a V engine essentially functions as a straight six engine which by itself has perfect primary and secondary engine balance A four stroke V engine has even firing order at V angles of or degrees Many V engines use a V angle of degrees between the two banks of cylinders V engines with other V angles have been produced sometimes using split crankpins to reduce the unbalanced vibrations The drawbacks of V engines include extra cost complexity friction losses and external size and weight compared with engines containing fewer cylinders br At any given time three of the cylinders in a V engine are in their power stroke which increases the smoothness of the power delivery by eliminating gaps between power pulses br A V engine with a degree V angle is often called a flat twelve engine These are also sometimes called boxer twelve engines however this terminology is incorrect for the majority of degree V engines since they use shared crankpins and are therefore not configured as boxer engines br Theoretically the rotating parts of a V racing engine could be lighter than a crossplane V engine of similar displacement due to the V engine not requiring counterweights on the crankshaft or as much inertial mass for the flywheel In addition the exhaust system of a V engine is much simpler than would be required for a crossplane V engine to achieve pulsed exhaust gas tuning However the use of V engines in motor racing is uncommon in the st century br br br Size and displacement br A degree V engine is typically narrower than a degree V or V engine of similar displacement However the V engine is usually longer than V and V engines The added length often makes it difficult to fit a V engine into a passenger car but the length is not typically a problem for trucks and stationary applications Due to its narrower width the V is common as locomotive armoured tank and marine engines In these applications the width of the engine is constrained by tight railway clearances or street widths while the length of the vehicle is more flexible br In twin propeller boats two V engines can be narrow enough to sit side by side while three V engines are sometimes used in high speed three propeller configurations Large fast cruise ships can have six or more V engines In historic piston engine fighter and bomber aircraft the long narrow V configuration used in high performance aircraft made them more streamlined than other engines particularly the short wide radial engine br br br Usage in marine vessels br br The first V engine a V twin design was built by Daimler in then the first V engine was built by Antoinette in These were followed by the first V engine in which was built by Putney Motor Works in London for use in racing boats Known as the Craig D rwald engine after Putney s founding partners the V engine was based on Putney s existing two cylinder engine with a flathead design a V angle of degrees and an aluminium crankcase As in many marine engines the camshaft could be slid longitudinally to engage a second set of cams giving valve timing that reversed the engine s rotation to achieve astern propulsion The engine had a displacement of L cu in a weight of kg lb and developed m ft racing boats but little is known of its racing achievements br Two more V s appeared in the motor boat racing season The Lamb Boat Engine Company in the United States built a L cu in engine for the company s m ft Lamb IV boat The Orleans Motor Company built a massive L cu in flathead V engine with a power output quoted as nearly kW bhp In Panhard built two L cu in V engines with four valves per cylinder which were designed for use in racing boats br Large V diesel engines are common in modern cruise ships which may have up to six such engines An example of a currently produced V marine engine is the W rtsil F engine where the V version has a displacement of L cu in and a power output of kW hp br br br Usage in airplanes br br br s to s br br Renault introduced the first V engine for aircraft with their hp model of This engine had a V angle of degrees air cooling and an intake over exhaust F head valve arrangement The propeller was driven from the front end of the camshaft thus spinning the propeller speed at half the speed of a typical crankshaft driven propeller in order to improve the propeller efficiency The Renault engine was closely mimicked by the RAF and its derivatives which was used by various British military aircraft during World War I The RAF engine had a displacement of L cu in weighed kg lb and produced kW hp at rpm br In March a prototype version of the Sunbeam Mohawk V engine was unveiled in the United Kingdom based on the Toodles V motor racing engine The production version was rated at kW hp at rpm making it the most powerful airplane engine in Great Britain at the outbreak of World War I During and after World War I various companies in the United States produced the Liberty L engine In Austria the Austro Daimler V engines were used by the large flying boats of the Naval Air Force and produced up to kW hp By the end of World War I V s were well established in aviation powering some of the newest and largest fighter and bomber airplanes br After World War I many Zeppelins used V engines built by Maybach and Daimler V engines powered the first transatlantic crossings by the Curtiss NC flying boats using four Liberty L engines the first non stop transatlantic crossing in a Vickers Vimy using two Rolls Royce Eagle engines and the first transatlantic crossing by an airship in the R class airship using five Sunbeam Maori engines br br br s to present br br V engines reached their apogee during World War II with engines such as the British Rolls Royce Merlin and Rolls Royce Griffon the Soviet Klimov VK and Mikulin AM the American Allison V and the German Daimler Benz DB and Junkers Jumo These engines generated about kW hp at the beginning of the war and over kW hp at their ultimate evolution stage This rapid increase in power outputs was due to technology such as multi speed superchargers and high octane fuels and the V layout was commonly adopted due to its low vibrations so that the powerful engines did not tear apart the light airframes of fighters br The Allied forces used V engines with an upright design while many German engines aside from the BMW VI which was designed prior to World War II used an inverted engine design which had a lower centre of gravity and improved pilot visibility for single engined designs The only American design inverted V engine of any type to see even limited service in World War II was the air cooled Ranger V which was used in aircraft that were only used for training purposes within the United States such as the Fairchild AT Gunner br The Rolls Royce Merlin V engine was used in several British aircraft including the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire fighters and the Avro Lancaster and de Havilland Mosquito bombers The Hurricane and Spitfire played vital roles in the Battle of Britain The long narrow configuration of the V contributed to good aerodynamics while its smoothness allowed its use with relatively light and fragile airframes br In the United States the Rolls Royce Merlin engine was produced under license by Packard Motor Car Company which was used in the P Mustang fighter This engine was also incorporated into some models of the Curtiss P specifically the P F and P L Packard Merlins powered Canadian built Hurricane Lancaster and Mosquito aircraft as well as the UK built Spitfire Mark XVI which was otherwise the same as the Mark IX with its British built Merlin The Allison V was the only liquid cooled V engine designed in the United States that was used on active service during World War II It was initially used in the P Lightning but the turbosupercharger system required bulky ductwork and had poor high altitude performance In a version using a more conventional mechanical supercharger began production br After World War II V engines became generally obsolete in aircraft due to the introduction of turbojet and turboprop engines that had more power for their weight and fewer complications br br br Usage in automobiles br br In automobiles V engines are less common than engines with fewer cylinders due to their size complexity and cost They have been mostly used for expensive sports and luxury cars thanks to their power smooth operation and distinctive sound br br br s br br One of the earliest recorded uses of V engines in automobiles was in October when a custom built racing car competed at the Brooklands circuit in the United Kingdom The car was entered by Louis Coatalen who was chief engineer of the Sunbeam Motor Car Company It was named Toodles V after Coatalen s pet name for his wife and achieved several speed records in and The V engine had a displacement of L cu in an aluminum crankcase iron cylinders with L shaped combustion chambers a cam in block valvetrain and a V angle of degrees Each bank of the engine consisted of two cylinder blocks with three cylinders each Valve clearance was set by grinding the relevant parts the engine lacking any easy means of adjustment This reflected the intention for the engine to be later used in aircraft since any adjustment method that could go wrong in flight was to be avoided As initially built the V was rated at kW bhp at rpm and weighed approximately kg lb br Amongst the first production cars to use a V engine were the Packard Twin Six the National V engine and the Weidely Pathfinder all of which were built in the United States br br br s to s br br During the late s the number of marques offering V engines for their passenger cars increased and peaked in the s The lack of vibration and sound inherent smoothness and increased power were cited as key benefits for V engines Automobile petrol produced in the s and s had lower octane rating leading to lower engine performance ratings and vibration isolating engine mounts were rarely fitted to the passenger cars in the s and the early s Adding more cylinders to the engine was one of several techniques for performance increase br European passenger cars with V engines were br br Fiat Superfiat br Daimler Double Six several models

Silver Arrow br The economic hardships caused the Great Depression meant that all American automakers except for Lincoln had discontinued production of V engines by the end of the s Lincoln themselves would cease V production in and no American automaker has built V engines since Improvements in engine design namely combustion chamber piston form fuel delivery system and such enabled the lighter and cheaper V engines to surpass V engines in performance br br br to s br br Following the end of the Second World War the economic austerity and changes in taste in many European countries led to the demise of luxury automobiles with V engines in the s and s Lincoln continued the limited production of luxury cars with V engines from to The American manufacturers focused on continuously improving V engines and their performances through the s leading to the first horsepower war in the s br In Italy Enzo Ferrari who had long admired the V engines of Packard Auto Union and Alfa Romeo His former employer introduced his first passenger car Ferrari Inter in and fitted it with L cu in Colombo V engine Dissatisfied with the reliability and crudeness of his Ferrari GT Ferruccio Lamborghini wanted to develop his own passenger cars that were more cultured and more reliable than the cars produced by Ferrari His first passenger car a grand tourer was GT with L cu in DOHC engine Both manufacturers have a long history of producing vehicles with V engines which continues uninterrupted to this day br Cadillac experimented with V engines in and as a potential engine option for its first ever front wheel drive car Cadillac Eldorado However Cadillac was unsatisfied with the performance of its V engine having little advantage over the large displacement V that was cheaper to enlarge for more power br br br s to present br br In Europe several manufacturers added V engines to their line up as listed below br br Jaguar The Jaguar V engine was an all aluminium SOHC design with displacements of L cu in that was produced from to in the E Type XJS and XJ The first application for the engine was a litre version used in the Jaguar E Type sports car br BMW Production of V

In the United States no mass produced V engines have been built since the s with U S manufacturers preferring to use large displacement V engines instead br Japanese manufacturers rarely produce engines with large displacements therefore V engines are very rare The sole Japanese V engine is the Toyota GZ engine a L cu in DOHC design which was used in the Toyota Century limousine br In China the Hongqi HQE limousine powered by a L cu in DOHC V engine is the sole Chinese car to be produced with a V engine br br br List of V production engines br br br Motor racing br br V engines have often been used in Formula One particularly from the season to the season The first V engine used in Formula One was in the Honda RA racing car and continued through to the Honda RA racing car The
