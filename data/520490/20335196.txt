The Honeywell T formerly Lycoming company designation LTC is a turboshaft engine used on American helicopters and fixed wing aircraft in turboprop form since the s and in unlimited hydroplanes since the s As of more than of these engines have been built It is produced by Honeywell Aerospace a division of Honeywell based in Scottsdale Arizona and was originally designed by the Turbine Engine Division of Lycoming Engines in Stratford Connecticut as a scaled up version of the smaller Lycoming T The T serves as the engine on several major applications including the CH Chinook the Bell and the Piper PA Enforcer The T also serves as the core of the Lycoming ALF turbofan Since the T was first developed progressive increases in airflow overall pressure ratio and turbine inlet temperature have more than tripled the power output of the engine br br br Variants br br br Civil and experimental variants br LTC A br Turboprop engine with a power rating of shp kW and dry weight of lb kg was designated the YT L after its hour qualification test was completed in December br LTC B br br LTC B br Geared turboshaft engine with an initial power rating of shp kW completed a hour qualification test demonstrating shp kW in March and then was designated as the YT L with a power rating of shp kW br LTC B br Ungeared version of the LTC B with an integral oil cooler and tank demonstrated shp kW in January the higher power rating resulted from increased turbine inlet temperatures which came from small modifications learned from YT L and YT L development experience completed hour qualification test at shp kW power rating in February after which it was designated as the YT L completed its hour qualification test in September after which its designation changed from YT L to the T L production
