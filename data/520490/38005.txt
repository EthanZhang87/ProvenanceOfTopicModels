title: Boeing CH-47 Chinook
id: 38005
The Boeing CH Chinook is a tandem rotor helicopter originally developed by American rotorcraft company Vertol and now manufactured by Boeing Defense Space Security The Chinook is a heavy lift helicopter that is among the heaviest lifting Western helicopters Its name Chinook is from the Native American Chinook people of Oregon and Washington state br The Chinook was originally designed by Vertol which had begun work in on a new tandem rotor helicopter designated as the Vertol Model or V Around the same time the United States Department of the Army announced its intention to replace the piston engine powered Sikorsky CH Mojave with a new gas turbine powered helicopter During June the U S Army ordered a small number of V s from Vertol under the YHC A designation following testing some Army officials considered it to be too heavy for the assault missions and too light for transport purposes While the YHC A would be improved and adopted by the U S Marine Corps as the CH Sea Knight the Army sought a heavier transport helicopter and ordered an enlarged derivative of the V with the Vertol designation Model Initially designated as the YCH B on September the preproduction rotorcraft performed its maiden flight In the HC B was redesignated CH A under the United States Tri Service aircraft designation system br The Chinook possesses several means of loading various cargoes including multiple doors across the fuselage a wide loading ramp located at the rear of the fuselage and a total of three external ventral cargo hooks to carry underslung loads Capable of a top speed of knots mph km h upon its introduction to service in the helicopter was considerably faster than contemporary s utility helicopters and attack helicopters and is still one of the fastest helicopters in the US inventory Improved and more powerful versions of the Chinook have also been developed since its introduction one of the most substantial variants to be produced was the CH D which first entered service in improvements from the CH C standard included upgraded engines composite rotor blades a redesigned cockpit to reduce workload improved and redundant electrical systems and avionics and the adoption of an advanced flight control system It remains one of the few aircraft to be developed during the early s along with the fixed wing Lockheed C Hercules cargo aircraft that has remained in both production and frontline service for over years br The military version of the helicopter has been exported to nations across the world the U S Army and the Royal Air Force see Boeing Chinook UK variants have been its two largest users The civilian version of the Chinook is the Boeing Vertol It has been used by civil operators not only for passenger and cargo transport but also for aerial firefighting and to support logging construction and oil extraction industries br br br Design and development br br br Initial development br During late the United States Department of the Army announced its intention to replace the Sikorsky CH Mojave which was powered by piston engines with a new gas turbine powered helicopter Turbine engines were also a key design feature of the smaller UH Huey utility helicopter Following a design competition in September a joint Army Air Force source selection board recommended that the Army procure the Vertol built medium transport helicopter However funding for full scale development was not then available and the Army vacillated on its design requirements Some officials in Army Aviation thought that the new helicopter should be operated as a light tactical transport aimed at taking over the missions of the old piston engined Piasecki H and Sikorsky H helicopters and be consequently capable of carrying about troops one squad Another faction in Army Aviation thought that the new helicopter should be much larger enabling it to airlift large artillery pieces and possess enough internal space to carry the new MGM Pershing missile system br br During Vertol commenced work upon a new tandem rotor helicopter designated as the Vertol Model or V During June the U S Army awarded a contract to Vertol for the acquisition of a small number of the rotorcraft giving it the YHC A designation As ordered the YHC A possessed the capacity to carry a maximum of troops Three underwent testing by the Army for deriving engineering and operational data However the YHC A was considered by many figures within the Army users to be too heavy for the assault role while too light for the more general transport role Accordingly a decision was made to procure a heavier transport helicopter and at the same time upgrade the UH Huey to serve as the needed tactical troop transport The YHC A would be improved and adopted by the Marines as the CH Sea Knight in As a result the Army issued a new order to Vertol for an enlarged derivative of the V known by internal company designation as the Model which it gave the designation of HC B On September the preproduction Boeing Vertol YCH B made its initial hovering flight During the HC B was redesignated the CH A under the United States Tri Service aircraft designation system it was also named Chinook after the Chinook people of the Pacific Northwest br br The CH is powered by two turboshaft engines mounted on each side of the helicopter s rear pylon and connected to the rotors by drive shafts Initial models were fitted with Lycoming T engines rated at hp kW each The counter rotating rotors eliminate the need for an antitorque vertical rotor allowing all power to be used for lift and thrust The ability to adjust lift in either rotor makes it less sensitive to changes in the center of gravity important for the cargo lifting and dropping While hovering over a specific location a twin rotor helicopter has increased stability over a single rotor when weight is added or removed for example when troops drop from or begin climbing up ropes to the aircraft or when other cargo is dropped If one engine fails the other can drive both rotors The sizing of the Chinook was directly related to the growth of the Huey and the Army s tacticians insistence that initial air assaults be built around the squad The Army pushed for both the Huey and the Chinook and this focus was responsible for the acceleration of its air mobility effort br br br Improved and later versions br br Improved and more powerful versions of the CH have been developed since the helicopter entered service Often the same airframe was upgraded to later standards or sometimes the airframes were built to the newer upgrade The U S Army s first major design leap was the now common CH D which entered service in Improvements from the CH C included upgraded engines composite rotor blades a redesigned cockpit to reduce pilot workload improved and redundant electrical systems an advanced flight control system and improved avionics The latest mainstream generation is the CH F which features several major upgrades to reduce maintenance digitized flight controls and is powered by two horsepower kW Honeywell engines br An example of a British upgraded version is the HC the first HC first flew on December br A commercial model of the Chinook the Boeing Vertol Model is used worldwide for logging construction fighting forest fires and supporting petroleum extraction operations In December Columbia Helicopters Inc purchased the type certificate of the Model from Boeing The Chinook has also been licensed to be built by companies outside the United States such as Agusta now AgustaWestland in Italy and Kawasaki in Japan br br br Operational history br br br Vietnam War br br The Army finally settled on the larger Chinook as its standard medium transport helicopter and by February aircraft had been delivered to the Army The st Cavalry Division had brought its organic Chinook battalion three Chinook companies when it arrived in and a separate aviation medium helicopter company the th had arrived in Vietnam on November This latter company was initially placed in direct support of the st Infantry Division CH crews quickly learned to mount an M machine gun in each of the forward doors Sometimes they also installed an M machine gun to fire from the rear cargo door br The most spectacular mission in Vietnam for the Chinook was the placing of artillery batteries in perilous mountain positions inaccessible by any other means and then keeping them resupplied with large quantities of ammunition The st Cavalry Division found that its CH s were limited to a pound kg payload when operating in the mountains but could carry an additional pounds kg when operating near the coast br br As with any new piece of equipment the Chinook presented a major problem of customer education Commanders and crew chiefs had to be constantly alert that eager soldiers did not overload the temptingly large cargo compartment It would be some time before troops would be experts at using sling loads The Chinook soon proved to be such an invaluable aircraft for artillery movement and heavy logistics that it was seldom used as an assault troop carrier Some of the Chinook fleet was used for casualty evacuation and due to the very heavy demand for the helicopters they were usually overburdened with wounded Perhaps the most cost effective use of the Chinook was the recovery of other downed aircraft br At the war s peak the US Army had Chinook companies in Vietnam Pilots discovered the CH A s transmission system could not handle the two gas turbines running at full power and high humidity and heat reduced the maximum lift by more than in the low lands and in mountain areas More powerful improved transmission and strengthened fuselages arrived in with the CH B followed a few months later by the CH C The CH s in Vietnam were generally armed with a single in mm M machine gun on a pintle mount on either side of the aircraft for self defense with stops fitted to keep the gunners from firing into the rotor blades Dust filters were also added to improve engine reliability Of the nearly Chinook helicopters in the U S and South Vietnam fleets about were lost in combat or wartime operational accidents The U S Army CH s supported the st Australian Task Force as required br br Four CH s were converted into ACH As by adding armor and improved engines Its armament included two fixed forward firing M A mm cannons one turret with mm automatic grenade launcher on the nose five in machine guns and two weapon pods on the sides that could carry either XM B XM C mm rocket launchers or mm miniguns They arrived in Vietnam in and they engaged in six months of operational testing at An Kh Army Airfield They performed well in combat but its high maintenance costs and demand for use in troop and cargo transport was stronger Three ACH s were lost One collided with a CH while taxiing Another had a retention pin shake loose on a mm cannon and was brought down when its own gun fired through the forward rotor blades The third was grounded by enemy fire and destroyed by enemy mortar rounds after the crew escaped br br br Iran br br During the s the United States and Iran had a strong relationship in which the Iranian armed forces began to use many American military aircraft most notably the F Tomcat as part of a modernization program After an agreement signed between Boeing and Agusta the Imperial Iranian Air Force purchased Agusta built CH Cs in The Imperial Iranian Army Aviation purchased CH Cs from Agusta between and In late Iran placed an order for an additional helicopters with Elicotteri Meridionali but that order was canceled immediately after the revolution of them were delivered after multiple requests by Iran br In the Iranian Chinook shootdown four Iranian CH Cs penetrated km mi into Soviet airspace in the Turkmenistan Military District They were intercepted by a MiG M which shot down one CH killing eight crew members and forced a second helicopter to land Chinook helicopters were used in efforts by the Iranian against Kurdish rebels in br During the Iran Iraq War Iran made heavy use of its US bought equipment and lost at least eight CH s during the period most notably during a clash on July when an Iraqi Mirage F destroyed three Iranian Chinooks transporting troops to the front line and on February when Iraqi MiG fighters shot down two examples On March in Operation Fath ol Mobin a key operation of the war Iranian Chinooks were landed behind Iraqi lines deployed troops that silenced their artillery and captured an Iraqi headquarters the attack took the Iraqi forces by surprise br Despite the arms embargo in place upon Iran it has managed to keep its Chinook fleet operational Some of the Chinooks have been rebuilt by Panha As of to Chinooks were operational in Iran br br br Libyan wars br In the Libyan Air Force purchased Italian built CH C helicopters of which were transferred to the Libyan Army during the s The Libyan Air Force recruited Western pilots and technicians to operate the CH fleet The Libyan Chinooks flew transport and support missions into Chad to supply Libyan ground forces operating there in the s Chinooks were occasionally used to transport Libyan special forces in assault missions in northern Chad br In Libya sold helicopters to the United Arab Emirates as due to the Western embargo and lack of funds maintaining them was difficult The sale to UAE was a million package that included equipment parts and training How many CH s are still in existence or operational during the ongoing Libyan civil wars that started in is not known br br br Falklands War br br The Chinook was used both by Argentina and the United Kingdom during the Falklands War in br The Argentine Air Force and the Argentine Army each deployed two CH C helicopters which were widely used in general transport duties Of the Army s aircraft one was destroyed on the ground by mm cannon fire from an RAF GR Harrier while the other was captured by the British and reused after the war Both Argentine Air Force helicopters returned to Argentina and remained in service until br Three British Chinooks were destroyed on May when Atlantic Conveyor was struck by an Exocet sea skimming missile fired by an Argentine Super tendard The sole surviving British Chinook Bravo November did outstanding service in the Falklands lifting troops on one occasion Since April it has been on display at Royal Air Force Museum Cosford br br br Afghanistan and Iraq wars br About CH Ds of various operators were deployed to Saudi Arabia Kuwait and Iraq during Operation Desert Shield and the subsequent Operation Desert Storm in br br The CH D has seen wide use in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq The Chinook is being used in air assault missions inserting troops into fire bases and later bringing food water and ammunition It is also the casualty evacuation aircraft of choice in the British Armed Forces In combat theaters it is typically escorted by attack helicopters such as the AH Apache for protection Its lift capacity has been found of particular value in the mountainous terrain of Afghanistan where high altitudes and temperatures limit the use of helicopters such as the UH Black Hawk reportedly one Chinook can replace up to five UH s in the air assault transport role br br The Chinook helicopters of several nations have participated in the Afghanistan War including aircraft from Britain Italy the Netherlands Spain Canada and Australia Despite the age of the Chinook it is still in heavy demand in part due its proven versatility and ability to operate in demanding environments such as Afghanistan br In May an Australian Army CH D crashed during a resupply mission in Zabul Province resulting in one fatality and five survivors The helicopter was unable to be recovered and was destroyed in place To compensate for the loss the ADF added two ex U S Army CH Ds to the fleet which are expected to be in service until the introduction of the CH Fs in br On August a Chinook crashed near Kabul killing all of the aboard The Chinook was reportedly shot down with a rocket propelled grenade by the Taliban while attempting to assist a group of U S Navy SEALs The were members of NATO and allied forces including Naval Special Warfare operators five U S Army Aviation soldiers three U S Air Force special operations personnel and seven Afghan National Army commandos A civilian translator and a U S military working dog were also killed in the crash The crash was the single deadliest during the entire Operation Enduring Freedom campaign The previous biggest single day loss for American forces in Afghanistan involved a Chinook that was shot down near Kabul in Kunar Province in June with all aboard killed including a member U S Special Operations team br Chinook helicopters participated in the Kabul airlift at the close of military operations in Afghanistan br br br Disaster relief br br The Chinook s ability to carry large underslung loads has been of significant value in relief operations in the aftermath of natural disasters Numerous operators have chosen to deploy their Chinook fleets to support humanitarian efforts in stricken nations overseas Following the Asian tsunami the Republic of Singapore Air Force assisted in the relief operations in neighboring Indonesia using its Chinooks similarly after the Kashmir earthquake the Royal Air Force dispatched several Chinooks to Northern Pakistan to assist in recovery efforts br In August six CH Ds were deployed from Fort Bragg in North Carolina to provide relief in the wake of Hurricane Andrew in what was one of the first major helicopter disaster relief operations on US soil Then President George H W Bush ordered the military to assist The Chinooks arrived at Miami Opa Locka Executive Airport just outside of the disaster zone one day after the President s order early on they performed a wide loop over Homestead and Florida City to publicly display their presence helping to curtail lawlessness and looting The Chinooks initially flew twelve sorties per day out of Opa Locka which expanded over time often supporting distribution operations at Homestead AFB and Opa Locka as well as delivering relief payloads via internal storage not using sling loads supplementing the two dozen distribution centers and trucks proving essential as trucks could not reach the worst hit areas due to downed trees and power lines They flew everyday for approximately three weeks moving supplies and personnel around the disaster zone as well as carrying media and government officials including then Congressman Bill Nelson Ultimately the Chinooks supplied distribution sites throughout the zone and transported million pounds of supplies before the urgent relief phase ended br Three of Japan s CH s were used to cool Reactors and of the Fukushima Nuclear power plant following the earthquake in they were used to collect sea water from the nearby ocean and drop it over the affected areas In order to protect the crew from the heightened radiation levels present a number of lead plates were attached to the floor of each Chinook even with such measures pilots had to keep their distance from the reactors while also limiting flight times in the vicinity to a maximum of minutes to avoid excessive radiation exposure br br br Other operations and roles br br In April multiple Chinooks conducted the evacuation of the US Embassy in Khartoum Sudan with Special Forces see also Sudanese civil war present Chinooks have been deployed to Mali for MINUSMA br Since the type s inception the Chinook has carried out various secondary missions including medical evacuation disaster relief search and rescue aircraft recovery fire fighting and heavy construction assistance br In February the Indian Air Force started using Chinooks at theatres such as Ladakh and Siachen Glacier to assist Indian forces deployed at the Indian borders with China and Pakistan The Indian Space Research Organisation has also enlisted Indian Air Force Chinooks during the development of its Reusable Launch Vehicle Technology Demonstration Program with Chinook helicopters air dropping two test vehicles during the RLV LEX and RLV LEX conducted on April and March respectively br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br CH F orders br In February the Royal Netherlands Air Force became the first international customer of the CH F model expanding their Chinook fleet to On August Canada signed a contract for extensively modified and upgraded CH Fs for the Canadian Forces later delivered in with the Canadian designation CH F On December Britain announced its Future Helicopter Strategy including the purchase of new CH Fs to be delivered from Australia ordered seven CH Fs in March to replace its six CH Ds between and In September India approved purchase of CH F Chinooks On November Singapore announced that the CH F would replace its older Chinooks which had been in service since enabling the Republic of Singapore Air Force to meet its requirements for various operations including Search and Rescue SAR Aeromedical Evacuation AME and Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief HADR operations The German government announced in June that the CH F Block was selected as the winner of its heavy helicopter program to replace its Sikorsky CH G Sea Stallion fleet Germany is planning to buy airframes to boost heavy lift capability br Spain had CH which it is planning to upgrade CH F standard By CH D were upgraded to CH F and additionally new build CH F were acquired br br br Variants br There have been many versions of the Chinook over the decades there are variants that involve major upgrades such as engines and avionics ones for certain tasks such as Special Operation missions and finally there are version for certain countries such as the J model built by and for Japan br br br HC B br The pre designation for Model development aircraft that would be redesignated CH Chinook br br br CH A br The all weather medium lift CH A Chinook was powered initially by Lycoming T L engines rated at horsepower kW which were replaced by the T L rated at hp kW engines or T L C engines rated at hp kW The CH A had a maximum gross weight of lb kg with a maximum payload about lb kg Delivery of the CH A Chinook to the U S Army began in August A total of were built br br br ACH A br br The ACH A was known as the Armed Armored CH A or A ACH A before being designated ACH A as a U S Army Attack Cargo Helicopter and unofficially referred to as Guns A Go Go Four CH A helicopters were converted to gunships by Boeing Vertol in late Three were assigned to the rd Aviation Detachment in South Vietnam for testing with the remaining one retained in the U S for weapons testing By the rd was redesignated the st Aviation Detachment Provisional and attached to the th Assault Support Helicopter Battalion of the st Cavalry Division Airmobile By only one gunship remained and transport demands prevented more conversions It was returned to the United States and the program stopped br The ACH A carried five mm M D machine guns or caliber mm M HB heavy machine guns provided by the XM and XM armament subsystems two mm M A cannons two tube inch mm Folding Fin Aerial Rocket launchers XM B XM or sometimes two M M A mm gun pods and a single mm M grenade launcher in the XM M armament subsystem more commonly seen on the UH series of helicopters Rare newsreel footage shows one of the aircraft in action supporting the th Cavalry Regiment during an ambush at B ng Son South Vietnam The surviving aircraft Easy Money has been restored and is on display at Redstone Arsenal Alabama br br br CH B br br The CH B was an interim upgrade while Boeing worked on a more substantially improved CH C The CH B was powered by two Lycoming T L C hp kW engines It had a blunted rear rotor pylon redesigned asymmetrical rotor blades and strakes along the rear ramp and fuselage to improve flying characteristics It could be equipped with two door mounted M D mm NATO machine guns on the M armament subsystem and a ramp mounted M D using the M armament subsystem Some CH bombers were equipped to drop tear gas or napalm from the rear cargo ramp onto Viet Cong bunkers The CH B could be equipped with a hoist and cargo hook The Chinook proved especially valuable in Pipe Smoke aircraft recovery missions The Hook recovered about aircraft valued at over billion during the war were built br br br CH C br br The CH C featured more powerful engines and transmissions Three sub versions were built the first with Lycoming T L C engines delivering shp kW The Super C had Lycoming T L engines delivering shp kW an upgraded maximum gross weight of lb kg and pitch stability augmentation The T L engines were less reliable as they had been hurriedly introduced to increase payload thus they were temporarily replaced by the more reliable Lycoming T L C The Super C was distinguishable from the standard C by the uprated maximum gross weight br The type was not approved by the FAA for civil aviation due to the nonredundant hydraulic flight boost system drive The hydraulic system was redesigned for the succeeding CH D allowing it to achieve certification as the Boeing Model A total of CH Cs were built Canada bought eight CH Cs deliveries of the type began in Receiving the Canadian designation CH these were fitted with a power hoist above the crew door other changes included a flight engineer station in the rear cabin operators referred to the configuration as the Super C The CH C was used widely during the Vietnam War eventually replacing the older Piasecki H Shawnee in the combat assault support role br br br CH D br br The CH D shares the same airframe as earlier models with more powerful engines Early CH Ds were powered by two T L engines The most common engine is the later T GA A With its triple hook cargo system the CH D can carry heavy payloads internally and up to lb kg such as foot or meter containers externally It was introduced into service in In air assault operations it often serves as the principal mover of the mm M howitzer plus rounds of ammunition and an man crew The CH D has advanced avionics including Global Positioning System Nearly all US Army CH Ds were converted from previous A B and C models a total of being converted The last U S Army CH D built was delivered to the U S Army Reserve located at Fort Hood Texas in br br The Netherlands acquired all seven of the Canadian Forces surviving CH Cs and upgraded them to CH D Six more new CH Ds were delivered in for a total of The Dutch CH Ds are improved over U S Army CH Ds including a long nose for Bendix weather radar a glass cockpit and improved T L engines As of the Netherlands planned upgrading of them to the CH F standard at a later date As of Singapore has CH D SDs which includes twelve Super D Chinooks in service In Canada purchased CH Ds from the U S for the Canadian Helicopter Force Afghanistan for million With CH D lost to an accident the remaining five were sold in after the end of Canada s Afghanistan mission and replaced with seven CH Fs br br br MH D br The MH D was developed for special forces operations and has inflight refueling capability a fast rope rappelling system and other upgrades The MH D was used by U S Army th Special Operations Aviation Regiment Twelve MH D helicopters were produced Six were converted from CH As and six were converted from CH C models br br br MH E br br The MH E has been used by U S Army Special Operations Beginning with the E model prototype manufactured in a total of Special Operations Aircraft were produced All aircraft were assigned to th SOAR A Nightstalkers home based at Fort Campbell Kentucky E models were converted from CH C airframes The MH E has similar capabilities as the MH D but with increased fuel capacity similar to the CH SD and terrain following terrain avoidance radar br In the Royal Air Force ordered eight Chinook HC s effectively a lower cost MH E for special operations They were delivered in but never became operational due to technical issues with their avionics fit unique to the HC In work started to revert the HC s to HC standard to enable them to enter service As of they were upgraded to HC standard with a digital automated flight control system br br br CH F br br In the CH F an upgraded CH D made its maiden flight The first production model rolled out at Boeing s facility in Ridley Park Pennsylvania and first flew on October Upgrades included shaft horsepower kW Honeywell engines and airframe with better integrated construction for lower maintenance requirements The milled construction reduces vibration as well as inspection and repair needs and eliminates flexing points to increase service life The CH F can fly at speeds of over mph km h with a payload of more than lb kg New avionics include a Rockwell Collins Common Avionics Architecture System CAAS cockpit and BAE Systems Digital Advanced Flight Control System DAFCS AgustaWestland assembles the CH F under license known as the Chinook ICH F for several customers Boeing delivered CH Fs to the U S Army through August at that time Boeing announced a billion billion in contract with the Army for Chinooks br br A CH F Block is being implemented as of The Block aims for a payload of lb kg with ft m and F C high and hot hover performance eventually increased up to ft m to carry the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle maximum takeoff weight would be raised to lb kg It has more powerful Honeywell T engines along with an active parallel actuator system APAS to enhance the digital advanced flight control system providing an exact torque split between the rotors for greater efficiency A new fuel system combines the three fuel cells in each sponson into one larger fuel cell and eliminates intracell fuel transfer hardware reducing weight by kg lb and increasing fuel capacity Electrical capacity is increased by three kVA generators The Advanced Chinook Rotor Blades ACRB derived from the cancelled RAH Comanche were intended to improve lift performance in hot high altitude conditions by lb however the US Army ultimately decided against implementing the ACRB due to persistent vibration during testing Boeing denied the assertion that the vibration was a safety risk and believed it could be solved with dampeners In addition the aft rotor blade was stalling when in a swept back position br The U S Army plans for a Block upgrade after which could include a new hp kW class engine with boosted power capacity of the transmission and drive train developed under the future affordable turbine engine FATE program and a lengthened fuselage The Future Vertical Lift program plans to begin replacing the Army s rotorcraft fleet in the mid s initially focusing on medium lift helicopters thus the CH is planned to be in service beyond over years after the first entered service br br br MH G br The MH G Special Operations Aviation SOA version is similar to the MH E but features more sophisticated avionics including a digital Common Avionics Architecture System CAAS The CAAS is a common glass cockpit used by helicopters such as MH K Ls CH E Ks and ARH As The MH G also incorporates all of the new sections of the CH F br br The modernization program improves MH D and MH E Special Operations Chinooks to the MH G design specs A total of MH E and MH D aircraft were upgraded by the end of The final MH G was delivered to the U S Army Special Operations Command USASOC on February Modernization of MH D Es to the MH G standard is due by On September Boeing announced the delivery of the first MH G Block II to USASOC of an initial order of with a stated ultimate requirement for The MH G Block II includes all of the improvements from the CH F Block II as well as inflight refueling capability a comprehensive defensive aids suite and low level adverse weather piloting aids such as forward looking infrared and multi mode terrain following radar It is armed with two mm M Miniguns and two M mm machine guns br The British MOD confirmed that while the U S does not export the model the two countries were in discussion regarding the MH G as of On October the Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of a possible sale of H Chinooks Extended Range to the UK br br br CH J br br The CH J is a medium transport helicopter for the Japan Ground Self Defense Force JGSDF and the Japan Air Self Defense Force JASDF The differences between the CH J and the CH D are the engine rotor brake and avionics for use for general transportation SAR and disaster activity like U S forces The CH JA introduced in is a long range version of the CH J fitted with an enlarged fuel tank an AAQ FLIR in a turret under the nose and a partial glass cockpit Both versions are built under license in Japan by Kawasaki Heavy Industries who produced aircraft by April br The Japan Defense Agency ordered aircraft of which were for the JGSDF and were for the JASDF Boeing supplied flyable aircraft to which Kawasaki added full avionics interior and final paint The CH J model Chinook N H made its first flight in January and it was sent to Kawasaki in April Boeing began delivering five CH J kits in September for assembly at Kawasaki br br Over had been produced by the early st century including the CH JA model with improved fuel tanks and other upgrades br br br HH br On November the HH a new variant of the Chinook based on the MH G was selected by the U S Air Force as the winner of the Combat Search and Rescue CSAR X competition Four development HH s were to be built with the first of production aircraft planned to enter service in However in February the contract award was protested and the GAO ordered the CSAR X project to be re bid The CSAR X program was again terminated in In February the USAF announced plans to replace aging HH G helicopters and deferred secondary combat search and rescue requirements calling for a larger helicopter In a long process the Air Force did not choose the larger Chinook and the HH W entered service by to replace the older helicopters br br br Sea Chinook br For years the U S Navy has been operating different versions of the single rotor CH helicopter as its heavy lift helicopter CH s regularly conduct ship based operations for U S Special Forces and other international operators Due to budget issues technical problems and delays with CH K the director of the Pentagon s cost assessment office directed US Navy to consider maritime versions of CH Naval versions must be protected against the corrosive seaborne environment and be able to operate from aircraft carriers and amphibious ships br br br Other export models br
