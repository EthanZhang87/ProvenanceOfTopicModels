A foil is a solid object with a shape such that when placed in a moving fluid at a suitable angle of attack the lift force generated perpendicular to the fluid flow is substantially larger than the drag force generated parallel to the fluid flow If the fluid is a gas the foil is called an airfoil or aerofoil and if the fluid is water the foil is called a hydrofoil br br br Physics of foils br br A foil generates lift primarily because of its shape and angle of attack When oriented at a suitable angle the foil deflects the oncoming fluid resulting in a force on the foil in the direction opposite to the deflection This force can be resolved into two components lift and drag This turning of the fluid in the vicinity of the foil creates curved streamlines which results in lower pressure on one side and higher pressure on the other This pressure difference is accompanied by a velocity difference via Bernoulli s principle so for foils generating lift the resulting flowfield about the foil has a higher average velocity on one surface than on the other br A more detailed description of the flowfield is given by the simplified Navier Stokes equations applicable when the fluid is incompressible And since the effects of the compressibility of air at low speeds is negligible these simplified equations can be used for airfoils as long as the airflow is substantially less than the speed of sound up to about Mach For hydrofoils at high speeds of the order of knots m s according to Faltinsen cavitation and ventilation with air penetrating along the strut from the water surface to the foil may occur Both effects may have a substantial influence on the foil s lift br br br Basic design considerations br The simplest type of foil is a flat plate When set at an angle the angle of attack to the flow the plate will deflect the fluid passing over and under it and this deflection will result in a lift force on the plate However while it does generate lift it also generates a large amount of drag br Since even a flat plate can generate lift a significant factor in foil design is the minimization of drag An example of this is the rudder of a boat or aircraft When designing a rudder a key design factor is the minimization of drag in its neutral position which is balanced with the need to produce sufficient lift with which to turn the craft at a reasonable rate br br Other types of foils both natural and man made seen both in air and water have features that delay or control the onset of lift induced drag flow separation and stall see Bird flight Fin Airfoil Placoid scale Tubercle Vortex generator Canard close coupled Blown flap Leading edge slot Leading edge slats as well as Wingtip vortices see Winglet br br br Lifted ability in air and water br The weight a foil can lift is proportional to its lift coefficient the density of the fluid the foil area and its speed squared The following shows the lifting ability of a flat plate with span metres and area square metres moving at a speed of m s at different altitudes and water depths It uses the lift at an altitude of km as a datum to show how the lift increases with decreasing altitude increasing air density It also shows the influence of ground effect and then the effect of increase in density going from air to water br br height km lift datum for comparison br m br in ground effect br water surface planing br just submerged br depth m br km br br br See also br br br br br br External links br Lift from Flow Turning br What is Lift br Bernoulli and Newton br Effect of Shape on Lift br Incorrect Lift Theory br Penguin can fly br phillipines thresher shark swim towards scuba divers br Swimming with Wild Dolphins br Bird Flight II
