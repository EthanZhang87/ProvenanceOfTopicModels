Rolls Royce Limited was a British luxury car and later an aero engine manufacturing business established in in Manchester by the partnership of Charles Rolls and Henry Royce Building on Royce s good reputation established with his cranes they quickly developed a reputation for superior engineering by manufacturing the best car in the world The business was incorporated as Rolls Royce Limited in and a new factory in Derby was opened in The First World War brought the company into manufacturing aero engines Joint development of jet engines began in and they entered production in Rolls Royce has since built an enduring reputation for the development and manufacturing of engines for military and commercial aircraft br In the late s Rolls Royce was adversely affected by the mismanaged development of its advanced RB jet engine and consequent cost over runs though it ultimately proved a great success In the owners were obliged to liquidate their business The useful portions were bought by a new government owned company named Rolls Royce Limited which continued the core business but sold the holdings in British Aircraft Corporation BAC almost immediately and transferred ownership of the profitable but now financially insignificant car division to Rolls Royce Motors Holdings Limited which it sold to Vickers in Rolls Royce obtained consent to drop the distinction from its company name in at which point it became known once again as Rolls Royce Limited br The Rolls Royce business remained nationalised until when after having renamed the company to Rolls Royce plc the British government sold it to the public in a share offering Rolls Royce plc still owns and operates Rolls Royce s principal business although since it is technically a subsidiary of Rolls Royce Holdings plc a listed holding company br A marketing survey in showed that only Coca Cola was a more widely known brand than Rolls Royce br br br Motor cars br Henry Royce started an electrical and mechanical business in He made his first car a two cylinder Royce in his Manchester factory in Henry Royce was introduced to Charles Rolls at the Midland Hotel Manchester on May of that year Rolls was proprietor of an early motor car dealership C S Rolls Co in Fulham br In spite of his preference for three or four cylinder cars Rolls was impressed with the Royce and in a subsequent agreement on December agreed to take all the cars Royce could make There would be four models br br a hp kW two cylinder model selling at about in br a hp kW three cylinder model selling at about in br a hp kW four cylinder model selling at about in br a hp kW six cylinder model selling at about in br All would be badged as Rolls Royces and be sold exclusively by Rolls The first Rolls Royce car the Rolls Royce hp was unveiled at the Paris Salon in December br br br Incorporation br br Rolls Royce Limited was formed on March by which time it was apparent that new premises were required for production of cars After considering sites in Manchester Coventry Bradford and Leicester it was an offer from Derby s council of cheap electricity that resulted in the decision to acquire a acres m site on the southern edge of that city The new factory was largely designed by Royce and production began in early with a formal opening on July by Sir John Montagu The investment in the new company required further capital to be raised and on December of new shares were offered to the public In Rolls Royce bought out C S Rolls Co The non motor car interests of Royce Ltd continued to operate separately br br br Rolls Royce br br During Royce had been developing an improved six cylinder model with more power than the Rolls Royce hp Initially designated the hp this was Rolls Royce s first all new model In March Claude Johnson Commercial Managing Director and sometimes described as the hyphen in Rolls Royce succeeded in persuading Royce and the other directors that Rolls Royce should concentrate exclusively on the new model and all the earlier models were duly discontinued Johnson had an early example finished in silver and named as if it were a yacht Silver Ghost Unofficially the press and public immediately picked up and used Silver Ghost for all the cars made until the introduction of the Phantom in br The new was responsible for Rolls Royce s early reputation with over built Its chassis was used as a basis for the first British armoured car used in both world wars br br br Rolls Royce Eagle aero engine br br Aero engine manufacturing began in at the government s request The first model the Rolls Royce Eagle entered production in Two Eagles powered Alcock and Brown s first non stop trans Atlantic crossing by aeroplane mounted on their converted Vickers Vimy bomber br br br Springfield USA br br In Rolls Royce opened a new factory in Springfield Massachusetts in the United States to help meet a three year backlog demand where a further Springfield Ghosts and Phantoms were built This factory called Rolls Royce of America Inc operated for years with the first car being completed on January that being a Silver Ghost with a documented chassis price of US in dollars When the factory closed in total vehicles had been produced It was located at the former American Wire Wheel factory on Hendee Street with the administration offices at Waltham Ave Springfield was the earlier location for the Duryea Motor Wagon Company the location where the first American gasoline powered vehicle was built Bodies for American assembly were supplied by Brewster Co in Long Island City New York br br br Rolls Royce Twenty br br After the First World War Rolls Royce successfully avoided attempts to encourage British car manufacturers to merge Faced with falling sales of the Silver Ghost in short lived but deep postwar slumps Rolls Royce introduced the smaller affordable Twenty in effectively ending the one model policy followed since br br br Rolls Royce Phantom br The new hp Phantom replaced the Silver Ghost in The Phantom III introduced in was the last large pre war model A strictly limited production of Phantoms for heads of state recommenced in and continued until the Phantom VI ended production in the late s br br br Bentley and Rolls Royce br br In Rolls Royce acquired Bentley the small sports racing car maker and potential rival after the latter s finances failed to weather the onset of the Great Depression Rolls Royce stopped production of the new Bentley Litre which was threatening sales of their current Phantom disposed of remaining Bentley assets and using just the Bentley name and its repute br br After two years of development Rolls Royce introduced a new and quite different ultra civilised medium size Bentley the Bentley Litre Advertised as the silent sports car and very much in the Rolls Royce mould it was a private entry by Eddie Hall but supported by Rolls Royce in the and RAC Tourist Trophy sports car races on the Ards Circuit where it recorded the fastest average speed in each year ahead of Lagondas and Bugattis This helped the Sales Department as old Bentley customers had been inclined to doubt that the new Crewe Bentley could out perform its famous predecessors br Immediately after World War II when fully tooled pressed steel cars were produced in the factory rather than chassis sent to a coachbuilder for a custom built body until standard Bentley and Rolls Royce cars were usually nearly identical Bentleys were badge engineered only the radiator grille and minor details differed br In the colour of the Rolls Royce radiator monogram was changed from red to black because the red sometimes clashed with the coachwork colour selected by clients and not as a mark of respect for the death of Royce later that year as is commonly stated br br br Crewe br The British government built a shadow factory in Crewe in for Rolls Royce where they could build their Merlin and Griffon aero engines Car production was moved there in for space to construct bodies and to leave space for aero engines at Derby The site was bought from the government in It is now Bentley Crewe br br br Second World War br In a contract was signed with the Packard Motor Car Company in Detroit Michigan for the production of Merlin aero engines for World War II in the USA br Production focused on aero engines but a variant of the Merlin engine known as the Meteor was developed for the Cromwell tank The Meteor s development completed in the same team at the Belper foundry restarted work on an eight cylinder car engine widening its uses and it became the pattern for the British Army s B range of petrol engines for post war combat vehicles in particular in Alvis s FV range Daimler s Ferret Humber s Hornet and Pig and Austin s Champ br br br Postwar diversification br br br Motor bodies br br After the war in Rolls Royce and Bentley car production moved to Crewe where they began to assemble complete Rolls Royce and Bentley cars with body pressings made by the Pressed Steel Company see W A Robotham Previously they had built only the chassis leaving the bodies to specialist coach builders In Rolls Royce brought one of the specialist coachbuilders completely in house by buying the remaining capital of Park Ward Limited which since in conjunction with Rolls Royce had been building short production runs of all metal saloon bodies on Bentley chassis br In Rolls Royce bought coachbuilder H J Mulliner and the two businesses were put together as H J Mulliner Park Ward br br br Diesel engines Shrewsbury br br Luxury cars did not fit with the new mood of post war austerity After starting design and development of what became their C series diesel engine range in Rolls Royce began to produce diesel engines in By it provided diesel engines for automotive railway industrial earth moving and marine use br Sentinel Shrewsbury Limited was bought in Sentinel made machine tools and industrial locomotives Rolls Royce took over Sentinel s Shrewsbury factory for diesel engine production and all its diesel work was transferred there br West Riding manufacturer of diesel shunting locomotives Thomas Hill Rotherham Limited was added to the group in br In when Shrewsbury activities were put under the umbrella of new owner Rolls Royce Motors the range of diesel engines included br br C range and cylinder engines with power output from to bhp Used in generating sets compressors etc construction equipment railway and other industrial purposes and marine propulsion br Eagle a modified version of the C range cylinder engine named Eagle is used in heavy vehicles their output to bhp br D range V engines with outputs from to bhp for generating sets marine and railway applications br br br Aero engines br br In Charles Rolls whose interests had turned increasingly to flying tried unsuccessfully to persuade Royce and the other directors to design an aero engine When World War I broke out in August Rolls Royce and many others were taken by surprise As a manufacturer of luxury cars Rolls Royce was immediately vulnerable and Claude Johnson thought the bank would withdraw its overdraft facility on which Rolls Royce depended at that time Nevertheless believing that war was likely to be short lived the directors initially decided not to seek government work making aero engines However this position was quickly reversed and Rolls Royce was persuaded by the War Office to manufacture fifty air cooled V engines under licence from Renault Meanwhile the Royal Aircraft Factory asked Rolls Royce to design a new hp kW engine Despite initial reluctance they agreed and during developed Rolls Royce s first aero engine the twelve cylinder Eagle This was quickly followed by the smaller six cylinder Hawk the hp kW Falcon and just before the end of the war the larger hp kW Condor br Throughout World War I Rolls Royce struggled to build aero engines in the quantities required by the War Office However with the exception of Brazil Straker in Bristol Rolls Royce resisted pressure to license production to other manufacturers fearing that the engines much admired quality and reliability would risk being compromised Instead the Derby factory was extended to enable Rolls Royce to increase its own production rates By the late s aero engines made up most of Rolls Royce s business br Henry Royce s last design was the Merlin aero engine which was first flown in prototype form in although he had died in This was developed from the R engine which had powered a record breaking Supermarine S B seaplane to almost mph km h in the Schneider Trophy The Merlin was a powerful supercharged V engine and was fitted into many World War II aircraft the British Hawker Hurricane Supermarine Spitfire de Havilland Mosquito twin engine Avro Lancaster four engine a development of the Avro Manchester with its unreliable Rolls Royce Vulture engines Vickers Wellington twin engine it also transformed the American North American P Mustang into a competitor for the best fighter of its time its engine a Merlin engine built by Packard under licence Over Merlin engines were produced including over by the Ford Motor Company at Trafford Park Manchester During the war most Rolls Royce flight testing of engines was carried out from Hucknall Aerodrome The Merlin crossed over into military land vehicle use as the Meteor powering the Centurion tank among others Many Meteor engines used engine blocks and parts that failed requirements for high performance engines but were suitable for use in the derated kW hp Meteor br In December over a five shilling meal at the Swan and Royal Archived February at the Wayback Machine in Clitheroe Stanley Hooker and Ernest Hives of Rolls Royce agreed with Spencer Wilks of the Rover Car Company that Rolls Royce would take over top secret work on the development of the jet engine An exchange of assets followed with Rover and in the post World War II period Rolls Royce made significant advances in gas turbine engine design and manufacture The Dart and Tyne turboprop engines were particularly important enabling airlines to cut times for shorter journeys whilst jet airliners were introduced on longer services The Dart engine was used in Armstrong Whitworth AW Argosy Avro Fokker F Friendship Handley Page Herald and Vickers Viscount aircraft whilst the more powerful Tyne powered the Breguet Atlantique Transall C Short Belfast and Vickers Vanguard and the SR N hovercraft Many of these turboprops are still in service br Amongst the jet engines of this period was the RB Spey which powers the Hawker Siddeley Trident BAC One Eleven Grumman Gulfstream II and Fokker F Fellowship br During the late s and s there was a significant rationalisation of all aspects of British aerospace and this included aero engine manufacturers In Rolls Royce acquired Bristol Siddeley which had resulted from the merger of Armstrong Siddeley and Bristol Aero Engines in and incorporated it as the Bristol Siddeley division Bristol Siddeley with its principal factory at Filton near Bristol had a strong base in military engines including the Olympus Viper Pegasus vectored thrust and Orpheus They were also manufacturing the Olympus Mk to be used in Concorde in collaboration with SNECMA They also had a turbofan project with SNECMA br Leavesden Aerodrome Watford was originally owned by the Ministry of Defence and used during World War II for the manufacture of Mosquito and Halifax aircraft For a number of years Rolls Royce used the site for the manufacture of helicopter engines until the site closed in June The former Rolls Royce factory at Watford is now known as the Leavesden Film Studios and has produced world famous films including the James Bond Star Wars and Harry Potter series br br br RB the receivership and nationalisation br br The amalgamations and disappearances of the s and s left a small number of major airframe manufacturers based in only a few countries The competition for the very large contracts to supply their engines grew intense Expensive research and development became vital Real profits came from the maintenance contracts which might peak a whole human generation later By the s it was said that each generation of aero engines cost around times that of its parent br At this time Rolls Royce employed people and it was Britain s th largest company in terms of manpower It was generally known that problems had recently arisen requiring government support of the RB programme as one outcome of intense financial competition with Pratt Whitney and General Electric for the original RB contract br In the new year of financial problems caused largely by development of this new RB turbofan engine designed and developed for Lockheed Aircraft Corporation s new L TriStar led after several government provided cash subsidies to the recognition Rolls Royce had no resources left and it voluntarily entered receivership February br There were said to have been acrimonious telephone conversations between US president Richard Nixon and the British prime minister Edward Heath but these were subsequently denied Responding to questions as to how the situation could have arisen the chief executive advised that in their calculations they were guided by the success of their estimates in the launching of their Spey engine br Had the government simply nationalised Rolls Royce it would have been unable to avoid the obligations to Lockheed br The situation was handled in the usual manner with the assets being sold for cash in this case to the government leaving the massive liabilities to be dealt with by Rolls Royce Limited using the funds realised by the sale However the government would not fix a purchase price for the assets until the situation became clearer because without a continuing business many of them might be worthless In the meantime the government would use the assets to continue the activities of the aero engine marine and industrial gas turbine and small engine divisions that were important to national defence the collective programmes with other countries and to many air forces and civil airlines A new company was incorporated that May to purchase substantially the whole of the undertakings and assets of the four divisions of Rolls Royce connected with gas turbine engines The original company Rolls Royce Limited was placed in liquidation on October br Asking their own government for support Lockheed warned that a switch to either Pratt Whitney or General Electric engines would delay production by an extra six months and might force Lockheed into bankruptcy br The receiver negotiated with Lockheed which consented to waive damages allowing the plant to be shut down The continuing support of the trade creditors was also achieved by the receiver in spite of threats to demand immediate payments in full and to withdraw supplies The first asset sold was British Aircraft Corporation bought equally by Vickers and GEC The receiver floated Rolls Royce Motors in br br br New board br The new owner Rolls Royce Limited had among its board members Lord Cole a former chairman of Unilever Sir Arnold Weinstock managing director of GEC Hugh Conway managing director Rolls Royce Gas Turbines Dr Stanley Hooker Rolls Royce Bristol Sir William Cook an adviser to the Minister of Defence Sir St John Elstub managing director of Imperial Metal Industries and Sir Charles Elworthy former Marshal of the Royal Air Force and Chief of the Defence Staff br br br Lockheed and Rolls Royce take off br The new aircraft with its three RB engines left USA for the first time and arrived in Paris on June At Palmdale California the L received its US Federal Aviation Administration s certificate of airworthiness on April nine months late On the day the chairman of Lockeed said we know that in airline service it RB will prove itself to be one of the leading power plants in aviation history br The first airliner was delivered to Eastern Air Lines on April but it had been beaten in the race to production by McDonnell Douglas s DC br br br Rolls Royce Motors br br Rolls Royce Motors Limited was incorporated on April two and a half months after Rolls Royce fell into receivership Under the ownership of the receiver it began to trade in April manufacturing motor cars diesel and petrol engines coachwork and other items previously made by Rolls Royce s motor car and diesel divisions and Mulliner Park Ward It continued to take on precision engineering work on sub contracts br In June it acquired all the business and assets used by the motor car and diesel divisions of Rolls Royce and Mulliner Park Ward Rolls Royce Motors permitted uses of the various Rolls Royce trade marks were very precisely defined br At the end of Rolls Royce Motors employees in the United Kingdom numbered in the car division and in the diesel division for a total of people In May the business was sold to Rolls Royce Motors Holdings Limited in preparation for its public flotation br br br Car Division br At that time the Car Division as well as making cars and special coachwork carried out investment foundry work and the machining of aero engine components It also produced piston engines for light aircraft together with other petrol and multi fuel engines Both divisions carried out development work for the British government br The car division s headquarters were in Pym s Lane and Minshull New Road Crewe Bespoke coachbuilding remained in Hythe Road and High Road Willesden London The Crewe former shadow factory premises were bought from the government at this time br br br Diesel Division br The Diesel

met with a disappointing public response and more than per cent of the issue was left in the hands of the underwriters br br br Merger with Vickers br On August the shareholders agreement to the merger of Rolls Royce Motors Holdings and Vickers Limited became unconditional Vickers would sell Rolls Royce Motors to Volkswagen Group in without the trademark which was controlled by the aeroengine company so it was renamed to Bentley Motors with BMW then establishing a new manufacturer named Rolls Royce Motor Cars br br br Perkins Engines br The Rolls Royce diesel business was acquired from Vickers in by Perkins Engines Perkins further developed the Eagle Diesels into the Perkins TX series of engines br br br Rolls Royce drops from its name br br The name of Rolls Royce Limited was changed to Rolls Royce Limited on December the end of the company s financial year The original Rolls Royce Limited incorporated in and still in liquidation had been renamed Rolls Royce Realisations

traded on sharemarkets br br br privatisation br In April the government offered for sale all Rolls Royce plc shares The heavily advertised issue was a remarkable success br Rolls Royce s was an exceptionally long term business Before a civil aero engine went into service its development could take to years military engines often longer Production might then extend a further years including the manufacture of spare parts required long after complete engine production ends br br br Customers br According to the prospectus published for the issue of shares to members of the public Rolls Royce was by then one of only three enterprises outside USSR and China able to design develop and produce large gas turbine engines At that time its engines were installed in the aircraft of more than civil carriers and were used by armed services and operators of executive and corporate aircraft br In addition its turbines powered the naval vessels of different nations Over industrial customers operated Rolls Royce gas turbines for power generation gas and oil pumping and other industrial purposes Its single most important customer was the United Kingdom s government In the preceding five years about per cent of production went outside the United Kingdom br br br Competition br Rolls Royce s competitors were GE and Pratt Whitney UTC Aero engines were then only a part of GE and UTC
