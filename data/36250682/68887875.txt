on platform movements only if there was compelling evidence that they were the product of tightly knit circles of users connected to real world violence or other harm and committed to violating Facebook s rules As part of their recently coordinated initiative this included less promotion of the movement s posts within users News Feed as well as not notifying users of new posts from these pages Specific groups that have been highlighted as being affected by Facebook s social harm policy include the Patriot Party previously linked to the Capitol attack as well as a newer German conspiracy group known as Querdenken who had been placed under surveillance by German intelligence after protests it organized repeatedly resulted in violence and injuries to the police br br br Facebook s AI concern br According to The Wall Street Journal documents show that in Facebook reduced the time spent by human reviewers on hate speech complaints shifting towards a stronger dependence on their artificial intelligence systems to regulate the matter However internal documents from employees claim that their AI has been largely unsuccessful seeing trouble detecting videos of cars
