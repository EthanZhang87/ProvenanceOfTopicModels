as a walled garden community and service provider AOL received criticism for its community policies terms of service and customer service Prior to AOL was known for its direct mailing of CD ROMs and inch floppy disks containing its software The disks were distributed in large numbers at one point half of the CDs manufactured worldwide had AOL logos on them The marketing tactic was criticized for its environmental cost and AOL CDs were recognized as PC World s most annoying tech product br br br Community leaders br AOL used a system of volunteers to moderate its chat rooms forums and user communities The program dated back to AOL s early days when it charged by the hour for access and one of its highest billing services was chat AOL provided free access to community leaders in exchange for moderating the chat rooms and this effectively made chat very cheap to operate and more lucrative than AOL s other services of the era There were community leaders in All community leaders received hours of training and underwent a probationary period While most community leaders moderated chat rooms some ran AOL communities and controlled their layout and design with as much as of AOL s content being created or overseen by community managers until br By ISPs were beginning to charge flat rates for unlimited access which they could do at a profit because they only provided internet access Even though AOL would lose money with such a pricing scheme it was forced by market conditions to offer unlimited access in October In order to return to profitability AOL rapidly shifted its focus from content creation to advertising resulting in less of a need to carefully moderate every forum and chat room to keep users willing to pay by the minute to remain connected br After unlimited access AOL considered scrapping the program entirely but continued it with a reduced number of community leaders with scaled back roles in creating content Although community leaders continued to receive free access after they were motivated more by the prestige of the position and the access to moderator tools and restricted areas within AOL By there were over volunteers in the program br In May two former volunteers filed a class action lawsuit alleging AOL violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by treating volunteers like employees Volunteers had to apply for the position commit to working for at least three to four hours a week fill out timecards and sign a non disclosure agreement On July AOL ended its youth corps which consisted of underage community leaders At this time the United States Department of Labor began an investigation into the program but it came to no conclusions about AOL s practices br AOL ended its community leader program on June The class action lawsuit dragged on for years even after AOL ended the program and AOL declined as a major internet company In AOL finally agreed to settle the lawsuit for million The community leader program was found to be an example of co production in a article in International Journal of Cultural Studies br br br Billing disputes br AOL has faced a number of lawsuits over claims that it has been slow to stop billing customers after their accounts have been canceled either by the company or the user In addition AOL changed its method of calculating used minutes in response to a class action lawsuit Previously AOL would add seconds to the time a user was connected to the service and round up to the next whole minute thus a person who used the service for minutes and seconds would be charged for minutes AOL claimed this was to account for sign on sign off time but because this practice was not made known to its customers the plaintiffs won some also pointed out that signing on and off did not always take seconds especially when connecting via another ISP AOL disclosed its connection time calculation methods to all of its customers and credited them with extra free hours In addition the AOL software would notify the user of exactly how long they were connected and how many minutes they were being charged br AOL was sued by the Ohio Attorney General in October for improper billing practices The case was settled on June AOL agreed to resolve any consumer complaints filed with the Ohio AG s office In December AOL agreed to provide restitution to Florida consumers to settle the case filed against them by the Florida Attorney General br br br Account cancellation br Many customers complained that AOL personnel ignored their demands to cancel service and stop billing In response to approximately consumer complaints the New York Attorney General s office began an inquiry of AOL s customer service policies The investigation revealed that the company had an elaborate scheme for rewarding employees who purported to retain or save subscribers who had called to cancel their Internet service In many instances such retention was done against subscribers wishes or without their consent Under the scheme customer service personnel received bonuses worth tens of thousands of dollars if they could successfully dissuade or save half of the people who called to cancel service For several years AOL had instituted minimum retention or save percentages which consumer representatives were expected to meet These bonuses and the minimum save rates accompanying them had the effect of employees not honoring cancellations or otherwise making cancellation unduly difficult for consumers br On August America Online agreed to pay million to the state of New York and reformed its customer service procedures Under the agreement AOL would no longer require its customer service representatives to meet a minimum quota for customer retention in order to receive a bonus However the agreement only covered people in the state of New York br On June Vincent Ferrari documented his account cancellation phone call in a blog post stating he had switched to broadband years earlier In the recorded phone call the AOL representative refused to cancel the account unless the year old Ferrari explained why AOL hours were still being recorded on it Ferrari insisted that AOL software was not even installed on the computer When Ferrari demanded that the account be canceled regardless the AOL representative asked to speak with Ferrari s father for whom the account had been set up The conversation was aired on CNBC When CNBC reporters tried to have an account on AOL cancelled they were hung up on immediately and it ultimately took more than minutes to cancel the account br On July AOL s entire retention manual was released on the Internet On August Time Warner announced that the company would be dissolving AOL s retention centers due to its profits hinging on billion in cost cuts The company estimated that it would lose more than six million subscribers over the following year br br br Direct marketing of disks br br Prior to AOL often sent unsolicited mass direct mail of floppy disks and CD ROMs containing their software They were the most frequent user of this marketing tactic and received criticism for the environmental cost of the campaign According to PC World in the s you couldn t open a magazine PC World included or your mailbox without an AOL disk falling out of it br The mass distribution of these disks was seen as wasteful by the public and led to protest groups One such was No More AOL CDs a web based effort by two IT workers to collect one million disks with the intent to return the disks to AOL The website was started in August and an estimated CDs were collected by August when the project was shut down br br br Software br In AOL was served with an billion lawsuit alleging that its AOL software caused significant difficulties for users attempting to use third party Internet service providers The lawsuit sought damages of up to for each user that had downloaded the software cited at the time of the lawsuit AOL later agreed to a settlement of million without admission of wrongdoing The AOL software then was given a feature called AOL Dialer or AOL Connect on Mac OS X This feature allowed users to connect to the ISP without running the full interface This allowed users to use only the applications they wish to use especially if they do not favor the AOL Browser br AOL was once identified by Stopbadware as being under investigation for installing additional software without disclosure and modifying browser preferences toolbars and icons However as of the release of AOL VR Vista Ready on January it was no longer considered badware due to changes AOL made in the software br br br Usenet newsgroups br When AOL gave clients access to Usenet in they hid at least one newsgroup in standard list view alt aol sucks AOL did list the newsgroup in the alternative description view but changed the description to Flames and complaints about America Online With AOL clients swarming Usenet newsgroups the old existing user base started to develop a strong distaste for both AOL and its clients referring to the new state of affairs as Eternal September br AOL discontinued access to Usenet on June No official details were provided as to the cause of decommissioning Usenet access except providing users the suggestion to access Usenet services from a third party Google Groups AOL then provided community based message boards in lieu of Usenet br br br Terms of Service TOS br AOL has a detailed set of guidelines and expectations for users on their service known as the Terms of Service TOS also known as Conditions of Service or COS in the UK It is separated into three different sections Member Agreement Community Guidelines and Privacy Policy All three agreements are presented to users at time of registration and digital acceptance is achieved when they access the AOL service During the period when volunteer chat room hosts and board monitors were used chat room hosts were given a brief online training session and test on Terms of Service violations br There have been many complaints over rules that govern an AOL user s conduct Some users disagree with the TOS citing the guidelines are too strict to follow coupled with the fact the TOS may change without users being made aware A considerable cause for this was likely due to alleged censorship of user generated content during the earlier years of growth for AOL br br br Certified email br In early AOL stated its intention to implement a certified email system called Goodmail which will allow companies to send email to users with whom they have pre existing business relationships with a visual indication that the email is from a trusted source and without the risk that the email messages might be blocked or stripped by spam filters br This decision drew fire from MoveOn which characterized the program as an email tax and the Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF which characterized it as a shakedown of non profits A website called Dearaol com was launched with an online petition and a blog that garnered hundreds of signatures from people and organizations expressing their opposition to AOL s use of Goodmail br Esther Dyson defended the move in an editorial in The New York Times saying I hope Goodmail succeeds and that it has lots of competition I also think it and its competitors will eventually transform into services that more directly serve the interests of mail recipients Instead of the fees going to Goodmail and AOL they will also be shared with the individual recipients br Tim Lee of the Technology Liberation Front posted an article that questioned the Electronic Frontier Foundation s adopting a confrontational posture when dealing with private companies Lee s article cited a series of discussions on Declan McCullagh s Politechbot mailing list on this subject between the EFF s Danny O Brien and antispammer Suresh Ramasubramanian who has also compared the EFF s tactics in opposing Goodmail to tactics used by Republican political strategist Karl Rove SpamAssassin developer Justin Mason posted some criticism of the EFF s and Moveon s going overboard in their opposition to the scheme br The dearaol com campaign lost momentum and disappeared with the last post to the now defunct dearaol com blog AOL starts the shakedown being made on May br Comcast who also used the service announced on its website that Goodmail had ceased operations and as of February they no longer used the service br br br Search data br br On August AOL released a compressed text file on one of its websites containing million search keywords for over users over a three month period between March and May intended for research purposes AOL pulled the file from public access by August but not before its wide distribution on the Internet by others Derivative research titled A Picture of Search was published by authors Pass Chowdhury and Torgeson for The First International Conference on Scalable Information Systems br The data were used by websites such as AOLstalker for entertainment purposes where users of AOLstalker are encouraged to judge AOL clients based on the humorousness of personal details revealed by search behavior br br br User list exposure br In Jason Smathers an AOL employee was convicted of stealing America Online s million screen names and selling them to a known spammer Smathers pled guilty to conspiracy charges in Smathers pled guilty to violations of the US CAN SPAM Act of He was sentenced in August to months in prison the sentencing judge also recommended Smathers be forced to pay in restitution triple the that he sold the addresses for br br br AOL s Computer Checkup scareware br On February a class action lawsuit was filed against Support com Inc and partner AOL Inc The lawsuit alleged Support com and AOL s Computer Checkup scareware which uses software developed by Support com misrepresented that their software programs would identify and resolve a host of technical problems with computers offered to perform a free scan which often found problems with users computers The companies then offered to sell software for which AOL allegedly charged a month and Support com to remedy those problems Both AOL Inc and Support com Inc settled on May for million This included to each valid class member and each to Consumer Watchdog and the Electronic Frontier
