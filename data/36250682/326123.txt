id: 326123
Windows is a major release of the Windows NT operating system developed by Microsoft It was released to manufacturing on July and became generally available on October It is the successor to Windows Vista released nearly three years earlier Windows s server counterpart Windows Server R was released at the same time It was succeeded by Windows in October br Extended support ended on January over ten years after the release of Windows after which the operating system ceased receiving further updates A paid support program was available for enterprises providing security updates for Windows for up to three years since the official end of life br Windows was intended to be an incremental upgrade to Microsoft Windows addressing Windows Vista s poor critical reception while maintaining hardware and software compatibility Windows continued improvements on the Windows Aero user interface with the addition of a redesigned taskbar that allows pinned applications and new window management features Other new features were added to the operating system including libraries the new file sharing system HomeGroup and support for multitouch input A new Action Center was also added to provide an overview of system security and maintenance information and tweaks were made to the User Account Control system to make it less intrusive Windows also shipped with updated versions of several stock applications including Internet Explorer Windows Media Player and Windows Media Center br Unlike Windows Vista Windows received critical acclaim with critics considering the operating system to be a major improvement over its predecessor because of its improved performance its more intuitive interface fewer User Account Control popups and other improvements made across the platform Windows was a major success for Microsoft even before its official release pre order sales for the operating system on the online retailer Amazon com had surpassed previous records In just six months over million copies had been sold worldwide increasing to over million licenses by July By January Windows surpassed Windows as the most popular version of Windows worldwide As of just of traditional PCs running Windows are running Windows Windows overtook Windows as the second most popular Windows version on all continents in August Windows remains relatively popular in some countries as of e g China where Windows has tied it and is second most popular in some countries br Windows is the final version of Windows that supports processors without SSE or NX although an update released in dropped support for non SSE processors Its successor Windows requires a processor with SSE and NX for any then supported architecture br br br Naming br Windows is the successor to Windows Vista and its version name is Windows NT compared to Vista s NT its naming caused some confusion when it was announced in Windows president Steven Sinofsky commented that Windows was the fourth version of Windows but Windows counts up from Windows NT as it is a descendant of NT br br br Development history br Originally a version of Windows codenamed Blackcomb was planned as the successor to Windows XP and Windows Server in Major features were planned for Blackcomb including an emphasis on searching and querying data and an advanced storage system named WinFS to enable such scenarios However an interim minor release codenamed Longhorn was announced for delaying the development of Blackcomb By the middle of however Longhorn had acquired some of the features originally intended for Blackcomb After three major malware outbreaks the Blaster Nachi and Sobig worms exploited flaws in Windows operating systems within a short time period in August Microsoft changed its development priorities putting some of Longhorn s major development work on hold while developing new service packs for Windows XP and Windows Server Development of Longhorn Windows Vista was also restarted and thus delayed in August A number of features were cut from Longhorn Blackcomb was renamed Vienna in early and was later canceled in due to the scope of the project br When released Windows Vista was criticized for its long development time performance issues spotty compatibility with existing hardware and software at launch changes affecting the compatibility of certain PC games and unclear assurances by Microsoft that certain computers shipping with XP before launch would be Vista Capable which led to a class action lawsuit among other critiques As such the adoption of Vista in comparison to XP remained somewhat low In July following the shelving of the Vienna project and six months following the public release of Vista it was reported that the next version of Windows would then be codenamed Windows with plans for a final release within three years Bill Gates in an interview with Newsweek suggested that Windows would be more user centric Gates later said that Windows would also focus on performance improvements Steven Sinofsky later expanded on this point explaining in the Engineering Windows blog that the company was using a variety of new tracing tools to measure the performance of many areas of the operating system on an ongoing basis to help locate inefficient code paths and to help prevent performance regressions Senior Vice President Bill Veghte stated that Windows Vista users migrating to Windows would not find the kind of device compatibility issues they encountered migrating from Windows XP An estimated developers worked on Windows These were broadly divided into core operating system and Windows client experience in turn organized into teams of around developers on average br In October it was announced that Windows would also be the official name of the operating system There had been some confusion over naming the product Windows while versioning it as to indicate its similar build to Windows Vista and increase compatibility with applications that only check major version numbers similar to Windows and Windows XP both having x version numbers The first external release to select Microsoft partners came in January with Milestone build Speaking about Windows on October Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer confirmed compatibility between Windows Vista and Windows indicating that Windows would be a refined version of Windows Vista br At PDC Microsoft demonstrated Windows with its reworked taskbar On December the Windows Beta was leaked onto the Internet via BitTorrent According to a performance test by ZDNet Windows Beta beat both Windows XP and Windows Vista in several key areas including boot and shutdown time and working with files such as loading documents Other areas did not beat XP including PC Pro benchmarks for typical office activities and video editing which remain identical to Vista and slower than XP On January the x version of the Windows Beta build was leaked onto the web with some torrents being infected with a trojan At CES Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer announced the Windows Beta build had been made available for download to MSDN and TechNet subscribers in the format of an ISO image The stock wallpaper of the beta version contained a digital image of the Betta fish br The release candidate build became available for MSDN and TechNet subscribers and Connect Program participants on April On May it became available to the general public although it had also been leaked onto the Internet via BitTorrent The release candidate was available in five languages and expired on June with shutdowns every two hours starting March Microsoft stated that Windows would be released to the general public on October less than three years after the launch of its predecessor Microsoft released Windows to MSDN and Technet subscribers on August Microsoft announced that Windows along with Windows Server R was released to manufacturing in the United States and Canada on July Windows build which was compiled on July was declared the final RTM build after passing all Microsoft s tests internally br br br Features br br br New and changed br br Among Windows s new features are advances in touch and handwriting recognition support for virtual hard disks improved performance on multi core processors improved boot performance DirectAccess and kernel improvements Windows adds support for systems using multiple heterogeneous graphics cards from different vendors Heterogeneous Multi adapter a new version of Windows Media Center a Gadget for Windows Media Center improved media features XPS Essentials Pack and Windows PowerShell being included and a redesigned Calculator with multiline capabilities including Programmer and Statistics modes along with unit conversion for length weight temperature and several others Many new items have been added to the Control Panel including ClearType Text Tuner Display Color Calibration Wizard Gadgets Recovery Troubleshooting Workspaces Center Location and Other Sensors Credential Manager Biometric Devices System Icons and Display Windows Security Center has been renamed to Windows Action Center Windows Health Center and Windows Solution Center in earlier builds which encompasses both security and maintenance of the computer ReadyBoost on bit editions now supports up to gigabytes of extra allocation Windows also supports images in RAW image format through the addition of Windows Imaging Component enabled image decoders which enables raw image thumbnails previewing and metadata display in Windows Explorer plus full size viewing and slideshows in Windows Photo Viewer and Windows Media Center Windows also has a native TFTP client with the ability to transfer files to or from a TFTP server br br The taskbar has seen the biggest visual changes where the old Quick Launch toolbar has been replaced with the ability to pin applications to the taskbar Buttons for pinned applications are integrated with the task buttons These buttons also enable Jump Lists to allow easy access to common tasks and files frequently used with specific applications The revamped taskbar also allows the reordering of taskbar buttons To the far right of the system clock is a small rectangular button that serves as the Show desktop icon By default hovering over this button makes all visible windows transparent for a quick look at the desktop In touch enabled displays such as touch screens tablet PCs etc this button is slightly pixels wider in order to accommodate being pressed by a finger Clicking this button minimizes all windows and clicking it a second time restores them br Window management in Windows has several new features Aero Snap maximizes a window when it is dragged to the top left or right of the screen Dragging windows to the left or right edges of the screen allows users to snap software windows to either side of the screen such that the windows take up half the screen When a user moves windows that were snapped or maximized using Snap the system restores their previous state Snap functions can also be triggered with keyboard shortcuts Aero Shake hides all inactive windows when the active window s title bar is dragged back and forth rapidly br br Windows includes additional sound schemes titled Afternoon Calligraphy Characters Cityscape Delta Festival Garden Heritage Landscape Quirky Raga Savanna and Sonata Internet Spades Internet Backgammon and Internet Checkers which were removed in Windows Vista were restored in Windows Users are able to disable or customize many more Windows components than was possible in Windows Vista New additions to this list of components include Internet Explorer Windows Media Player Windows Media Center Windows Search and Windows Gadget Platform A new version of Microsoft Virtual PC newly renamed as Windows Virtual PC was made available for Windows Professional Enterprise and Ultimate editions It allows multiple Windows environments including Windows XP Mode to run on the same machine Windows XP Mode runs Windows XP in a virtual machine and displays applications within separate windows on the Windows desktop Furthermore Windows supports the mounting of a virtual hard disk VHD as a normal data storage and the bootloader delivered with Windows can boot the Windows system from a VHD however this ability is only available in the Enterprise and Ultimate editions The Remote Desktop Protocol RDP of Windows is also enhanced to support real time multimedia application including video playback and D games thus allowing use of DirectX in remote desktop environments The three application limit previously present in the Windows Vista and Windows XP Starter Editions has been removed from Windows All editions include some new and improved features such as Windows Search Security features and some features new to Windows that originated within Vista Optional BitLocker Drive Encryption is included with Windows Ultimate and Enterprise Windows Defender is included Microsoft Security Essentials antivirus software is a free download All editions include Shadow Copy which every day or so System Restore uses to take an automatic previous version snapshot of user files that have changed Backup and restore have also been improved and the Windows Recovery Environment installed by default replaces the optional Recovery Console of Windows XP br A new system known as Libraries was added for file management users can aggregate files from multiple folders into a Library By default libraries for categories such as Documents Pictures Music and Video are created consisting of the user s personal folder and the Public folder for each The system is also used as part of a new home networking system known as HomeGroup devices are added to the network with a password and files and folders can be shared with all other devices in the HomeGroup or with specific users The default libraries along with printers are shared by default but the personal folder is set to read only access by other users and the Public folder can be accessed by anyone br Windows includes improved globalization support through a new Extended Linguistic Services API to provide multilingual support particularly in Ultimate and Enterprise editions Microsoft also implemented better support for solid state drives including the new TRIM command and Windows is able to identify a solid state drive uniquely Native support for USB is not included because of delays in the finalization of the standard At WinHEC Microsoft announced that color depths of bit and bit would be supported in Windows along with the wide color gamut scRGB which for HDMI can be converted and output as xvYCC The video modes supported in Windows are bit sRGB bit sRGB bit sRGB bit with extended color gamut sRGB and bit scRGB br For developers Windows includes a new networking API with support for building SOAP based web services in native code as opposed to NET based WCF web services new features to simplify development of installation packages and shorten application install times Windows by default generates fewer User Account Control UAC prompts because it allows digitally signed Windows components to gain elevated privileges without a prompt Additionally users can now adjust the level at which UAC operates using a sliding scale br br br Removed br br Certain capabilities and programs that were a part of Windows Vista are no longer present or have been changed resulting in the removal of certain functionalities these include the classic Start Menu user interface some taskbar features Windows Explorer features Windows Media Player features Windows Ultimate Extras Search button and InkBall Four applications bundled with Windows Vista Windows Photo Gallery Windows Movie Maker Windows Calendar and Windows Mail are not included with Windows and were replaced by Windows Live branded versions as part of the Windows Live Essentials suite br br br Editions br br Windows is available in six different editions of which the Home Premium Professional and Ultimate were available at retail in most countries and as pre loaded software on most new computers Home Premium and Professional were aimed at home users and small businesses respectively while Ultimate was aimed at enthusiasts Each edition of Windows includes all of the capabilities and features of the edition below it and adds additional features oriented towards their market segments for example Professional adds additional networking and security features such as Encrypting File System and the ability to join a domain Ultimate contained a superset of the features from Home Premium and Professional along with other advanced features oriented towards power users such as BitLocker drive encryption unlike Windows Vista there were no Ultimate Extras add ons created for Windows Ultimate Retail copies were available in upgrade and higher cost full version licenses upgrade licenses require an existing version of Windows to install while full licenses can be installed on computers with no existing operating system br The remaining three editions were not available at retail of which two were available exclusively through OEM channels as pre loaded software The Starter edition is a stripped down version of Windows meant for low cost devices such as netbooks In comparison to Home Premium Starter has reduced multimedia functionality does not allow users to change their desktop wallpaper or theme disables the Aero Glass theme does not have support for multiple monitors and can only address GB of RAM Home Basic was sold only in emerging markets and was positioned in between Home Premium and Starter The highest edition Enterprise is functionally similar to Ultimate but is only sold through volume licensing via Microsoft s Software Assurance program br All editions aside from Starter support both IA and x architectures Starter only supports bit systems Retail copies of Windows are distributed on two DVDs one for the IA version and the other for x OEM copies include one DVD depending on the processor architecture licensed The installation media for consumer versions of Windows are identical the product key and corresponding license determines the edition that is installed The Windows Anytime Upgrade service can be used to purchase an upgrade that unlocks the functionality of a higher edition such as going from Starter to Home Premium and Home Premium to Ultimate Most copies of Windows only contained one license in certain markets a Family Pack version of Windows Home Premium was also released for a limited time which allowed upgrades on up to three computers In certain regions copies of Windows were only sold in and could only be activated in a

upgrade or a new computer br In August researchers reported that all modern versions of Microsoft Windows may be at risk for critical system compromise because of design flaws of hardware device drivers from multiple providers In the same month computer experts reported that the BlueKeep security vulnerability CVE that potentially affects older unpatched Microsoft Windows versions via the program s Remote Desktop Protocol allowing for the possibility of remote code execution may now include related flaws collectively named DejaBlue affecting newer Windows versions i e Windows and all recent versions as well In addition experts reported a Microsoft security vulnerability CVE based on legacy code involving Microsoft CTF and ctfmon ctfmon exe that affects all Windows versions from the older Windows XP version to the most recent Windows versions a patch to correct the flaw is currently available br In September Microsoft announced that it would provide free security updates for Windows on federally certified voting machines through the United States elections br br br Extended Security Updates br On September Microsoft announced a paid Extended Security Updates ESU service that will offer additional updates for Windows Professional and Enterprise for up to three years after the end of extended support available via specific volume licensing programs in yearly installments br Windows Professional for Embedded Systems Windows Embedded Standard and Windows Embedded POSReady also get Extended Security Updates for up to three years after their end of extended support date via OEMs The Extended Security Updates program on Windows Embedded POSReady will expire on October which would mark the final end of IA updates on the Windows NT product line after more than years br In August Microsoft announced it would offer a year of free extended security updates to some business users br br br Third party support br In January version of the Chromium based Microsoft Edge became the last version of Edge to support Windows Windows Windows Server and Windows Server R Alongside this several other web browsers based on the Chromium codebase also dropped support for these operating systems after version including Google Chrome and Opera A fork of Chromium named Supermium is maintained for versions of Windows older than Windows including Windows br Steam ended support for Windows and on January br br br Upgradability br Several Windows components are upgradable to the latest versions which include new versions introduced in later versions of Windows and other major Microsoft applications are available These latest versions for Windows include br br Internet Explorer br Microsoft Edge Chromium up to version br Office was the last version of Microsoft Office to support Windows br br br System requirements br br Additional requirements to use certain features br br Windows XP Mode Professional Ultimate and Enterprise Requires an additional GB of RAM and additional GB of available hard disk space The requirement for a processor capable of hardware virtualization has been lifted br Windows Media Center included in Home Premium Professional Ultimate and Enterprise requires a TV tuner to receive and record TV br br br Extent of hardware support br br br Physical memory br The maximum amount of RAM that Windows supports varies depending on the product edition and on the processor architecture as shown in the following table br br br Processor limits br Windows Professional and up support up to physical processors CPU sockets br whereas Windows Starter Home Basic and Home Premium editions support only Physical processors with either multiple cores or hyper threading or both implement more than one logical processor per physical processor The x editions of Windows support up to logical processors x editions support up to x br In January Microsoft announced that it would no longer support Windows platforms older than Windows on any future Intel compatible processor lines citing difficulties in reliably allowing the operating system to operate on newer hardware Microsoft stated that effective July devices with Intel Skylake CPUs were only to receive the most critical updates for Windows and and only if they have been judged not to affect the reliability of Windows on older hardware For enterprise customers Microsoft issued a list of Skylake based devices certified for Windows and in addition to Windows to assist them in migrating to newer hardware that can eventually be upgraded to once they are ready to transition Microsoft and their hardware partners provide special testing and support for these devices on and until the July date br On March in response to criticism from enterprise customers Microsoft delayed the end of support and non critical updates for Skylake systems to July but stated that they would also continue to receive security updates through the end of extended support In August citing a strong partnership with our OEM partners and Intel Microsoft retracted the decision and stated that it would continue to support Windows and on Skylake hardware through the end of their extended support lifecycle However the restrictions on newer CPU microarchitectures remain in force br In March a Microsoft knowledge base article announced which implies that devices using Intel Kaby Lake AMD Bristol Ridge or AMD Ryzen would be blocked from using Windows Update entirely In addition official Windows device drivers are not available for the Kaby Lake and Ryzen platforms br Security updates released since March contained bugs that affect processors that do not support SSE extensions including all Pentium III Athlon XP and prior processors Microsoft initially stated that it would attempt to resolve this issue and prevented installation of the affected patches on these systems However Microsoft retroactively modified its support documents on June to remove the promise that this bug would be resolved replacing it with a statement suggesting that users obtain a newer processor This effectively ends further patch support for Windows on these older systems br br br Updates br br br Service Pack br Windows Service Pack SP was announced on March A beta was released on July The final version was released to the public on February At the time of release it was not made mandatory It was available via Windows Update direct download or by ordering the Windows SP DVD The service pack is on a much smaller scale than those released for previous versions of Windows particularly Windows Vista br Windows Service Pack adds support for Advanced Vector Extensions AVX a bit instruction set extension for processors and improves IKEv by adding additional identification fields such as E mail ID to it In addition it adds support for Advanced Format e as well as additional Identity Federation Services Windows Service Pack also resolves a bug related to HDMI audio and another related to printing XPS documents br In Europe the automatic nature of the BrowserChoice eu feature was dropped in Windows Service Pack in February and remained absent for

Management Instrumentation WMI It was released on February and was eventually superseded by Windows Management Framework br br br Convenience rollup br In May Microsoft released a Convenience rollup update for Windows SP and Windows Server R SP which contains all patches released between the release of SP and April The rollup is not available via Windows Update and must be downloaded manually This package can also be integrated into a Windows installation image br Since October all security and reliability updates are cumulative Downloading and installing updates that address individual problems is no longer possible but the number of updates that must be downloaded to fully update the OS is significantly reduced br br br Monthly update rollups July January br In June Microsoft announced that Windows would be moved to a monthly update model beginning with updates released in September two years after Microsoft switched the rest of their supported operating systems to that model With the new update model instead of updates being released as they became available only two update packages were released on the second Tuesday of every month until Windows reached its end of life one package containing security and quality updates and a smaller package that contained only the security updates Users could choose which package they wanted to install each month Later in the month another package would be released which was a preview of the next month s security and quality update rollup br Microsoft announced in July that the Microsoft Internet Games services on Windows XP and Windows Me would end on July and for Windows on January br The last non extended security update rollup packages were released on January the last day that Windows had extended support br br br End of support after January br On January Windows support ended with Microsoft no longer providing security updates or fixes after that date except for subscribers of the Windows Extended Security

Microsoft quietly added in Secure Boot support along with partial UEFI support br br br Reception br br br Critical reception br Windows received critical acclaim with critics noting the increased usability and functionality when compared with its predecessor Windows Vista CNET gave Windows Home Premium a rating of out of stars stating that it is more than what Vista should have been and it s where Microsoft needed to go PC Magazine rated it a out of saying that Windows is a big improvement over Windows Vista with fewer compatibility problems a retooled taskbar simpler home networking and faster start up Maximum PC gave Windows a rating of out of and called Windows a massive leap forward in usability and security and praised the new Taskbar as worth the price of admission alone PC World called Windows a worthy successor to Windows XP and said that speed benchmarks showed Windows to be slightly faster than Windows Vista PC World also named Windows one of the best products of the year br In its review of Windows Engadget said that Microsoft had taken a strong step forward with Windows and reported that speed is one of Windows s major selling points particularly for the netbook sets Laptop Magazine gave Windows a rating of out of stars and said that Windows makes computing more intuitive offered better overall performance including a modest to dramatic increase in battery life on laptop computers TechRadar gave Windows a rating of out of stars concluding that it combines the security and architectural improvements of Windows Vista with better performance than XP can deliver on today s hardware No version of Windows is ever perfect but Windows really is the best release of Windows yet USA Today and The Telegraph also gave Windows favorable reviews br Nick Wingfield of The Wall Street Journal wrote Visually arresting and A pleasure Mary Branscombe of Financial Times wrote A clear leap forward of Gizmodo wrote Windows Kills Snow Leopard Don Reisinger of CNET wrote Delightful David Pogue of The New York Times wrote Faster J Peter Bruzzese and Richi Jennings of Computerworld wrote Ready br Some Windows Vista Ultimate users have expressed concerns over Windows pricing and upgrade options Windows Vista Ultimate users wanting to upgrade from Windows Vista to Windows had to either pay to upgrade to Windows Ultimate or perform a clean install which requires them to reinstall all of their programs br The changes to User Account Control on Windows were criticized for being potentially insecure as an exploit was discovered allowing untrusted software to be launched with elevated privileges by exploiting a trusted component Peter Bright of Ars Technica argued that the way that the Windows UAC improvements have been made completely exempts Microsoft s developers from having to do that work themselves With Windows it s one rule for Redmond another one for everyone else Microsoft s Windows kernel engineer Mark Russinovich acknowledged the problem but noted that malware can also compromise a system when users agree to a prompt br br br Sales br In July in only eight hours pre orders of Windows at amazon co uk surpassed the demand which Windows Vista had in its first weeks It became the highest grossing pre order in Amazon s history surpassing sales of the previous record holder the seventh Harry Potter book After hours bit versions of Windows Professional and Ultimate editions sold out in Japan Two weeks after its release its market share had surpassed that of Snow Leopard released two months previously as the most recent update to Apple s Mac OS X operating system According to Net Applications Windows reached a market share in less than three weeks in comparison it took Windows Vista seven months to reach the same mark As of February Windows had a market share of according to Net Applications in comparison Windows XP had a market share of br On March Microsoft announced that it had sold more than million licenses br By April more than million copies were sold in six months which made it Microsoft s fastest selling operating system As of June Windows has sold million copies which made it the fastest selling operating system in history with seven copies sold every second Based on worldwide data taken during June from Windows Update of Windows PCs run the bit edition of Windows According to Stephen Baker of the NPD Group during April in the United States of PCs sold at retail were pre installed with the bit edition of Windows As of July Windows had sold million copies On October Microsoft announced that more than million copies of Windows had been sold Three months later on January Microsoft announced total sales of million copies of Windows On July the sales figure was refined to over million end user licenses and business installations As of July over million licenses have been sold this number includes licenses sold to OEMs for new PCs br br br Antitrust concerns br As with other Microsoft operating systems Windows was studied by United States federal regulators who oversee the company s operations following the United States v Microsoft Corp settlement According to status reports filed the three member panel began assessing prototypes of the new operating system in February Michael Gartenberg an analyst at Jupiter Research said Microsoft s challenge for Windows will be how can they continue to add features that consumers will want that also don t run afoul of regulators br In order to comply with European antitrust regulations Microsoft proposed the use of a ballot screen containing download links to competing web browsers thus removing the need for a version of Windows completely without Internet Explorer as previously planned Microsoft announced that it would discard the separate version for Europe and ship the standard upgrade and full packages worldwide in response to criticism involving Windows E and concerns from manufacturers about possible consumer confusion if a version of Windows with Internet Explorer were shipped later after one without Internet Explorer br As with the previous version of Windows an N version which does not come with Windows Media Player has been released in Europe but only for sale directly from Microsoft sales websites and selected others br br br See also br BlueKeep a security vulnerability discovered in May that affected
