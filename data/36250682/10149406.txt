Criticism br The legality of ridesharing companies by jurisdiction varies in some areas they are considered to be illegal taxicab operations br br br Criticism from taxi companies and taxi drivers br Values of taxi medallions transferable permits or licenses authorizing the holder to pick up passengers for hire have declined in value significantly In this led to failures by credit unions that lent

companies have classified drivers as independent contractors and not employees under employment law arguing that they receive certain flexibilities not generally received by employees This affects taxation working time employee benefits unemployment benefits and overtime benefits and has been challenged legally br Jurisdictions in which drivers must receive the classification of employees include the United Kingdom after the case of Aslam v Uber BV which was decided by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom Switzerland New Jersey and the Netherlands California Assembly Bill was passed to force drivers to be classified as employees in California although ridesharing companies received an exemption by California Proposition a ballot initiative Ridesharing companies spent tens of millions of dollars on the campaign br br br Compliance with minimum wage laws br Some drivers earn rates that are below minimum wage as a result in some jurisdictions laws were passed to guarantee drivers a minimum wage before and after expenses br br br Safety issues br Crimes have been committed by rideshare drivers as well as by individuals posing as rideshare drivers who lure unsuspecting passengers to their vehicles by placing an emblem on their car or by claiming to be a passenger s expected driver The latter led to the murder of Samantha Josephson and the introduction of Sami s Law Ridesharing companies have been accused of not taking necessary measures to prevent sexual assault They have been fined by government agencies for violations in their background check processes In more than women sued Lyft in the United States alleging that they were raped or assaulted by Lyft drivers and that the company did not do enough to keep them safe and that Lyft attracts drivers that plan to prey on vulnerable women Many women claim that even after they reported their assault to Lyft the company ignored their report and continued to allow the assailants to drive with Lyft br Ridesharing has also been criticized for encouraging or requiring phone use while driving To accept a fare some apps require drivers to tap their phone screen usually within seconds after receiving a notification which is illegal in some jurisdictions since it could result in distracted driving br Ridesharing vehicles in many cities routinely obstruct bicycle lanes while picking up or dropping off passengers a practice that endangers cyclists br br br Price fixing allegations br In the United States drivers do not have any control over the fares they charge A lawsuit filed in California Gill et

criticized for providing inadequate accessibility measures for disabled people in violation of local laws br In some areas vehicle for hire companies are required by law to have a certain amount of wheelchair accessible vans WAVs in use However most drivers do not own a WAV making it hard to comply with the laws br While ridesharing companies require drivers to transport service animals drivers have been criticized for refusal to transport service animals which in the United States is in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act In an arbitrator awarded million to a visually impaired passenger who travels with a guide dog because she was denied rides separate times br br br Bias against passengers in certain demographic groups br Complaints that drivers have not accepted ride requests from passengers in certain demographic groups has led some ridesharing companies to hide passenger identities until the ride request is accepted by the driver A study in Washington D C found that drivers cancelled ride requests from African Americans and LGBT and straight ally passengers indicated by a rainbow flag more often but cancelled at the same rate for women and men The higher cancellation rate for African American passengers was somewhat attenuated at peak times when financial incentives were higher br br br Traffic congestion br Studies have shown that especially in cities where it competes with public transport ridesharing contributes to traffic congestion reduces public transport use has no substantial impact on vehicle ownership and increases automobile dependency br Dead mileage specifically causes unnecessary carbon emissions and traffic congestion A study published in September found that taxis had lower rider waiting time and vehicle empty driving time and thus contribute less to congestion and pollution in downtown areas However a report noted that ridesharing complements public transit A study published in July found that Uber and Lyft are creating more traffic and congestion A study published in March found that in Los Angeles and Seattle the passenger occupancy for Uber services is higher than that of taxi services and concluded that Uber rides reduce congestion on the premise that they replace taxi rides Studies citing data from to found that Uber rides are made in addition to taxi rides and replace walking bike rides and bus rides in addition to the Uber vehicles having a low average occupancy rate all of which increases congestion This increase in congestion has led some cities to levy taxes on rides taken with ridesharing companies Another study shows that the surge factor pricing mechanism used for ridehailing services are informative for predicting taxi bookings as well and that taxis incorporating this relative price can improve allocative efficiency and demand prediction br A study published in July indicated that the increase in traffic caused by Uber generates collective costs in lost time in congestion increased pollution and increased accident risks that can exceed the economy and revenue generated by the service indicating that in certain conditions Uber might have a social cost that is greater than its benefits br br br Unwanted text messages br In November Lyft settled a class action suit filed in alleging that the company had sent large numbers of unwanted commercial text messages In addition to million in payments to consumers the plaintiffs sought million in legal fees br br br See also br Ride sharing privacy br br br br br br External links br br Official website
