taxicab businesses and allegedly caused an increase in traffic congestion Ridesharing companies are regulated in many jurisdictions and the Uber platform is not available in several countries where the company is not able or willing to comply with local regulations Controversies involving Uber include various unethical practices such as aggressive lobbying and ignoring and evading local regulations Many of these were revealed by a leak of documents showing controversial activity between and under the leadership of Travis Kalanick br br br Ignoring and evading local regulations br Uber has been criticized for its strategy of generally commencing operations in a city without regard for local regulations If faced with regulatory opposition Uber called for public support for its service and mounted a political campaign supported by lobbying to change regulations Uber argued that it is a technology company and not a taxi company and therefore it was not subject to regulations affecting taxi companies Uber s strategy was generally to seek forgiveness rather than permission In with regards to airport pickups without a permit in California drivers were actually told to ignore local regulations and that the company would pay for any citations Uber s response to California Assembly Bill whereby it announced that it would not comply with the law then engaged lobbyists and mounted an expensive public opinion campaign to overturn it via a ballot was cited as an example of this policy br More than Uber documents covering the five year period from to when Uber was run by its co founder Travis Kalanick were leaked by Mark MacGann a lobbyist who led Uber s efforts to win over governments across Europe the Middle East and Africa to The Guardian newspaper and first printed on July by its Sunday sister The Observer The documents revealed attempts to lobby Joe Biden Olaf Scholz and George Osborne how Emmanuel Macron secretly aided Uber lobbying in France and use of a kill switch during police raids to conceal data Travis Kalanick dismissed concerns from other executives that sending Uber drivers to a protest in France put them at risk of violence from angry opponents in the taxi industry saying I think it s worth it violence guarantees success br Taxi companies sued Uber in numerous American cities alleging that Uber s policy of violating taxi regulations was a form of unfair competition or a violation of antitrust law Although some courts did find that Uber intentionally violated the taxi rules Uber prevailed in every case including the only case to proceed to trial br In March an investigation by The New York Times revealed that Uber developed a software tool called Greyball to avoid giving rides to known law enforcement officers in areas where its service was illegal such as in Portland Oregon Australia South Korea and China The tool identified government officials using geofencing mining credit card databases identifying devices and searches of social media While at first Uber stated that it only used the tool to identify riders that violated its terms of service after investigations by Portland Oregon and the United States Department of Justice Uber admitted to using the tool to skirt local regulations and promised not to use the tool for that purpose The use of Greyball in London was cited by Transport for London as one of the reasons for its decision not to renew Uber s private hire operator licence in September A January report by Bloomberg News stated that Uber routinely used a panic button system codenamed Ripley that locked powered off and changed passwords on staff computers when those offices were subjected to government raids Uber allegedly used this button at least times from spring until late br br br Traffic congestion br Studies have shown that especially in cities where it competes with public transport ridesharing contributes to traffic congestion reduces public transport use has no substantial impact on vehicle ownership and increases automobile dependency br Dead mileage specifically causes unnecessary carbon emissions and traffic congestion A study published in September found that taxis had lower rider waiting time and vehicle empty driving time and thus contribute less to congestion and pollution in downtown areas However a report noted that ridesharing complements public transit A study published in July found that Uber and Lyft are creating more traffic and congestion A study published in March found that in Los Angeles and Seattle the passenger occupancy for Uber services is higher than that of taxi services and concluded that Uber rides reduce congestion on the premise that they replace taxi rides Studies citing data from to found that Uber rides are made in addition to taxi rides and replace walking bike rides and bus rides in addition to the Uber vehicles having a low average occupancy rate all of which increases congestion This increase in congestion has led some cities to levy taxes on rides taken with ridesharing companies Another study shows that the surge factor pricing mechanism used for ridehailing services are informative for predicting taxi bookings as well and that taxis incorporating this relative price can improve allocative efficiency and demand prediction br A study published in July indicated that the increase in traffic caused by Uber generates collective costs in lost time in congestion increased pollution and increased accident risks that can exceed the economy and revenue generated by the service indicating that in certain conditions Uber might have a social cost that is greater than its benefits br br br Counter intelligence research on class action plaintiffs br In Uber hired the global security consulting firm Ergo to secretly investigate plaintiffs involved in a class action lawsuit Ergo operatives posed as acquaintances of the plaintiff s counsel and tried to contact their associates to obtain information that could be used against them The result of which was found out causing the judge to throw out evidence obtained as obtained in a fraudulent manner br br br Sexual harassment allegations and management shakeup br On February former Uber engineer Susan Fowler published on her website that she was propositioned for sex by a manager and subsequently threatened with termination of employment by another manager if she continued to report the incident Kalanick was allegedly aware of the complaint On February Amit Singhal Uber s Senior Vice President of Engineering was forced to resign after he failed to disclose a sexual harassment claim against him that occurred while he served as Vice President of Google Search After investigations led by former attorney general Eric Holder and Arianna Huffington a member of Uber s board of directors in June Uber fired over employees Kalanick took an indefinite leave of absence but under pressure from investors he resigned as CEO a week later Also departing the company in June was Emil Michael a senior vice president who suggested that Uber hire a team of opposition researchers and journalists with a million dollar budget to dig up dirt on the personal lives and backgrounds of journalists who reported negatively on Uber specifically targeting Sarah Lacy editor of PandoDaily who in an article published in

employees and former employees receiving each and of those employees and former employees receiving an additional each In December Kalanick resigned from the board of directors of the company and sold his shares br br br Delayed disclosure of data breaches br On February Uber admitted that it had suffered a data breach more than nine months prior Names and license plate information from approximately drivers were inadvertently disclosed Uber discovered this leak in September but waited more than five months to notify the affected individuals br An announcement in November revealed that in a separate data breach had disclosed the personal information of drivers and million customers This data included names email addresses phone numbers and drivers license information Hackers used employees usernames and passwords that had been compromised in previous breaches a credential stuffing method to gain access to a private GitHub repository used by Uber s developers The hackers located credentials for the company s Amazon Web Services datastore in the repository files and were able to obtain access to the account records of users and drivers as well as other data contained in over Amazon S buckets Uber paid a ransom to the hackers on the promise they would delete the stolen data Uber was subsequently criticized for concealing this data breach Dara Khosrowshahi publicly apologized In September in the largest multi state settlement of a data breach Uber paid million to the Federal Trade Commission and admitted that internal access to consumers personal information was closely monitored on an ongoing basis was false and stated that it had failed to live up to its promise to provide reasonable security for consumer data In November Uber s British divisions were fined reduced to by the Information Commissioner s Office br In the US Department of Justice announced criminal charges against former Chief Security Officer Joe Sullivan for obstruction of justice The criminal complaint said Joe Sullivan arranged with Travis Kalanick s knowledge to pay a ransom for the breach as a bug bounty to conceal its true nature and for the hackers to falsify non disclosure agreements to say they had not obtained any data br br br Privacy br In July Uber received a five star privacy rating from the Electronic Frontier Foundation but was harshly criticized by the group in September for a controversial policy of tracking customers locations even after a ride ended forcing the company to reverse its policy br In January Uber was fined million euros million by the Dutch data protection authority for violating privacy regulations pertaining to the personal data of its drivers The authority determined that Uber had failed to provide clear information in its terms and conditions regarding the duration for which it retained drivers personal data as well as the measures taken to secure this data when transmitting it to undisclosed entities outside the European
