Release br The Quest was first released in two SKUs differentiated by storage capacity with a GB model priced at US and a GB model replacing the original Quest s GB model priced at both were cheaper than their equivalent SKUs for the first generation Quest In the GB model of the Quest was replaced by a GB model at the same price point br In November as part of the rebranding of Facebook Inc as Meta the Oculus brand began to be phased out the Oculus Quest began to be referred to Meta Quest in promotional materials Oculus Store was rebranded as Quest Store and Oculus developed community platforms such as Facebook Horizon took on the Horizon brand In March system software version replaced all instances of the Oculus logo with that of Meta and by April newer production runs of the Quest hardware with Meta Quest branding had begun to appear at retail br Meta aired a commercial for the Quest and Horizon Worlds Old Friends New Fun during Super Bowl LVI in February br In July citing increased production costs and to enable us to continue investing in ways that will keep driving this increasingly competitive industry forward for consumers and developers alike it was announced that the prices of all current Meta Quest SKUs would be increased by US beginning in August It was concurrently announced that Beat Saber would also be bundled with the headset through the end of the year as a promotional offer The GB model was later reduced in price to US in March br With the announcement of the upcoming Meta Quest in June which was released at a US price point for its base GB model the GB model was reduced back to US and the GB model was reduced to US Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth has stated that the company will continue to support the Quest for quite a while By July Meta had begun to quietly phase out retail sales of the Quest amid the upcoming launch of a new entry level model that would be based on the Quest br br br Accessories br Facebook presented an Elite Strap accessory which contains a ring like pad for the back of the head and a tightness dial along with a variant with a battery pack built into the strap Facebook also promoted Logitech headphones certified for Quest including the G VR the company s first in ear headphones which have shortened cables designed for use with VR headsets br In addition Facebook partnered with Logitech to support their K keyboard as part of the Infinite Office feature allowing the keyboard to be detected and displayed within a virtual reality environment br In October Meta unveiled new Touch Pro controllers for the Meta Quest Pro which are also available as an optional accessory for existing Quest headsets These controllers have a more compact design replace the infrared tracking rings with cameras for on board inside out tracking thus no longer needing to be within the line of sight of the headset s cameras for best performance and also include a pressure sensor for pinching gestures and rechargeable batteries br br br Reception br The Verge was positive in a pre release review noting that while it lacked standout features it did have worthwhile improvements such as reduced weight a screen with a better visual appearance and refresh rate than the original Quest and a re located USB port The new strap was panned for having less support and a slightly clumsier tightening mechanism partly rectified by the Elite Strap accessory sold separately and the new IPD mechanism was considered annoying and not as inclusive as that of the first generation model In conclusion it was argued that while it was not a must upgrade for existing owners the Quest had the best overall balance of hardware features and price br Ars Technica was less positive noting that its internal speakers were noticeably crisper and louder but panning the new cloth strap in comparison to the original Quest s elastic straps and arguing that it alone was responsible for the claimed reduction in weight the limited IPD options worse battery life and the controllers having less grip and reduced accuracy on more intensive games The switch from OLED to LCD was shown to produce crisper images but more washed out color br The Elite Strap accessory was met with criticism initially due to issues with the straps breaking randomly In response Facebook stated that the issue was a processing inconsistency affecting only a few units and sales of the strap were paused temporarily before going on sale again Other issues such as loose screws in the strap were also reported br br br Sales br In November Qualcomm stated that at least million Quest headsets had been shipped worldwide In late December the Oculus app which is required to complete first time setup became the most popular app on the iOS App Store and Google Play Store in the United States for the first time implying that Quest headsets had been heavily purchased as Christmas gifts during the holiday shopping season br br br Facebook integration br The Quest had faced criticism over the mandate that users must log in with a Facebook account in order to use the Quest and any future Oculus products including the amount of user data that could be collected by the company via virtual reality hardware and interactions such as the user s surroundings motions and actions and biometrics It was reported that some users were unable to use the headset due to their Facebook account being suspended Some described that linking their deactivated Facebook account to the device rendered the headset a paperweight In September Facebook suspended the sale of all Oculus products in Germany after it faced criticism from the German Federal Cartel Office over the requirement At the Facebook Connect event in Mark Zuckerberg stated that the company was working on making it so you can log in into Quest with an account other than your personal Facebook account br Meta later announced in July that it would establish a new Meta account system a spiritual successor to Oculus accounts to link Meta apps and platforms and that users who transition to Meta account would be allowed to decouple their Facebook logins from its VR platforms However Ars Technica noted that the new terms of service and privacy policies associated with the new Meta account system could still allow enforcement of a real name policy stating that users would be obligated to provide accurate and up to date information including registration information which may include providing personal data and still allowed for rampant use of user data by Meta br br br Face pad recall br In December Facebook stated that it was investigating reports of users experiencing rashes and other skin irritation from the Quest s foam face pad In April Facebook stated that it had identified and reduced the use of a few trace substances that are normally present in the manufacturing process which could contribute to skin discomfort but that they did not find any contamination or unexpected substances in our manufacturing process On July Facebook announced that it had issued a recall of the face pads in Canada and the United States would issue free silicone covers to existing users and would temporarily suspend global sales of the Quest in order to allow these covers to be included with all future shipments of the headset br br br br br br External links
