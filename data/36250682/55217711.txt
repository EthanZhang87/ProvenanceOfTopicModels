id: 55217711
Face ID is a facial recognition system designed and developed by Apple Inc for the iPhone and iPad Pro The system allows biometric authentication for unlocking a device making payments accessing sensitive data providing detailed facial expression tracking for Animoji as well as six degrees of freedom DOF head tracking eye tracking and other features Initially released in November with the iPhone X it has since been updated and introduced to several new iPhone models and many iPad Pro models br The Face ID hardware consists of a sensor with three modules a laser dot projector that projects a grid of small infrared dots onto a user s face a module called the flood illuminator that shines infrared light at the face and an infrared camera that takes an infrared picture of the user reads the resulting pattern and generates a D facial map This map is compared with the registered face using a secure subsystem and the user is authenticated if the two faces match sufficiently The system can recognize faces with glasses clothing makeup and facial hair and it adapts to changes in appearance over time br Face ID has sparked a number of debates about security and privacy Apple claims that Face ID is statistically more advanced than Touch ID fingerprint scanning It exhibits significantly fewer false positives Multiple security features largely limit the risk of the system being bypassed using photos or masks and only one proof of concept attempt using detailed scans has succeeded Debate continues over the lack of legal protections offered by biometric systems as compared to passcode authentication in the United States Privacy advocates have also expressed concern about third party app developers access to rough maps of user facial data despite rigid requirements by Apple of how developers handle facial data br With the onset of the COVID pandemic it was noted that Face ID was unable to recognize users wearing face coverings on some devices Apple responded to criticism by offering faster fallback to passcode input and the option for Apple Watch users to confirm whether they intended to unlock their iPhone In March Apple released iOS which adds mask compatible Face ID for iPhone and later devices br br br History br Apple announced Face ID during the unveiling of the iPhone X on September The system was presented as the successor to Touch ID Apple s previous fingerprint based authentication technology embedded in the home button of the iPhone and earlier devices in addition to the second and third generation iPhone SE On September Apple introduced the iPhone XS and XR with faster neural network processing speeds providing a significant speed increase to Face ID On October Apple introduced the third generation iPad Pro which brings Face ID to the iPad and allows face recognition in any orientation iOS included an upgraded version of Face ID which is up to faster than Face ID on previous versions br br br Technology br br Face ID s technology is based on PrimeSense s previous work with low cost infrared depth perception that was the basis of the Kinect motion sensor for the Xbox console line from Microsoft Apple had acquired PrimeSense in after Microsoft started to wane on the use of Kinect br Face ID is based on a facial recognition sensor that consists of two parts a vertical cavity surface emitting laser dot projector module that projects more than infrared dots onto the user s face and an infrared camera module that reads the pattern The pattern is projected from the laser using an Active Diffractive Optical Element which divides the beam into dots br The pattern is encrypted and sent to a local Secure Enclave in the device s CPU to confirm a match with the registered face The stored facial data is a mathematical representation of key details of the face and it is inaccessible to Apple or other parties To avoid involuntary authentication the system requires the user to open their eyes and look at the device to attempt a match although this can be disabled through an accessibility setting Face ID is temporarily disabled and the user s passcode is required after unsuccessful scans hours of inactivity restarting the device or if both of the device s side buttons are held briefly br Apple claimed the probability of someone else unlocking a phone with Face ID is in as opposed to Touch ID at in During initial setup the user s face is scanned twice from a number of angles to create a complete reference map As the system is used it learns about typical variations in a user s appearance and will adjust its registered face data to match aging facial hair growth and other changes using the Neural Engine The system will recognize a face wearing hats scarves glasses most sunglasses facial hair or makeup It also works in the dark by invisibly illuminating the whole face with a dedicated infrared flash module br Authentication with Face ID is used to enable a number of iOS features including unlocking the phone automatically on wake making payments with Apple Pay and viewing saved passwords Apps by Apple or third party developers can protect sensitive data with a system framework the device will verify the user s identity and return success or failure without sharing face data with the app Additionally Face ID can be used without authentication to track over aspects of a user s facial expression and positioning which can be used to create live effects such as Animoji or camera filters In recent years third party developers have developed more use cases for FaceID such as e g Eyeware Beam an iOS app that provides a reliable and precise multi purpose head and eye tracking tool It is used to enable control of the camera angle through head motion in games and eye tracking to share attention with audience in streams but also augmentative and alternative communication AAC and biometric research br br br Devices with Face ID br br br Safety br Face ID uses an infrared flood illuminator and laser infrared dot projector though Apple insists that the output is low enough that it will cause no harm to the eyes or skin and meets international safety standards They do not however recommend the sensor be repaired by third parties citing security concerns There is also an in built feature to deactivate Face ID should unauthorized components be found br br br Issues br br br Twins and close relatives br Inconsistent results have been shown when testing Face ID on identical twins with some tests showing the system managing to separate the two while other tests have failed The system has additionally been fooled by close relatives Apple states that the probability of a false match is different for twins and siblings as well as children under years of age as their distinct facial features may not have fully developed br br br Law enforcement access br Face ID has raised concerns regarding the possibility of law enforcement accessing an individual s phone by pointing the device at the user s face United States Senator Al Franken asked Apple to provide more information on the security and privacy of Face ID a day after the announcement with Apple responding by highlighting the recent publication of a security white paper and knowledge base detailing answers br The Verge noted that courts in the United States have granted different Fifth Amendment rights to keycode and biometric unlocking systems Keycodes are considered testimonial evidence based on the contents of users thoughts whereas fingerprints are considered physical evidence with some suspects having been ordered to unlock their phones via fingerprint br In August the FBI obtained a warrant to search the property which includes electronic devices of a man accused of transmitting child pornography they unlocked the suspect s iPhone by holding it up to his face without needing his passcode br br br Infiltration br Many people have attempted to fool Face ID with sophisticated masks though most have failed In November Vietnamese security firm Bkav announced in a blog post that it had created a mask that successfully unlocked Face ID but WIRED noted that Bkav s technique was more of a proof of concept rather than active exploitation risk with the technique requiring a detailed measurement or digital scan of the iPhone owner s face putting the real risk of danger only to targets of espionage and world leaders br br br Third party developers br If the user explicitly grants a third party app permission to use the camera the app can also access basic facial expression and positioning data from Face ID for features such as precise selfie filters such as those seen in Snapchat or game characters mirroring real world user facial expressions The data accessible to third parties is not sufficient to unlock a device or even identify a user and Apple prohibits developers from selling the data to others creating profiles on users or using the data for advertising The American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Democracy and Technology raised privacy questions about Apple s enforcement of the privacy restrictions connected to third party access with Apple maintaining that its App Store review processes were effective safeguards Jay Stanley a senior policy analyst with the ACLU has stated that the overall idea of letting developers access sensitive facial information was still not satisfactorily handled with Stanley telling Reuters that the privacy issues around of the use of very sophisticated facial recognition technology for unlocking the phone have been overblown The real privacy issues have to do with the access by third party developers br br br Use with face masks br During the COVID pandemic face masks were employed as a public and personal health control measure against the spread of SARS CoV Face ID at the time was incompatible with face masks with Apple stating Face ID is designed to work with your eyes nose and mouth visible With the release of iOS Apple added a feature that automatically brought up the passcode screen if it detected that the user was wearing a mask Apple was criticized for not addressing these issues with the release of the iPhone but was praised for the lack of inclusion of Face ID in favor of Touch ID integration into the power button on the fourth generation iPad Air In April Apple released iOS and watchOS with an option to allow Apple Watch to act as a backup if Face ID fails due to face masks In March Apple released iOS which adds mask compatible Face ID for iPhone
