George Francis Hotz born October alias geohot is an American security hacker entrepreneur and software engineer He is known for developing iOS jailbreaks reverse engineering the PlayStation and for the subsequent lawsuit brought against him by Sony From September onwards he has been working on his vehicle automation machine learning company comma ai Since November Hotz has been working on tinygrad a deep learning framework br br br Education br Hotz attended the Academy for Engineering and Design Technology at the Bergen County Academies a magnet public high school in Hackensack New Jersey Hotz is an alumnus of the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth program Hotz also briefly attended Rochester Institute of Technology and Carnegie Mellon University br br br Security research

PlayStation on his website These keys were later removed from his website as a result of legal action by Sony against fail verflow and Hotz In response to his continued publication of PS exploit information Sony filed on January for an application for a temporary restraining order TRO against him in the US District Court of Northern California br Hotz published his commentary on the case

exploit software hack for Samsung Galaxy S devices used in the US market The exploit is built around the CVE vulnerability which was discovered by hacker Pinkie Pie and it involves an issue in the futex subsystem that in turn allows for privilege escalation The exploit known as towelroot was designated as a one click Android rooting tool br Although originally released for the Verizon Galaxy S the root exploit was made compatible with most Android devices available at that time For example it was tested and found to work with the AT T Galaxy S Nexus and Galaxy S Active Updates continued to be applied to the root exploit to increase its capabilities with other devices running Android Updates to the Android operating system closed the source of the exploit Samsung officially responded to

exploits br Hotz worked at Facebook between May and January br On July Google hired Hotz to work with the Project Zero team where he developed Qira for dynamically analysing application binaries br

didn t think there was any real impact I could make there br br br comma ai br Hotz founded his AI startup comma ai in September In an interview with Bloomberg Hotz revealed that the company was building vehicular automation technology based on machine learning algorithms Hotz built a working self driving Acura ILX which he demonstrated on California s Interstate freeway in a video resulting in a cease and desist letter from the California Department of Motor Vehicles br Hotz wanted to sell his technology to Tesla Motors meeting with CEO Elon Musk Hotz claims that Musk offered him million minus million for every month it took Hotz to work on the task to create a driving system that could replace the MobilEye solution that Tesla used at the time which was disputed by Musk Musk offered advice on Hotz s self driving car project in a December interview br On October the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA informed Hotz that the product was legally required to comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards and requested information that would confirm such compliance A day later George Hotz tweeted from Shenzhen that the comma one was cancelled Kristen Lee

announced that they raised M to build computers for machine learning and develop neural network framework called tinygrad Tinygrad the neural network framework developed by Tiny Corp aims to provide a balance between the simplicity of Andrej Karpathy s micrograd framework and the functionality of the PyTorch framework tinygrad aims to realize performance gains over PyTorch through a number of optimizations including dynamic compilation fusing of operations and a greatly simplified backend tinygrad is currently used to enable comma ai s openpilot framework to run on the company s dedicated hardware which includes a Snapdragon GPU br Additionally tiny corp builds the TinyBox a AI computer aimed at local model training and inference serving as a personal compute cluster br br br Other
