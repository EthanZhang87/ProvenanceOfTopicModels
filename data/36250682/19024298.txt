A virtual assistant VA is a software agent that can perform a range of tasks or services for a user based on user input such as commands or questions including verbal ones Such technologies often incorporate chatbot capabilities to simulate human conversation such as via online chat to facilitate interaction with their users The interaction may be via text graphical interface or voice as some virtual assistants are able to interpret human speech and respond via synthesized voices br In many cases users can ask their virtual assistants questions control home automation devices and media playback and manage other basic tasks such as email to do lists and calendars all with verbal commands In recent years prominent virtual assistants for direct consumer use have included Apple s Siri Amazon Alexa Google Assistant and Samsung s Bixby Also companies in various industries often incorporate some kind of virtual assistant technology into their customer service or support br Recently the emergence of recent artificial intelligence based chatbots such as ChatGPT has brought increased capability and interest to the field of virtual assistant products and services br br br History br br br Experimental decades s s br Radio Rex was the first voice activated toy patented in and released in It was a wooden toy in the shape of a dog that would come out of its house when its name is called br In Bell Labs presented Audrey the Automatic Digit Recognition machine It occupied a six foot high relay rack consumed substantial power had streams of cables and exhibited the myriad maintenance problems associated with complex vacuum tube circuitry It could recognize the fundamental units of speech phonemes It was limited to accurate recognition of digits spoken by designated talkers It could therefore be used for voice dialing but in most cases push button dialing was cheaper and faster rather than speaking the consecutive digits br Another early tool which was enabled to perform digital speech recognition was the IBM Shoebox voice activated calculator presented to the general public during the Seattle World s Fair after its initial market launch in This early computer developed almost years before the introduction of the first IBM Personal Computer in was able to recognize spoken words and the digits to br The first natural language processing computer program or the chatbot ELIZA was developed by MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaum in the s It was created to demonstrate that the communication between man and machine was superficial ELIZA used pattern matching and substitution methodology into scripted responses to simulate conversation which gave an illusion of understanding on the part of the program br Weizenbaum s own secretary reportedly asked Weizenbaum to leave the room so that she and ELIZA could have a real conversation Weizenbaum was surprised by this later writing I had not realized that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people br This gave name to the ELIZA effect the tendency to unconsciously assume computer behaviors are analogous to human behaviors that is anthropomorphisation a phenomenon present in human interactions with virtual assistants br The next milestone in the development of voice recognition technology was achieved in the s at the Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania with substantial support of the United States Department of Defense and its DARPA agency funded five years of a Speech Understanding Research program aiming to reach a minimum vocabulary of words Companies and academia including IBM Carnegie Mellon University CMU and Stanford Research Institute took part in the program br The result was Harpy it mastered about words the vocabulary of a three year old and it could understand sentences It could process speech that followed pre programmed vocabulary pronunciation and grammar structures to determine which sequences of words made sense together and thus reducing speech recognition errors br In Tangora was an upgrade of the Shoebox it was a voice recognizing typewriter Named after the world s fastest typist at the time it had a vocabulary of words and used prediction to decide the most likely result based on what was said in the past IBM s approach was based on a hidden Markov model which adds statistics to digital signal processing techniques The method makes it possible to predict the most likely phonemes to follow a given phoneme Still each speaker had to individually train the typewriter to recognize his or her voice and pause between each word br In Gus Searcy invented the Butler In A Box an electronic voice home controller system br br br Birth of smart virtual assistants s s br br In the s digital speech recognition technology became a feature of the personal computer with IBM Philips and Lernout Hauspie fighting for customers Much later the market launch of the first smartphone IBM Simon in laid the foundation for smart virtual assistants as we know them today br In Dragon s Naturally Speaking software could recognize and transcribe natural human speech without pauses between each word into a document at a rate of words per minute A version of Naturally Speaking is still available for download and it is still used today for instance by many doctors in the US and the UK to document their medical records br In Colloquis publicly launched SmarterChild on platforms like AIM and MSN Messenger While entirely text based SmarterChild was able to play games check the weather look up facts and converse with users to an extent br The first modern digital virtual assistant installed on a smartphone was Siri which was introduced as a feature of the iPhone S on October Apple Inc developed Siri following the acquisition of Siri Inc a spin off of SRI International which is a research institute financed by DARPA and the United States Department of Defense Its aim was to aid in tasks such as sending a text message making phone calls checking the weather or setting up an alarm Over time it has developed to provide restaurant recommendations search the internet and provide driving directions br In November Amazon announced Alexa alongside the Echo br In April Amazon released a service for building conversational interfaces for any type of virtual assistant or interface br br br Artificial intelligence and language models s present br br In the s artificial intelligence AI systems like ChatGPT have gained popularity for their ability to generate human like responses to text based conversations In February Microsoft introduced its Turing Natural Language Generation T NLG which was then the largest language model ever published at billion parameters On November ChatGPT was launched as a prototype and quickly garnered attention for its detailed responses and articulate answers across many domains of knowledge The advent of ChatGPT and its introduction to the wider public increased interest and competition in the space In February Google began introducing an experimental service called Bard which is based on its LaMDA program to generate text responses to questions asked based on information gathered from the web br While ChatGPT and other generalized chatbots based on the latest generative AI are capable of performing various tasks associated with virtual assistants there are also more specialized forms of such technology that are designed to target more specific situations or needs br br br Method of interaction br br Virtual assistants work via br br Text including online chat especially in an instant messaging application or other application SMS text e mail or other text based communication channel for example Conversica s intelligent virtual assistants for business br Voice for example with Amazon Alexa on Amazon Echo devices Siri on an iPhone Google Assistant on Google enabled Android devices or Bixby on Samsung devices br Images some assistants such as Google Assistant which includes Google Lens and Bixby on the Samsung Galaxy series have the added capability of performing image processing to recognize objects in images br Many virtual assistants are accessible via multiple methods offering versatility in how users can interact with them whether through chat voice commands or other integrated technologies br Virtual assistants use natural language processing NLP to match user text or voice input to executable commands Some continually learn using artificial intelligence techniques including machine learning and ambient intelligence br To activate a virtual assistant using the voice a wake word might be used This is a word or groups of words such as Hey Siri OK Google or Hey Google Alexa and Hey Microsoft As virtual assistants become more popular there are increasing legal risks involved br br br Devices and objects br br Virtual assistants may be integrated into many types of platforms or like Amazon Alexa across several of them br br Into devices like smart speakers such as Amazon Echo Google Home and Apple HomePod br In instant messaging applications on both smartphones and via the Web e g M virtual assistant on both Facebook and Facebook Messenger apps or via the Web br Built into a mobile operating system OS as are Apple s Siri on iOS devices and BlackBerry Assistant on BlackBerry devices or into a desktop OS such as Cortana on Microsoft Windows OS br Built into a smartphone independent of the OS as is Bixby on the Samsung Galaxy S and Note br Within instant messaging platforms assistants from specific organizations such as Aeromexico s Aerobot on Facebook Messenger or WeChat Secretary br Within mobile apps from specific companies and other organizations such as Dom from Domino s Pizza br In appliances cars and wearable technology br Previous generations of virtual assistants often worked on websites such as Alaska Airlines Ask Jenn or on interactive voice response IVR systems such as American Airlines IVR by Nuance br br br Services br Virtual assistants can provide a wide variety of services These include br br Provide information such as weather facts from e g Wikipedia or IMDb set an alarm make to do lists and shopping lists br Play music from streaming services such as Spotify and Pandora play radio stations read audiobooks br Play videos TV shows or movies on televisions streaming from e g Netflix br Conversational commerce see below br Assist public interactions with government see Artificial intelligence in government br Complement and or replace human customer service specialists in domains like healthcare sales and banking One report estimated that an automated online assistant produced a decrease in the work load for a human provided call centre br Enhance the driving experience by enabling interaction with virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa while in the car br br br Conversational commerce br br Conversational commerce is e commerce via various means of messaging including via voice assistants but also live chat on e commerce Web sites live chat on messaging applications such as WeChat Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp and chatbots on messaging applications or Web sites br br br Customer support br br A virtual assistant can work with customer support team of a business to provide x support to customers It provides quick responses which enhances a customer s experience br br br Third party services br Amazon enables Alexa Skills and Google Actions essentially applications that run on the assistant platforms br br br Privacy br br Virtual assistants have a variety of privacy concerns associated with them Features such as activation by voice pose a threat as such features requires the device to always be listening Modes of privacy such as the virtual security button have been proposed to create a multilayer authentication for virtual assistants br br br Google Assistant br The privacy policy of Google Assistant states that it does not store the audio data without the user s permission but may store the conversation transcripts to personalise its experience Personalisation can be turned off in settings If a user wants Google Assistant to store audio data they can go to Voice Audio Activity VAA and turn on this feature Audio files are sent to the cloud and used by Google to improve the performance of Google Assistant but only if the VAA feature is turned on br br br Amazon Alexa br The privacy policy of Amazon s virtual assistant Alexa states that it only listens to conversations when its wake word like Alexa Amazon Echo is used It starts recording the conversation after the call of a wake word and stops recording after seconds of silence It sends the recorded conversation to the cloud It is possible to delete the recording from the cloud by visiting Alexa Privacy in Alexa br br br Apple s Siri br Apple states that it does not record audio to improve Siri Instead it claims to use transcripts Transcript data is only sent if it is deemed important for analysis Users can opt out anytime if they don t want Siri to send the transcripts in the cloud br br br Consumer interest br br br Presumed added value as allowing a new way of interactions br Added value of the virtual assistants can come among others from the following br br Voice communication can sometimes represent the optimal man machine communication br It is convenient there are some sectors where voice is the only way of possible communication and more generally it allows to free up both hands and vision potentially for doing another activity in parallel or helps also disabled people br It is faster Voice is more efficient than writing on a keyboard we can speak up to words per minute opposed to in case of writing on a keyboard It is also more natural thus requiring less effort reading a text however can reach words per minute br Virtual assistants save a lot of time by automation they can take appointments or read the news while the consumer does something else It is also possible to ask the virtual assistant to schedule meetings hence helping to organize time The designers of new digital schedulers explained the ambition they had that these calendars schedule lives to make the consumer use his time more efficiently through machine learning processes and complete organization of work time and free time As an example when the consumer expresses the desire of scheduling a break the VA will schedule it at an optimal moment for this purpose for example at a time of the week where they are less productive with the additional long term objective of being able to schedule and organize the free time of the consumer to assure them optimal work efficiency br br br Perceived interest br br According to a recent study the two reasons for using virtual assistants for consumers are perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment The first result of this study is that both perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment have an equivalent very strong influence for the consumer willingness to use a virtual assistant br The second result of this study is that br Provided content quality has a very strong influence on perceived usefulness and a strong influence on perceived enjoyment br Visual attractiveness has a very strong influence on perceived enjoyment br Automation has a strong influence on perceived usefulness br br br Controversies br br br Artificial intelligence controversies br Virtual assistants spur the filter bubble As for social media virtual assistants algorithms are trained to show pertinent data and discard others based on previous activities of the consumer The pertinent data is the one which will interest or please the consumer As a result they become isolated from data that disagrees with their viewpoints effectively isolating them into their own intellectual bubble and reinforcing their opinions This phenomenon was known to reinforce fake news and echo chambers br Virtual assistants are also sometimes criticized for being overrated In particular A Casilli points out that the AI of virtual assistants are neither intelligent nor artificial for two reasons br Not intelligent because all they do is being the assistant of the human and only by doing tasks that a human could do easily and in a very limited specter of actions find class and present information offers or documents Also virtual assistants are neither able to make decisions on their own nor to anticipate things br And not artificial because they would be impossible without human labelization through micro working br br br Ethical implications br In Antonio A Casilli a French sociologist criticized artificial intelligence and virtual assistants in particular in the following way br At a first level the fact that the consumer provides free data for the training and improvement of the virtual assistant often without knowing it is ethically disturbing br But at a second level it might be even more ethically disturbing to know how these AIs are trained with this data br This artificial intelligence is trained via neural networks which require a huge amount of labelled data However this data needs to be labelled through a human process which explains the rise of microwork in the last decade That is remotely using some people worldwide doing some repetitive and very simple tasks for a few cents such as listening to virtual assistant speech data and writing down what was said Microwork has been criticized for the job insecurity it causes and for the total lack of regulation The average salary was dollar hour in and it provides neither healthcare nor retirement benefits sick pay minimum wage Hence virtual assistants and their designers are controversial for spurring job insecurity and the AIs they propose are still human in the way that they would be impossible without the microwork of millions of human workers br Privacy concerns are raised by the fact that voice commands are available to the providers of virtual assistants in unencrypted form and can thus be shared with third parties and be processed in an unauthorized or unexpected manner Additionally to the linguistic content of recorded speech a user s manner of expression and voice characteristics can implicitly contain information about his or her biometric identity personality traits body shape physical and mental health condition sex gender moods and emotions socioeconomic status and geographical origin br br br Developer platforms br Notable developer platforms for virtual assistants include br br Amazon Lex was opened to developers in April It involves natural language understanding technology combined with automatic speech recognition and had been introduced in November br Google provides the Actions on Google and Dialogflow platforms for developers to create Actions for Google Assistant br Apple provides SiriKit for developers to create extensions for Siri br IBM s Watson while sometimes spoken of as a virtual assistant is in fact an entire artificial intelligence platform and community powering some virtual assistants chatbots and many other types of solutions br br br Previous generations br In previous generations of text chat based virtual assistants the assistant was often represented by an avatar a k a interactive online character or automated character this was known as an embodied agent br br br Economic relevance br br br For individuals br Digital experiences enabled by virtual assistants are considered to be among the major recent technological advances and most promising consumer trends Experts claim that digital experiences will achieve a status weight comparable to real experiences if not become more sought after and prized The trend is verified by a high number of frequent users and the substantial growth of worldwide user numbers of virtual digital assistants In mid the number of frequent users of digital virtual assistants is estimated to be around bn worldwide In addition it can be observed that virtual digital assistant technology is no longer restricted to smartphone applications but present across many industry sectors incl automotive telecommunications retail healthcare and education br In response to the significant R D expenses of firms across all sectors and an increasing implementation of mobile devices the market for speech recognition technology is predicted to grow at a CAGR of globally over the period of to and thereby surpass a global market size of US billion by According to an Ovum study the native digital assistant installed base is projected to exceed the world s population by with billion active voice AI capable devices According to Ovum by that time Google Assistant will dominate the voice AI capable device market with market share followed by Samsung s Bixby Apple s Siri Amazon s Alexa and Microsoft s Cortana br Taking into consideration the regional distribution of market leaders North American companies e g Nuance Communications IBM eGain are expected to dominate the industry over the next years due to the significant impact of BYOD Bring Your Own Device and enterprise mobility business models Furthermore the increasing demand for smartphone assisted platforms are expected to further boost the North American intelligent virtual assistant IVA industry growth Despite its smaller size in comparison to the North American market the intelligent virtual assistant industry from the Asia Pacific region with its main players located in India and China is predicted to grow at an annual growth rate of above global average over the period br br br Economic opportunity for enterprises br Virtual assistants should not be only seen as a gadget for individuals as they could have a real economic utility for enterprises As an example a virtual assistant can take the role of an always available assistant with an encyclopedic knowledge And which can organize meetings check inventories verify informations Virtual assistants are all the more important that their integration in small and middle sized enterprises often consists in an easy first step through the more global adaptation and use of Internet of Things IoT Indeed IoT technologies are first perceived by small and medium sized enterprises as technologies of critical importance but too complicated risky or costly to be used br br br Security br In May researchers from the University of California Berkeley published a paper that showed audio commands undetectable for the human ear could be directly embedded into music or spoken text thereby manipulating virtual assistants into performing certain actions without the user taking note of it The researchers made small changes to audio files which cancelled out the sound patterns that speech recognition systems are meant to detect These were replaced with sounds that would be interpreted differently by the system and command it to dial phone numbers open websites or even transfer money The possibility of this has been known since and affects devices from Apple Amazon and Google br In addition to unintentional actions and voice recording another security and privacy risk associated with intelligent virtual assistants is malicious voice commands An attacker who impersonates a user and issues malicious voice commands to for example unlock a smart door to gain unauthorized entry to a home or garage or order items online without the user s knowledge Although some IVAs provide a voice training feature to prevent such impersonation it can be difficult for the system to distinguish between similar voices Thus a malicious person who is able to access an IVA enabled device might be able to fool the system into thinking that they are the real owner and carry out criminal or mischievous acts br br br Comparison of notable assistants br br br See also br br
