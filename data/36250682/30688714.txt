forces in the middle of the night This was to become a defining moment in the Yemeni revolution media outlets reported my detention and demonstrations erupted in most provinces of the country they were organised by students civil society activists and politicians The pressure on the government was intense and I was released after hours in a women s prison where I was kept in chains br She then led another protest on January where she called for a Day of Rage on February similar to events of the Egyptian revolution that were in turn inspired by the Tunisian revolution On March she was re arrested amidst ongoing protests Speaking of the uprising she had said that We will continue until the fall of Ali Abdullah Saleh s regime We have the Southern Movement in the south the Shia Huthi rebels in the north and parliamentary opposition But what s most important now is the jasmine revolution She has set at the protest camp for months along with her husband br Karman explained the reasons why the Yemeni protests attracted Yemenis The combination of a dictatorship corruption poverty and unemployment has created this revolution It s like a volcano Injustice and corruption are exploding while opportunities for a good life are coming to an end br Karman has had some tense disagreements with other organisers especially after she urged protesters to march to the Presidential Palace in May as a response to the killing of protesters by security forces br On June she wrote an article entitled Yemen s Unfinished Revolution in The New York Times in which she assailed the United States and Saudi Arabia for their support for the corrupt Saleh regime in Yemen because they used their influence to ensure that members of the old regime remain in power and the status quo is maintained She argued that American intervention in Yemen was motivated by the war on terror and was not responsive to either the human rights abuses in Yemen or the calls from Yemen s democracy movement She affirmed that the protesters in Yemen also wanted stability in the country and region In an interview on Democracy Now Karman said In our weekly protests in front of the cabinet we called on the government to allow people to have freedom of speech and for people to be able to own online newspapers We knew and know that freedom of speech is the door to democracy and justice and also that part of the freedom of speech is the freedom of movement The culture of freedom and protests spread all over Yemen Every time we stood up for our rights the government answered with violence or interfered in our rights She credited Tunisia for inspiring others around the Middle East for the Arab Spring protests br During the protests Karman was part of a large number of women activists up to percent of the protestors demanding change in Yemen On October government snipers in Taiz shot and killed Aziza Othman Kaleb CNN reported she was the first woman to have been killed during the Yemen protests but could not verify this claim Ten days later women in Sana a protested against the violent force used against them by burning their makrama At the time Karman was in Washington D C where she said the female protesters who burned their makrama were reject ing the injustice that the Saleh regime has imposed on them And this is a new stage for the Yemeni women because they will not hide behind veils or behind walls or anything else br br br Involvement of international government organizations br After the Nobel Peace Prize announcement Tawakkol Karman became increasingly involved in mobilizing world opinion and United Nations Security Council members to assist the protesters in ousting Saleh and bringing him before the international court br She lobbied the United Nations Security Council and the United States not to make a deal that would pardon Saleh but instead hold him accountable freeze his assets and support the protesters The United Nations Security Council voted on October on United Nations Security Council Resolution that strongly condemns Saleh s government for the use of deadly force against protesters but it also backed the Gulf Cooperation Council s GCC initiative that would give Saleh immunity from prosecution should he resign Karman who was present for the vote criticised the council s support for the GCC s proposal and instead advocated that Saleh stand trial at the International Criminal Court br Karman also met the United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on October to discuss the same United Nations Resolution to which Clinton said the United States supports a democratic transition in Yemen and the rights of the people of Yemen men and women to choose their own leaders and futures Karman responded to the comment through the Yemini press by saying in Yemen it has been nine months that people have been camped in the squares Until now we didn t see that Obama came to value the sacrifice of the Yemeni people Instead the American administration is giving guarantees to Saleh br Saleh signed the Gulf Cooperation Council s plan November in Riyadh Saudi Arabia Saleh would transfer his powers to Vice President Abd al Rab Mansur al Hadi to start a political transition according to the terms of the agreement br br br Nobel Peace Prize br br Karman became the first Arab woman the youngest person at that time to have

Nobel Peace Prize for their non violent struggle for the safety of women and for women s rights to full participation in peace building work Of Karman the Nobel Committee said In the most trying circumstances both before and during the Arab spring Tawakkul Karman has played a leading part in the struggle for women s rights and for democracy and peace in Yemen The Nobel Committee cited the United Nations Security Council Resolution adopted in which states that women and children suffer great harm from war and political instability and that women must have a larger influence and role in peacemaking activities it also c alls on all actors involved when negotiating and implementing peace agreements to adopt a gender perspective br Upon announcing the award the committee chairman Thorbj rn Jagland said We cannot achieve democracy and lasting peace in the world unless women obtain the same opportunities as men to influence developments at all levels of society He later added that the prize was a very important signal to women all over the world and that despite the events of the Arab Spring there are many other positive developments in the world that we have looked at I think it is a little strange that researchers and others have not seen them He had earlier said the prize for the year would be very powerful but at the same time very unifying and would not create as strong reactions from a single country as it did last year with Liu Xiaobo The prize is to be divided equally among the three recipients from a total of million Swedish kronor br In reaction to the award Karman while camped out in Sana a during ongoing anti government protests said I didn t expect it It came as a total surprise This is a victory for Arabs around the world and a victory for Arab women and that the award was a victory of our peaceful revolution I am so happy and I give this award to all of the youth and all of the women across the Arab world in Egypt in Tunisia We cannot build our country or any country in the world without peace adding that it was also for Libya Syria and Yemen and all the youth and women this is a victory for our demand for citizenship and human rights that all Yemenis are happy over the prize The fight for democratic Yemen will continue that she dedicate s it to all the martyrs and wounded of the Arab Spring in Tunisia Egypt Yemen Libya and Syria and to all the free people who are fighting for their rights and freedoms and I dedicate it to all Yemenis who preferred to make their revolution peaceful by facing the snipers with flowers It is for the
