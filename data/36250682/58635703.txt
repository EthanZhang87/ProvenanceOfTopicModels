The first generation Oculus Quest is a discontinued virtual reality headset developed by Oculus now Reality Labs a brand of Facebook Inc and released on May Similar to its predecessor Oculus Go it is a standalone device that can run games and software wirelessly under an Android based operating system It supports positional tracking with six degrees of freedom using internal sensors and an array of cameras in the front of the headset rather than external sensors The cameras are also used as part of the safety feature Passthrough which shows a view from the cameras when the user exits their designated boundary area known as Guardian A later software update added Oculus Link a feature that allows the Quest to be connected to a computer via USB enabling use with Oculus Rift compatible software and games br The Oculus Quest received praise for its price and convenience and for having improved graphical fidelity and tracking over Oculus Go but was panned for its front heavy build and downgraded graphics quality over PC based VR games At launch it also faced criticism for being limited to software available on the Oculus Store and not having backwards compatibility with Oculus Go software The later introduction of Oculus Link led to reappraisals of the Quest with critics praising the device s increased flexibility and indicating that devices like the Quest would likely supplant the PC only Rift headsets moving forward A successor the Oculus Quest was released in br br br History br At Oculus Connect in Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that Oculus was working on a standalone virtual reality headset codenamed Santa Cruz At Oculus Connect the following year it was announced that Oculus planned to issue software development kits for the new model in They also revealed the accompanying controllers which would be similar to the Oculus Rift s touch controllers br In at Connect it was announced that the new headset would be known as the Oculus Quest and would be priced at US At F it was announced that the Quest would ship on May At launch the device was priced at US for the GB version and US for the GB version br A successor model the Oculus Quest was announced on September It was released on October starting at for the GB version and for the GB version Software support for the first generation Quest began to be phased out in with support for certain social features ending in March and updates limited to maintenance and security patches until br br br Specifications br The Oculus Quest uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon system on chip SoC with GB of RAM Three of the four GHz CPU cores of the chip are reserved for software while the remaining core and its four lower power cores are reserved for motion tracking and other background functions It runs operating system software based on Android Open Source Project AOSP source code with modifications to enhance performance in VR applications A smartphone running the Oculus app is required in order to conduct first time setup br A diamond Pentile OLED display is used for each eye with an individual resolution of and a refresh rate of Hz The headset uses the next generation lens technology originally introduced in Oculus Go which helps to enlarge the sweet spot of the lens Visual artifacts such as God rays are less prominent but still visible in scenes with high contrast It also features physical interpupillary distance IPD adjustment br br br Tracking br Unlike the Oculus Go which used a limited handheld remote that only supported limited motion tracking the Quest supports positional tracking with six degrees of freedom compared to the Go s three br Rather than use external sensor cameras in the play area to spatially track the headset and controllers as was the case with the original Oculus Rift CV Oculus Quest utilizes an inside out tracking system known as Oculus Insight Based on the concept of simultaneous localization and mapping SLAM infrared diodes on the Oculus Touch controllers are tracked via four wide angle cameras built into the front of the headset This is combined with accelerometer input from the controllers and headset as well as AI algorithms to predict the path of motion when the controllers are outside of the cameras field of view br The cameras are also used as part of a safety feature known as Passthrough which displays a grayscale view from the cameras when the player exits their defined playing area At Oculus Connect it was announced that the feature would be upgraded to Passthrough as on the Oculus Rift S which also uses Insight making it stereoscopic and stereo correct A Passthrough on Demand feature was added in Quest system software version allowing the user to quickly access the Passthrough view by double tapping the left or right side of the headset br br br Hand tracking br During Oculus Connect it was announced that hand tracking would be added to the Quest in early utilizing machine learning Oculus Insight and model based tracking to recognize the position and gesture of the user s hands without additional hardware br Hand tracking was initially introduced as an experimental feature in December as part of Quest system software version It was limited to the main user interface and selected built in apps such as the web browser It was also announced that the Oculus Quest SDK would be updated to add support for the feature In May hand tracking exited beta and became available for use in third party software beginning May br br br Controllers br br The Oculus Quest uses second generation Oculus Touch controllers Their designs were modified to accommodate Oculus Insight with their tracking rings moved from the back of the controllers to their tops so that they can be tracked by the headset s cameras br br br Audio br The Quest has embedded speakers as well as a pair of mm audio jacks on each side for use with external headphones br br br Accessories br Though the Oculus Quest has built in audio it was possible to purchase official in ear headphones from Facebook There is also an official travel case br Following the release of the Oculus Link feature Facebook released an official m ft long USB C cable designed for use with the feature The cable is fiber optic as the reliability of non powered USB cables with copper based wires diminishes at feet m br br br Software br br Facebook enforces stricter content and quality standards for software distributed on Oculus Quest in comparison to Oculus Go and Gear VR including requiring developers to undergo a pre screening of their concepts to demonstrate quality and probable market success In Facebook introduced App Lab a new section within the storefront allowing developers to upload and distribute Quest apps without going through the formal review process App Lab is designed primarily to support early access models and can support public and invite based distribution br Facebook launched the headset with over titles consisting of a mix of new and ported games including titles such as Beat Saber Moss Robo Recall Superhot VR and VRChat Some games support cross play with their PC versions br At Oculus Connect in September it was announced that backward compatibility with over Oculus Go applications and games would be added to the Quest In addition users who had purchased Oculus Go apps would be eligible to download Oculus Quest specific versions of them for free through the end of br br br Use with PC software br At Oculus Connect Facebook announced Oculus Link now Quest Link a function which allows the Quest to be used with Oculus Rift compatible software on a PC over USB It became available in beta on November as part of system software version Initially Link only supported USB connections In May support for USB was added although Facebook still recommends use of USB cables br On June Zuckerberg stated that Oculus Air Link a feature from the Quest that allows Link to be used over a local Wi Fi connection was coming soon to the original Quest br br br Reception br Scott Stein of CNET considered the Quest to be improbably amazing for its size and price tag and compared it to Nintendo Switch in terms of convenience Stein praised its camera system and motion controls and its graphics quality for being nearer to PC quality than Oculus Go albeit still limited in detail due to its use of mobile computing hardware The Quest was panned for being a closed platform at launch with software limited to the Oculus Store and not being backwards compatible with software released for Oculus Go Adi Robertson of The Verge shared similar opinions noting that the Quest was heavier and not as comfortable as Rift S and that its launch titles were not at the same caliber as the PC Oculus Rift in terms of size or graphical fidelity but that the Quest still included a physical IPD slider unlike the Rift S br In May The Verge acknowledged that the Quest had improved since its launch to become the closest thing that exists to a sleek almost mainstream VR headset citing an expanding software library and the ability to use the headset with a PC over USB via the Oculus Link feature and over Wi Fi using the sideloaded third party software Virtual Desktop which was not noticeably worse than doing so over USB in their experience It was argued that the Quest works so well by itself that it s a great system in its own right while Oculus Link allowed it to double as a credible PC VR headset as well While it was noted that the Rift S was less front heavy and that its display trades contrast for slightly higher resolution and refresh rate it was argued that neither it or the Valve Index works as a perfectly good standalone wireless VR headset VentureBeat felt that Oculus was likely setting the stage for discontinuing the Rift line in favor of Quest arguing if Link performs as expected most users will have little to no idea of what they re missing Rift S extra camera FPS and resolution differences won t matter much br br br Sales br Two weeks after launch Oculus announced that it had sold million worth of content for the Oculus Quest At Oculus Connect it was announced that the Quest had created over of the generated revenue from all platforms at Oculus totaling at million It was also reported during the same event that the Quest has by far the highest retention rate of all their headsets units were sold over the th quarter of and was sold out at times br br br br br br External links br br Official website br Oculus Quest on VRcompare
