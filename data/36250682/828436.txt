A QR code quick response code is a type of two dimensional matrix barcode invented in by Japanese company Denso Wave for labelling automobile parts It features black squares on a white background with fiducial markers readable by imaging devices like cameras and processed using Reed Solomon error correction until the image can be appropriately interpreted The required data are then extracted from patterns that are present in both the horizontal and the vertical components of the QR image br Whereas a barcode is a machine readable optical image that contains information specific to the labelled item the QR code contains the data for a locator an identifier and for web tracking To efficiently store data QR codes use four standardized modes of encoding i numeric ii alphanumeric iii byte or binary and iv kanji Compared to standard UPC barcodes the QR labelling system was applied beyond the automobile industry because of faster reading of the optical image and greater data storage capacity in applications such as product tracking item identification time tracking document management and general marketing br br br History br br The QR code system was invented in at the Denso Wave automotive products company in Japan The initial alternating square design presented by the team of researchers headed by Masahiro Hara was influenced by the black counters and the white counters played on a Go board the pattern of position detection was found and determined by applying the least used ratio in black and white areas on printed matter which cannot be misidentified by an optical scanner The functional purpose of the QR code system was to facilitate keeping track of the types and numbers of automobile parts by replacing individually scanned bar code labels on each box of auto parts with a single label that contained the data of each label The quadrangular configuration of the QR code system consolidated the data of the various bar code labels with Kanji Kana and alphanumeric codes that were printed onto a single label br br br Adoption br br As of QR codes are used in a much broader context including both commercial tracking applications and convenience oriented applications aimed at mobile phone users termed mobile tagging QR codes may be used to display text to the user to open a webpage on the user s device to add a vCard contact to the user s device to open a Uniform Resource Identifier URI to connect to a wireless network or to compose an email or text message There are a great many QR code generators available as software or as online tools that are either free or require a paid subscription The QR code has become one of the most used types of two dimensional code br During the month of June million American mobile users scanned a QR code or a barcode Some of those users scanned a QR or barcode from their homes while scanned from retail stores of the million users were men between the ages of and br In million people in the United States scanned a QR code using their mobile devices up by percent compared to The majority of QR code users used them to make payments or to access product and menu information br In September a survey found that percent of consumers in the United States and United Kingdom strongly agreed that they had noticed an increase of QR code use since the then active COVID related restrictions had begun several months prior br br br Standards br br There are several standards that cover the encoding of data as QR codes br br October AIM Association for Automatic Identification and Mobility International br January JIS X br June ISO IEC Information technology Automatic identification and data capture techniques Bar code symbology QR code now withdrawn Defines QR code models and symbols br September ISO IEC Information technology Automatic identification and data capture techniques QR Code bar code symbology specification now withdrawn Defines QR code symbols an extension of QR code

specification Renames the QR Code symbol to QR Code and adds clarification to some procedures and minor corrections br May ISO IEC Information technology Automatic identification and data capture techniques Rectangular Micro QR Code rMQR bar code symbology specificationDefines the requirements for Micro QR Code br At the application layer there is some variation between most of the implementations Japan s NTT DoCoMo has established de facto standards for the encoding of URLs contact information and several other data types The open source ZXing project maintains a list of QR code data types br br br Uses br br QR codes have become common in consumer advertising Typically a smartphone is used as a QR code scanner displaying the code and converting it to some useful form such as a standard URL for a website thereby obviating the need for a user to type it into a Web browser br QR code has become a focus of advertising strategy since it provides a way to access a brand s website more quickly than by manually entering a URL Beyond mere convenience to the consumer the importance of this capability is that it increases the conversion rate the chance that contact with the advertisement will convert to a sale It coaxes interested prospects further down the conversion funnel with little delay or effort bringing the viewer to the advertiser s website immediately whereas a longer and more targeted sales pitch may lose the viewer s interest br Although initially used to track parts in vehicle manufacturing QR codes are used over a much wider range of applications These include commercial tracking warehouse stock control entertainment and transport ticketing product and loyalty marketing and in store product labeling Examples of marketing include where a company s discounted and percent discount can be captured using a QR code decoder that is a mobile app or storing a company s information such as address and related information alongside its alpha numeric text data as can be seen in telephone directory yellow pages br They can also be used in storing personal information for use by organizations An example of this is Philippines National Bureau of Investigation NBI where NBI clearances now come with a QR code Many of these applications target mobile phone users via mobile tagging Users may receive text add a vCard contact to their device open a URL or compose an e mail or text message after scanning QR codes They can generate and print their own QR codes for others to scan and use by visiting one of several pay or free QR code generating sites or apps Google had an API now deprecated to generate QR codes and apps for scanning QR codes can be found on nearly all smartphone devices br br QR codes storing addresses and URLs may appear in magazines on signs on buses on business cards or on almost any object about which users might want information Users with a camera phone equipped with the correct reader application can scan the image of the QR code to display text contact information connect to a wireless network or open a web page in the phone s browser This act of linking from physical world objects is termed hardlinking or object hyperlinking QR codes also may be linked to a location to track where a code has been scanned Either the application that scans the QR code retrieves the geo information by using GPS and cell tower triangulation aGPS or the URL encoded in the QR code itself is associated with a location In a Japanese stonemason announced plans to engrave QR codes on gravestones allowing visitors to view information about the deceased and family members to keep track of visits Psychologist Richard Wiseman was one of the first authors to include QR codes in a book in Paranormality Why We See What Isn t There Microsoft Office and LibreOffice have a functionality to insert QR code into documents br QR codes have been incorporated into currency In June The Royal Dutch Mint Koninklijke Nederlandse Munt issued the world s first official coin with a QR code to celebrate the centenary of its current building and premises The coin can be scanned by a smartphone and originally linked to a special website with contents about the historical event and design of the coin In the Central Bank of Nigeria issued a naira banknote to commemorate its centennial the first banknote to incorporate a QR code in its design When scanned with an internet enabled mobile device the code goes to a website that tells the centenary story of Nigeria br In the Central Bank of the Russian Federation issued a rubles note to commemorate the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation It contains a QR code into its design and when scanned with an internet enabled mobile device the code goes to a website that details the historical and technical background of the commemorative note In the Bank of Ghana issued a cedis banknote to commemorate years of Central Banking in Ghana and contains a QR code in its design which when scanned with an internet enabled mobile device that code goes to the official Bank of Ghana website br Credit card functionality is under development In September the Reserve Bank of India RBI launched the eponymously named Bharat QR a common QR code jointly developed by all the four major card payment companies National Payments Corporation of India that runs RuPay cards along with MasterCard Visa and American Express It will also have the capability of accepting payments on the unified payments interface UPI platform br br br Augmented reality br QR codes are used in some augmented reality systems to determine the positions of objects in dimensional space br br br Mobile operating systems br QR codes can be used on various mobile device operating systems Both Android and iOS devices can natively scan QR codes without downloading an external app The camera app is able to scan and display the kind of QR code along with the link These devices support URL redirection which allows QR codes to send metadata to existing applications on the device Many free apps are available with the ability to scan the codes and hard link to an external URL br br br Virtual stores br QR codes have been used to establish virtual stores where a gallery of product information and QR codes is presented to the customer e g on a train station wall The customers scan the QR codes and the products are delivered to their homes This use started in South Korea and Argentina but is currently expanding globally Walmart Procter Gamble and Woolworths have already adopted the Virtual Store concept br br br QR code payment br br QR codes can be used to store bank account information or credit card information or they can be specifically designed to work with particular payment provider applications There are several trial applications of QR code payments across the world In developing countries including China India and Bangladesh QR code payment is a very popular and convenient method of making payments Since Alipay designed a QR code payment method in mobile payment has been quickly adopted in China As of around of all payments were made via mobile payment br In November QR code payments were deployed on a larger scale in the Czech Republic when an open format for payment information exchange a Short Payment Descriptor was introduced and endorsed by the Czech Banking Association as the official local solution for QR payments In the European Payment Council provided guidelines for the EPC QR code enabling SCT initiation within the Eurozone br In Singapore created a taskforce including government agencies such as the Monetary Authority of Singapore and Infocomm Media Development Authority to spearhead a system for e payments using standardized QR code specifications These specific dimensions are specialized for Singapore br The e payment system Singapore Quick Response Code SGQR essentially merges various QR codes into one label that can be used by both parties in the payment system This allows for various banking apps to facilitate payments between multiple customers and a merchant that displays the single QR code The SGQR scheme is co owned by MAS and IMDA A single SDQR label contains e payments and combines multiple payment options People making purchases can scan the code and see which payment options the merchant accepts br br br Website login br QR codes can be used to log into websites a QR code is shown on the login page on a computer screen and when a registered user scans it with a verified smartphone they will automatically be logged in Authentication is performed by the smartphone which contacts the server Google developed this in br br br Mobile ticket br There is a system whereby a QR code can be displayed on a device such as a smartphone and used as an admission ticket Its use is common for J League and Nippon Professional Baseball tickets in Japan In some cases rights can be transferred via the Internet In Latvia QR codes can be scanned in Riga public transport to validate R gas Satiksme e tickets br br br Restaurant ordering br Restaurants can present a QR code near the front door or at the table allowing guests to view an online menu or even redirect them to an online ordering website or app allowing them to order and or possibly pay for their meal without having to use a cashier or waiter QR codes can also link to daily or weekly specials that are not printed on the standardized menus and enable the establishment to update the entire menu without needing to print copies At table serve restaurants QR codes enable guests to order and pay for their meals without a waiter involved the QR code contains the table number so servers know where to bring the food This application has grown especially since the need for social distancing during the COVID pandemic prompted reduced contact between service staff and customers br br br Joining a Wi Fi network br br By specifying the SSID encryption type password passphrase and if the SSID is hidden or not mobile device users can quickly scan and join networks without having to manually enter the data A MeCard like format is supported by Android and iOS br br Common format WIFI S SSID T WEP WPA nopass P PASSWORD H true false blank br Sample WIFI S MySSID T WPA P MyPassW rd br br br Funerary use br br A QR code can link to an obituary and can be placed on a headstone In Ishinokoe in Yamanashi Prefecture Japan began to sell tombstones with QR codes produced by IT DeSign where the code leads to a virtual grave site of the deceased Other companies such as Wisconsin based Interactive Headstones have also begun implementing QR codes into tombstones In the Jewish Cemetery of La Paz in Uruguay began implementing QR codes for tombstones br br br Electronic authentication br QR codes can be used to generate time based one time passwords for electronic authentication br br br Loyalty programs br QR codes have been used by various retail outlets that have loyalty programs Sometimes these programs are accessed with an app that is loaded onto a phone and includes a process triggered by a QR code scan The QR codes for loyalty programs tend to be found printed on the receipt for a purchase or on the products themselves Users in these schemes collect award points by scanning a code br br br Counterfeit detection br Serialised QR codes have been used by brands and governments to let consumers retailers and distributors verify the authenticity of the products and help with detecting counterfeit products as part of a brand protection program However the security level of a regular QR code is limited since QR codes printed on original products are easily reproduced on fake products even though the analysis of data generated as a result of QR code scanning can be used to detect counterfeiting and illicit activity A higher security level can be attained by embedding a digital watermark or copy detection pattern into the image of the QR code This makes the QR code more secure against counterfeiting attempts products that display a code which is counterfeit although valid as a QR code can be detected by scanning the secure QR code with the appropriate app br The treaty regulating apostilles documents bearing a seal of authenticity has been updated to allow the issuance of digital apostilles by countries a digital apostille is a PDF document with a cryptographic signature containing a QR code for a canonical URL of the original document allowing users to verify the apostille from a printed version of the document br br br Product tracing br br Different studies have been made to assess the effectiveness of QR codes as a means of conveying labelling information and their use as part of a food traceability system In a field experiment it was found that when provided free access to a smartphone with QR code scanning app of participants would use it to access labelling information A study made in South Korea showed that consumers appreciate QR code used in food traceability system as they provide detailed information about food as well as information that helps them in their purchasing decision If QR codes are serialised consumers can access a web page showing the supply chain for each ingredient as well as information specific to each related batch including meat processors and manufacturers which helps address the concerns they have about the origin of their food br br br COVID pandemic br br After the COVID pandemic began spreading QR codes began to be used as a touchless system to display information show menus or provide updated consumer information especially in the hospitality industry Restaurants replaced paper or laminated plastic menus with QR code decals on the table which opened an online version of the menu This prevented the need to dispose of single use paper menus or institute cleaning and sanitizing procedures for permanent menus after each use Local television stations have also begun to utilize codes on local newscasts to allow viewers quicker access to stories or information involving the pandemic including testing and immunization scheduling websites or for links within stories mentioned in the newscasts overall br In Australia patrons were required to scan QR codes at shops clubs supermarkets and other service and retail establishments on entry to assist contact tracing Singapore Taiwan the United Kingdom and New Zealand used similar systems br QR codes are also present on COVID vaccination certificates in places such as Canada and the EU EU Digital COVID certificate where they can be scanned to verify the information on the certificate br br br Design br Unlike the older one dimensional barcodes that were designed to be mechanically scanned by a narrow beam of light a QR code is detected by a dimensional digital image sensor and then digitally analyzed by a programmed processor The processor locates the three distinctive squares at the corners of the QR code image using a smaller square or multiple squares near the fourth corner to normalize the image for size orientation and angle of viewing The small dots throughout the QR code are then converted to binary numbers and validated with an error correcting algorithm br br br Information capacity br The amount of data that can be represented by a QR code symbol depends on the data type mode or input character set version indicating the overall dimensions of the symbol i e version number dots on each side and error correction level The maximum storage capacities occur for version and error correction level L low denoted by L br br Here are some samples of QR codes br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br

br br x br br br br br br br x br br br br br br br br br displaystyle x x x x br br corresponding to the polynomial number with initial root br The Reed Solomon code uses one of different polynomials over br br br br br br F br br br br br br br br displaystyle mathbb F br br with degrees ranging from to depending on how many error correction bytes the code adds It is implied by the form of Reed Solomon used systematic BCH view that these polynomials are all on the form br br br br br br br i br br br br br n br br br br br br x br br br br br i br br br br br br textstyle prod i n x alpha i br br however the rules for selecting the degree br br br br n br br br displaystyle n br br are specific to the QR standard br For example the generator polynomial used for the Version QR code when error correction bytes are used is br br br br br g br br x br br br br x br br br br br br br br br br br br br x br br br br br br br br br br br br br x br br br br br br br br br br br br br x br

alpha x alpha x alpha br br br The highest power of br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br in the polynomial the degree br br br br n br br br displaystyle n br br of the polynomial determines the number of error correction bytes In this case the degree is br When discussing the Reed Solomon code phase there is some risk for confusion in that the QR ISO IEC standard uses the term codeword for the elements of br br br br br br F br br br br br br br br displaystyle mathbb F br br which with respect to the Reed Solomon code are symbols whereas it uses the term block for what with respect to the Reed Solomon code are the codewords The number of data versus error correction bytes within each block depends on i the version side length of the QR symbol and ii the error correction level of which there are four The higher the error correction level the less storage capacity The following table lists the approximate error correction capability at each of the four levels br br In larger QR symbols the message is broken up into several Reed Solomon code blocks The block size is chosen so that no attempt is made at correcting more than errors per block this limits the complexity of the decoding algorithm The code blocks are then interleaved together making it less likely that localized damage to a QR symbol will overwhelm the capacity of any single block br The Version QR symbol with level L error correction for example consists of a single error correction block with a total of code bytes made of message bytes and seven error correction bytes It can correct up to byte errors Hence this code is known as a error correction code over GF br Due to error correction it is possible to create artistic QR codes with embellishments to make them more readable or attractive to the human eye and to incorporate colors logos and other features into the QR code block the embellishments are treated as errors but the codes still scan correctly br It is also possible to design artistic QR codes without reducing the error correction capacity by manipulating the underlying mathematical constructs Image processing algorithms are also used to reduce errors in QR code br br br Encoding br The format information records two things the error correction level and the mask pattern used for the symbol Masking is used to break up patterns in the data area that might confuse a scanner such as large blank areas or misleading features that look like the locator marks The mask patterns are defined on a grid that is repeated as necessary to cover the whole symbol Modules corresponding to the dark areas of the mask are inverted The bit format information is protected from errors with a BCH code and two complete copies are included in each QR symbol A triple error correcting BCH code over GF is used having the generator polynomial br br br br g br br x br br br br x br br br br br br br x br br br br br br br x br br br br br br br x br br br br br br br x br br br br br br x br br br br br displaystyle g x x x x x x x br br It can correct at most bit errors out of the data bits There are a total of bits in this BCH code bits are added for error correction This bit code is itself X ORed with a fixed bit mask pattern to prevent an all zero string br The message dataset is placed from right to left in a zigzag pattern as shown below In larger symbols this is complicated by the presence of the alignment patterns and the use of multiple interleaved error correction blocks br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br The general structure of a QR encoding is as a sequence of bit indicators with payload length dependent on the indicator mode e g byte encoding payload length is dependent on the first byte br br Four bit indicators are used to select the encoding mode and convey other information br br Encoding modes can be mixed as needed within a QR symbol e g a url with a long string of alphanumeric characters br br After every indicator that selects an encoding mode is a length field that tells how many characters are encoded in that mode The number of bits in the length field depends on the encoding and the symbol version br br Alphanumeric encoding mode stores a message more compactly than the byte mode can but cannot store lower case letters and has only a limited selection of punctuation marks which are sufficient for rudimentary web addresses Two characters are coded in an bit value by this formula br br V C C br This has the exception that the last character in an alphanumeric string with an odd length is read as a bit value instead br br br Decoding example br The following images offer more information about the QR code br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Variants br br br Model br Model QR code is an older version of the specification It is visually similar to the widely seen model codes but lacks alignment patterns Differences are in the bottom right corner and in the midsections of the bottom and right edges are additional functional regions br br br br br br br br br br br br Micro QR code br Micro QR code is a smaller version of the QR code standard for applications where symbol size is limited There are four different versions sizes of Micro QR codes the smallest is modules the largest can hold numeric characters or ASCII alphanumeric characters or bytes bits br br br br br br br br br br br br Rectangular Micro QR Code br br Rectangular Micro QR Code also known as rMQR Code is two dimensional D matrix barcode invented and standardized in by Denso Wave as ISO IEC rMQR Code is designed as a rectangular variation of QR code and has the same parameters and applications as original QR code But rMQR Code is more suitable for the rectangular areas and has difference between width and height up to in R x version br br br br br br br br iQR code br iQR code is an alternative to existing square QR codes developed by Denso Wave iQR codes can be created in square or rectangular formations this is intended for situations where a longer and narrower rectangular shape is more suitable such as on cylindrical objects iQR codes can fit the same amount of information in less space There are versions of square iQR codes and versions of rectangular codes For squares the minimum size is modules rectangles have a minimum of modules iQR codes add error correction level S which allows for error correction iQR Codes had not been given an ISO IEC specification as of and only proprietary Denso Wave products could create or read iQR codes br br br br br br br br Secure QR code br Secure Quick Response SQR code is a QR code that contains a private data segment after the terminator instead of the specified filler bytes ec This private data segment must be deciphered with an encryption key This can be used to store private information and to manage a company s internal information br br br Frame QR br br Frame QR is a QR code with a canvas area that can be flexibly used In the center of this code is the canvas area where graphics letters and more can be flexibly arranged making it possible to lay out the code without losing the design of illustrations photos etc br br br HCC D br br Researchers have proposed a new High Capacity Colored Dimensional HCC D Code which builds upon a QR code basis for preserving the QR robustness to distortions and uses colors for increasing data density as of it is still in prototyping phase The HCC D code specification is described in details in Querini et al while techniques for color classification of HCC D code cells are described in detail in Querini and Italiano which is an extended version of Querini and Italiano br Introducing colors into QR codes requires addressing additional issues In particular during QR code reading only the brightness information is taken into account while HCC D codes have to cope with chromatic distortions during the decoding phase In order to ensure adaptation to chromatic distortions that arise in each scanned code HCC D codes make use of an additional field the Color Palette Pattern This is because color cells of a Color Palette Pattern are supposed to be distorted in the same way as color cells of the Encoding Region Replicated color palettes are used for training machine learning classifiers br br br AQR br Accessible QR is a type of QR code that combines a standard QR code with a dot dash pattern positioned around one corner of the code to provide product information for people who are blind and partially sighted The codes announce product categories and product details such as instructions ingredients safety warnings and recycling information The data is structured for the needs of users who are blind or partially sighted and offers larger text or audio output It can read QR codes from a metre away activating the smartphone s accessibility features like VoiceOver to announce product details br br br License br The use of QR code technology is freely licensed as long as users follow the standards for QR code documented with JIS or ISO IEC Non standardized codes may require special licensing br Denso Wave owns a number of patents on QR code technology but has chosen to exercise them in a limited fashion In order to promote widespread usage of the technology Denso Wave chose to waive its rights to a key patent in its possession for standardized codes only In the US the granted QR code patent is and in Japan both of which have expired The European Patent Office granted patent to Denso Wave which was then validated into French UK and German patents all of which expired in March br The text QR Code itself is a registered trademark and wordmark of Denso Wave Incorporated In UK the trademark is registered as E the term QR Code with a filing date of September The UK version of the trademark is based on the Kabushiki Kaisha Denso DENSO CORPORATION trademark filed as Trademark the term QR Code on September and registered on December with the European Union OHIM Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market br The U S Trademark for the term QR Code is Trademark and was filed on September with an amended registration date of March assigned to Denso Corporation In South Korea trademark application filed on November was refused at March because the Korean Intellectual Property Office viewed that the phrase was genericized among South Korean people to refer to matrix barcodes in general br br br Risks br The only context in which common QR codes can carry executable data is the URL data type These URLs may host JavaScript code which can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in applications on the host system such as the reader the web browser or the image viewer since a reader will typically send the data to the application associated with the data type used by the QR code br In the case of no software exploits malicious QR codes combined with a permissive reader can still put a computer s contents and user s privacy at risk This practice is known as attagging a portmanteau of attack tagging They are easily created and can be affixed over legitimate QR codes On a smartphone the reader s permissions may allow use of the camera full Internet access read write contact data GPS read browser history read write local storage and global system changes br Risks include linking to dangerous web sites with browser exploits enabling the microphone camera GPS and then streaming those feeds to a remote server analysis of sensitive data passwords files contacts transactions and sending email SMS IM messages or packets for DDoS as part of a botnet corrupting privacy settings stealing identity and even containing malicious logic themselves such as JavaScript or a virus These actions could occur in the background while the user is only seeing the reader opening a seemingly harmless web page In Russia a malicious QR code caused phones that scanned it to send premium texts at a fee of each QR codes have also been linked to scams in which stickers are placed on parking meters posing as quick payment options as seen in Austin San Antonio
