A chatbot originally chatterbot is a software application or web interface that is designed to mimic human conversation through text or voice interactions Modern chatbots are typically online and use generative artificial intelligence systems that are capable of maintaining a conversation with a user in natural language and simulating the way a human would behave as a conversational partner Such chatbots often use deep learning and natural language processing but simpler chatbots have existed for decades br Since late the field has gained widespread attention due to the popularity of OpenAI s ChatGPT followed by alternatives such as Microsoft s Copilot and Google s Gemini Such examples reflect the recent practice of basing such products upon broad foundational large language models such as GPT or the Gemini language model that get fine tuned so as to target specific tasks or applications i e simulating human conversation in the case of chatbots Chatbots can also be designed or customized to further target even more specific situations and or particular subject matter domains br A major area where chatbots have long been used is in customer service and support with various sorts of virtual assistants Companies spanning a wide range of industries have begun using the latest generative artificial intelligence technologies to power more advanced developments in such areas br As chatbots work by predicting responses rather than knowing the meaning of their responses this means they can produce coherent sounding but inaccurate or fabricated content referred to as hallucinations When humans use and apply chatbot content contaminated with hallucinations this results in botshit Given the increasing adoption and use of chatbots for generating content there are concerns that this technology will significantly reduce the cost it takes humans to generate spread and consume botshit br br br Background br In Alan Turing s famous article Computing Machinery and Intelligence was published which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence This criterion depends on the ability of a computer program to impersonate a human in a real time written conversation with a human judge to the extent that the judge is unable to distinguish reliably on the basis of the conversational content alone between the program and a real human The notoriety of Turing s proposed test stimulated great interest in Joseph Weizenbaum s program ELIZA published in which seemed to be able to fool users into believing that they were conversing with a real human However Weizenbaum himself did not claim that ELIZA was genuinely intelligent and the introduction to his paper presented it more as a debunking exercise br br In artificial intelligence machines are made to behave in wondrous ways often sufficient to dazzle even the most experienced observer But once a particular program is unmasked once its inner workings are explained its magic crumbles away it stands revealed as a mere collection of procedures The observer says to himself I could have written that With that thought he moves the program in question from the shelf marked intelligent to that reserved for curios The object of this paper is to cause just such a re evaluation of the program about to be explained Few programs ever needed it more br ELIZA s key method of operation copied by chatbot designers ever since involves the recognition of clue words or phrases in the input and the output of the corresponding pre prepared or pre programmed responses that can move the conversation forward in an apparently meaningful way e g by responding to any input that contains the word MOTHER with TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY Thus an illusion of understanding is generated even though the processing involved has been merely superficial ELIZA showed that such an illusion is surprisingly easy to generate because human judges are so ready to give the benefit of the doubt when conversational responses are capable of being interpreted as intelligent br Interface designers have come to appreciate that humans readiness to interpret computer output as genuinely conversational even when it is actually based on rather simple pattern matching can be exploited for useful purposes Most people prefer to engage with programs that are human like and this gives chatbot style techniques a potentially useful role in interactive systems that need to elicit information from users as long as that information is relatively straightforward and falls into predictable categories Thus for example online help systems can usefully employ chatbot techniques to identify the area of help that users require potentially providing a friendlier interface than a more formal search or menu system This sort of usage holds the prospect of moving chatbot technology from Weizenbaum s shelf reserved for curios to that marked genuinely useful computational methods br br br Development br Among the most notable early chatbots are ELIZA and PARRY More recent notable programs include A L I C E Jabberwacky and D U D E Agence Nationale de la Recherche and CNRS While ELIZA and PARRY were used exclusively to simulate typed conversation many chatbots now include other functional features such as games and web searching abilities In a book called The Policeman s Beard is Half Constructed was published allegedly written by the chatbot Racter though the program as released would not have been capable of doing so br From to some time after the CYRUS project led by Janet Kolodner constructed a chatbot simulating Cyrus Vance th United States Secretary of State It used case based reasoning and updated its database daily by parsing wire news from United Press International The program was unable to process the news items subsequent to the surprise resignation of Cyrus Vance in April and the team constructed another chatbot simulating his successor Edmund Muskie br One pertinent field of AI research is natural language processing Usually weak AI fields employ specialized software or programming languages created specifically for the narrow function required For example A L I C E uses a markup language called AIML which is specific to its function as a conversational agent and has since been adopted by various other developers of so called Alicebots Nevertheless A L I C E is still purely based on pattern matching techniques without any reasoning capabilities the same technique ELIZA was using back in This is not strong AI which would require sapience and logical reasoning abilities br Jabberwacky learns new responses and context based on real time user interactions rather than being driven from a static database Some more recent chatbots also combine real time learning with evolutionary algorithms that optimize their ability to communicate based on each conversation held Still there is currently no general purpose conversational artificial intelligence and some software developers focus on the practical aspect information retrieval br Chatbot competitions focus on the Turing test or more specific goals Two such annual contests are the Loebner Prize and The Chatterbox Challenge the latter has been offline since however materials can still be found from web archives br Chatbots may use artificial neural networks as a language model For example generative pre trained transformers GPT which use the transformer architecture have become common to build sophisticated chatbots The pre training in its name refers to the initial training process on a large text corpus which provides a solid foundation for the model to perform well on downstream tasks with limited amounts of task specific data An example of a GPT chatbot is ChatGPT Despite criticism of its accuracy and tendency to hallucinate that is to confidently output false information and even cite non existent sources ChatGPT has gained attention for its detailed responses and historical knowledge Another example is BioGPT developed by Microsoft which focuses on answering biomedical questions In November Amazon announced a new chatbot called Q for people to use at work br DBpedia created a chatbot during the GSoC of It can communicate through Facebook Messenger see Master of Code Global article br br br Application br br br Messaging apps br Many companies chatbots run on messaging apps or simply via SMS They are used for B C customer service sales and marketing br In Facebook Messenger allowed developers to place chatbots on their platform There were bots created for Messenger in the first six months rising to by September br Since September this has also been as part of a pilot program on WhatsApp Airlines KLM and Aerom xico both announced their participation in the testing both airlines had previously launched customer services on the Facebook Messenger platform br The bots usually appear as one of the user s contacts but can sometimes act as participants in a group chat br Many banks insurers media companies e commerce companies airlines hotel chains retailers health care providers government entities and restaurant chains have used chatbots to answer simple questions increase customer engagement for promotion and to offer additional ways to order from them Chatbots are also used in market research to collect short survey responses br A study showed of companies used chatbots According to a study of businesses said they intended to have one by br br br As part of company apps and websites br Previous generations of chatbots were present on company websites e g Ask Jenn from Alaska Airlines which debuted in or Expedia s virtual customer service agent which launched in The newer generation of chatbots includes IBM Watson powered Rocky introduced in February by the New York City based e commerce company Rare Carat to provide information to prospective diamond buyers br br br Chatbot sequences br Used by marketers to script sequences of messages very similar to an autoresponder sequence Such sequences can be triggered by user opt in or the use of keywords within user interactions After a trigger occurs a sequence of messages is delivered until the next anticipated user response Each user response is used in the decision tree to help the chatbot navigate the response sequences to deliver the correct response message br br br Company internal platforms br Other companies explore ways they can use chatbots internally for example for Customer Support Human Resources or even in Internet of Things IoT projects Overstock com for one has reportedly launched a chatbot named Mila to automate certain simple yet time consuming processes when requesting sick leave Other large companies such as Lloyds Banking Group Royal Bank of Scotland Renault and Citro n are now using automated online assistants instead of call centres with humans to provide a first point of contact A SaaS chatbot business ecosystem has been steadily growing since the F Conference when Facebook s Mark Zuckerberg unveiled that Messenger would allow chatbots into the app In large companies like in hospitals and aviation organizations IT architects are designing reference architectures for Intelligent Chatbots that are used to unlock and share knowledge and experience in the organization more efficiently and reduce the errors in answers from expert service desks significantly These Intelligent Chatbots make use of all kinds of artificial intelligence like image moderation and natural language understanding NLU natural language generation NLG machine learning and deep learning br br br Customer service br Chatbots have great potential to serve as an alternate source for customer service Many high tech banking organizations are looking to integrate automated AI based solutions such as chatbots into their customer service in order to provide faster and cheaper assistance to their clients who are becoming increasingly comfortable with technology In particular chatbots can efficiently conduct a dialogue usually replacing other communication tools such as email phone or SMS In banking their major application is related to quick customer service answering common requests as well as transactional support br Deep learning techniques can be incorporated into chatbot applications to allow them to map conversations between users and customer service agents especially in social media Research has shown that methods incorporating deep learning can learn writing styles from a brand and transfer them to another promoting the brand s image on social media platforms Chatbots can create new ways of brands and user interactions which can help improve the brand s performance and allow users to gain social information and economic benefits br Several studies report significant reduction in the cost of customer services expected to lead to billions of dollars of economic savings in the next ten years In Gartner predicted that by of all customer service interactions globally will be handled completely by AI A study by Juniper Research in estimates retail sales resulting from chatbot based interactions will reach billion by br Since when Facebook allowed businesses to deliver automated customer support e commerce guidance content and interactive experiences through chatbots a large variety of chatbots were developed for the Facebook Messenger platform br In Russia based Tochka Bank launched the world s first Facebook bot for a range of financial services including a possibility of making payments br In July Barclays Africa also launched a Facebook chatbot making it the first bank to do so in Africa br The France s third largest bank by total assets Soci t G n rale launched their chatbot called SoBot in March While of users of the SoBot expressed their satisfaction after having tested it Soci t G n rale deputy director Bertrand Cozzarolo stated that it will never replace the expertise provided by a human advisor br br The advantages of using chatbots for customer interactions in banking include cost reduction financial advice and support br br br Healthcare br br Chatbots are also appearing in the healthcare industry A study suggested that physicians in the United States believed that chatbots would be most beneficial for scheduling doctor appointments locating health clinics or providing medication information br The GPT chatbot ChatGPT is able to answer user queries related to health promotion and disease prevention such as screening and vaccination Whatsapp has teamed up with the World Health Organization WHO to make a chatbot service that answers users questions on COVID br In The Indian Government launched a chatbot called MyGov Corona Helpdesk that worked through Whatsapp and helped people access information about the Coronavirus COVID pandemic br Certain patient groups are still reluctant to use chatbots A mixed methods study showed that people are still hesitant to use chatbots for their healthcare due to poor understanding of the technological complexity the lack of empathy and concerns about cyber security The analysis showed that while had heard of a health chatbot and had experience of using it perceived themselves as likely to use one within months The majority of participants would use a health chatbot for seeking general health information booking a medical appointment and looking for local health services However a health chatbot was perceived as less suitable for seeking results of medical tests and seeking specialist advice such as sexual health br The analysis of attitudinal variables showed that most participants reported their preference for discussing their health with doctors and having access to reliable and accurate health information While were curious about new technologies that could improve their health reported only seeking a doctor when experiencing a health problem and thought that a chatbot was a good idea reported dislike about talking to computers felt it would be strange to discuss health matters with a chatbot and about half were unsure if they could trust the advice given by a chatbot Therefore perceived trustworthiness individual attitudes towards bots and dislike for talking to computers are the main barriers to health chatbots br br br Politics br br In New Zealand the chatbot SAM short for Semantic Analysis Machine made by Nick Gerritsen of Touchtech has been developed It is designed to share its political thoughts for example on topics such as climate change healthcare and education etc It talks to people through Facebook Messenger br In the chatbot Leader Lars or Leder Lars was nominated for The Synthetic Party to run in the Danish parliamentary election and was built by the artist collective Computer Lars Leader Lars differed from earlier virtual politicians by leading a political party and by not pretending to be an objective candidate This chatbot engaged in critical discussions on politics with users from around the world br In India the state government has launched a chatbot for its Aaple Sarkar platform which provides conversational access to information regarding public services managed br br br Government br Chatbots have been used at different levels of government departments including local national and regional contexts Chatbots are used to provide services like citizenship and immigration court administrations financial aid and migrants rights inquiries For example EMMA answers more than inquiries monthly regarding services on citizenship and immigration in the US br br br Toys br Chatbots have also been incorporated into devices not primarily meant for computing such as toys br Hello Barbie is an Internet connected version of the doll that uses a chatbot provided by the company ToyTalk which previously used the chatbot for a range of smartphone based characters for children These characters behaviors are constrained by a set of rules that in effect emulate a particular character and produce a storyline br The My Friend Cayla doll was marketed as a line of inch cm dolls which uses speech recognition technology in conjunction with an Android or iOS mobile app to recognize the child s speech and have a conversation Like the Hello Barbie doll it attracted controversy due to vulnerabilities with the doll s Bluetooth stack and its use of data collected from the child s speech br IBM s Watson computer has been used as the basis for chatbot based educational toys for companies such as CogniToys intended to interact with children for educational purposes br br br Malicious use br Malicious chatbots are frequently used to fill chat rooms with spam and advertisements by mimicking human behavior and conversations or to entice people into revealing personal information such as bank account numbers They were commonly found on Yahoo Messenger Windows Live Messenger AOL Instant Messenger and other instant messaging protocols There has also been a published report of a chatbot used in a fake personal ad on a dating service s website br Tay an AI chatbot designed to learn from previous interaction caused major controversy due to it being targeted by internet trolls on Twitter Soon after its launch the bot was exploited and with its repeat after me capability it started releasing racist sexist and controversial responses to Twitter users This suggests that although the bot learned effectively from experience adequate protection was not put in place to prevent misuse br If a text sending algorithm can pass itself off as a human instead of a chatbot its message would be more credible Therefore human seeming chatbots with well crafted online identities could start scattering fake news that seems plausible for instance making false claims during an election With enough chatbots it might be even possible to achieve artificial social proof br br br Data security br Data security is one of the major concerns of chatbot technologies Security threats and system vulnerabilities are weaknesses that are often exploited by malicious users Storage of user data and past communication that is highly valuable for training and development of chatbots can also give rise to security threats Chatbots operating on third party networks may be subject to various security issues if owners of the third party applications have policies regarding user data that differ from those of the chatbot Security threats can be reduced or prevented by incorporating protective mechanisms User authentication chat End to end encryption and self destructing messages are some effective solutions to resist potential security threats br br br Limitations of chatbots br The creation and implementation of chatbots is still a developing area heavily related to artificial intelligence and machine learning so the provided solutions while possessing obvious advantages have some important limitations in terms of functionalities and use cases However this is changing over time br The most common limitations are listed below br br As the input output database is fixed and limited chatbots can fail while dealing with an unsaved query br A chatbot s efficiency highly depends on language processing and is limited because of irregularities such as accents and mistakes br Chatbots are unable to deal with multiple questions at the same time and so conversation opportunities are limited br Chatbots require a large amount of conversational data to train Generative models which are based on deep learning algorithms to generate new responses word by word based on user input are usually trained on a large dataset of natural language phrases br Chatbots have difficulty managing non linear conversations that must go back and forth on a topic with a user br As it happens usually with technology led changes in existing services some consumers more often than not from older generations are uncomfortable with chatbots due to their limited understanding making it obvious that their requests are being dealt with by machines br In US based National Eating Disorders Association replaced its human helpline staff with a chatbot but had to take it offline after users reported receiving harmful advice from it br br br Chatbots and jobs br Chatbots are increasingly present in businesses and often are used to automate tasks that do not require skill based talents With customer service taking place via messaging apps as well as phone calls there are growing numbers of use cases where chatbot deployment gives organizations a clear return on investment Call center workers may be particularly at risk from AI driven chatbots br Chatbot jobs br Chatbot developers create debug and maintain applications that automate customer services or other communication processes Their duties include reviewing and simplifying code when needed They may also help companies implement bots in their operations br A study by Forrester June predicted that of all jobs would be impacted by AI technologies by br Prompt Engineering the task of designing and refining prompts inputs leading to desired AI generated responses has gained significant demand and popularity in recent years with the advent of sophisticated models notably OpenAI s GPT series which still contain notable flaws and limitations as previously outlined br br br See also br br br br br br Further reading br Gertner Jon Wikipedia s
