title: Videotelephony
id: 2304367
Videotelephony also known as videoconferencing or video call is the use of audio and video for simultaneous two way communication br There are many terms to refer to videotelephony Videophones are standalone devices for video calling compare Telephone In the present day devices like smartphones and computers are capable of video calling reducing the demand for separate videophones Videoconferencing implies group communication Videoconferencing is used in telepresence whose goal is to create the illusion that remote participants are in the same room br The concept of videotelephony was conceived in the late th century and versions were available to the public starting in the s Early demonstrations were installed at booths in post offices and shown at various world expositions In AT T launched the first commercial personal videotelephone system In addition to videophones there existed image phones which exchanged still images between units every few seconds over conventional telephone lines The development of advanced video codecs more powerful CPUs and high bandwidth Internet service in the late s allowed digital videophones to provide high quality low cost color service between users almost any place in the world Today videotelephony is widespread br Applications of videotelephony include sign language transmission for deaf and speech impaired people distance education telemedicine and overcoming mobility issues News media organizations have used videotelephony for broadcasting br br br History br br br Origin br The concept of videotelephony was first conceived in the late s both in the United States and in Europe although the basic sciences to permit its very earliest trials would take nearly a half century to be discovered The prerequisite knowledge arose from intensive research and experimentation in several telecommunication fields notably electrical telegraphy telephony radio and television br br br Early systems br Simple analog videophone communication could be established as early as the invention of the television Such an antecedent usually consisted of two closed circuit television systems connected via coax cable or radio An example of that was the German Reich Postzentralamt post office videotelephone network serving Berlin and several German cities via coaxial cables between and br The development of videotelephony as a subscription service started in the latter half of the s in the United Kingdom and the United States spurred notably by John Logie Baird and AT T s Bell Labs This occurred in part at least with AT T to serve as an adjunct supplementing the use of the telephone A number of organizations believed that videotelephony would be superior to plain voice communications Attempts at using normal telephony networks to transmit slow scan video such as the first systems developed by AT T Corporation first researched in the s failed mostly due to the poor picture quality and the lack of efficient video compression techniques br During the first crewed space flights NASA used two radio frequency UHF or VHF video links one in each direction TV channels routinely use this type of videotelephony when reporting from distant locations The news media were to become regular users of mobile links to satellites using specially equipped trucks and much later via special satellite videophones in a briefcase This technique was very expensive though and was not adopted for applications such as telemedicine distance education and business meetings br Decades of research and development culminated in the commercial launch of AT T s Picturephone service available in select cities However the system was a commercial failure chiefly due to consumer apathy high subscription costs and lack of network effect with only a few hundred Picturephones in the world users had extremely few contacts they could actually call and interoperability with other videophone systems would not exist for decades br br br Digital br In the s digital telephony transmission networks became possible such as with ISDN networks During this time there was also research into other forms of digital video and audio communication Many of these technologies such as the Media space are not as widely used today as videoconferencing but were still an important area of research The first dedicated systems started to appear as ISDN networks were expanding throughout the world One of the first commercial videoconferencing systems sold to companies came from PictureTel Corp which had an initial public offering in November br In Concept Communication in the United States created a circuit board for standard personal computers that doubled the video frame rate of typical digital videotelephone systems from to frames per second and reduced the cost from to The company also secured a patent for a codec for full motion videoconferencing first demonstrated at AT T Bell Labs in br br Very expensive videoconferencing systems continued to rapidly evolve throughout the s and s Proprietary equipment software and network requirements gave way to standards based technologies that were available for anyone to purchase at a reasonable cost br While videoconferencing technology was initially used primarily within internal corporate communication networks one of the first community service uses of the technology started in through a unique partnership with PictureTel and IBM which at the time were promoting a jointly developed desktop based videoconferencing product known as the PCS Over the next years Project DIANE Diversified Information and Assistance Network grew to use a variety of videoconferencing platforms to create a multi state cooperative public service and distance education network consisting of several hundred schools libraries science museums zoos and parks and many other community oriented organizations br br br Transition to internet and mobile devices br Advances in video compression allowed digital video streams to be transmitted over the Internet which was previously difficult due to the impractically high bandwidth requirements of uncompressed video The DCT algorithm was the basis for the first practical video coding standard that was useful for online videoconferencing H standardised by the ITU T in and subsequent H x video coding standards br In CU SeeMe was developed at Cornell by Tim Dorcey et al In the first public videoconference between North America and Africa took place linking a technofair in San Francisco with a techno rave and cyberdeli in Cape Town At the Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Nagano Japan Seiji Ozawa conducted the Ode to Joy from Beethoven s Ninth Symphony simultaneously across five continents in near real time br br Kyocera conducted a two year development campaign from to that resulted in the release of the VP Visual Phone the first mobile colour videophone that also doubled as a camera phone for still photos The camera phone was the same size as similar contemporary mobile phones but sported a large camera lens and a cm inch colour TFT display capable of displaying colors and was able to process two video frames per second br Videotelephony was popularized in the s via free Internet services such as Skype and iChat web plugins supporting H x video standards and online telecommunication programs that promoted low cost albeit lower quality videoconferencing to virtually every location with an Internet connection br Videotelephony became even more widespread through the deployment of video enabled mobile phones such as s iPhone plus videoconferencing and computer webcams which use Internet telephony In the upper echelons of government business and commerce telepresence technology an advanced form of videoconferencing has helped reduce the need to travel br br br Additional history br In May the first high definition videoconferencing systems produced by LifeSize Communications were displayed at the Interop trade show in Las Vegas Nevada able to provide video at frames per second with a by display resolution Polycom introduced its first high definition videoconferencing system to the market in As of the s high definition resolution for videoconferencing became a popular feature with most major suppliers in the videoconferencing market offering it br Technological developments by videoconferencing developers in the s have extended the capabilities of videoconferencing systems beyond the boardroom for use with hand held mobile devices that combine the use of video audio and on screen drawing capabilities broadcasting in real time over secure networks independent of location Mobile collaboration systems now allow people in previously unreachable locations such as workers on an offshore oil rig the ability to view and discuss issues with colleagues thousands of miles away Traditional videoconferencing system manufacturers have begun providing mobile applications as well such as those that allow for live and still image streaming br The highest ever video call other than those from aircraft and spacecraft took place on May when British adventurer Daniel Hughes used a smartphone with a BGAN satellite modem to make a videocall to the BBC from the summit of Mount Everest at metres ft above sea level br The COVID pandemic resulted in a significant increase in the use of videoconferencing Berstein Research found that Zoom added more subscribers during the first two months of alone than in the entire year GoToMeeting had a percent increase in usage according to LogMeIn UK based StarLeaf reported a percent increase in national call volumes Videoconferencing became so widespread during the pandemic that the term Zoom fatigue came to prominence referring to the taxing nature of spending long periods of time on videocalls This fatigue refers to the psychological and physiological effects participants involved in videoconferencing One experimental study from revealed a link between camera use in videoconferencing and a prediction of fatigue occurrence an individual Furthermore a article in the journal Computers in Human Behaviour highlighted a study linking negative attitudes with the use of self view when videoconferencing br On September Facebook launched two new versions of its Portal video calling devices the Portal Go and Portal Plus The new video calling devices include the first portable variety of the hardware and number of updates br br br Major categories br br Videotelephony can be categorized by its functionality and intended purpose and also by its method of transmission br Videophones were the earliest form of videotelephony dating back to initial tests in by AT T During the late s the post offices of several European governments established public videophone services for person to person communications using dual cable circuit telephone transmission technology In the present day standalone videophones and UMTS video enabled mobile phones are usually used on a person to person basis br Videoconferencing saw its earliest use with AT T s Picturephone service in the early s Transmissions were analog over short distances but converted to digital forms for longer calls again using telephone transmission technology Popular corporate video conferencing systems in the present day have migrated almost exclusively to digital ISDN and IP transmission modes due to the need to convey the very large amounts of data generated by their cameras and microphones These systems are often intended for use in conference mode that is by many people in several different locations all of whom can be viewed by every participant at each location br Telepresence systems are a newer more advanced subset of videoconferencing systems meant to allow higher degrees of video and audio fidelity Such high end systems are typically deployed in corporate settings br Mobile collaboration systems are another recent development combining the use of video audio and on screen drawing capabilities using newest generation hand held electronic devices broadcasting over secure networks enabling multi party conferencing in real time independent of location Proximity chat is another alternative mode focused on the flexibility of small group conversations br A more recent technology encompassing these functions is TV cams TV cams enable people to make video calls using video calling services like Skype on their TV without using a PC connection TV cams are specially designed video cameras that feed images in real time to another TV camera or other compatible computing devices like smartphones tablets and computers br Webcams are popular relatively low cost devices that can provide live video and audio streams via personal computers and can be used with many software clients for both video calls and videoconferencing br Each of the systems has its own advantages and disadvantages including video quality capital cost degrees of sophistication transmission capacity requirements and cost of use br br br By cost and quality of service br From the least to the most expensive systems br br Web camera videophone and videoconferencing systems either stand alone or built in that serve as complements to personal computers connected to other participants by computer and VoIP networks lowest direct cost assuming the users already possess computers at their respective locations Quality of service can range from low to very high including high definition video available on the latest model webcams A related and similar device is a TV camera which is usually small sits on top of a TV and can connect to it via its HDMI port similar to how a webcam attaches to a computer via a USB port br Videophones low to midrange cost The earliest standalone models operated over either plain old telephone service POTS lines on the PSTN telephone networks or more expensive ISDN lines while newer models have largely migrated to Internet Protocol line service for higher image resolutions and sound quality Quality of service for standalone videophones can vary from low to high br Huddle room or all in one systems low to midrange cost newer endpoint category based on standard videoconferencing systems but defined by the camera microphone s speakers and codec contained in a single piece of hardware Typically used in small to medium spaces where beamforming microphone arrays located in the system are sufficient in lieu of table or ceiling microphones in closer proximity to the in room participants Quality of service is comparable to standard videoconferencing systems varying from moderate to high Some manufacturers huddle room systems do not include the codec within the soundbar shaped unit rather only camera microphone and speakers These systems are usually still classified as huddle room systems but like webcams rely on a USB connection to an external device usually a PC to process the video codec responsibilities Despite its name video conferencing systems for Huddle Rooms prevent participants from huddling close together to be seen in the camera All in one systems for these types of rooms range from wide angles such as Horizontal field of view FOV to as much as FOV that allow a full view of the room br Videoconferencing systems midrange cost usually using multipoint control units or other bridging services to allow multiple parties on videoconference calls Quality of service can vary from moderate to high br Telepresence systems highest capabilities and highest cost Full high end systems can involve specially built teleconference rooms to allow expansive views with very high levels of audio and video fidelity to permit an immersive videoconference When the proper type and capacity transmission lines are provided between facilities the quality of service reaches state of the art levels br br br Security concerns br Computer security experts have shown that poorly configured or inadequately supervised videoconferencing systems can permit an easy virtual entry by computer hackers and criminals into company premises and corporate boardrooms br br br Adoption br For over a century futurists have envisioned a future where telephone conversations will take place as actual face to face encounters with video as well as audio Sometimes it is simply not possible or practical to have face to face meetings with two or more people Sometimes a telephone conversation or conference call is adequate Other times e mail exchanges are adequate However videoconferencing adds another option and can be considered when br br A live conversation is needed br Non verbal visual information is an important component of the conversation br The parties of the conversation cannot physically come to the same location br The expense or time of travel is a consideration br Bill Gates said in that he used videoconferencing three or four times a year because digital scheduling was difficult and if the overhead is super high then you might as well just have a face to face meeting Some observers argue that three outstanding issues have prevented videoconferencing from becoming a widely adopted form of communication despite the ubiquity of videoconferencing capable systems br br Eye contact Eye contact plays a large role in conversational turn taking perceived attention and intent and other aspects of group communication While traditional telephone conversations give no eye contact cues many videoconferencing systems are arguably worse in that they provide an incorrect impression that the remote interlocutor is avoiding eye contact Some telepresence systems have cameras located in the screens that reduce the amount of parallax observed by the users This issue is also being addressed through research that generates a synthetic image with eye contact using stereo reconstruction Telcordia Technologies formerly Bell Communications Research owns a patent for eye to eye videoconferencing using rear projection screens with the video camera behind it evolved from a s U S military system that provided videoconferencing services between the White House and various other government and military facilities This technique eliminates the need for special cameras or image processing br Appearance consciousness A second psychological problem with videoconferencing is being on camera with the video stream possibly even being recorded The burden of presenting an acceptable on screen appearance is not present in audio only communication Early studies by Alphonse Chapanis found that the addition of video actually impaired communication possibly because of the consciousness of being on camera br Signal latency The information transport of digital signals in many steps need time In a telecommunicated conversation an increased latency time lag larger than about ms becomes noticeable and is soon observed as unnatural and distracting Therefore next to a stable large bandwidth a small total round trip time is another major technical requirement for the communication channel for interactive videoconferencing br Bandwidth and quality of service In some countries it is difficult or expensive to get a high quality connection that is fast enough for good quality videoconferencing Technologies such as ADSL are usually provided as two separate lines for uplink downlink because each has limited upload speeds and cannot upload and download simultaneously at full speed As Internet speeds increase higher quality and high definition videoconferencing will become more readily available br Complexity of systems Most users are not technically experienced and want a simple interface In hardware systems an unplugged cord or an unresponsive remote control is seen as a failure contributing to a perceived unreliability Successful systems are backed by support teams who can provide fast assistance when required br Perceived lack of interoperability Not all systems can readily interconnect for example ISDN and IP systems require a gateway Popular software solutions cannot easily connect to hardware systems Some systems use different standards features and qualities which can require additional configuration when connecting to dissimilar systems Free software systems circumvent this limitation by making it relatively easy for a single user to communicate over multiple incompatible platforms br Expense of commercial systems Well designed telepresence systems require specially designed rooms which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to fit out their rooms with codecs integration equipment such as Multipoint Control Units high fidelity sound systems and furniture Monthly charges may also be required for bridging services and high capacity broadband service br These are some of the reasons many organizations only use the systems internally where there is less risk of loss of customers An alternative for those lacking dedicated facilities is the rental of videoconferencing equipped meeting rooms in cities around the world Clients can book rooms and turn up for the meeting with all technical aspects being prearranged and support being readily available if needed The issue of eye contact may be solved with advancing technology including smartphones which have the screen and camera in essentially the same place In developed countries the near ubiquity of smartphones tablet computers and computers with built in audio and webcams removes the need for expensive dedicated hardware br br br Technology br br br Components and types br br The core technology used in a videotelephony system is digital compression of audio and video streams in real time The hardware or software that performs compression is called a codec coder decoder Compression rates of up to can be achieved The resulting digital stream of s and s is subdivided into labeled packets which are then transmitted through a digital network of some kind usually ISDN or IP br The other components required for a videoconferencing system include br br Video input PTZ Fisheye video camera or webcam br Video output computer monitor television or projector br Audio input microphones CD DVD player cassette player or any other source of PreAmp audio outlet br Audio output usually loudspeakers associated with the display device or telephone br Data transfer analog or digital telephone network LAN or Internet br Computer a data processing unit that ties together the other components does the compressing and decompressing and initiates and maintains the data linkage via the network br There are basically three kinds of videoconferencing and videophone systems br br Dedicated systems have all required components packaged into a single piece of equipment usually a console with a high quality remote controlled video camera These cameras can be controlled at a distance to pan left and right tilt up and down and zoom They became known as PTZ cameras The console contains all electrical interfaces the control computer and the software or hardware based codec Omnidirectional microphones are connected to the console as well as a TV monitor with loudspeakers and or a video projector There are several types of dedicated videoconferencing devices br Large group videoconferencing are built in large expensive devices used for large rooms such as conference rooms and auditoriums br Small group videoconferencing are either non portable or portable smaller less expensive devices used for small meeting rooms br Individual videoconferencing are usually portable devices meant for single users and have fixed cameras microphones and loudspeakers integrated into the console br Desktop systems are add ons hardware boards or software codec to normal PCs and laptops transforming them into videoconferencing devices A range of different cameras and microphones can be used with the codec which contains the necessary codec and transmission interfaces Most of the desktops systems work with the H standard br WebRTC platforms use a web browser instead of dedicated native application software Solutions such as Adobe Connect and Cisco WebEx can be accessed using a URL sent by the meeting organizer and various degrees of security can be attached to the virtual room Often the user must download and install a browser extension to enable access to the local camera and microphone and establish a connection to the meeting But WebRTC does not require any special software instead a WebRTC compliant internet browser itself provides the facilities for to and to many videoconferencing calls Several enhancements to WebRTC are provided by independent vendors br br br Videoconferencing modes br Videoconferencing systems use several methods to determine which video feed or feeds to display br Continuous Presence simply displays all participants at the same time usually with the exception that the viewer either does not see their own feed or sees their own feed in miniature br Voice Activated Switch selectively chooses a feed to display at each endpoint with the goal of showing the person who is currently speaking This is done by choosing the feed other than the viewer which has the loudest audio input perhaps with some filtering to avoid switching for very short lived volume spikes Often if no remote parties are currently speaking the feed with the last speaker remains on the screen br br br Echo cancellation br Acoustic echo cancellation AEC is a processing algorithm that uses the knowledge of audio output to monitor audio input and filter from it noises that echo back after some time delay If unattended these echoes can be re amplified several times leading to problems including br br The remote party hearing their own voice coming back at them usually significantly delayed br Strong reverberation which makes the voice channel useless br Howling created by feedback br Echo cancellation is a processor intensive task that usually works over a narrow range of sound delays br br br Bandwidth requirements br br Videophones have historically employed a variety of transmission and reception bandwidths which can be understood as data transmission speeds The lower the transmission reception bandwidth the lower the data transfer rate resulting in a progressively limited and poorer image quality i e lower resolution and or frame rate Data transfer rates and live video image quality are related but are also subject to other factors such as data compression techniques Some early videophones employed very low data transmission rates with a resulting poor video quality br Broadband bandwidth is often called high speed because it usually has a high rate of data transmission In general any connection of kbit s Mbit s or greater is more concisely considered broadband Internet The International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector ITU T recommendation I has defined broadband as a transmission capacity at to Mbit s The Federal Communications Commission United States definition of broadband is Mbit s br Currently adequate video for some purposes becomes possible at data rates lower than the ITU T broadband definition with rates of kbit s and kbit s used for some videoconferencing applications and rates as low as kbit s used for videophones using H MPEG AVC compression protocols The newer MPEG video and audio compression format can deliver high quality video at Mbit s which is at the low end of cable modem and ADSL broadband performance br br br Standards br br The International Telecommunication Union ITU has three umbrellas of standards for videoconferencing br br ITU H is known as the standard for public switched telephone networks PSTN or videoconferencing over integrated services digital networks While still prevalent in Europe ISDN was never widely adopted in the United States and Canada br ITU H Scalable Video Coding SVC is a compression standard that enables videoconferencing systems to achieve highly error resilient Internet Protocol IP video transmissions over the public Internet without quality of service enhanced lines This standard has enabled wide scale deployment of high definition desktop videoconferencing and made possible new architectures which reduces latency between the transmitting sources and receivers resulting in more fluid communication without pauses In addition an attractive factor for IP videoconferencing is that it is easier to set up for use along with web conferencing and data collaboration These combined technologies enable users to have a richer multimedia environment for live meetings collaboration and presentations br ITU T V videoconferencing is generally compatibilized with H standard point to point videotelephony over regular POTS phone lines br The Unified Communications Interoperability Forum UCIF a non profit alliance between communications vendors launched in May The organization s vision is to maximize the interoperability of UC based on existing standards Founding members of UCIF include HP Microsoft Polycom Logitech LifeSize Communications and Juniper Networks br br br Call setup br Videoconferencing in the late th century was limited to the H protocol notably Cisco s SCCP implementation was an exception but newer videophones often use SIP which is often easier to set up in home networking environments It is a text based protocol incorporating many elements of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP H is still used but more commonly for business videoconferencing while SIP is more commonly used in personal consumer videophones A number of call setup methods based on instant messaging protocols such as Skype also now provide video br Another protocol used by videophones is H which mixes call setup and video compression Videophones that work on regular phone lines typically use H but the bandwidth is limited by the modem to around kbit s limiting the video quality and frame rate A slightly modified version of H called G M defined by GPP is also used by some cellphones that allow video calls typically for use only in UMTS networks br There is also H standard which specified technical requirements for narrow band visual telephone systems and terminal equipment typically for videoconferencing and videophone services It applied mostly to dedicated circuit based switched network point to point connections of moderate or high bandwidth such as through the medium bandwidth ISDN digital phone protocol or a fractionated high bandwidth T lines Modern products based on H standard usually support also H standard br The IAX protocol also supports videophone calls natively using the protocol s own capabilities to transport alternate media streams A few hobbyists obtained the Nortel Color SIP Videophone cheaply in as surplus after Nortel s bankruptcy and deployed the sets on the Asterisk PBX platform While additional software is required to patch together multiple video feeds for conference calls or convert between dissimilar video standards SIP calls between two identical handsets within the same PBX were relatively straightforward br br br Conferencing layers br The components within a videoconferencing system can be divided up into several different layers User Interface Conference Control Control or Signaling Plane and Media Plane br Videoconferencing User Interfaces VUI can be either graphical or voice responsive Many in the industry have encountered both types of interface and normally a graphical interface is encountered on a computer User interfaces for conferencing have a number of different uses they can be used for scheduling setup and making a video call Through the user interface the administrator is able to control the other three layers of the system br Conference Control performs resource allocation management and routing This layer along with the User Interface creates meetings scheduled or unscheduled or adds and removes participants from a conference br Control Signaling Plane contains the stacks that signal different endpoints to create a call and or a conference Signals can be but are not limited to H and Session Initiation Protocol SIP Protocols These signals control incoming and outgoing connections as well as session parameters br The Media Plane controls the audio and video mixing and streaming This layer manages Real Time Transport Protocols User Datagram Packets UDP and Real Time Transport Control Protocol RTCP The RTP and UDP normally carry information such the payload type which is the type of codec frame rate video size and many others RTCP on the other hand acts as a quality control Protocol for detecting errors during streaming br br br Multipoint control br br Simultaneous videoconferencing among three or more remote points is possible in a hardware based system by means of a Multipoint Control Unit MCU This is a bridge that interconnects calls from several sources in a similar way to the audio conference call All parties call the MCU or the MCU can also call the parties which are going to participate in sequence There are MCU bridges for IP and ISDN based videoconferencing There are MCUs which are pure software and others that are a combination of hardware and software An MCU is characterized according to the number of simultaneous calls it can handle its ability to conduct transposing of data rates and protocols and features such as Continuous Presence in which multiple parties can be seen on screen at once MCUs can be stand alone hardware devices or they can be embedded into dedicated videoconferencing units br The MCU consists of two logical components br br A single multipoint controller MC and br Multipoint Processors MP sometimes referred to as the mixer br The MC controls the conferencing while it is active on the signaling plane which is simply where the system manages conferencing creation endpoint signaling and in conferencing controls This component negotiates parameters with every endpoint in the network and controls conferencing resources br While the MC controls resources and signaling negotiations the MP operates on the media plane and receives media from each endpoint The MP generates output streams from each endpoint and redirects the information to other endpoints in the conference br Some systems are capable of multipoint conferencing with no MCU stand alone embedded or otherwise These use a standards based H technique known as decentralized multipoint where each station in a multipoint call exchanges video and audio directly with the other stations with no central manager or other bottleneck The advantages of this technique are that the video and audio will generally be of higher quality because they do not have to be relayed through a central point Also users can make ad hoc multipoint calls without any concern for the availability or control of an MCU This added convenience and quality comes at the expense of some increased network bandwidth because every station must transmit to every other station directly br br br Cloud storage br Cloud based videoconferencing can be used without the hardware generally required by other videoconferencing systems and can be designed for use by SMEs or larger international or multinational corporations like Facebook Cloud based systems can handle either D or D video broadcasting Cloud based systems can also implement mobile calls VOIP and other forms of video calling They can also come with a video recording function to archive past meetings br br br Impact br br High speed Internet connectivity has become more widely available and affordable as has good quality video capture and display hardware Consequently personal videoconferencing systems based on webcams personal computer systems software compression and the Internet have become progressively more affordable by the general public The availability of freeware often as part of chat programs has made software based videoconferencing accessible to many br The widest deployment of videotelephony now occurs in mobile phones Nearly all mobile phones supporting UMTS networks can work as videophones using their internal cameras and are able to make video calls wirelessly to other UMTS users anywhere As of the second quarter of there are over million UMTS users and hence potential videophone users on networks in countries Mobile phones can also use broadband wireless Internet whether through the cell phone network or over a local Wi Fi connection along with software based videophone apps to make calls to any video capable Internet user whether mobile or fixed br Deaf hard of hearing and mute individuals have a particular role in the development of affordable high quality videotelephony as a means of communicating with each other in sign language Unlike Video Relay Service which is intended to support communication between a caller using sign language and another party using spoken language videoconferencing can be used directly between two deaf signers br Videophones are increasingly used in the provision of telemedicine to the elderly disabled and to those in remote locations where the ease and convenience of quickly obtaining diagnostic and consultative medical services are readily apparent In one single instance quoted in A nurse led clinic at Letham has received positive feedback on a trial of a video link which allowed pensioners to be assessed by medics without traveling to a doctor s office or medical clinic A further improvement in telemedical services has been the development of new technology incorporated into special videophones to permit remote diagnostic services such as blood sugar level blood pressure and vital signs monitoring Such units are capable of relaying both regular audio video plus medical data over either standard POTS telephone or newer broadband lines br br Videotelephony has also been deployed in corporate teleconferencing also available through the use of public access videoconferencing rooms A higher level of videoconferencing that employs advanced telecommunication technologies and high resolution displays is called telepresence br Today the principles if not the precise mechanisms of a videophone are employed by many users worldwide in the form of webcam videocalls using personal computers with inexpensive webcams microphones and free video calling Web client programs Thus an activity that was disappointing as a separate service has found a niche as a minor feature in software products intended for other purposes br According to Juniper Research smartphone videophone users will reach million by globally br A study conducted by Pew Research in revealed that of Americans have made a mobile video call br br br Government and law br In the United States videoconferencing has allowed testimony to be used for an individual who is unable or prefers not to attend the physical legal settings or would be subjected to severe psychological stress in doing so however there is a controversy on the use of testimony by foreign or unavailable witnesses via video transmission regarding the violation of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment of the U S Constitution br In a military investigation in North Carolina Afghan witnesses have testified via videoconferencing br In Hall County Georgia videoconferencing systems are used for initial court appearances The systems link jails with courtrooms reducing the expenses and security risks of transporting prisoners to the courtroom br The U S Social Security Administration SSA which oversees the world s largest administrative judicial system under its Office of Disability Adjudication and Review ODAR has made extensive use of videoconferencing to conduct hearings at remote locations In Fiscal Year FY the U S Social Security Administration SSA conducted videoconferenced hearings a increase over FY In August the SSA opened its fifth and largest videoconferencing only National Hearing Center NHC in St Louis Missouri This continues the SSA s effort to use video hearings as a means to clear its substantial hearing backlog Since the SSA has also established NHCs in Albuquerque New Mexico Baltimore Maryland Falls Church Virginia and Chicago br br br Education br br Videoconferencing provides students with the chance to learn by participating in two way communication forums Because it is live videotelephony allows teachers to access remote or otherwise isolated learners Students from diverse communities and backgrounds can come together to learn about one another through practices known as telecollaboration in foreign language education and virtual exchange although language barriers will continue to be present Such students are able to explore communicate analyze and share information and ideas with one another br Through videoconferencing students can visit other parts of the world including museums and other cultural and educational sites Such virtual field trips can provide enriched learning opportunities to students especially those who are geographically isolated or economically disadvantaged Small schools can use these technologies to pool resources and provide courses such as in foreign languages which could not otherwise be offered br Some benefits that videoconferencing can provide to education include br br faculty members keeping in touch with classes while attending conferences br faculty members attending conferences virtually br guest lecturers brought in classes from other institutions br researchers collaborating with colleagues at other institutions on a regular basis without loss of time due to travel br schools with multiple campuses collaborating and sharing professors br schools from two separate nations engaging in cross cultural exchanges br faculty members participating in thesis defenses at other institutions br administrators on tight schedules collaborating on budget preparation from different parts of campus br faculty committee auditioning scholarship candidates br researchers answering questions about grant proposals from agencies or review committees br alternative enrollment structures to purely in person attendance br student interviews with employers in other cities and br teleseminars br br br Medicine and health br br Videoconferencing is a highly useful technology for real time telemedicine and telenursing applications such as diagnosis consulting prevention treatment and transmission of medical images With videoconferencing patients may contact nurses and physicians in emergency or routine situations physicians and other paramedical professionals can discuss cases across large distances Rural areas can use this technology for diagnostic purposes thus saving lives and making more efficient use of health care money For example a rural medical center in Ohio used videoconferencing to successfully cut the number of transfers of sick infants to a hospital miles km away This had previously cost nearly per transfer br Special peripherals such as microscopes fitted with digital cameras videoendoscopes medical ultrasound imaging devices otoscopes etc can be used in conjunction with videoconferencing equipment to transmit data about a patient Recent developments in mobile collaboration on hand held mobile devices have also extended video conferencing capabilities to locations previously unreachable such as a remote community long term care facility or a patient s home br br br Business br Videoconferencing can enable individuals in distant locations to participate in meetings on short notice with time and money savings Technology such as VoIP can be used in conjunction with desktop videoconferencing to enable low cost face to face business meetings without leaving the desk especially for businesses with widespread offices The technology is also used for remote work One research report based on a sampling of corporate employees showed that as of June of the respondents with access to videoconferencing used it all of the time or frequently br Intel Corporation have used videoconferencing to reduce both costs and environmental impacts of its business operations br Videoconferencing is also currently being introduced on online networking websites in order to help businesses form profitable relationships quickly and efficiently without leaving their place of work This has been leveraged by banks to connect busy banking professionals with customers in various locations using video banking technology br Videoconferencing on hand held mobile devices mobile collaboration technology is being used in industries such as manufacturing energy healthcare insurance government and public safety Live visual interaction removes traditional restrictions of distance and time often in locations previously unreachable such as a manufacturing plant floor thousands of miles away br In the increasingly globalized film industry videoconferencing has become useful as a method by which creative talent in many different locations can collaborate closely on the complex details of film production For example for the award winning animated film Frozen Burbank based Walt Disney Animation Studios hired the New York City based husband and wife songwriting team of Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson Lopez to write the songs which required two hour long transcontinental videoconferences nearly every weekday for about months br With the development of lower cost endpoints the integration of video cameras into personal computers and mobile devices and software applications such as FaceTime Skype Teams BlueJeans and Zoom videoconferencing has changed from just a business to business offering to include business to consumer and consumer to consumer use br Although videoconferencing has frequently proven its value research has shown that some non managerial employees prefer not to use it due to several factors including anxiety Some such anxieties can often be avoided if managers use the technology as part of the normal course of business Remote workers can also adopt certain behaviors and best practices to stay connected with their co workers and company br Researchers also find that attendees of business and medical videoconferences must work harder to interpret information delivered during a conference than they would if they attended face to face They recommend that those coordinating videoconferences make adjustments to their conferencing procedures and equipment br br br Press br br The concept of press videoconferencing was developed in October by the PanAfrican Press Association APPA a Paris France based non governmental organization to allow African journalists to participate in international press conferences on developmental and good governance issues br Press videoconferencing permits international press conferences via videoconferencing over the Internet Journalists can participate on an international press conference from any location without leaving their offices or countries They need only be seated by a computer connected to the Internet in order to ask their questions br In the International Monetary Fund introduced the Online Media Briefing Center a password protected site available only to professional journalists The site enables the IMF to present press briefings globally and facilitates direct questions to briefers from the press The site has been copied by other international organizations since its inception More than journalists worldwide are currently registered with the IMF br br br Sign language br br One of the first demonstrations of the ability for telecommunications to help sign language users communicate with each other occurred when AT T s videophone trademarked as the Picturephone was introduced to the public at the New York World s Fair two deaf users were able to communicate freely with each other between the fair and another city Various universities and other organizations including British Telecom s Martlesham facility have also conducted extensive research on signing via video telephony br The use of sign language via videotelephony was hampered for many years due to the difficulty of its use over slow analog copper phone lines coupled with the high cost of better quality ISDN data phone lines Those factors largely disappeared with the introduction of more efficient and powerful video codecs and the advent of lower cost high speed ISDN data and IP Internet services in the s br br br st century improvements br Significant improvements in video call quality of service for the deaf occurred in the United States in when Sorenson Media Inc formerly Sorenson Vision Inc a video compression software coding company developed its VP model stand alone videophone specifically for the deaf community It was designed to output its video to the user s television in order to lower the cost of acquisition and to offer remote control and a powerful video compression codec for unequaled video quality and ease of use with video relay services Favorable reviews quickly led to its popular usage at educational facilities for the deaf and from there to the greater deaf community br Coupled with similar high quality videophones introduced by other electronics manufacturers the availability of high speed Internet and sponsored video relay services authorized by the U S Federal Communications Commission in VRS services for the deaf underwent rapid growth in that country br br Using such video equipment in the present day the deaf hard of hearing and speech impaired can communicate between themselves and with hearing individuals using sign language The United States and several other countries compensate companies to provide video relay services VRS Telecommunication equipment can be used to talk to others via a sign language interpreter who uses a conventional telephone at the same time to communicate with the deaf person s party Video equipment is also used to do on site sign language translation via Video Remote Interpreting VRI The relatively low cost and widespread availability of G mobile phone technology with video calling capabilities have given deaf and speech impaired users a greater ability to communicate with the same ease as others Some wireless operators have even started free sign language gateways br Sign language interpretation services via VRS or by VRI are useful in the present day where one of the parties is deaf hard of hearing or speech impaired mute In such cases the interpretation flow is normally within the same principal language such as French Sign Language LSF to spoken French Spanish Sign Language LSE to spoken Spanish British Sign Language BSL to spoken English and American Sign Language ASL also to spoken English since BSL and ASL are completely distinct from each other German Sign Language DGS to spoken German and so on br Multilingual sign language interpreters who can also translate as well across principal languages such as a multilingual interpreter interpreting a call from a deaf person using ASL to reserve a hotel room at a hotel in the Dominican Republic whose staff speaks Spanish only therefore the interpreter has to use ASL spoken Spanish and spoken English to facilitate the call for the deaf person are also available albeit less frequently Such activities involve considerable mental processing efforts on the part of the translator since sign languages are distinct natural languages with their own construction semantics and syntax different from the aural version of the same principal language br With video interpreting sign language interpreters work remotely with live video and audio feeds so that the interpreter can see the deaf or mute party and converse with the hearing party and vice versa Much like telephone interpreting video interpreting can be used for situations in which no on site interpreters are available However video interpreting cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone VRS and VRI interpretation requires all parties to have the necessary equipment Some advanced equipment enables interpreters to control the video camera remotely in order to zoom in and out or to point the camera toward the party that is signing br br br Comparison of Sign Language communication tools br br br Descriptive names and terminology br br The name videophone never became as standardized as its earlier counterpart telephone resulting in a variety of names and terms being used worldwide and even within the same region or country Videophones are also known as video phones videotelephones or video telephones and often by an early trademarked name Picturephone which was the world s first commercial videophone produced in volume The compound name videophone slowly entered into general use after br although video telephone likely entered the lexicon earlier after video was coined in br Videophone calls also videocalls video chat as well as Skype and Skyping in verb form differ from videoconferencing in that they expect to serve individuals not groups However that distinction has become increasingly blurred with technology improvements such as increased bandwidth and sophisticated software clients that can allow for multiple parties on a call In general everyday usage the term videoconferencing is now frequently used instead of videocall for point to point calls between two units Both videophone calls and videoconferencing are also now commonly referred to as a video link br Webcams are popular relatively low cost devices that can provide live video and audio streams via personal computers and can be used with many software clients for both video calls and videoconferencing br A videoconference system is generally higher cost than a videophone and deploys greater capabilities A videoconference also known as a videoteleconference allows two or more locations to communicate via live simultaneous two way video and audio transmissions This is often accomplished by the use of a multipoint control unit a centralized distribution and call management system or by a similar non centralized multipoint capability embedded in each videoconferencing unit Again technology improvements have circumvented traditional definitions by allowing multiple party videoconferencing via web based applications br A telepresence system is a high end videoconferencing system and service usually employed by enterprise level corporate offices Telepresence conference rooms use state of the art room designs video cameras displays sound systems and processors coupled with high to very high capacity bandwidth transmissions br Typical uses of the various technologies described above include calling one to one or conferencing one to many or many to many for personal business educational deaf Video Relay Service and tele medical diagnostic and rehabilitative purposes personal videocalls to inmates incarcerated in penitentiaries and videoconferencing to resolve airline engineering issues at maintenance facilities are being created or evolving on an ongoing basis br Other names for videophone that have been used in English are Viewphone the British Telecom equivalent to AT T s Picturephone and visiophone a common French translation that has also crept into limited English usage as well as over twenty less common names and expressions Latin based translations of videophone in other languages include vid ophone French Bildtelefon German videotelefono Italian both vide fono and videotel fono Spanish both beeldtelefoon and videofoon Dutch and videofon a Catalan br A telepresence robot also telerobotics is a robotically controlled and motorized videoconferencing display to help give a better sense of remote physical presence for communication and collaboration in an office home school etc when one cannot be there in person The robotic avatar device can move about and look around at the command of the remote person it represents br br br Popular culture br br In science fiction literature names commonly associated with videophones include telephonoscope telephote viewphone vidphone vidfone and visiphone The first example was probably the cartoon Edison s Telephonoscope by George du Maurier in Punch In In the year published the French author Jules Verne predicts that The transmission of speech is an old story the transmission of images by means of sensitive mirrors connected by wires is a thing but of yesterday In many science fiction movies and TV programs that are set in the future videophones were used as a primary method of communication One of the first movies where a videophone was used was Fritz Lang s Metropolis br Other notable examples of videophones in popular culture include an iconic scene from the film A Space Odyssey set on Space Station V The movie was released shortly before AT T began its efforts to commercialize its Picturephone Mod II service in several cities and depicts a video call to Earth using an advanced AT T videophone which it predicts will cost for a two minute call in a fraction of the company s real rates on Earth in Film director Stanley Kubrick strove for scientific accuracy relying on interviews with scientists and engineers at Bell Labs in the United States Dr Larry Rabiner of Bell Labs discussing videophone research in the documentary The Making of a Myth stated that in the mid to late s videophones captured the imagination of the public and of Mr Kubrick and the people who reported to him In one movie scene a central character Dr Heywood Floyd calls home to contact his family a social feature noted in the Making of a Myth Floyd talks with and views his daughter from a space station in orbit above the Earth discussing what type of present he should bring home for her br A portable videophone is also featured prominently in the science fiction movie Moon where the story s protagonist Sam Bell also calls home as well to communicate with loved ones Bell the lone occupant of a mining station on the far side of the Earth s moon finally succeeds in making his video call after an extended work period but becomes traumatized when viewing his daughter br Other earlier examples of videophones in popular culture included a videophone that was featured in the Warner Bros cartoon Plane Daffy in which the female spy Hatta Mari used a videophone to communicate with Adolf Hitler as well as a device with the same functionality has been used by the comic strip character Dick Tracy who often used his way wrist TV to communicate with police headquarters br By the early s videotelephony and videophones had become commonplace and unremarkable in various forms of media in part due to their real and ubiquitous presence in common electronic devices and laptop computers Additionally TV programming increasingly used videophones to interview subjects of interest and to present live coverage by news correspondents via the Internet or by satellite links In the mass market media the popular U S TV talk show hostess Oprah Winfrey incorporated videotelephony into her TV program on a regular basis from May with an initial episode called Where the Skype Are You as part of a marketing agreement with the Internet telecommunication company Skype br Additionally videophones have been featured in br br Lisa s Wedding an episode of The Simpsons which depicted a Picturephone br a Beyonc Knowles pop single and music video called Video Phone from her album I Am
