Buck is a multi language build system developed and used by Meta Platforms Inc It was designed for building small reusable modules consisting of code and resources within a monorepo It supports many programming languages including C Swift Unix Shell Java Kotlin Python Lua OCaml Rust and Go It can produce binary outputs for a variety of target platforms including iOS Android NET and Java virtual machine VM runtime systems Licensing for Buck is under Apache License while Buck is under either MIT or Apache br Buck requires the explicit declaration of dependencies Because all dependencies are explicit and Buck has a directed acyclic graph of all source files and build targets Buck can perform incremental recompilation only rebuilding targets downstream of files that have changed Buck computes a key for each target that is a hash of the contents of the files it depends on It stores a mapping from that key to the build target in a build cache br br br History br In Buck was released One of the key features was the ability to share build results between multiple developers and continuous integration CI as Buck supports a HTTP Cache API br In Buck was released claiming that builds are x as fast as compared to Buck One of the largest changes from Buck is that the core is written in Rust instead of Java and rules are written outside the core in Starlark the language created for the Bazel build system br br br See also br Build automation br List of build automation software br br br br br br External links br Official website
