An emoji ih MOH jee plural emoji or emojis Japanese Japanese pronunciation emo i is a pictogram logogram ideogram or smiley embedded in text and used in electronic messages and web pages The primary function of modern emoji is to fill in emotional cues otherwise missing from typed conversation as well as to replace words as part of a logographic system Emoji exist in various genres including facial expressions expressions activity food and drinks celebrations flags objects symbols places types of weather animals and nature br Originally meaning pictograph the word emoji comes from Japanese e picture moji character the resemblance to the English words emotion and emoticon is purely coincidental The first emoji sets were created by Japanese portable electronic device companies in the late s and the s Emoji became increasingly popular worldwide in the s after Unicode began encoding emoji into the Unicode Standard They are now considered to be a large part of popular culture in the West and around the world In Oxford Dictionaries named the Face with Tears of Joy emoji the word of the year br br br History br br br Evolution from emoticons s br br The emoji was predated by the emoticon a concept implemented in by computer scientist Scott Fahlman when he suggested text based symbols such as and could be used to replace language Theories about language replacement can be traced back to the s when Russian novelist and professor Vladimir Nabokov stated in an interview with The New York Times I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile some sort of concave mark a supine round bracket It did not become a mainstream concept until the s when Japanese American and European companies began developing Fahlman s idea Mary Kalantzis and Bill Cope point out that similar symbology was incorporated by Bruce Parello a student at the University of Illinois into PLATO IV the first e learning system in The PLATO system was not considered mainstream and therefore Parello s pictograms were only used by a small number of people Scott Fahlman s emoticons importantly used common alphabet symbols and aimed to replace language text to express emotion and for that reason are seen as the actual origin of emoticons br The first emoji are a matter of contention due to differing definitions and poor early documentation It was previously widely considered that DoCoMo had the first emoji set in but an Emojipedia blog article in brought SoftBank s earlier set to light More recently in earlier emoji sets were uncovered on portable devices by Sharp Corporation and NEC in the early s with the Sharp PA harboring what can be defined as the earliest known emoji set that reflects emoji keyboards today br br Wingdings a font invented by Charles Bigelow and Kris Holmes was released by Microsoft in It could be used to send pictographs in rich text messages but would only load on devices with the Wingdings font installed In the French newspaper Le Monde announced that Alcatel would be launching a new phone the BC Its welcome screen displayed a digital smiley face replacing the usual text seen as part of the welcome message often seen on other devices at the time In SoftBank s J Phone arm launched the SkyWalker DP SW which contained a set of emoji Its designs each measuring by pixels were monochrome depicting numbers sports the time moon phases and the weather It contained the Pile of Poo emoji in particular The J Phone model experienced low sales and the emoji set was thus rarely used br In Shigetaka Kurita created emoji as part of NTT DoCoMo s i mode used on its mobile platform They were intended to help facilitate electronic communication and to serve as a distinguishing feature from other services Due to their influence Kurita s designs were once claimed to be the first cellular emoji however Kurita has denied that this is the case According to interviews he took inspiration from Japanese manga where characters are often drawn with symbolic representations called manpu such as a water drop on a face representing nervousness or confusion and weather pictograms used to depict the weather conditions at any given time He also drew inspiration from Chinese characters and street sign pictograms The DoCoMo i Mode set included facial expressions such as smiley faces derived from a Japanese visual style commonly found in manga and anime combined with kaomoji and smiley elements Kurita s work is displayed in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City br Kurita s emoji were brightly colored albeit with a single color per glyph General use emoji such as sports actions and weather can readily be traced back to Kurita s emoji set Notably absent from the set were pictograms that demonstrated emotion The yellow faced emoji in current use evolved from other emoticon sets and cannot be traced back to Kurita s work His set also had generic images much like the J Phones Elsewhere in the s Nokia phones began including preset pictograms in its text messaging app which they defined as smileys and symbols A third notable emoji set was introduced by Japanese mobile phone brand au by KDDI br br br Development of emoji sets br The basic by pixel emoji in Japan grew in popularity across various platforms over the next decade This was aided by the popularity of DoCoMo i mode which for many was the origins of the smartphone The i mode service also saw the introduction of emoji in conversation form on messenger apps By i mode had million subscribers exposing numerous people to emoji for the first time between and The popularity of i mode led to other manufacturers offering their own emoji sets While emoji adoption was high in Japan during this time the competitors failed to collaborate to create a uniform set of emoji to be used across all platforms in the country br br The Universal Coded Character Set Unicode controlled by the Unicode Consortium and ISO IEC JTC SC had already been established as the international standard for text representation ISO IEC since although variants of Shift JIS remained relatively common in Japan Unicode included several characters which would subsequently be classified as emoji including some from North American or Western European sources such as DOS code page ITC Zapf Dingbats or the WordPerfect Iconic Symbols set Unicode coverage of written characters was extended several times by new editions during the s with little interest in incorporating the Japanese cellular emoji sets deemed out of scope although symbol characters which would subsequently be classified as emoji continued to be added For example Unicode contained new emoji which included direction arrows a warning triangle and an eject button Besides Zapf Dingbats other dingbat fonts such as Wingdings or Webdings also included additional pictographic symbols in their own custom pi font encodings unlike Zapf Dingbats however many of these would not be available as Unicode emoji until br Nicolas Loufrani applied to the US Copyright Office in to register the smileys that he created Soon after he created The Smiley Dictionary which not only hosted the largest number of smileys at the time it also categorized them The desktop platform was aimed at allowing people to insert smileys as text when sending emails and writing on a desktop computer By it had grown to smileys and ascii emotions br The smiley toolbar offered a variety of symbols and smileys and was used on platforms such as MSN Messenger Nokia then one of the largest global telecom companies was still referring to today s emoji sets as smileys in The digital smiley movement was headed up by Nicolas Loufrani the CEO of The Smiley Company He created a smiley toolbar which was available at smileydictionary com during the early s to be sent as emoji are today br Over the next two years The Smiley Dictionary became the plug in of choice for forums and online instant messaging platforms There were competitors but The Smiley Dictionary was by far the most popular Platforms such as MSN Messenger allowed for customisation from onwards with many users importing emoticons to use in messages as text These emoticons would eventually go on to become the modern day emoji It was not until MSN Messenger and BlackBerry noticed the popularity of these unofficial sets and launched their own from late onwards br br br Beginnings of Unicode emoji br br The first American company to take notice of emoji was Google beginning in In August a team made up of Mark Davis and his colleagues Kat Momoi and Markus Scherer began petitioning the Unicode Technical Committee UTC in an attempt to standardise the emoji The UTC having previously deemed emoji to be out of scope for Unicode made the decision to broaden its scope to enable compatibility with the Japanese cellular carrier formats which were becoming more widespread Peter Edberg and Yasuo Kida joined the collaborative effort from Apple Inc shortly after and their official UTC proposal came in January with new emoji characters Unicode accepted the proposal in br Pending the assignment of standard Unicode code points Google and Apple implemented emoji support via Private Use Area schemes Google first introduced emoji in Gmail in October in collaboration with au by KDDI and Apple introduced the first release of Apple Color Emoji to iPhone OS on November Initially Apple s emoji support was implemented for holders of a SoftBank SIM card the emoji themselves were represented using SoftBank s Private Use Area scheme and mostly resembled the SoftBank designs Gmail emoji used their own Private Use Area scheme in a supplementary Private Use plane br Separately a proposal had been submitted in to add the ARIB extended characters used in broadcasting in Japan to Unicode This included several pictographic symbols These were added in Unicode in a year before the cellular emoji sets were fully added they include several characters which either also appeared amongst the cellular emoji or were subsequently classified as emoji br After iPhone users in the United States discovered that downloading Japanese apps allowed access to the keyboard pressure grew to expand the availability of the emoji keyboard beyond Japan The Emoji application for iOS which altered the Settings app to allow access to the emoji keyboard was created by Josh Gare in February Before the existence of Gare s Emoji app Apple had intended for the emoji keyboard to only be available in Japan in iOS version br Throughout members of the Unicode Consortium and national standardization bodies of various countries gave feedback and proposed changes to the international standardization of the emoji The feedback from various bodies in the United States Europe and Japan agreed on a set of emoji as the standard set This would be released in October in Unicode Apple made the emoji keyboard available to those outside of Japan in iOS version in Later Unicode June added the character repertoires of the Webdings and Wingdings fonts to Unicode resulting in approximately more Unicode emoji br The Unicode emoji whose code points were assigned in or earlier are therefore taken from several sources A single character could exist in multiple sources and characters from a source were unified with existing characters where appropriate for example the shower weather symbol from the ARIB source was unified with an existing umbrella with raindrops character which had been added for KPS compatibility The emoji characters named Rain ame from all three Japanese carriers were in turn unified with the ARIB character However the Unicode Consortium groups the most significant sources of emoji into four categories br br br UTS and modern emoji present br br In late a Public Review Issue was created by the Unicode Technical Committee seeking feedback on a proposed Unicode Technical Report UTR titled Unicode Emoji This was intended to improve interoperability of emoji between vendors and define a means of supporting multiple skin tones The feedback period closed in January Also in January the use of the zero width joiner to indicate that a sequence of emoji could be shown as a single equivalent glyph analogous to a ligature as a means of implementing emoji without atomic code points such as varied compositions of families was discussed within the emoji ad hoc committee br Unicode June added another emoji including articles of sports equipment such as the cricket bat food items such as the taco new facial expressions and symbols for places of worship as well as five characters crab scorpion lion face bow and arrow amphora to improve support for pictorial rather than symbolic representations of the signs of the Zodiac br Also in June the first approved version Emoji of the Unicode Emoji report was published as Unicode Technical Report UTR This introduced the mechanism of skin tone indicators the first official recommendations about which Unicode characters were to be considered emoji and the first official recommendations about which characters were to be displayed in an emoji font in absence of a variation selector and listed the zero width joiner sequences for families and couples that were implemented by existing vendors Maintenance of UTR taking emoji requests and creating proposals for emoji characters and emoji mechanisms was made the responsibility of the Unicode Emoji Subcommittee ESC operating as a subcommittee of the Unicode Technical Committee br With the release of version in May alongside Unicode UTR was redesignated a Unicode Technical Standard UTS making it an independent specification rather than merely an informative document As of July there were Unicode emoji listed The next version of UTS published in May skipped to the version number Emoji so as to synchronise its major version number with the corresponding version of the Unicode Standard br The popularity of emoji has caused pressure from vendors and international markets to add additional designs into the Unicode standard to meet the demands of different cultures Some characters now defined as emoji are inherited from a variety of pre Unicode messenger systems not only used in Japan including Yahoo and MSN Messenger br Corporate demand for emoji standardization has placed pressures on the Unicode Consortium with some members complaining that it had overtaken the group s traditional focus on standardizing characters used for minority languages and transcribing historical records Conversely the Consortium recognises that public desire for emoji support has put pressure on vendors to improve their Unicode support which is especially true for characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane thus leading to better support for Unicode s historic and minority scripts in deployed software br In the Unicode Consortium decided to stop accepting proposals for flag emoji citing low use of the category and that adding new flags creates exclusivity at the expense of others The Consortium stated that new flag emoji would still be added when their country becomes part of the ISO standard with no proposal needed br br br Cultural influence br br Oxford Dictionaries named U F FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY its Word of the Year Oxford noted that had seen a sizable increase in the use of the word emoji and recognized its impact on popular culture Oxford Dictionaries President Caspar Grathwohl expressed that traditional alphabet scripts have been struggling to meet the rapid fire visually focused demands of st Century communication It s not surprising that a pictographic script like emoji has stepped in to fill those gaps it s flexible immediate and infuses tone beautifully SwiftKey found that Face with Tears of Joy was the most popular emoji across the world The American Dialect Society declared U F AUBERGINE to be the Most Notable Emoji of in their Word of the Year vote br Some emoji are specific to Japanese culture such as a bowing businessman U F PERSON BOWING DEEPLY the shoshinsha mark used to indicate a beginner driver U F JAPANESE SYMBOL FOR BEGINNER a white flower U F AE WHITE FLOWER used to denote brilliant homework or a group of emoji representing popular foods ramen noodles U F C STEAMING BOWL dango U F DANGO onigiri U F RICE BALL curry U F B CURRY AND RICE and sushi U F SUSHI Unicode Consortium founder Mark Davis compared the use of emoji to a developing language particularly mentioning the American use of eggplant U F AUBERGINE to represent a phallus Some linguists have classified emoji and emoticons as discourse markers br br In December a sentiment analysis of emoji was published and the Emoji Sentiment Ranking was provided In a musical about emoji premiered in Los Angeles The animated The Emoji Movie was released in summer br In January in what is believed to be the first large scale study of emoji usage researchers at the University of Michigan analyzed over billion messages input via the Kika Emoji Keyboard and announced that the Face With Tears of Joy was the most popular emoji The Heart and the Heart eyes emoji stood second and third respectively The study also found that the French use heart emoji the most People in countries like Australia France and the Czech Republic used more happy emoji while this was not so for people in Mexico Colombia Chile and Argentina where people used more negative emoji in comparison to cultural hubs known for restraint and self discipline like Turkey France and Russia br There has been discussion among legal experts on whether or not emoji could be admissible as evidence in court trials Furthermore as emoji continue to develop and grow as a language of symbols there may also be the potential of the formation of emoji dialects Emoji are being used as more than just to show reactions and emotions Snapchat has even incorporated emoji in its trophy and friends system with each emoji showing a complex meaning Emoji can also convey different meanings based on syntax and inversion For instance fairy comments involve heart star and fairy emoji placed between the words of a sentence These comments often invert the meanings associated with hearts and may be used to tread on borders of offense br In the MIT Media Lab published DeepMoji a deep neural network sentiment analysis algorithm that was trained on billion emoji occurrences in Twitter data from to DeepMoji was found to outperform human subjects in correctly identifying sarcasm in Tweets and other online modes of communication br br br Use in furthering causes br br On March a drop of blood U FA DROP OF BLOOD emoji was released which is intended to help break the stigma of menstruation In addition to normalizing periods it will also be relevant to describe medical topics such as donating blood and other blood related activities br A mosquito U F F MOSQUITO emoji was added in to raise awareness for diseases spread by the insect such as dengue and malaria br br br Linguistic function of emoji br Linguistically emoji are used to indicate emotional state they tend to be used more in positive communication Some researchers believe emoji can be used for visual rhetoric Emoji can be used to set emotional tone in messages Emoji tend not to have their own meaning but act as a paralanguage adding meaning to text Emoji can add clarity and credibility to text br Sociolinguistically the use of emoji differ depending on speaker and setting Women use emoji more than men Men use a wider variety of emoji Women are more likely to use emoji in public communication than private communication Extraversion and agreeableness are positively correlated with emoji use neuroticism is negatively correlated Emoji use differ between cultures studies in terms of Hofstede s cultural dimensions theory found that cultures with high power distance and tolerance to indulgence used more negative emoji while those with high uncertainty avoidance individualism and long term orientation use more positive emoji An country user experience study showed that emoji based scales specifically the usage of smileys may ease the challenges related to translation and implementation for brief cross cultural surveys br br br Emoji communication problems br br Research has shown that emoji are often misunderstood In some cases this misunderstanding is related to how the actual emoji design is interpreted by the viewer in other cases the emoji that was sent is not shown in the same way on the receiving side br The first issue relates to the cultural or contextual interpretation of the emoji When the author picks an emoji they think about it in a certain way but the same character may not trigger the same thoughts in the mind of the receiver br For example people in China have developed a system for using emoji subversively so that a smiley face could be sent to convey a despising mocking and even obnoxious attitude as the orbicularis oculi the muscle near that upper eye corner on the face of the emoji does not move and the orbicularis oris the one near the mouth tightens which is believed to be a sign of suppressing a smile br The second problem relates to technology and branding When an author of a message picks an emoji from a list it is normally encoded in a non graphical manner during the transmission and if the author and the reader do not use the same software or operating system for their devices the reader s device may visualize the same emoji in a different way Small changes to a character s look may completely alter its perceived meaning with the receiver As an example in April British actress and presenter Jameela Jamil posted a tweet from her iPhone using the Face with Hand Over Mouth emoji as part of a comment on people shopping for food during the COVID pandemic On Apple s iOS the emoji expression is neutral and pensive but on other platforms the emoji shows as a giggling face Many fans were initially upset thinking that she as a well off celebrity was mocking poor people but this was not her intended meaning br Researchers from German Studies Institute at Ruhr Universit t Bochum found that most people can easily understand an emoji when it replaces a word directly like an icon for a rose instead of the word rose yet it takes people about percent longer to comprehend the emoji br br br Variation and ambiguity br Emoji characters vary slightly between platforms within the limits in meaning defined by the Unicode specification as companies have tried to provide artistic presentations of ideas and objects For example following an Apple tradition the calendar emoji on Apple products always shows July the date in Apple announced its iCal calendar application for macOS This led some Apple product users to initially nickname July World Emoji Day Other emoji fonts show different dates or do not show a specific one br Some Apple emoji are very similar to the SoftBank standard since SoftBank was the first Japanese network on which the iPhone launched For example U F DANCER is female on Apple and SoftBank standards but male or gender neutral on others br Journalists have noted that the ambiguity of emoji has allowed them to take on culture specific meanings not present in the original glyphs For example U F NAIL POLISH has been described as being used in English language communities to signify non caring fabulousness and anything from shutting haters down to a sense of accomplishment Unicode manuals sometimes provide notes on auxiliary meanings of an object to guide designers on how emoji may be used for example noting that some users may expect U F BA SEAT to stand for a reserved or ticketed seat as for an airplane train or theater br br br Controversial emoji br br Some emoji have been involved in controversy due to their perceived meanings Multiple arrests and imprisonments have followed usage of pistol U F B PISTOL knife U F E DAGGER KNIFE and bomb U F A BOMB emoji in ways that authorities deemed credible threats br In the lead up to the Summer Olympics the Unicode Consortium considered proposals to add several Olympic related emoji including medals and events such as handball and water polo By October these candidate emoji included rifle U F RIFLE and modern pentathlon U F B MODERN PENTATHLON However in Apple and Microsoft opposed these two emoji and the characters were added without emoji presentations meaning that software is expected to render them in black and white rather than color and emoji specific software such as onscreen keyboards will generally not include them In addition while the original incarnations of the modern pentathlon emoji depicted its five events including a man pointing a gun the final glyph contains a person riding a horse along with a laser pistol target in the corner br br On August Apple announced that in iOS the pistol emoji U F B PISTOL would be changed from a realistic revolver to a water pistol Conversely the following day Microsoft pushed out an update to Windows that changed its longstanding depiction of the pistol emoji as a toy ray gun to a real revolver Microsoft stated that the change was made to bring the glyph more in line with industry standard designs and customer expectations By most major platforms such as Google Microsoft Samsung Facebook and Twitter had transitioned their rendering of the pistol emoji to match Apple s water gun implementation Apple s change of depiction from a realistic gun to a toy gun was criticised by among others the editor of Emojipedia because it could lead to messages appearing differently to the receiver than the sender had intended Insider s Rob Price said it created the potential for serious miscommunication across different platforms and asked What if a joke sent from an Apple user to a Google user is misconstrued because of differences in rendering Or if a genuine threat sent by a Google user to an Apple user goes unreported because it is taken as a joke br The eggplant aubergine emoji U F AUBERGINE has also seen controversy due to it being used to represent a penis Beginning in December the hashtag EggplantFridays began to rise to popularity on Instagram for use in marking photos featuring clothed or unclothed penises This became such a popular trend that beginning in April Instagram disabled the ability to search for not only the EggplantFridays tag but also other eggplant containing hashtags including simply eggplant and br The peach emoji U F PEACH has likewise been used as a euphemistic icon for buttocks with a Emojipedia analysis revealing that only seven percent of English language tweets with the peach emoji refer to the actual fruit In Apple attempted to redesign the emoji to less resemble buttocks This was met with fierce backlash in beta testing and Apple reversed its decision by the time it went live to the public br In December a lawyer in Delhi India threatened to file a lawsuit against WhatsApp for allowing use of the middle finger emoji U F REVERSED HAND WITH MIDDLE FINGER EXTENDED on the basis that the company is directly abetting the use of an offensive lewd obscene gesture in violation of the Indian Penal Code br br br Emoji implementation br br br Early implementation in Japan br Various often incompatible character encoding schemes were developed by the different mobile providers in Japan for their own emoji sets For example the extended Shift JIS representation F is used for a convenience store by SoftBank but for a wristwatch by KDDI All three vendors also developed schemes for encoding their emoji in the Unicode Private Use Area DoCoMo for example used the range U E E through U E Versions of iOS prior to encoded emoji in the SoftBank private use area br br br Unicode support considerations br Most but not all emoji are included in the Supplementary Multilingual Plane SMP of Unicode which is also used for ancient scripts some modern scripts such as Adlam or Osage and special use characters such as Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols Some systems introduced prior to the advent of Unicode emoji were only designed to support characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane BMP on the assumption that non BMP characters would rarely be encountered although failure to properly handle characters outside of the BMP precludes Unicode compliance br The introduction of Unicode emoji created an incentive for vendors to improve their support for non BMP characters The Unicode Consortium notes that b ecause of the demand for emoji many implementations have upgraded their Unicode support substantially also helping support for minority languages that use those features br br br Color support br Any operating system that supports adding additional fonts to the system can add an emoji supporting font However inclusion of colorful emoji in existing font formats requires dedicated support for color glyphs Not all operating systems have support for color fonts so in these cases emoji might have to be rendered as black and white line art or not at all There are four different formats used for multi color glyphs in an SFNT font not all of which are necessarily supported by a given operating system library or software package such as a web browser or graphical program This means that color fonts may need to be supplied in several formats to be usable on multiple operating systems or in multiple applications br br br Implementation by different platforms and vendors br Apple first introduced emoji to their desktop operating system with the release of OS X Lion in Users can view emoji characters sent through email and messaging applications which are commonly shared by mobile users as well as any other application Users can create emoji symbols using the Characters special input panel from almost any native application by selecting the Edit menu and pulling down to Special Characters or by the key combination Command Option T The emoji keyboard was first available in Japan with the release of iPhone OS version in The emoji keyboard was not officially made available outside of Japan until iOS version From iPhone OS through to iOS those outside Japan could access the keyboard but had to use a third party app to enable it Apple has revealed that the face with tears of joy is the most popular emoji among English speaking Americans On second place is the heart emoji followed by the Loudly Crying Face br An update for Windows and Windows Server R brought a subset of the monochrome Unicode set to those operating systems as part of the Segoe UI Symbol font As of Windows Preview the Segoe UI Emoji font is included which supplies full color pictographs The plain Segoe UI font lacks emoji characters whereas Segoe UI Symbol and Segoe UI Emoji include them Emoji characters are accessed through the onscreen keyboard s key or through the physical keyboard shortcut Win br In Firefox added in browser emoji rendering for platforms lacking in native support br Facebook and Twitter replace all Unicode emoji used on their websites with their own custom graphics Prior to October Facebook had different sets for the main site and for its Messenger service where only the former provides complete coverage Messenger now uses Apple emoji on iOS and the main Facebook set elsewhere Facebook reactions are only partially compatible with standard emoji br br br Modifiers br br br Emoji versus text presentation br Unicode defines variation sequences for many of its emoji to indicate their desired presentation br br Emoji characters can have two main kinds of presentation br an emoji presentation with colorful and perhaps whimsical shapes even animated br a text presentation such as black white br Specifying the desired presentation is done by following the base emoji with either U FE E VARIATION SELECTOR VS for text or U FE F VARIATION SELECTOR VS for emoji style As of version Unicode defines presentation sequences for characters However the Unicode Technical Committee has since determined that unifying colourful emoji characters with textual symbols and dingbats was a mistake and resolved to allocate new code points rather than defining new presentation sequences br br br Skin color br br Five symbol modifier characters were added with Unicode to provide a range of skin tones for human emoji These modifiers are called EMOJI MODIFIER FITZPATRICK TYPE and U F FB U F FF They are based on the Fitzpatrick scale for classifying human skin color Human emoji that are not followed by one of these five modifiers should be displayed in a generic non realistic skin tone such as bright yellow blue or gray Non human emoji like U FD FUEL PUMP are unaffected by the Fitzpatrick modifiers br As of Unicode version Fitzpatrick modifiers can be used with human emoji spread across seven blocks Dingbats Emoticons Miscellaneous Symbols Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs Symbols and Pictographs Extended A and Transport and Map Symbols br The following table shows both the Unicode characters and the open source Twemoji images designed by Twitter br br br Joining br br Implementations may use a zero width joiner ZWJ between multiple emoji to make them behave like a single unique emoji character For example the sequence U F MAN U D ZERO WIDTH JOINER U F WOMAN U D ZERO WIDTH JOINER U F GIRL could be displayed as a single emoji depicting a family with a man a woman and a girl if the implementation supports it Systems that do not support it would ignore the ZWJs displaying only the three base emoji in order br Unicode previously maintained a catalog of emoji ZWJ sequences that were supported on at least one commonly available platform The consortium has since switched to documenting sequences that are recommended for general interchange RGI These are clusters that emoji fonts are expected to include as part of the standard br The ZWJ has also been used to implement platform specific emoji For example in Microsoft released a series of Ninja Cat emoji for their Windows Anniversary Update The sequence U F CAT FACE U D ZERO WIDTH JOINER U F BUST IN SILHOUETTE were used to create Ninja Cat Ninja Cat and variants were removed in late s Fluent
