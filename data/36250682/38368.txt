Technologies br br br Biography br br br Early life br Carmack was born in Shawnee Mission Kansas the son of local television news reporter Stan Carmack He grew up in the Kansas City metropolitan area where he became interested in computers at an early age He attended Shawnee Mission East High School in Prairie Village Kansas and Raytown South High School in nearby Raytown Missouri br Carmack was introduced to video games with the shoot em up game Space Invaders in the arcades during a summer vacation as a child The maze chase arcade game Pac Man also left a strong impression on him He cited Nintendo designer Shigeru Miyamoto as the game developer he most admired br As reported in David Kushner s Masters of Doom when Carmack was he broke into a school with other children to steal Apple II computers To gain entry to the building Carmack concocted a sticky substance of thermite mixed with Vaseline that melted through the windows However an overweight accomplice struggled to get through the hole and instead opened the window setting off a silent alarm and alerting police Carmack was arrested and sent for psychiatric evaluation He was sentenced to a year in a juvenile home He attended the University of Missouri Kansas City for two semesters before withdrawing to work as a freelance programmer br br br Career br Softdisk a computer company in Shreveport Louisiana hired Carmack to work on Softdisk G S an Apple IIGS publication introducing him to John Romero and other future key members of id Software such as Adrian Carmack no relation Later Softdisk would place this team in charge of a new but short lived bi monthly game subscription product called Gamer s Edge for the IBM PC DOS platform In while still at Softdisk Carmack Romero and others created the first of the Commander Keen games a series that was published by Apogee Software under the shareware distribution model from onwards Afterwards Carmack left Softdisk to co found id Software br Carmack has pioneered or popularized the use of many techniques in computer graphics including adaptive tile refresh for Commander Keen ray casting for Hovertank D Catacomb D and Wolfenstein D binary space partitioning which Doom became the first game to use surface caching which he invented for Quake Carmack s Reverse formally known as z fail stencil shadows which he devised for Doom and MegaTexture technology first used in Enemy Territory Quake Wars Quake popularized the fast inverse square root algorithm br Carmack s engines have also been licensed for use in other influential first person shooters such as Half Life Call of Duty and Medal of Honor In when Carmack was on vacation with his wife he ended up playing some games on his cellphone and decided he was going to make a good mobile game br br On August Carmack joined Oculus VR as their CTO On November he resigned from id Software to work full time at Oculus VR Carmack s reason for leaving was that id s parent company ZeniMax Media did not want to support Oculus Rift Carmack s role at both companies later became central to a ZeniMax lawsuit against Oculus parent company Facebook claiming that Oculus stole ZeniMax s virtual reality intellectual property The trial jury absolved Carmack of liability though Oculus and other corporate officers were held liable for trademark copyright and contract violations br br In February Carmack sued ZeniMax claiming the company had refused to pay him the remaining million million in owed to him from their purchase of id Software In October Carmack stated that he and ZeniMax had reached an agreement and that Zenimax has fully satisfied their obligations to me ending the suit br On November Carmack stepped down from the Oculus CTO role to become a Consulting CTO in order to allocate more time to his work on artificial general intelligence AGI On August Carmack announced that he has raised M for Keen Technologies his new AGI company On December Carmack left Oculus to focus on Keen br br br Workstyle br br Carmack has maintained a sixty hour work week working a hour day six days a week throughout his career He has spoken publicly about the importance of long hours of uninterrupted focus in his work Not only does high intensity allow him to make progress more quickly but long hours are also critical to maintaining a focused mindset over time Despite working such a demanding schedule he has never experienced burnout br Carmack is also known for taking week long programming retreats These retreats involve a solitary uninterrupted period away from his normal routine often sequestered in a random city and hotel The goal of these retreats is to allow Carmack to operate at full cognitive capacity tackling a specific difficult problem or learning a new skill The solitude and physical isolation of these retreats offer the perfect environment for deep focus and reflection making them an essential part of Carmack s creative process br Carmack was vocal about his frustration with the bureaucratic inefficiencies he encountered during his time at Meta In his departure memo he stated We have a ridiculous amount of people and resources but we constantly self sabotage and squander effort he wrote I have never been able to kill stupid things before they cause damage or set a direction and have a team actually stick to it br Carmack subscribes to the philosophy that small incremental steps are the fastest route to meaningful and disruptive innovation He compares this approach to the magic of gradient descent where small steps using local information result in the best outcomes According to Carmack this principle is proven by his own experience and he has observed this in many of the smartest people in the world He states Little tiny steps using local information winds up leading to all the best answers br br br Armadillo Aerospace br br Around Carmack became interested in rocketry a hobby of his youth Reviewing how much money he was spending on customizing Ferraris he began by giving financial support to a few local amateur engineers Carmack funded the company called Armadillo Aerospace out of his own pocket for something north of a million dollars a year The company of hobbyists made steady progress toward their goals of suborbital space flight and eventual orbital vehicles In October Armadillo Aerospace competed in a NASA contest known as the Lunar Lander Challenge winning first place in the Level competition along with in In September they completed Level and were awarded in The company went into hibernation mode in br According to Carmack the work in the Aerospace industry is simple compared to the work he does in video games br br br Open source software br Carmack is an advocate of open source software and has repeatedly voiced his opposition to software patents equating them to robbery He has also contributed to open source projects such as starting the initial port of the X Window System to Mac OS X Server and working to improve the OpenGL drivers for Linux through the Utah GLX project br Carmack released the source code for Wolfenstein D in and the Doom source code in first under a custom license and then under the GNU General Public License GPL in When the source code to Quake was leaked and circulated among the Quake community underground in after licensee Crack dot Com was hacked a programmer unaffiliated with id Software named Greg Alexander used it to port Quake to Linux using SVGALib As this was more feature rich than Dave Taylor s earlier X port he sent the patches to Carmack Instead of pursuing legal action id Software used the patches as the foundation for a company sanctioned Linux port maintained by new hire Zoid Kirsch who later ported Quakeworld and Quake II to Linux as well br id Software has since publicly released the source code to Quake in Quake in Quake in and lastly Doom in and later the BFG Edition in The source code for Hovertank D and Catacomb D as well as Carmack s earlier Catacomb was released in June by Flat Rock Software with Carmack s blessing He has since expressed regret on using the copyleft GPL over the more permissive BSD license br The release of id Tech occurred despite patent concerns from Creative Labs over Carmack s reverse while the original Doom source release shipped without music due to complications with the Cygnus Studios developed DMX library which lead to the Linux version being selected for release Carmack has since advised developers to be careful when utilizing middleware noting how it can limit the possibilities of later releasing source code Tim Sweeney has implied this issue has hindered potential releases of older Unreal Engine source code br On the other hand despite his technical admiration for the system Carmack has several times over the years voiced a sceptical opinion about Linux as a gaming platform In he argued for emulation as the proper technical direction for gaming on Linux and in he voiced the opinion that Linux might be the biggest problem for the success of the Steam Machine br Carmack contributes to charities and gaming communities Some of the recipients of Carmack s charitable contributions include his former high school promoters of open source software opponents of software patents and game enthusiasts br br br Personal life br Carmack was so successful at id that by mid he had purchased two Ferraris a Ferrari and a Ferrari Testarossa In he gave away the Ferrari as a prize to Dennis Fong the winner of the Quake tournament Red Annihilation br He met his now ex wife Katherine Anna Kang at the QuakeCon when she visited id s offices As a bet Kang challenged Carmack to sponsor the first All Female Quake Tournament if she was able to produce a significant number of participants Carmack predicted a maximum of participants but there were Carmack and Kang married on January and planned a ceremony in Hawaii Steve Jobs requested that they would postpone the ceremony so Carmack could attend the MacWorld Expo on January Carmack declined and suggested making a video instead Carmack and Kang had a son Christopher Ryan in August Their second son was born in November br Carmack is divorced as of On May he announced his divorce and how he met his partner Trista through the VR Beat Saber games he would host via Twitter br As a game developer Carmack differed from many of his contemporaries by avoiding commitment to a final release date for any game he was developing Instead when asked for a release date on a new game Carmack would usually reply that the game would be released when it s done Employees at Apogee in their past years the publishers of games by id Software adopted this business practice as well In as a guest on The Joe Rogan Experience Carmack stated that his beliefs have changed over time I largely recant from that now On Rage s year development time he says I think we should have done whatever it would have taken to ship it years earlier Carmack also reflected on the internal development of Quake in this regard and described it as traumatic and says id Software could have split the game into two parts and shipped it earlier br Carmack has a blog last updated in previously a plan which could be accessed by making a finger request for johnc idsoftware com an active Twitter account and also occasionally posts comments to Slashdot br Carmack supported the presidential campaign of Libertarian Ron Paul and is an atheist During a conversation with Joe Rogan Carmack revealed that he had trained in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Judo for several years as a hobby br During his time at id Software a medium pepperoni pizza would arrive for Carmack from Domino s Pizza almost every day carried by the same delivery person for more than years Carmack had been such a regular customer that they continued to charge him prices br On occasion he has commended the efforts of similarly focused programmers first Ken Silverman who wrote the Build engine for D Realms and later with Tim Sweeney of Epic Games who wrote the Unreal Engine br br br Recognition br br br Games br br br br br br Bibliography br Kushner David Masters
