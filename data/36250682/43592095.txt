Mapillary is a service for sharing crowdsourced geotagged photos developed by remote company Mapillary AB based in Malm Sweden Mapillary was launched in and acquired by Meta Platforms in It offers street level imagery similar to Google Street View br br br History br Mapillary co founders were Jan Erik Solem Johan Gyllenspetz Peter Neubauer and Yubin Kuang According to Solem Mapillary was founded to allow crowdsourcing of street level imagery for use with computer vision br The project started in September with an iPhone app released in November followed by an Android app released in January br Mapillary received million in seed capital funding from a group of investors led by Sequoia Capital in January In March it raised M additional funding Atomico Sequoia LDV Capital and PlayFair for expanded operations including more computer vision talent and a San Francisco office In spring the company received M investment led by BMW i Ventures for a total estimated funding of M br In September Mapillary announced a collaboration with Amazon to use the Rekognition visual data analysis platform to extract text from Mapillary s huge database of million images As large cities struggle to manage current street sign inventories the first major project is identifying parking signs and extracting sign text for one large U S city which will use the data to build a parking app to help save drivers time when searching for parking In October the company made CNBC s annual list of top start ups to watch In November Mapillary released a software development kit SDK allowing interested third party software developers to integrate Mapillary image capture functionality in their apps opening the way for additional input channels br In June Facebook acquired Mapillary for an undisclosed amount After the acquisition commercial use of Mapillary was made available free of charge Due to Mapillary being widely used for contributing to OpenStreetMap and fears that Facebook might shut the service down a tool was subsequently created for synchronizing data between Mapillary and KartaView formerly OpenStreetCam By November over TiB or million images had been transferred to KartaView br In August Mapillary announced that more cameras will be available for contributors making possible streetside coverage of more places that Mapillary might not visit br br br Features br Mapillary offers different capturing modes including walking riding either a bike or car or panorama On September Mapillary announced that they now support panoramas and spherical photos br As of May Mapillary had around million photos and by December it had over million As of March it had million photos and by June Mapillary had over million photos and by August over million As of November Mapillary had over million photos As of January th Mapillary reached Billion photos br Mapillary images millions br br br Major dataset contributions br In Mapillary acquired major image datasets from two USA state transportation departments approximately million images each contributed by the Vermont Department of Transportation and the Arizona Department of Transportation br br br License br The images on Mapillary can be used under Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike International License CC BY SA There is special permission to derive data from the photos for contributing to OpenStreetMap and Wikimedia Commons The GPX tracks can be used without restriction and derived data can be used provided it is ODbL br The license was changed on April from CC BY NC to CC BY SA br Mobile apps Android and iPhone are proprietary software br br br Research datasets br In May Mapillary released an open source subset of its very large and ever expanding crowdsourced image dataset the Mapillary Vistas Dataset of street level images with pixel wise annotation to help train autonomous vehicle AI system algorithms With data from countries they described it as the world s largest most diverse dataset for object recognition on street level imagery and offered it free for both academic and commercial researchers but licensing is required for commercial product integration br br br Mapillary Tasker br On November Mapillary released a beta tool known as the Mapillary Tasker Mapillary Tasker enables a task creator to tell other contributors where help is needed and what needs to be done On the other hand contributors can sort through the various tasks listed on the beta and work on whatever projects are interesting and feasible br The tasks can range from completing coverage making map edits based on images and verifying object detection and separated between capture map edit and verification tasks on the actual tool As a side note because the tool is currently in beta users have to send requests to be reviewed by Mapillary administrators rather than having the autonomy to post whatever task you want assistance with br br br See also br Google Street View br
