Meta AI is an American company owned by Meta formerly Facebook that develops artificial intelligence and augmented and artificial reality technologies Meta AI deems itself an academic research laboratory focused on generating knowledge for the AI community and should not be confused with Meta s Applied Machine Learning AML team which focuses on the practical applications of its products br br br History br The laboratory was founded as Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research FAIR with locations at the headquarters in Menlo Park California London United Kingdom and a new laboratory in Manhattan FAIR was officially announced in September FAIR was first directed by New York University s Yann LeCun a deep learning professor and Turing Award winner Working with NYU s Center for Data Science FAIR s initial goal was to research data science machine learning and artificial intelligence and to understand intelligence to discover its fundamental principles and to make machines significantly more intelligent Research at FAIR pioneered the technology that led to face recognition tagging in photographs and personalized feed recommendation Vladimir Vapnik a pioneer in statistical learning joined FAIR in Vapnik is the co inventor of the support vector machine and one of the developers of the Vapnik Chervonenkis theory br FAIR opened a research center in Paris France in and subsequently launched smaller satellite research labs in Seattle Pittsburgh Tel Aviv Montreal and London In FAIR partnered with Google Amazon IBM and Microsoft in creating the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society an organization with a focus on open licensed research supporting ethical and efficient research practices and discussing fairness inclusivity and transparency br In J r me Pesenti former CTO of IBM s big data group assumed the role of president of FAIR while LeCun stepped down to serve as chief AI scientist In FAIR was placed th in the AI Research Rankings which ranked the top global organizations leading AI research FAIR quickly rose to eighth position in and maintained eighth position in the rank FAIR had approximately staff in and had the goal to double that number by br FAIR s initial work included research in learning model enabled memory networks self supervised learning and generative adversarial networks text classification and translation as well as computer vision FAIR released Torch deep learning modules as well as PyTorch in an open source machine learning framework which was subsequently used in several deep learning technologies such as Tesla s autopilot and Uber s Pyro Also in FAIR discontinued a research project once AI bots developed a language that was unintelligible to humans inciting conversations about dystopian fear of artificial intelligence going out of control However FAIR clarified that the research had been shut down because they had accomplished their initial goal to understand how languages are generated rather than out of fear br FAIR was renamed Meta AI following the rebranding that changed Facebook Inc to Meta Platforms Inc br In Meta AI predicted the D shape of million potential proteins in two weeks br br br Current research br br br Natural language processing and conversational AI br Artificial intelligence communication requires a machine to understand natural language and to generate language that is natural Meta AI seeks to improve these technologies to improve safe communication regardless of what language the user might speak Thus a central task involves the generalization of natural language processing NLP technology to other languages As such Meta AI actively works on unsupervised machine translation Meta AI seeks to improve natural language interfaces by developing aspects of chitchat dialogue such as repetition specificity response relatedness and question asking incorporating personality into image captioning and generating creativity based language br br In November a large language model designed for generating scientific text Galactica was released Meta withdrew Galactica on November due to offensiveness and inaccuracy Before the cancellation researchers were working on Galactica Instruct which would use instruction tuning to allow the model to follow instructions to manipulate LaTeX documents on Overleaf br br br LLaMA br br In February Meta AI launched LLaMA Large Language Model Meta AI a large language model ranging from B to B parameters br br br Hardware br Until Meta AI mainly used CPU and in house custom chip as hardware before finally switching to Nvidia GPU This necessitated a complete redesign of several data centers since they needed to times the networking capacity and new liquid cooling systems br br br MTIA v br The MTIA v is Meta s first generation AI training and inference accelerator developed specifically for Meta s recommendation workloads It was fabricated using TSMC s nm process technology and operates at a frequency of MHz In terms of processing power the accelerator provides TOPS at INT precision and TFLOPS at FP precision while maintaining a thermal design power TDP of W br Meta AI offers options for users to customize their interaction with its features Users are able to mute the AI chatbot on platforms like Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp temporarily halting notifications from the chatbot Some platforms also offer the ability to hide certain AI elements from their interface To locate the relevant settings users can consult the platform s help documentation or settings menu br Concerns br Since May the Meta AI chatbot has summarized news from various outlets without linking directly to original articles including in Canada where news links are banned on its platforms This use of news content without compensation has raised ethical and legal concerns especially as Meta continues to reduce news visibility on its platforms br br br Uses br Meta AI was pre installed on the second generation of Ray Ban Meta Smart Glasses on September as a voice assistant On April Meta announced an update to Meta AI on the smart glasses to enable multimodal input via Computer vision On July Meta announced that Meta AI with Vision would be incorporated into the Meta Quest for detection of physical objects in passthrough mode replacing the older voice assistant software in the Quest OS br br br See also br Meta Platforms br br br br br CircleOut July How Meta AI Impacts Our Lives Retrieved br br br External links br Official website
