title: Reception and criticism of WhatsApp security and privacy features
id: 55464554
This article provides a detailed chronological account of the historical reception and criticism of security and privacy features in the WhatsApp messaging service br br br br On May an unidentified security researcher from the Netherlands under the pseudonym WhatsappHack published a method to hijack WhatsApp accounts using a flaw in the authentication process to the Dutch websites Tweakers net and GeenStijl The method involved trying to log in to a person s account from another phone number and intercepting the verification text message that would be sent out WhatsappHack provided methods to accomplish this on both Symbian and Android operating systems One day after the publication of the articles WhatsApp issued a patch to both the Android and Symbian clients br In May another security hole was reported which left communication through WhatsApp susceptible to packet analysis WhatsApp communications data was sent and received in plaintext meaning messages could easily be read if packet traces were available br br br br In May security researchers noticed that new updates of WhatsApp sent messages with encryption but described the cryptographic method used as broken In August of the same year the WhatsApp support staff stated that messages sent in the latest version of the WhatsApp software for iOS and Android but not BlackBerry Windows Phone and Symbian were encrypted but did not specify the cryptographic method br On January an unknown hacker published a website that made it possible to change the status of any WhatsApp user so long as the phone number associated with the user s account was known On January WhatsApp reported that it had resolved the problem In reality WhatsApp s solution had been to block the website s IP address which had allowed a Windows tool to be made that could accomplish the same thing This problem has since been resolved by the institution of an IP address check on currently logged in sessions br On September Heise Security demonstrated how to use WhatsAPI to hijack any WhatsApp account br Shortly afterward WhatsApp threatened to initiate legal action against the developers of WhatsAPI an open source project and WhatsAPI temporarily took down their source code br This however did not address the underlying security failure and Heise Security claimed they had been able to successfully repeat the hacking of WhatsApp accounts The WhatsAPI team has since resumed active development br br br br On March the Saudi Arabia Communications and Information Technology Commission CITC issued a statement that mentioned possible measures against WhatsApp among other applications unless the service providers took serious steps to comply with monitoring and privacy regulations br In February the Schleswig Holstein Data Protection Authority advised against using WhatsApp as the service lacked privacy protection such as end to end client side encryption technology In late WhatsApp began its implementation of end to end encryption which it finished in April br A joint Canadian Dutch government investigation was launched into several concerns over WhatsApp s compliance with security regulations The primary concern of the investigators was that WhatsApp required users to upload their mobile phone s entire address book including contact information for contacts who were not using WhatsApp to be mirrored on WhatsApp s servers While WhatsApp stored these phone numbers in hash the data was not salted br In late the Dutch government released a press statement claiming that WhatsApp had changed its hashing method making it much harder to reverse and thus subsequently complied with all rules and regulations br On December Indrajeet Bhuyan and Saurav Kar demonstrated the WhatsApp Message Handler vulnerability which allows anyone to remotely crash WhatsApp just by sending a specially crafted kilobyte message A user who receives the message must delete the whole conversation to avoid crashing WhatsApp upon opening the conversation br br In early after WhatsApp launched a web client that can be used from the browser Bhuyan found that the client had two new security issues the WhatsApp photo privacy bug and the WhatsApp web photo sync bug br br br br On March WhatsApp introduced a document sharing feature that allows users to share PDF files with contacts br WhatsApp received criticism however about the default setting to automatically download attachments which raised concerns about the downloading of malware and malicious files once the feature expands to include more than just PDFs br In August WhatsApp announced that it will start sharing account information such as the phone number of the account owner and aggregated analytical data with Facebook WhatsApp claims that the address books message content and metadata of users would not be shared br According to WhatsApp this account information is shared to track basic metrics about how often people use our services and better fight spam on WhatsApp And by connecting your phone number with Facebook s systems Facebook can offer better friend suggestions and show you more relevant ads if you have an account with them It was further stated that User data will not be shared with advertisers and is only used internally on the Facebook services and that users would be given the choice to opt out of sharing this data with Facebook for advertisement purposes br In October the Article Working Party stated that it has serious concerns regarding the way that the information relating to the updated Terms of Service and Privacy Policy was provided to users and consequently about the validity of the users consent br From the latest client as of April end to end encryption is supported for all of a user s communications including file transfers and voice calls It uses Curve for key exchange HKDF for generation of session keys AES in CBC mode for encryption and HMAC SHA for integrity verification and SHA for generating the two digit fingerprints of both users identity keys so that users can verify encryption The encryption prevents even the company from being able to decrypt users communications This update was received well by security professionals and privacy enthusiasts and the move was praised by Amnesty International The US Federal Bureau of Investigation criticized the update as threatening the work of law enforcement br In WhatsApp received a score of out of points on the Electronic Frontier Foundation s Secure Messaging Scorecard It has received points for having communications encrypted in transit having communications encrypted with keys the provider doesn t have access to allowing users to verify contacts identities having past messages secure if the encryption keys are stolen having completed a recent independent security audit and having the security designs properly documented The missing seventh point is for the code not being open to independent review br br br br On January a research team from Ruhr University Bochum published a security analysis of group messaging protocols in WhatsApp and other messaging services that found a privacy concern in that WhatsApp s servers effectively control the membership in groups The report found that it would be therefore possible to add arbitrary phone numbers to a group chat such that future communication becomes insecure br In October the German software company Open Xchange criticized WhatsApp among others for using proprietary software and stated plans to create an open source alternative br br br The Guardian Incident br On January The Guardian reported that security researcher Tobias Boelter had found WhatsApp s policy of forcing re encryption of initially undelivered messages without informing the recipient to constitute a loophole whereby WhatsApp could disclose the content of these messages br WhatsApp and Open Whisper Systems officials disagreed with this assessment br After complaints from security researchers The Guardian substantially revised and corrected their articles and a follow up article from Boelter was removed In June The Guardian readers editor Paul Chadwick wrote that The Guardian was wrong to report in January that the popular messaging service WhatsApp had a security flaw so serious that it was a huge threat to freedom of speech br br In a detailed review I found that misinterpretations mistakes and misunderstandings happened at several stages of the reporting and editing process Cumulatively they produced an article that overstated its case br Chadwick also noted that since the Guardian article WhatsApp has been better secured by the introduction of optional two factor verification in February br br br br In May it was revealed that there was a security vulnerability in WhatsApp allowing a remote person to install a spyware just by making a call which does not even need to be answered Later in June another vulnerability was revealed allowing a user to transform an audio call into a video call without the victim consent and without the victim noticing A bug bounty of US was offered for this bug br In June WhatsApp announced that it would take legal action against users who send disproportionately high number of messages using their communication platform The company reiterated that its platform was meant for private messaging or for businesses to interact with their customers through their business app In a notification on their website the company stated Beginning on December WhatsApp will take legal action against those we determine are engaged in or assisting others in abuse that violates our terms of service such as automated or bulk messaging br In September WhatsApp was criticized for its implementation of a delete for everyone feature iOS users can elect to save media to their camera roll automatically When a user deletes media for everyone WhatsApp does not delete images saved in the iOS camera roll and so those users are able to keep the images WhatsApp released a statement saying that the feature is working properly and that images stored in the camera roll cannot be deleted due to Apple s security layers br In November WhatsApp released a new privacy feature that let users decide who adds them to the group br In December WhatsApp confirmed a security flaw that would allow hackers to use a malicious GIF image file to gain access to the recipient s data The flaw was first reported by a user named Awakened on GitHub with an explanation of how the exploit worked When the recipient opened the gallery within WhatsApp even if not sending the malicious image the hack is triggered and the device and its contents become vulnerable The flaw was patched and users were encouraged to update WhatsApp br On December WhatsApp fixed a security flaw that allowed cyber attackers to repeatedly crash the messaging application for all members of group chat which could only be fixed by forcing the complete uninstall and reinstall of the app The bug was discovered by Check Point in August and reported to WhatsApp It was fixed in version onwards br br br br In April WhatsApp sued the NSO Group for allegedly using the spyware it produces to hack at least WhatsApp users To which the company responded by claiming that it is not responsible for nor can it control how its clients use its software According to research by Citizen Lab countries which may have used the software to hack WhatsApp include Saudi Arabia Bahrain Kazakhstan Morocco Mexico and the United Arab Emirates br On December as part of an anti trust case against Google a complaint was made that WhatsApp gave Google access to private messages The complaint was heavily redacted due to being part of an ongoing case and therefore it cannot be determined if the claim alleges tampering with the app s end to end encryption or Google accessing user backups br br br br In January WhatsApp announced an update to its Privacy Policy which states that WhatsApp would collect the metadata of users and share it with Facebook and its family of companies starting in February Previously users could opt out of such data sharing but this will no longer be an option The new policy will not fully apply within the EU in order to comply with the GDPR The new policy will not allow WhatsApp to see or send messages which are still end to end encrypted but it will allow Facebook to see data such as what phone and operating system a user has the user s time zone IP address profile picture status phone number app usage and all of the contacts which are stored in WhatsApp br This move has drawn intense criticism for Facebook and WhatsApp with critics claiming that it erodes the users privacy br Facing pushback and lack of clarity about Facebook data sharing WhatsApp postponed the implementation of the updated privacy policy from February to May but announced they have no plans to limit the functionality of the app for those who don t approve the new terms or to give them persistent reminders to do so br br br ProPublica investigation br In September ProPublica published an extensive investigation into WhatsApp s use of outside contractors and artificial intelligence systems to examine user communication and its collaboration with law enforcement The investigation includes information from a complaint filed by a whistleblower with the U S Securities and Exchange Commission Internal WhatsApp company documents revealed Facebook s considerable efforts to brand WhatsApp as a paragon of privacy br WhatsApp employs around contractors in their s and s via Accenture at offices in Austin Texas Dublin and Singapore Their job is to review content reported by WhatsApp users and pay starts at hour When a user flags a message they ve received it and the previous four messages are decrypted and sent to this content review team A reviewer has less than a minute to decide whether to do nothing place the user on a watch list or ban them Due to pranks ambiguous content language nuances and translation errors the process is prone to misunderstandings br WhatsApp also uses artificial intelligence systems to scan unencrypted data collected from users profile image and status phone number IMEI and OS names and images of the user s WhatsApp groups a list of the user s electronic devices any Facebook or Instagram accounts and compares it against suspicious patterns or terms and images previously deemed abusive br WhatsApp shares message metadata with law enforcement agencies such as the Department of Justice If legally required or at its own discretion such as for investigating Facebook leaks it can provide critical location or account information or real time data on the recipients messaged a target subject WhatsApp message metadata has been used to help jail people such as whistleblower Natalie Edwards In WhatsApp reported instances of possible child exploitation imagery to the National Center for Missing Exploited Children br br br br br
