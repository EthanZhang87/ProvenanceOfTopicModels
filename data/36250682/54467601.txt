title: Infer Static Analyzer
id: 54467601
Infer sometimes referred to as Facebook Infer is a static code analysis tool developed by an engineering team at Facebook along with open source contributors It provides support for Java C C and Objective C and br is deployed at Facebook in the analysis of its Android and iOS apps including those for WhatsApp Instagram Messenger and the main Facebook app br br br History br Infer has its roots in academic research on Separation Logic a theory for the formal verification of software Work on automatic program verification based on Separation Logic led to a succession of academic tools including Smallfoot and SpaceInvader Building on the academic work Cristiano Calcagno Dino Distefano and Peter O Hearn three researchers at University College London and Queen Mary University of London co founded the verification startup Monoidics in and Monoidics developed the first version of Infer Monoidics was acquired by Facebook in and in the code of Infer was open sourced br As of when Infer was open sourced it was claimed that hundreds of bugs per month identified by Infer were fixed by Facebook s developers before reaching production By this had increased to over bugs per month br Spotify Uber Mozilla Sky and Marks and Spencer are among the reported users of Infer br br br Technology br Infer performs checks for null pointer exceptions resource leaks annotation reachability missing lock guards and concurrency race conditions in Android and Java code It checks for null pointer problems memory leaks coding conventions and unavailable API s in C C and Objective C br Infer uses a technique called bi abduction to perform a compositional program analysis that interprets program procedures independently of their callers It is claimed that this enables Infer to scale to large codebases and to run quickly on code changes in an incremental fashion while still performing an inter procedural analysis that reasons across procedure boundaries br Infer is wired up to the code review system at Facebook Its deployment model is to comment automatically on code modifications as they are submitted for review where it reports potential regressions It does this by incrementally analyzing code changes via a job on Facebook s continuous integration system which runs in its data centers br Infer also has a domain specific language for abstract syntax tree linting based on ideas from Model Checking for Computation Tree Logic br br Infer is mostly written in the OCaml programming language br br br Awards br Dino Distefano received the Royal Academy of Engineering silver medal in in recognition of the acquisition of Monoidics br Four Infer team members Josh Berdine Cristiano Calcagno Dino Distafano and Peter O Hearn received the Computer Aided Verification Award an award they shared with John C Reynolds Samin Ishtiaq and Hongseok Yang br Peter O Hearn was elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in for his work on Separation Logic and Infer br br br br br br External links br Official website
