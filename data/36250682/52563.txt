the president of the United States and is a member of the president s Cabinet The current attorney general is Merrick Garland who has served since March br The Justice Department contains most of the

Environment and Natural Resources National Security and Justice Management Divisions The department also includes the U S Attorneys Offices for each of the U S federal judicial districts br The U S Congress created the Justice Department in during the presidency of Ulysses S Grant The Justice Department s functions originally date to when Congress created the office of the Attorney General br br br History br The office of the attorney general was established by the Judiciary Act of as a part time job for one person but grew with the bureaucracy At one time the attorney general gave legal advice to the U S Congress as well as the president however in the attorney general began advising Congress alone to ensure a manageable workload Until the salary of the attorney general was set by statute at less than the amount paid to other Cabinet members Early attorneys general supplemented their salaries by running private law practices often arguing cases before the courts as attorneys for paying litigants The lightness of the office is exemplified by Edward Bates Attorney General under Abraham Lincoln to Bates had only a small operation with a staff of six The main function was to generate legal opinions at the request of Lincoln and cabinet members and handle occasional cases before the Supreme Court Lincoln s cabinet was full of experienced lawyers who seldom felt the need to ask for his opinions Bates had no authority over the US Attorneys around the country The federal court system was handled by the Interior Department the Treasury handled claims Most of the opinions turned out by Bates s office were of minor importance Lincoln gave him no special assignments and did not seek his advice on Supreme Court appointments Bates did have an opportunity to comment on general policy as a cabinet member with a strong political base but he seldom spoke up br Following unsuccessful efforts in and to make attorney general a full time job in the U S House Committee on the Judiciary led by Congressman William Lawrence conducted an inquiry into the creation of a law department headed by the attorney general and also composed of the various department solicitors and United States attorneys On February Lawrence introduced a bill in Congress to create the Department of Justice President Ulysses S Grant signed the bill into law on June br Grant appointed Amos T Akerman as attorney general and Benjamin H Bristow as America s first solicitor general the same week that Congress created the Department of Justice The Department s immediate function was to preserve civil rights It set about fighting against domestic terrorist groups who had been using both violence and litigation to oppose the th th and th Amendments to the Constitution br br Both Akerman and Bristow used the Department of Justice to vigorously prosecute Ku Klux Klan members in the early s In the first few years of Grant s first term in office there were indictments against Klan members with over convictions from the Department of Justice By there were indictments and convictions with most only serving brief sentences while the ringleaders were imprisoned for up to five years in the federal penitentiary in Albany New York The result was a dramatic decrease in violence in the South Akerman gave credit to Grant and told a friend that no one was better or stronger than Grant when it came to prosecuting terrorists George H Williams who succeeded Akerman in December continued to prosecute the Klan throughout until the spring of during Grant s second term in office Williams then placed a moratorium on Klan prosecutions partially because the Justice Department inundated by cases involving the Klan did not have the manpower to continue prosecutions br The Act to Establish the Department of Justice drastically increased the attorney general s responsibilities to include the supervision of all United States attorneys formerly under the Department of the Interior the prosecution of all federal crimes and the representation of the United States in all court actions barring the use of private attorneys by the federal government The law also created the office of Solicitor General to supervise and conduct government litigation in the Supreme Court of the United States br With the passage of the Interstate Commerce Act in the federal government took on some law enforcement responsibilities and the Department of Justice was tasked with performing these br In control of federal prisons was transferred to the new department from the Department of the Interior New facilities were built including the penitentiary at Leavenworth in and a facility for women located in West Virginia at Alderson was established in br In President Franklin D Roosevelt issued an executive order which gave the Department of Justice responsibility for the functions of prosecuting in the courts of the United States claims and demands by and offsenses sic against the Government of the United States and of defending claims and demands against the Government and of supervising the work of United States attorneys marshals and clerks in connection therewith now exercised by any agency or officer br br br Headquarters br br The U S Department of Justice building was completed in from a design by Milton Bennett Medary Upon Medary s death in the other partners of his Philadelphia firm Zantzinger Borie and Medary took over the project On a lot bordered by Constitution and Pennsylvania Avenues and Ninth and Tenth Streets Northwest it holds over square feet m of space br Various efforts none entirely successful have been made to determine the original intended meaning of the Latin motto appearing on the Department of Justice seal Qui Pro Domina Justitia Sequitur literally Who For Lady Justice Strives It is not even known exactly when the original version of the DOJ seal itself was adopted or when the motto first appeared on the seal The most authoritative opinion of the DOJ suggests that the motto refers to the Attorney General and thus by extension to the Department of Justice who prosecutes on behalf of justice or the Lady Justice br The motto s conception of the prosecutor or government attorney as being the servant of justice itself finds concrete expression in a similarly ordered English language inscription THE
