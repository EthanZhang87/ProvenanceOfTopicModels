title: Signal (messaging app)
id: 45210316
Signal is an encrypted messaging service for instant messaging voice calls and video calls The instant messaging function includes sending text voice notes images videos and other files Communication may be one to one between users or may involve group messaging br The application uses a centralized computing architecture and is cross platform software It is developed by the non profit Signal Foundation and its subsidiary Signal Messenger LLC Signal s software is free and open source Its mobile clients desktop client and server are all published under the AGPL only license The official Android app generally uses the proprietary Google Play Services although it is designed to be able to work without them Signal is also distributed for iOS and desktop programs for Windows macOS and Linux Registration for desktop use requires an iOS or Android device br Signal uses mobile telephone numbers to register and manage user accounts though configurable usernames were added in March to allow users to hide their phone number from other users After removing support for SMS on Android in the app now secures all communications with end to end encryption The client software includes mechanisms by which users can independently verify the identity of their contacts and the integrity of the data channel br The non profit Signal Foundation was launched in February with initial funding of million from WhatsApp co founder Brian Acton As of January the platform had approximately million monthly active users As of May it was downloaded more than million times br br br History br br br Origins br Signal is the successor of the RedPhone encrypted voice calling app and the TextSecure encrypted texting program The beta versions of RedPhone and TextSecure were first launched in May by Whisper Systems a startup company co founded by security researcher Moxie Marlinspike and roboticist Stuart Anderson Whisper Systems also produced a firewall and tools for encrypting other forms of data All of these were proprietary enterprise mobile security software and were only available for Android br In November Whisper Systems announced that it had been acquired by Twitter Neither company disclosed the financial terms of the deal The acquisition was done primarily so that Mr Marlinspike could help the then startup improve its security Shortly after the acquisition Whisper Systems RedPhone service was made unavailable Some criticized the removal arguing that the software was specifically targeted to help people under repressive regimes and that it left people like the Egyptians in a dangerous position during the events of the Egyptian revolution of br Twitter released TextSecure as free and open source software under the GPLv license in December RedPhone was also released under the same license in July Marlinspike later left Twitter and founded Open Whisper Systems as a collaborative Open Source project for the continued development of TextSecure and RedPhone br br br Open Whisper Systems br br Open Whisper Systems website was launched in January br In February Open Whisper Systems introduced the second version of their TextSecure Protocol now Signal Protocol which added end to end encrypted group chat and instant messaging capabilities to TextSecure Toward the end of July they announced plans to merge the RedPhone and TextSecure applications as Signal This announcement coincided with the initial release of Signal as a RedPhone counterpart for iOS The developers said that their next steps would be to provide TextSecure instant messaging capabilities for iOS unify the RedPhone and TextSecure applications on Android and launch a web client Signal was the first iOS app to enable end to end encrypted voice calls for free TextSecure compatibility was added to the iOS application in March br br From its launch in May until March the Android version of Signal then called TextSecure included support for encrypted SMS MMS messaging From version onward the Android application only supported sending and receiving encrypted messages via the data channel Reasons for this included security flaws of SMS MMS and problems with the key exchange Open Whisper Systems abandonment of SMS MMS encryption prompted some users to create a fork named Silence initially called SMSSecure that is meant solely for the exchange of encrypted SMS and MMS messages br In November the TextSecure and RedPhone applications on Android were merged to become Signal for Android A month later Open Whisper Systems announced Signal Desktop a Chrome app that could link with a Signal mobile client At launch the app could only be linked with the Android version of Signal On September Open Whisper Systems announced that Signal Desktop could now be linked with the iOS version of Signal as well On October Open Whisper Systems announced that the Chrome app was deprecated At the same time they announced the release of a standalone desktop client based on the Electron framework for Windows macOS and certain Linux distributions br On October the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU and Open Whisper Systems published a series of documents revealing that OWS had received a subpoena requiring them to provide information associated with two phone numbers for a federal grand jury investigation in the first half of Only one of the two phone numbers was registered on Signal and because of how the service is designed OWS was only able to provide the time the user s account had been created and the last time it had connected to the service Along with the subpoena OWS received a gag order requiring OWS not to tell anyone about the subpoena for one year OWS approached the ACLU and they were able to lift part of the gag order after challenging it in court OWS said it was the first time they had received a subpoena and that they were committed to treating any future requests the same way br In March Open Whisper Systems transitioned Signal s calling system from RedPhone to WebRTC also adding the ability to make video calls with the mobile apps br br br Since Signal Technology Foundation br br On February Moxie Marlinspike and WhatsApp co founder Brian Acton announced the formation of the Signal Technology Foundation a c nonprofit organization whose mission is to support accelerate and broaden Signal s mission of making private communication accessible and ubiquitous Acton started the foundation with million in funding and became the foundation s executive chairman after leaving WhatsApp s parent company Facebook in September Marlinspike continued as Signal Messenger s first CEO As of Signal ran entirely on donations as a nonprofit br Between November and February Signal added iPad support view once images and videos stickers and reactions They also announced plans for a new group messaging system and an experimental method for storing encrypted contacts in the cloud br Signal was reportedly popularized in the United States during the George Floyd protests Heightened awareness of police monitoring led protesters to use the platform to communicate Black Lives Matter organizers had used the platform for several years During the first week of June the encrypted messaging app was downloaded over five times more than it had been during the week prior to the murder of George Floyd In June Signal Foundation announced a new feature that enables users to blur faces in photos in response to increased federal efforts to monitor protesters br On January Signal saw a surge in new user registrations which temporarily overwhelmed Signal s capacity to deliver account verification messages CNN and MacRumors linked the surge with a WhatsApp privacy policy change and a Signal endorsement by Elon Musk and Edward Snowden via Twitter The surge was also tied to the far right attack on the United States Capitol International newspapers reported similar trends in the United Arab Emirates Reuters reported that more than people had installed Signal between and January br Between and January the number of Signal installations listed on Google Play increased from over million to over million br On January due to the surge of new users Signal was overwhelmed with the new traffic and was down for all users On the afternoon of January Signal announced via Twitter that service had been restored br On January Moxie Marlinspike announced that he was stepping down from his role as CEO of Signal Messenger He continues to remain on the Signal Foundation s board of directors and Brian Acton has volunteered to serve as interim CEO during the search for a new CEO br In August Signal notified users that their data had been affected by the Twilio breach including user phone numbers and SMS verification codes At least one journalist had his account re registered to a device he did not control as a result of the attack br In September Signal Messaging LLC announced that AI researcher and noted critic of big tech Meredith Whittaker would fill the newly created position of President br br br Usage br br Signal s userbase started in May when its predecessor TextSecure was launched by Whisper Systems According to App Annie Signal had approximately million monthly active users at the end of December In January the BBC reported that Signal was used by over million people br br br Developers and funding br br The development of Signal and its predecessors at Open Whisper Systems was funded by a combination of consulting contracts donations and grants The Freedom of the Press Foundation acted as Signal s fiscal sponsor Between and the project received grants from the Knight Foundation the Shuttleworth Foundation and almost million from the US government sponsored Open Technology Fund Signal is now developed by Signal Messenger LLC a software company founded by Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton in which is wholly owned by a tax exempt nonprofit corporation called the Signal Technology Foundation also created by them in The Foundation was funded with an initial loan of million from Acton to support accelerate and broaden Signal s mission of making private communication accessible and ubiquitous All of the organization s products are published as free and open source software br In November Meredith Whittaker revealed that she expected the annual cost of running Signal to reach million in with the current cost estimated around million br br br Features br Signal provides one to one and group voice and video calls with up to forty participants on iOS Android and desktop platforms The calls are carried via the devices wired or wireless carrier or WiFi data connections The application can send text messages documents files voice notes pictures GIFs and video messages The platform also supports group messaging br All communication sessions between Signal users are automatically end to end encrypted the encryption keys are generated and stored on the devices and not on servers To verify that a correspondent is really the person that they claim to be Signal users can compare key fingerprints or scan QR codes out of band The platform employs a trust on first use mechanism to notify the user if a correspondent s key changes br Until on Android users could opt into making Signal the default SMS MMS application allowing them to send and receive unencrypted SMS messages in addition to the standard end to end encrypted Signal messages Users could then use the same application to communicate with contacts who do not have Signal As of October this feature has been deprecated due to safety and security concerns and was removed in br TextSecure allowed the user to set a passphrase that encrypted the local message database and the user s encryption keys This did not encrypt the user s contact database or message timestamps The Signal applications on Android and iOS can be locked with the phone s pin passphrase or biometric authentication The user can define a screen lock timeout interval providing an additional protection mechanism in case the phone is lost or stolen br Signal has a feature for scheduling messages In addition timers may be attached to messages to automatically delete the messages from both the sender s and the receivers devices The time period for keeping the message may be between five seconds and one week and begins for each recipient once they have read their copy of the message The developers stressed that this is meant to be a collaborative feature for conversations where all participants want to automate minimal data hygiene not for situations where the recipient is an adversary br Signal s app icon may be changed from with a variety of colour themes for customization and the application name can also be customized Upcoming features includes hiding spoilers as well adding other users via QR code br Signal excludes users messages from non encrypted cloud backups by default br Signal allows users to automatically blur faces of people in photos to protect identities br Signal includes a cryptocurrency wallet functionality for storing sending and receiving in app payments Apart from certain regions and countries the feature was enabled globally in November As of January the only supported payment method is MobileCoin br In February Signal added a username feature to the beta version of the app This is a privacy feature that allows users to communicate with others without having to share their telephone number br br br Limitations br Signal requires that the user provide a telephone number for verification eliminating the need for user names or passwords and facilitating contact discovery see below The number does not have to be the same as on the device s SIM card it can also be a VoIP number or a landline as long as the user can receive the verification code and have a separate device to set up the software A number can only be registered on one mobile device at a time Account registration requires an iOS or Android device br This mandatory connection to a telephone number a feature Signal shares with WhatsApp KakaoTalk and others has been criticized as a major issue for privacy conscious users who are not comfortable with giving out their private number A workaround is to use a secondary phone number The ability to choose a public changeable username instead of sharing one s phone number is a widely requested feature This feature was added to the beta version of Signal in February br Using phone numbers as identifiers may also create security risks that arise from the possibility of an attacker taking over a phone number A similar vulnerability was used to attack at least one user in August though the attack was performed via the provider of Signal s SMS services not any user s provider The threat of this attack can be mitigated by enabling Signal s Registration Lock feature a form of two factor authentication that requires the user to enter a PIN to register the phone number on a new device br When linking Signal Desktop to a mobile device the conversations history will not be synced only the new messages will be shown on Signal Desktop br br br Usability br In July the Internet Society published a user study that assessed the ability of Signal users to detect and deter man in the middle attacks The study concluded that out of participants failed to correctly compare public key fingerprints in order to verify the identity of other Signal users and that most of these users believed they had succeeded while they had actually failed Four months later Signal s user interface was updated to make verifying the identity of other Signal users simpler br In the French government is pushing for the adoption of a European encrypted messaging alternative to Signal and WhatsApp named Olvid as their secured platform for communications br br br Architecture br br br Encryption protocols br br Signal messages are encrypted with the Signal Protocol formerly known as the TextSecure Protocol The protocol combines the Double Ratchet Algorithm prekeys and an Extended Triple Diffie Hellman X DH handshake It uses Curve AES and HMAC SHA as primitives The protocol provides confidentiality integrity authentication participant consistency destination validation forward secrecy backward secrecy a k a future secrecy causality preservation message unlinkability message repudiation participation repudiation and asynchronicity It does not provide anonymity preservation and requires servers for the relaying of messages and storing of public key material br The Signal Protocol also supports end to end encrypted group chats The group chat protocol is a combination of a pairwise double ratchet and multicast encryption In addition to the properties provided by the one to one protocol the group chat protocol provides speaker consistency out of order resilience dropped message resilience computational equality trust equality subgroup messaging as well as contractible and expandable membership br In October researchers from Ruhr University Bochum published an analysis of the Signal Protocol Among other findings they presented an unknown key share attack on the protocol but in general they found that it was secure In October researchers from UK s University of Oxford Queensland University of Technology in Australia and Canada s McMaster University published a formal analysis of the protocol They concluded that the protocol was cryptographically sound In July researchers from Ruhr University Bochum found during another analysis of group messengers a purely theoretic attack against the group protocol of Signal A user who knows the secret group ID of a group due to having been a group member previously or stealing it from a member s device can become a member of the group Since the group ID cannot be guessed and such member changes are displayed to the remaining members this attack is likely to be difficult to carry out without being detected br As of August the Signal Protocol has been implemented into WhatsApp Facebook Messenger Skype and Google Allo making it possible for the conversations of more than a billion people worldwide to be end to end encrypted In Google Allo Skype and Facebook Messenger conversations are not encrypted with the Signal Protocol by default they only offer end to end encryption in an optional mode br Up until March Signal s voice calls were encrypted with SRTP and the ZRTP key agreement protocol which was developed by Phil Zimmermann In March Signal transitioned to a new WebRTC based calling system that introduced the ability to make video calls Signal s voice and video calling functionalities use the Signal Protocol channel for authentication instead of ZRTP br br br Authentication br To verify that a correspondent is really the person that they claim to be Signal users can compare key fingerprints or scan QR codes out of band The platform employs a trust on first use mechanism in order to notify the user if a correspondent s key changes br br br Local storage br After receiving and decrypting messages the application stored them locally on each device in a SQLite database that is encrypted with SQLCipher The cryptographic key for this database is also stored locally and can be accessed if the device is unlocked In December Cellebrite published a blog post announcing that one of their products could now access this key and use it to decrypt the Signal app Technology reporters later published articles about how Cellebrite had claimed to have the ability to break into the Signal app and crack Signal s encryption This latter interpretation was rejected by several experts as well as representatives from Signal who said the original post by Cellebrite had been about accessing data on an unlocked Android phone in their physical possession and that they could have just opened the app to look at the messages Similar extraction tools also exist for iOS devices and Signal Desktop br br br Servers br Signal relies on centralized servers that are maintained by Signal Messenger In addition to routing Signal s messages the servers also facilitate the discovery of contacts who are also registered Signal users and the automatic exchange of users public keys By default Signal s voice and video calls are peer to peer If the caller is not in the receiver s address book the call is routed through a server in order to hide the users IP addresses br br br Contact discovery br The servers store registered users phone numbers public key material and push tokens which are necessary for setting up calls and transmitting messages In order to determine which contacts are also Signal users cryptographic hashes of the user s contact numbers are periodically transmitted to the server The server then checks to see if those match any of the SHA hashes of registered users and tells the client if any matches are found The hashed numbers are thereafter discarded from the server In Moxie Marlinspike wrote that it is easy to calculate a map of all possible hash inputs to hash outputs and reverse the mapping because of the limited preimage space the set of all possible hash inputs of phone numbers and that a practical privacy preserving contact discovery remains an unsolved problem In September Signal s developers announced that they were working on a way for the Signal client applications to efficiently and scalably determine whether the contacts in their address book are Signal users without revealing the contacts in their address book to the Signal service br br br Metadata br All client server communications are protected by TLS Signal s developers have asserted that their servers do not keep logs about who called whom and when In June Marlinspike told The Intercept that the closest piece of information to metadata that the Signal server stores is the last time each user connected to the server and the precision of this information is reduced to the day rather than the hour minute and second br The group messaging mechanism is designed so that the servers do not have access to the membership list group title or group icon Instead the creation updating joining and leaving of groups is done by the clients which deliver pairwise messages to the participants in the same way that one to one messages are delivered br br br Federation br Signal s server architecture was federated between December and February In December it was announced that the messaging protocol Signal uses had successfully been integrated into the Android based open source operating system CyanogenMod Since CyanogenMod the client logic was contained in a system app called WhisperPush According to Signal s developers the Cyanogen team ran their own Signal messaging server for WhisperPush clients which federated with the main server so that both clients could exchange messages with each other The WhisperPush source code was available under the GPLv license In February the CyanogenMod team discontinued WhisperPush and recommended that its users switch to Signal In May Moxie Marlinspike wrote that federation with the CyanogenMod servers had degraded the user experience and held back development and that their servers will probably not federate with other servers again br In May Moxie Marlinspike requested that a third party client called LibreSignal not use the Signal service or the Signal name As a result on May the LibreSignal project posted that the project was abandoned The functionality provided by LibreSignal was subsequently incorporated into Signal by Marlinspike br br br Licensing br The complete source code of the Signal clients for Android iOS and desktop is available on GitHub under a free software license This enables interested parties to examine the code and help the developers verify that everything is behaving as expected It also allows advanced users to compile their own copies of the applications and compare them with the versions that are distributed by Signal Messenger In March Moxie Marlinspike wrote that apart from some shared libraries that are not compiled with the project build due to a lack of Gradle NDK support Signal for Android is reproducible Signal s servers are partially open source but the server software s anti spam component is proprietary and closed source due to security concerns br br br Reception br br br Security br In October the Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF included Signal in their updated surveillance self defense guide In November Signal received a perfect score on the EFF s secure messaging scorecard it received points for having communications encrypted in transit having communications encrypted with keys the provider does not have access to end to end encryption making it possible for users to independently verify their correspondents identities having past communications secure if the keys are stolen forward secrecy having the code open to independent review open source having the security designs well documented and having a recent independent security audit At the time ChatSecure Orbot Pidgin with OTR Silent Phone and Telegram s optional secret chats also received seven out of seven points on the scorecard br Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden has endorsed Signal on multiple occasions In his keynote speech at SXSW in March he praised Signal s predecessors TextSecure and RedPhone for their ease of use In December Der Spiegel leaked slides from an internal NSA presentation dating to June in which the NSA deemed Signal s encrypted voice calling component RedPhone on its own as a major threat to its mission of accessing users private data and when used in conjunction with other privacy tools such as Cspace Tor Tails and TrueCrypt was ranked as catastrophic and led to a near total loss lack of insight to target communications and presence br Following the Democratic National Committee email leak it was reported by Vanity Fair that Marc Elias the general counsel for Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign had instructed DNC staffers to exclusively use Signal when saying anything negative about Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump br In March Signal was approved by the sergeant at arms of the U S Senate for use by senators and their staff br On September Natalie Silvanovich a security engineer working in Google s vulnerability research team at Project Zero disclosed how a bug in the Android Signal client could let an attacker spy on a user without their knowledge The bug allowed an attacker to phone a target device mute the call and the call would complete keeping the audio open but without the owner being aware of that however they would still be aware of a ring and or a vibration from the initial call The bug was fixed the same day that it was reported and patched in release of the app for Android br In February the European Commission recommended that its staff use Signal Following the George Floyd protests which began in May Signal was downloaded times in the U S between May and June In July Signal became the most downloaded app in Hong Kong on both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store after the passage of the Hong Kong national security law br As of January Signal is a contact method for securely providing tips to major news outlets such as The Washington Post The Guardian The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal br Candiru claims the ability to capture data from Signal Private Messenger with their spyware at a fee of br On August Ismail Sabri Yaakob the Prime Minister of Malaysia reported that his Signal account was hacked and infiltrated by a third party sending out messages and impersonating the politician No details were disclosed regarding the method used to gain access to the account br br br In app payments br In April Signal announced the addition of a cryptocurrency wallet feature that would allow users to send and receive payments in MobileCoin This received criticism from security expert Bruce Schneier who had previously praised the software Schneier stated that this would bloat the client and attract unwanted attention from the authorities The wallet functionality was initially only available in certain countries but was later enabled globally in November br br br Blocking br br In December Egypt blocked access to Signal In response Signal s developers added domain fronting to their service This allows Signal users in a specific country to circumvent censorship by making it look like they are connecting to a different internet based service As of May Signal s domain fronting is enabled by default in Egypt UAE Oman Qatar Iran Cuba Uzbekistan and Ukraine br As of January Signal was blocked in Iran Signal s domain fronting feature relies on the Google App Engine GAE service This does not work in Iran because Google has blocked Iranian access to GAE in order to comply with U S sanctions br In early Google App Engine made an internal change to stop domain fronting for all countries Due to this issue Signal made a public change to use Amazon CloudFront for domain fronting However AWS also announced that they would be making changes to their service to prevent domain fronting As a result Signal said that they would start investigating new methods approaches Signal switched from AWS back to Google in April br In January Iran removed the app from app stores and blocked Signal Signal was later blocked by China in March followed by its removal from the App Store in China on April br br br Audience br br br Use by activists br In the app was used for coordination and communication by protesters during the George Floyd protests as they relied on the app s end to end encryption to share information securely br In March the United Nations recommended Myanmar residents use Signal and Proton Mail to pass and preserve evidence of human rights violations committed during the coup br br br Controversial use br Signal s terms of service state that the product must not be used to violate the law According to a former employee Signal s leadership at the time told him they would say something if and when people start abusing Signal or doing things that we think are terrible In January the position of Signal s leadership was to take a hands off approach to moderation as the company s employees are not able to read user messages and the Signal Foundation does not want to be a media company br In authorities in India arrested members of a suspected ISIS affiliated terrorist cell that communicated via Signal br Extremist right wing militias and white nationalists use Signal for organizing their actions including the Unite the Right II rally in br The claim that Signal is used to fund terrorist or criminal activities is the justification for Turkey to criminalize the app for the general population which Abdullah Bozkurt claims is a way the government abuses its counterterrorism laws to punish critics opponents and dissidents br br br See also br
