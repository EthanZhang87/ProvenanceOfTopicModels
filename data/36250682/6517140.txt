Digital diplomacy also referred to as Digiplomacy and eDiplomacy see below has been defined as the use of the Internet and new information communication technologies to help achieve diplomatic objectives However other definitions have also been proposed The definition focuses on the interplay between internet and diplomacy ranging from Internet driven changes in the environment in which diplomacy is conducted to the emergence of new topics on diplomatic agendas such as cybersecurity privacy and more along with the use of internet tools to practice diplomacy br Platform specific terms that have also evolved in this diplomacy category include Facebook diplomacy Twitter diplomacy and Google diplomacy br br br Overview br The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office defines digital diplomacy as solving foreign policy problems using the internet a narrower definition that excludes internal electronic collaboration tools and mobile phone and tablet based diplomacy The US State Department uses the term st Century Statecraft The Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs Trade and Development calls it Open Policy br Digital diplomacy can be practiced by state agencies such as Foreign Ministries embassies and consulates individual diplomats such as ambassadors or ambassadors at large and non state actors such as civil society and human rights groups br br br History br The first foreign ministry to establish a dedicated ediplomacy unit was the US State Department which created the Taskforce on eDiplomacy in This Taskforce has since been renamed the Office of eDiplomacy and has approximately staff members about half of which are dedicated to ediplomacy related work br In April the US State Department set up a new Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy CDP Although there is no generally accepted definition in this report we consider cyber diplomacy to be efforts that support U S interests in cyberspace internationally led by the Department of State Indeed the new CDP bureau brings together the many disparate initiatives set up under the Obama Administration under the hyphenated term United States cyber diplomacy encompassing Hillary Clinton s st century statecraft br Other foreign ministries have also begun to embrace ediplomacy The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office began to develop a digital diplomacy strategy in and now has an Office of Digital Diplomacy that is involved in a range of ediplomacy activities Sweden has also been active in promotion of digital diplomacy especially through the online communication strategy of its foreign minister Carl Bildt who soon became best connected Twitter leader br In July global public relations and communications firm Burson Marsteller studied the use of Twitter by heads of state and government referred to as Twitter diplomacy The study on Twiplomacy found that there were Twitter accounts of heads of state and government and their institutions in countries worldwide and that only leader s tweet personally Since then the attention on digital diplomacy as a tool of public diplomacy has only increased In USC Center on Public Diplomacy has named Facebook recognizing Kosovo as a country as one of the top moments in public diplomacy for br In the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs hosted the Stockholm Initiative for Digital Diplomacy conference The initiative evolved into informal online campaigns under the umbrella DiplomacyUnited coordinating the work of a dozen embassies in Washington D C br According to the Twiplomacy Study published in July percent of UN member states had a diplomatic presence on Twitter Only Laos North Korea Sao Tome and Principe and Turkmenistan lacked representation on the social network br br br Facebook diplomacy br Facebook diplomacy is a user created hybrid of public diplomacy and citizen diplomacy as applied in the Facebook social networking platform After some earlier informal use the term Facebook diplomacy was described at a New York conference on social networking and technology in December br br During the December conference in New York the United States Undersecretary of Public Diplomacy James Glassman said New technology gives the United States and other free nations a significant advantage over terrorists In his presentation at New York s Columbia University Law School he went on to illustrate how Facebook diplomacy and on line activism created success through the use of Facebook groups and the use of the platform to create activism and cause global awareness relative to issues in Colombia against the infamous FARC rebels br Facebook ambassador may refer to Facebook Garage Ambassadors who are dedicated to the technical aspect of Facebook development Research Facebook Developer Garage and Garage In A Box br br br Opportunities in digital diplomacy br The rise of social media as a tool in diplomacy has given way for states to strike up two way or dialogic communication with other diplomatic actors and their foreign publics compared to the one way nature of traditional public diplomacy While traditional diplomacy occurs offline in relative privacy online diplomacy has allowed a multitude of actors to discuss foreign policy making increasing the impact of public opinion on the foreign policy agenda br This method of diplomacy provides additional avenues for other actors to engage in co creation with influential people and organizations on multilateral diplomatic campaigns An example of this would be the Campaign to End Sexual Violence in Conflict launched by then British foreign secretary William Hague which used a multi channel digital and offline approach to engage UN organizations as well as states A video featuring co created content by Angelina Jolie a UN Special Envoy supporting the campaign managed to attract views compared to the foreign secretary s similar video which only attracted views br This ability for states to listen to their audiences perceptions of their foreign policy is considered another potential benefit of digital diplomacy It can provide a new means for states who have severed formal diplomatic ties to collect information about each other s foreign policy positions For example despite the states strained diplomatic relationship the U S State Department follows the Iranian president on Twitter br Access to social media as a diplomatic channel has also changed the relative influence of diplomatic actors from states thought to possess little hard power or power achieved through material resources strength amongst other diplomatic actors A study done by Ilan Manor and Elad Segev in measured the social media mobility of ministries of foreign affairs and UN missions to New York finding that states with less hard power could use social media to become supernodes in online diplomatic networks This is also referred to this as the theory of networked diplomacy br br br Challenges in digital diplomacy br Though states have managed to achieve diplomatic prominence online through their use of Twitter and other online channels these new diplomatic channels do not come without risks Messages and images shared on social media platforms particularly Twitter have already given rise to diplomatic crises br In Global Affairs Canada tweeted a statement calling on Saudi Arabia to release imprisoned human rights activists In response Saudi Arabia cut diplomatic and trade ties with Canada declaring the country s ambassador persona non grata and recalling Saudi Arabia s ambassador to Canada br The incident escalated when a pro government Twitter account later tweeted an image of an Air Canada plane flying in the direction of Toronto s CN Tower with the text He who interferes with what doesn t concern him finds what doesn t please him The image incited criticism from many on social media due to perceived parallels between the image and the September attacks in the United States br Digital platforms have also enabled the spread of disinformation used to undermine states international and domestic stability such as the interference of the Russian government in the U S presidential election br br br See also
