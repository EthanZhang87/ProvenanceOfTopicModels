title: Privacy concerns with Facebook
id: 64534250
Meta Platforms Inc or Meta for short formerly known as Facebook has faced a number of privacy concerns These stem partly from the company s revenue model that involves selling information collected about its users for many things including advertisement targeting Meta Platforms Inc has also been a part of many data breaches that have occurred within the company These issues and others are further described including user data concerns vulnerabilities in the company s platform investigations by pressure groups and government agencies and even issues with students In addition employers and other organizations individuals have been known to use Meta Platforms Inc for their own purposes As a result individuals identities and private information have sometimes been compromised without their permission In response to these growing privacy concerns some pressure groups and government agencies have increasingly asserted the users right to privacy and to be able to control their personal data br br br User data concerns br br br Widening exposure of member information br In the Electronic Frontier Foundation identified two personal information aggregation techniques called connections and instant personalization They demonstrated that anyone could get access to information saved to a Facebook profile even if the information was not intended to be made public A connection is created when a user clicks a Like button for a product or service either on Facebook itself or an external site Facebook treats such relationships as public information and the user s identity may be displayed on the Facebook page of the product or service br Instant personalization was a pilot program that shared Facebook account information with affiliated sites such as sharing a user s list of liked bands with a music website so that when the user visits the site their preferred music plays automatically The EFF noted that For users that have not opted out Instant Personalization is instant data leakage As soon as you visit the sites in the pilot program Yelp Pandora and Microsoft Docs the sites can access your name your picture your gender your current location your list of friends all the Pages you have Liked everything Facebook classifies as public information Even if you opt out of Instant Personalization there s still data leakage if your friends use Instant Personalization websites their activities can give away information about you unless you block those applications individually br On December CBS News reported that Randi Zuckerberg sister of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg criticized a friend for being way uncool in sharing a private Facebook photo of her on Twitter only to be told that the image had appeared on a friend of a friend s Facebook news feed Commenting on this misunderstanding of Facebook s privacy settings Eva Galperin of the EFF said Even Randi Zuckerberg can get it wrong That s an illustration of how confusing they can be br br br Issues during br In August the code used to generate Facebook s home and search page as visitors browse the site was accidentally made public A configuration problem on a Facebook server caused the PHP code to be displayed instead of the web page the code should have created raising concerns about how secure private data on the site was A visitor to the site copied published and later removed the code from his web forum claiming he had been served and threatened with legal notice by Facebook Facebook s response was quoted by the site that broke the story br br A small fraction of the code that displays Facebook web pages was exposed to a small number of users due to a single misconfigured web server that was fixed immediately It was not a security breach and did not compromise user data in any way Because the code that was released powers only Facebook user interface it offers no useful insight into the inner workings of Facebook The reprinting of this code violates several laws and we ask that people not distribute it further br In November Facebook launched Beacon a system discontinued in September where third party websites could include a script by Facebook on their sites and use it to send information about the actions of Facebook users on their site to Facebook prompting serious privacy concerns Information such as purchases made and games played were published in the user s news feed An informative notice about this action appeared on the third party site and allowed the user to cancel it The user could also cancel it on Facebook Originally if no action was taken the information was automatically published On November this was changed to require confirmation from the user before publishing each story gathered by Beacon br On December Facebook s credibility in regard to the Beacon program was further tested when it was reported that The New York Times essentially accuses Mark Zuckerberg of lying to the paper and leaving Coca Cola which is reversing course on the program with a similar impression A security engineer at CA Inc also claimed in a November blog post that Facebook collected data from affiliate sites even when the consumer opted out and even when not logged into the Facebook site On November the CA security blog posted a Facebook clarification statement addressing the use of data collected in the Beacon program br br When a Facebook user takes a Beacon enabled action on a participating site information is sent to Facebook for Facebook to operate Beacon technologically If a Facebook user clicks No thanks on the partner site notification Facebook does not use the data and deletes it from its servers Separately before Facebook can determine whether the user is logged in some data may be transferred from the participating site to Facebook In those cases Facebook does not associate the information with any individual user account and deletes the data as well br The Beacon service ended in September along with the settlement of a class action lawsuit against Facebook resulting from the service br br br News feed and mini feed br On September Facebook introduced two new features called News Feed and Mini Feed The first of the new features News Feed appears on every Facebook member s home page displaying recent Facebook activities of the member s friends The second feature Mini Feed keeps a log of similar events on each member s profile page Members can manually delete items from their Mini Feeds if they wish to do so and through privacy settings can control what is actually published in their respective Mini Feeds br Some Facebook members still feel that the ability to opt out of the entire News Feed and Mini Feed system is necessary as evidenced by a statement from the Students Against Facebook News Feed group which peaked at over members in Reacting to users concerns Facebook developed new privacy features to give users some control over information about them that was broadcast by the News Feed According to subsequent news articles members have widely regarded the additional privacy options as an acceptable compromise br In May Facebook added privacy controls and streamlined its privacy settings giving users more ways to manage status updates and other information broadcast to the public News Feed Among the new privacy settings is the ability to control who sees each new status update a user posts Everyone Friends of Friends or Friends Only Users can now hide each status update from specific people as well However a user who presses like or comments on the photo or status update of a friend cannot prevent that action from appearing in the news feeds of all the user s friends even non mutual ones The View As option used to show a user how privacy controls filter out what a specific given friend can see only displays the user s timeline and gives no indication that items missing from the timeline may still be showing up in the friend s own news feed br br br Inability to voluntarily terminate accounts br Facebook had allowed users to deactivate their accounts but not actually remove account content from its servers A Facebook representative explained to a student from the University of British Columbia that users had to clear their own accounts by manually deleting all of the content including wall posts friends and groups The New York Times noted the issue and raised a concern that emails and other private user data remain indefinitely on Facebook s servers Facebook subsequently began allowing users to permanently delete their accounts in Facebook s Privacy Policy now states When you delete an account it is permanently deleted from Facebook br br br Memorials br A notable ancillary effect of social networking websites is the ability for participants to mourn publicly for a deceased individual On Facebook friends often leave messages of sadness grief or hope on the individual s page transforming it into a public book of condolences This particular phenomenon has been documented at a number of schools Facebook originally held a policy that profiles of people known to be deceased would be removed after days due to privacy concerns Due to user response Facebook changed its policy to place deceased members profiles in a memorialization state Facebook s Privacy Policy regarding memorialization says If we are notified that a user is deceased we may memorialize the user s account In such cases we restrict profile access to confirmed friends and allow friends and family to write on the user s Wall in remembrance We may close an account if we receive a formal request from the user s next of kin or other proper legal request to do so br Some of these memorial groups have also caused legal issues Notably on January one such memorial group posted the identity of murdered Toronto teenager Stefanie Rengel whose family had not yet given the Toronto Police Service their consent to release her name to the media and the identities of her accused killers in defiance of Canada s Youth Criminal Justice Act which prohibits publishing the names of the under age accused While police and Facebook staff attempted to comply with the privacy regulations by deleting such posts they noted difficulty in effectively policing the individual users who repeatedly republished the deleted information br br br Customization and security br In July Adrienne Felt an undergraduate student at the University of Virginia discovered a cross site scripting XSS hole in the Facebook Platform that could inject JavaScript into profiles She used the hole to import custom CSS and demonstrate how the platform could be used to violate privacy rules or create a worm br br br Inadequate privacy controls br Facebook offers privacy controls to allow users to choose who can view their posts only friends friends and friends of friends everyone custom specific choice of which friends can see posts While these options exist there are still methods by which otherwise unauthorized third parties can view a post For example posting a picture and marking it as only viewable by friends but tagging someone else as appearing in that picture causes the post to be viewable by friends of the tagged person s br Photos taken of people by others can be posted on Facebook without the knowledge or consent of people appearing in the image persons may have multiple photos which feature them on Facebook without being aware of it A study has suggested that a photo of a person which reflects poorly on them posted online can have a more harmful effect than losing a password br When commenting on a private post the commenting user is not informed if the post they commented on is later made public which would make their comment on said post also publicly viewable br br br Quit Facebook Day br Quit Facebook Day was an online event which took place on May coinciding with Memorial Day in which Facebook users stated that they would quit the social network due to privacy concerns br It was estimated that of Facebook users coming from the United States would delete their accounts br However only roughly of its roughly million members at the time users quit the site The number one reason for users to quit Facebook was privacy concerns being followed by a general dissatisfaction with Facebook negative aspects regarding Facebook friends and the feeling of getting addicted to Facebook Facebook quitters were found to be more concerned about privacy more addicted to the Internet and more conscientious br br br Photo recognition and face tagging br Facebook enabled an automatic facial recognition feature in June called Tag Suggestions a product of a research project named DeepFace The feature compares newly uploaded photographs to those of the uploader s Facebook friends to suggest photo tags br National Journal Daily claims Facebook is facing new scrutiny over its decision to automatically turn on a new facial recognition feature aimed at helping users identify their friends in photos Facebook has defended the feature saying users can disable it Facebook introduced the feature on an opt out basis European Union data protection regulators said they would investigate the feature to see if it violated privacy rules br Naomi Lachance stated in a web blog for NPR All Tech Considered that Facebook s facial recognition is right of the time compared to the FBI s out of people However the accuracy of Facebook searches is due to its larger more diverse photo selection compared to the FBI s closed database br Mark Zuckerberg showed no worries when speaking about Facebook s AIs saying Unsupervised learning is a long term focus of our AI research team at Facebook and it remains an important challenge for the whole AI research community and It will save lives by diagnosing diseases and driving us around more safely It will enable breakthroughs by helping us find new planets and understand Earth s climate It will help in areas we haven t even thought of today br In May Facebook faced a lawsuit in Illinois for violations of the Biometric Information Privacy Act In February the company settled agreeing to pay million and shut down the feature in December Following the shutdown Cher Scarlett a former Apple security engineer in January tweeted a photo that she had been auto tagged in by someone unknown to her prior to shutdown The photo was from the th century and she said that she learned it was her great great great grandmother of Volga German ancestry saying the technology was dangerous and off putting and pointed to the implication of genocide br br br Tracking of non members of Facebook br An article published by USA Today in November claimed that Facebook creates logs of pages visited both by its members and by non members relying on tracking cookies to keep track of pages visited br In early November Facebook was ordered by the Belgian Privacy Commissioner to cease tracking non users citing European laws or risk fines of up to per day As a result instead of removing tracking cookies Facebook banned non users in Belgium from seeing any material on Facebook including publicly posted content unless they sign in Facebook criticized the ruling saying that the cookies provided better security br br br Stalking br By statistics of Facebook profiles are automatically set visible to the public meaning anyone can access the profiles that users have updated Facebook also has its own built in messaging system that people can send messages to any other user unless they have disabled the feature to from friends only Stalking is not only limited to SNS stalking but can lead to further in person stalking because nearly of real life stalking victims reported it started with online instant messaging e g Facebook chat br br br Sharing private messages and contacts details without consent br In December it emerged that Facebook had during the period granted access to users private messages address book contents and private posts without the users consent to more than third parties including Microsoft Amazon Yahoo Netflix and Spotify This had been occurring despite public statements from Facebook that it had stopped such sharing years earlier br br br Denial of location privacy regardless of user settings br In December it emerged that Facebook s mobile app reveals the user s location to Facebook even if the user does not use the check in feature and has configured all relevant settings within the app so as to maximize location privacy br br br Health data from apps sent to Facebook without user consent br In February it emerged that a number of Facebook apps including Flo had been sending users health data such as blood pressure and ovulation status to Facebook without users informed consent New York governor Andrew Cuomo called the practice an outrageous abuse of privacy ordered New York s department of state and department of financial services to investigate and encouraged federal regulators to step in br br br Oculus and metaverse platforms br Facebook s acquisition of virtual reality headset manufacturer Oculus has resulted in ongoing concerns over the integration of its hardware and software platforms with Facebook user data After the acquisition Oculus co founder Palmer Luckey had assured users that you won t need to log into your Facebook account every time you wanna use the Oculus Rift br Initially the Oculus desktop software provided opt in integration with Facebook primarily for identifying Facebook users within their Oculus friends list In August Facebook announced that all Oculus products and services would become subject to the unified Facebook privacy policy code of conduct and community guidelines moving forward and that a Facebook account would be required to use Oculus products and services beginning in October This policy took effect beginning with the Oculus Quest At that time the ability to create a standalone Oculus account was discontinued and it was announced that these accounts were to be deprecated effective January br The requirements as well as Facebook s later focus on metaverse platforms have led to concerns over the amount of user data that could be collected by the company via virtual reality hardware and interactions including the user s surroundings motions and actions and biometrics Horizon a VR social network run as part of the Oculus platform is subject to Facebook policies performs rolling recordings of interactions that could be uploaded to Facebook servers for the purposes of moderation if users are reported and users can be observed by moderators without their knowledge if they are reported by others or signals regarding that user are raised by other users via their own actions such as muting br In September Facebook pulled all Oculus products from the German market due to concerns from local regulators over the policy s compliance with the European Union s General Data Protection Regulation GDPR In December the German Federal Cartel Office Bundeskartellamt launched an antitrust investigation into Facebook s mandatory integration of its social networking platform with its virtual reality products br At the Facebook Connect event in October where Facebook Inc announced its rebranding as Meta Zuckerberg stated that Meta was working on making it so you can log in into Quest with an account other than your personal Facebook account The new Meta account was announced in July as a de facto replacement for Oculus accounts which will not be explicitly tied to the Facebook social network and can be linked with other members of the Facebook Family of Apps Facebook Messenger Instagram and WhatsApp It was stated that Meta Quest users would be allowed to transition to Meta accounts and decouple their Facebook logins from its VR platforms Ars Technica noted that the new terms of service and privacy policies associated with Meta account system could allow enforcement of a real name policy stating that users would be obligated to provide accurate and up to date information including registration information which may include providing personal data and still allowed for rampant use of user data by Meta especially if linked with other Facebook apps br br br Scraping of contact information br Personal information of million Facebook users including names phone numbers email addresses and other user profile data was posted to a hacking forum in April This information had been previously leaked through a feature allowing users to find each other by phone number which Facebook fixed to prevent this abuse in September The company decided not to notify users of the data breach br The Irish Data Protection Commission which has jurisdiction over Facebook due to the location of its EU headquarters then opened an investigation into the breach as a possible violation of GDPR br br br Allegations of eavesdropping br There have been allegations by some users that Facebook s mobile app is capable of listening to conversations without consent citing instances of the service displaying advertisements for products that they had only spoken about and had otherwise had no prior interactions with In August Facebook admitted that it had been sending anonymized voice data from the Messenger app to third party contractors for human review to improve the quality of its automatic transcription function but denied that this data was being used for personalized advertising The company also stated that it had recently suspended human reviews after scrutiny over Amazon Apple and Google s use of similar practices for their voice assistant platforms br br br Platform vulnerabilities br br br Data mining br There have been some concerns expressed regarding the use of Facebook as a means of surveillance and data mining br Two Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT students used an automated script to download the publicly posted information of over Facebook profiles from four schools MIT NYU the University of Oklahoma and Harvard University as part of a research project on Facebook privacy published on December Since then Facebook has bolstered security protection for users responding We ve built numerous defenses to combat phishing and malware including complex automated systems that work behind the scenes to detect and flag Facebook accounts that are likely to be compromised based on anomalous activity like lots of messages sent in a short period of time or messages with links that are known to be bad br A second clause that brought criticism from some users allowed Facebook the right to sell users data to private companies stating We may share your information with third parties including responsible companies with which we have a relationship This concern was addressed by spokesman Chris Hughes who said Simply put we have never provided our users information to third party companies nor do we intend to Facebook eventually removed this clause from its privacy policy br In the United Kingdom the Trades Union Congress TUC has encouraged employers to allow their staff to access Facebook and other social networking sites from work provided they proceed with caution br In September Facebook drew criticism after it began allowing search engines to index profile pages though Facebook s privacy settings allow users to turn this off br Concerns were also raised on the BBC s Watchdog program in October when Facebook was shown to be an easy way to collect an individual s personal information to facilitate identity theft However there is barely any personal information presented to non friends if users leave the privacy controls on their default settings the only personal information visible to a non friend is the user s name gender profile picture and networks br An article in The New York Times in February pointed out that Facebook does not actually provide a mechanism for users to close their accounts and raised the concern that private user data would remain indefinitely on Facebook s servers As of Facebook gives users the options to deactivate or delete their accounts br Deactivating an account allows it to be restored later while deleting it will remove the account permanently although some data submitted by that account like posting to a group or sending someone a message will remain br br br Onavo and Facebook Research br br In Facebook acquired Onavo a developer of mobile utility apps such as Onavo Protect VPN which is used as part of an Insights platform to gauge the use and market share of apps This data has since been used to influence acquisitions and other business decisions regarding Facebook products Criticism of this practice emerged in when Facebook began to advertise the Onavo Protect VPN within its main app on iOS devices in the United States Media outlets considered the app to effectively be spyware due to its behavior adding that the app s listings did not readily disclaim Facebook s ownership of the app and its data collection practices Facebook subsequently pulled the iOS version of the app citing new iOS App Store policies forbidding apps from performing analytics on the usage of other apps on a user s device br Since Facebook has also run Project Atlas publicly known as Facebook Research a market research program inviting teenagers and young adults between the ages of and to have data such as their app usage web browsing history web search history location history personal messages photos videos emails and Amazon order history analyzed by Facebook Participants would receive up to per month for participating in the program Facebook Research is administered by third party beta testing services including Applause and requires users to install a Facebook root certificate on their phone After a January report by TechCrunch on Project Atlas which alleged that Facebook bypassed the App Store by using an Apple enterprise program for apps used internally by a company s employees Facebook refuted the article but later announced its discontinuation of the program on iOS br On January Apple temporarily revoked Facebook s Enterprise Developer Program certificates for one day which caused all of the company s internal iOS apps to become inoperable Apple stated that Facebook has been using their membership to distribute a data collecting app to consumers which is a clear breach of their agreement with Apple and that the certificates were revoked to protect our users and their data US Senators Mark Warner Richard Blumenthal and Ed Markey separately criticized Facebook Research s targeting of teenagers and promised to sponsor legislation to regulate market research programs br br br application privacy breach br In the Wall Street Journal found that many of Facebook s top rated apps including apps from Zynga and Lolapps were transmitting identifying information to dozens of advertising and Internet tracking companies like RapLeaf The apps used an HTTP referer that exposed the user s identity and sometimes their friends identities Facebook said that While knowledge of user ID does not permit access to anyone s private information on Facebook we plan to introduce new technical systems that will dramatically limit the sharing of User ID s A blog post by a member of Facebook s team further stated that press reports have exaggerated the implications of sharing a user ID though still acknowledging that some of the apps were passing the ID in a manner that violated Facebook s policies br br br user list br In Canadian security consultant Ron Bowes of Skull Security created a BitTorrent download consisting of the names of about million Facebook users Facebook likened the information to what is listed in a phone book It included some who had opted not to be found by search engines and some who did not realize their information was public Bowes created the list to get statistical information about user names which can be used in both penetration testing and computer break ins br br br AT T routing glitch br In and the fact that Facebook was not requiring connections to use HTTPS other than at login meant that a routing glitch at AT T caused cookie to end up on the wrong users phones This resulted in some Facebook users having continuous access to another person s account instead of their own br br br Facebook and Cambridge Analytica data scandal br br In Facebook admitted that an app made by Global Science Research and Alexandr Kogan related to Cambridge Analytica was able in to harvest personal data of up to million Facebook users without their consent by exploiting their friendship connection to the users who sold their data via the app Following the revelations of the breach several public figures including industrialist Elon Musk and WhatsApp cofounder Brian Acton announced that they were deleting their Facebook accounts using the hashtag deletefacebook br Facebook was also criticized for allowing the Barack Obama presidential campaign to analyze and target select users by providing the campaign with friendship connections of users who signed up for an application However users signing up for the application were aware that their data but not the data of their friends was going to a political party br br br Unpublished photo disclosure bug br In September a software bug meant that photos that had been uploaded to Facebook accounts but that had not been published and which therefore should have remained private between the user and Facebook were exposed to app developers Approximately million users and third party apps were affected br br br Unencrypted password storage br In March Facebook admitted that it had mistakenly stored hundreds of millions of passwords of Facebook and Instagram users in plaintext as opposed to being hashed and salted on multiple internal systems accessible only to Facebook engineers dating as far back as Facebook stated that affected users would be notified but that there was no evidence that this data had been abused or leaked br In April Facebook admitted that its subsidiary Instagram also stored millions of unencrypted passwords br Facebook has denied for years that it listens to conversations and in turn releases ads based on them however Facebook has been shown to have lied about their policies in the past In Facebook stated Facebook does not use your phone s microphone to inform ads or to change what you see in News Feed a spokeswoman said some recent articles have suggested that we must be listening to people s conversations in order to show them relevant ads This is not true We show ads based on people s interests and other profile information not what you re talking out loud about br br br Investigations br br br Cooperation with government requests br Government and local authorities rely on Facebook and other social networks to investigate crimes and obtain evidence to help establish a crime provide location information establish motives prove and disprove alibis and reveal communications Federal state and local investigations have not been restricted to profiles that are publicly available or willingly provided to the government Facebook has willingly provided information in response to government subpoenas or requests except with regard to private unopened inbox messages less than days old which would require a warrant and a finding of probable cause under federal law under Electronic Communications Privacy Act ECPA One article noted that even when the government lacks reasonable suspicion of criminal activity and the user opts for the strictest privacy controls Facebook users still cannot expect federal law to stop their private content and communications from being used against them br Facebook s privacy policy states that We may also share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity to prevent imminent bodily harm or to protect ourselves and you from people violating our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities This may include sharing information with other companies lawyers courts or other government entities Since the U S Congress has failed to meaningfully amend the ECPA to protect most communications on social networking sites such as Facebook and since the U S Supreme Court has largely refused to recognize a Fourth Amendment privacy right to information shared with a third party no federal statutory or constitutional right prevents the government from issuing requests that amount to fishing expeditions and there is no Facebook privacy policy that forbids the company from handing over private user information that suggests any illegal activity br The mass surveillance disclosures identified Facebook as a participant in the U S National Security Administration s PRISM program Facebook now reports the number of requests it receives for user information from governments around the world br In Nesbraska police charged a teenage girl and her mother after obtaining Facebook messages which allegedly showed that they performed an illegal self managed medication abortion br br br Complaint from CIPPIC br On May the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic CIPPIC per Director Phillipa Lawson filed a page complaint with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner against Facebook based on breaches of the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act PIPEDA University of Ottawa law students Lisa Feinberg Harley Finkelstein and Jordan Eric Plener initiated the minefield of privacy invasion suit Facebook s Chris Kelly contradicted the claims saying that We ve reviewed the complaint and found it has serious factual errors most notably its neglect of the fact that almost all Facebook data is willingly shared by users Assistant Privacy Commissioner Elizabeth Denham released a report of her findings on July In it she found that several of CIPPIC s complaints were well founded Facebook agreed to comply with some but not all of her recommendations The Assistant Commissioner found that Facebook did not do enough to ensure users granted meaningful consent for the disclosure of personal information to third parties and did not place adequate safeguards to prevent unauthorized access by third party developers to personal information br br br Investigation by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner br In August the Irish Data Protection Commissioner DPC started an investigation after receiving complaints by europe v facebook org which was founded by a group of Austrian students The DPC stated in first reactions that the Irish DPC is legally responsible for privacy on Facebook for all users within the European Union and that he will investigate the complaints using his full legal powers if necessary The complaints were filed in Ireland because all users who are not residents of the United States or Canada have a contract with Facebook Ireland Ltd located in Dublin Ireland Under European law Facebook Ireland is the data controller for facebook com and therefore facebook com is governed by European data protection laws Facebook Ireland Ltd was established by Facebook Inc to avoid US taxes see Double Irish arrangement br The group europe v facebook org made access requests at Facebook Ireland and received up to pages of data per person in data categories that Facebook was holding about them including data that was previously removed by the users The group claimed that Facebook failed to provide some of the requested data including likes facial recognition data data about third party websites that use social plugins visited by users and information about uploaded videos Currently the group claims that Facebook holds at least data categories about every user br The first complaints target different problems from undeleted old pokes all the way to the question if sharing and new functions on Facebook should be opt in or opt out The second wave of more complaints was targeting more issues including one against the Like button The most severe could be a complaint that claims that the privacy policy and the consent to the privacy policy is void under European laws br In an interview with the Irish Independent a spokesperson said that the DPC will go and audit Facebook go into the premises and go through in great detail every aspect of security He continued by saying It s a very significant detailed and intense undertaking that will stretch over four or five days In December the DPC published its first report on Facebook This report was not legally binding but suggested changes that Facebook should undertake until July The DPC is planning to do a review about Facebook s progress in July br br br Changes br In spring Facebook had to undertake many changes e g having an extended download tool that should allow users to exercise the European right to access all stored information or an update of the worldwide privacy policy These changes were seen as not sufficient to comply with European law by europe v facebook org The download tool does not allow for example access to all data The group has launched our policy org to suggest improvements to the new policy which they saw as a backdrop for privacy on Facebook Since the group managed to get more than comments on Facebook s pages Facebook had to do a worldwide vote on the proposed changes Such a vote would have only been binding if of all users would have taken part Facebook did not promote the vote resulting in only participation with about voting against Facebook s new policy The new privacy policy took effect on the same day br br br International lobbying against privacy protections br In early it was reported that Facebook had spent years lobbying extensively against privacy protection laws around the world such as GDPR br br The lobbying included efforts by Sandberg to bond with female European officials including Enda Kenny then Prime Minister of Ireland where Facebook s European operations are based to influence them in Facebook s favor Other politicians reportedly lobbied by Facebook in relation to privacy protection laws included George Osborne then Chancellor of the Exchequer Pranab Mukherjee then President of India and Michel Barnier br In Facebook attempted to use a legal trick to bypass GDPR regulations in the European Union by including personal data processing agreement in what they considered to be a contract Article b GDPR rather than a consent Article a GDPR which would lead to the user effectively granting Facebook a very broad permission to process their personal data with most of the GDPR controls void Irish Data Protection Commission DPC expressed its preliminary approval for this bypass and sent its draft decision to other data protection authorities in the European Union at which point the document was leaked to media and published on noyb eu DPC sent a takedown notice to noyb eu which was also published by the portal which reject to self censor br br br Promotion of service as free br In December the Hungarian Competition Authority fined Facebook around US million for false advertising ruling that Facebook cannot market itself as a free no cost service because the use of detailed personal information to deliver targeted advertising constituted a compensation that must be provided to Facebook to use the service br br br Student related issues br br br Student privacy concerns br Students who post illegal or otherwise inappropriate material have faced disciplinary action from their universities colleges and schools including expulsion Others posting libelous content relating to faculty have also faced disciplinary action The Journal of Education for Business states that a recent study of Facebook profiles found that had comments regarding alcohol had photos involving alcohol use had comments regarding sexual activities had seminude or sexually provocative photos and included the use of profanity It is inferred that negative or incriminating Facebook posts can affect alumni s and potential employers perception of them This perception can greatly impact the students relationships ability to gain employment and maintain school enrollment The desire for social acceptance leads individuals to want to share the most intimate details of their personal lives along with illicit drug use and binge drinking Too often these portrayals of their daily lives are exaggerated and or embellished to attract others like minded to them br br br Effect on class engagement br Students in general have a higher engagement when using Facebook groups in class as students can comment on each other s short writings or videos Increased teacher student and student student interaction improved performance and convenience of learning were some of the benefits of using Facebook as an educational instrument However it limits student s writing to be shorter since checking on spelling and typing on a phone keyboard is relatively more time consuming br br br Effect on higher education br On January The Chronicle of Higher Education continued an ongoing national debate on social networks with an opinion piece written by Michael Bugeja director of the Journalism school at Iowa State University entitled Facing the Facebook Bugeja author of the Oxford University Press text Interpersonal Divide quoted representatives of the American Association of University Professors and colleagues in higher education to document the distraction of students using Facebook and other social networks during class and at other venues in the wireless campus Bugeja followed up on January in The Chronicle with an article titled Distractions in the Wireless Classroom quoting several educators across the country who were banning laptops in the classroom Similarly organizations such as the National Association for Campus Activities the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication and others have hosted seminars and presentations to discuss ramifications of students use of Facebook and other social networking sites br The EDUCAUSE Learning Initiative has also released a brief pamphlet entitled Things You Should Know About Facebook aimed at higher education professionals that describes what Facebook is where it is going and why it matters to teaching and learning br Some research on Facebook in higher education suggests that there may be some small educational benefits associated with student Facebook use including improving engagement which is related to student retention research has found that time spent on Facebook is related to involvement in campus activities This same study found that certain Facebook activities like commenting and creating or RSVPing to events were positively related to student engagement while playing games and checking up on friends was negatively related Furthermore using technologies such as Facebook to connect with others can help college students be less depressed and cope with feelings of loneliness and homesickness br br br Effect on college student grades br As of February only four published peer reviewed studies have examined the relationship between Facebook use and grades The findings vary considerably Pasek et al found no relationship between Facebook use and grades Kolek and Saunders found no differences in overall grade point average GPA between users and non users of Facebook Kirschner and Karpinski found that Facebook users reported a lower mean GPA than non users Junco s study clarifies the discrepancies in these findings While Junco found a negative relationship between time spent on Facebook and student GPA in his large sample of college students the real world impact of the relationship was negligible Furthermore Junco found that sharing links and checking up on friends were positively related to GPA while posting status updates was negatively related In addition to noting the differences in how Facebook use was measured among the four studies Junco concludes that the ways in which students use Facebook are more important in predicting academic outcomes br br br Miscellaneous br br br Performative surveillance br Performative surveillance is the notion that people are very much aware that they are being surveilled on websites like Facebook and use the surveillance as an opportunity to portray themselves in a way that connotes a certain lifestyle of which that individual may or may not distort how they are perceived in reality br br br Employer employee privacy issues br In an effort to surveil the personal lives of current or prospective employees some employers have asked employees to disclose their Facebook login information This has resulted in the passing of a bill in New Jersey making it illegal for employers to ask potential or current employees for access to their Facebook accounts Although the U S government has yet to pass a national law protecting prospective employees and their social networking sites from employers the fourth amendment of the US constitution can protect prospective employees in specific situations Many companies examine Facebook profiles of job candidates looking for reasons to not hire them Because of this many employees feel like their online social media rights and privacy are being violated In addition employees begin to make performative profiles where they purposefully portray themselves as professional and have desired personality traits According to a survey of hiring managers by CareerBuilder com the most common deal breakers they found on Facebook profiles include references to drinking poor communication skills inappropriate photos and lying about skills and or qualifications br Facebook requires employees and contractors working for them to give permission for Facebook to access their personal profiles including friend requests and personal messages br br br Users violating minimum age requirements br A study in the online journal First Monday examines how parents consistently enable children as young as years old to sign up for accounts directly violating Facebook s policy banning young visitors This policy is in compliance with a United States law the Children s Online Privacy Protection Act which requires minors aged under to gain explicit parental consent to access commercial websites In jurisdictions where a similar law sets a lower minimum age Facebook enforces the lower age Of the households surveyed for the study of parents reported that their child joined Facebook at an age younger than the minimum age in the site s terms of service The study also reported that Facebook removes roughly users each day for violating its minimum age policy The study s authors also note Indeed Facebook takes various measures both to restrict access to children and delete their accounts if they join The findings of the study raise questions primarily about the shortcomings of United States federal law but also implicitly continue to raise questions about whether or not Facebook does enough to publicize its terms of service with respect to minors Only of parents said they were aware that Facebook has a minimum signup age of these parents believe that the minimum age is merely a recommendation or thought the signup age was or not br br br Phishing br br Phishing refers to a scam used by criminals to trick people into revealing passwords credit card information and other sensitive information On Facebook
