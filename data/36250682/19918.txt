The megabyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information Its recommended unit symbol is MB The unit prefix mega is a multiplier of in the International System of Units SI Therefore one megabyte is one million bytes of information This definition has been incorporated into the International System of Quantities br In the computer and information technology fields other definitions have been used that arose for historical reasons of convenience A common usage has been to designate one megabyte as bytes B a quantity that conveniently expresses the binary architecture of digital computer memory Standards bodies have deprecated this binary usage of the mega prefix in favor of a new set of binary prefixes by means of which the quantity B is named mebibyte symbol MiB br br br Definitions br The unit megabyte is commonly used for one million bytes or bytes The interpretation of using base originated as technical jargon for the byte multiples that needed to be expressed by the powers of but lacked a convenient name As approximates roughly corresponding to the SI prefix kilo it was a convenient term to denote the binary multiple In the International Electrotechnical Commission IEC published standards for binary prefixes requiring the use of megabyte to denote bytes and mebibyte to denote bytes By the end of the IEC Standard had been adopted by the IEEE EU ISO and NIST Nevertheless the term megabyte continues to be widely used with different meanings br br Base br MB bytes B B is the definition following the rules of the International System of Units SI and the International Electrotechnical Commission IEC This definition is used in computer networking contexts and most storage media particularly hard drives flash based storage and DVDs and is also consistent with the other uses of the SI prefix in computing such as CPU clock speeds or measures of performance The Mac OS X file manager is a notable example of this usage in software Since Snow Leopard file sizes are reported in decimal units br In this convention one thousand megabytes MB is equal to one gigabyte GB where GB is one billion bytes br br Base br br MB bytes B B is the definition used by Microsoft Windows in reference to computer memory such as random access memory RAM This definition is synonymous with the unambiguous binary unit mebibyte In this convention one thousand and twenty four megabytes MB is equal to one gigabyte GB where GB is bytes i e GiB br Mixed br MB bytes B is the definition used to describe the formatted capacity of the MB inch HD floppy disk which actually has a capacity of bytes br Randomly addressable semiconductor memory doubles in size for each address lane added to an integrated circuit package which favors counts that are powers of two The capacity of a disk drive is the product of the sector size number of sectors per track number of tracks per side and the number of disk platters in the drive Changes in any of these factors would not usually double the size br br br Examples of use br br Depending on compression methods and file format a megabyte of data can roughly be br br a megapixel bitmap image e g with colors bits pixel color depth stored without any compression br seconds of kHz bit uncompressed CD audio br minute of kbit s MP lossy compressed audio br a typical English book volume in plain text format pages characters per page br The novel The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde hosted on Project Gutenberg as an uncompressed plain text file is MB Great Expectations is MB and Moby Dick is MB br The human genome consists of DNA representing MB of data The parts that differentiate one person from another can be compressed to MB br br br See also br Timeline of binary prefixes br Gigabyte Consumer confusion br br br br br br External links br Historical Notes About The Cost Of Hard Drive Storage Space br the megabyte established definition in Networking and Storage industries from whatis com br International Electrotechnical Commission definitions br IEC prefixes and symbols for binary multiples Archived at the Wayback Machine
