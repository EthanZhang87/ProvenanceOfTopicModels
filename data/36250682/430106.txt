id: 430106
In computer science a software agent is a computer program that acts for a user or another program in a relationship of agency br The term agent is derived from the Latin agere to do an agreement to act on one s behalf Such action on behalf of implies the authority to decide which if any action is appropriate Some agents are colloquially known as bots from robot They may be embodied as when execution is paired with a robot body or as software such as a chatbot executing on a computer such as a mobile device e g Siri Software agents may be autonomous or work together with other agents or people Software agents interacting with people e g chatbots human robot interaction environments may possess human like qualities such as natural language understanding and speech personality or embody humanoid form see Asimo br Related and derived concepts include intelligent agents in particular exhibiting some aspects of artificial intelligence such as reasoning autonomous agents capable of modifying the methods of achieving their objectives distributed agents being executed on physically distinct computers multi agent systems distributed agents that work together to achieve an objective that could not be accomplished by a single agent acting alone and mobile agents agents that can relocate their execution onto different processors br br br Concepts br The basic attributes of an autonomous software agent are that agents br br are not strictly invoked for a task but activate themselves br may reside in wait status on a host perceiving context br may get to run status on a host upon starting conditions br do not require interaction of user br may invoke other tasks including communication br br The term agent describes a software abstraction an idea or a concept similar to OOP terms such as methods functions and objects The concept of an agent provides a convenient and powerful way to describe a complex software entity that is capable of acting with a certain degree of autonomy in order to accomplish tasks on behalf of its host But unlike objects which are defined in terms of methods and attributes an agent is defined in terms of its behavior br Various authors have proposed different definitions of agents these commonly include concepts such as br br persistence code is not executed on demand but runs continuously and decides for itself when it should perform some activity br autonomy agents have capabilities of task selection prioritization goal directed behavior decision making without human intervention br social ability agents are able to engage other components through some sort of communication and coordination they may collaborate on a task br reactivity agents perceive the context in which they operate and react to it appropriately br br br Distinguishing agents from programs br All agents are programs but not all programs are agents Contrasting the term with related concepts may help clarify its meaning Franklin Graesser discuss four key notions that distinguish agents from arbitrary programs reaction to the environment autonomy goal orientation and persistence br br br Intuitive distinguishing agents from objects br Agents are more autonomous than objects br Agents have flexible behavior reactive proactive social br Agents have at least one thread of control but may have more br br br Distinguishing agents from expert systems br Expert systems are not coupled to their environment br Expert systems are not designed for reactive proactive behavior br Expert systems do not consider social ability br br br Distinguishing intelligent software agents from intelligent agents in AI br Intelligent agents also known as rational agents are not just computer programs they may also be machines human beings communities of human beings such as firms or anything that is capable of goal directed behavior br Russell Norvig br br br Impact of software agents br Software agents may offer various benefits to their end users by automating complex or repetitive tasks However there are organizational and cultural impacts of this technology that need to be considered prior to implementing software agents br br br Organizational impact br br br Work contentment and job satisfaction impact br People like to perform easy tasks providing the sensation of success unless the repetition of the simple tasking is affecting the overall output In general implementing software agents to perform administrative requirements provides a substantial increase in work contentment as administering their own work does never please the worker The effort freed up serves for a higher degree of engagement in the substantial tasks of individual work Hence software agents may provide the basics to implement self controlled work relieved from hierarchical controls and interference Such conditions may be secured by application of software agents for required formal support br br br Cultural impact br The cultural effects of the implementation of software agents include trust affliction skills erosion privacy attrition and social detachment Some users may not feel entirely comfortable fully delegating important tasks to software applications Those who start relying solely on intelligent agents may lose important skills for example relating to information literacy In order to act on a user s behalf a software agent needs to have a complete understanding of a user s profile including his her personal preferences This in turn may lead to unpredictable privacy issues When users start relying on their software agents more especially for communication activities they may lose contact with other human users and look at the world with the eyes of their agents These consequences are what agent researchers and users must consider when dealing with intelligent agent technologies br br br History br The concept of an agent can be traced back to Hewitt s Actor Model Hewitt A self contained interactive and concurrently executing object possessing internal state and communication capability br To be more academic software agent systems are a direct evolution of Multi Agent Systems MAS MAS evolved from Distributed Artificial Intelligence DAI Distributed Problem Solving DPS and Parallel AI PAI thus inheriting all characteristics good and bad from DAI and AI br John Sculley s Knowledge Navigator video portrayed an image of a relationship between end users and agents Being an ideal first this field experienced a series of unsuccessful top down implementations instead of a piece by piece bottom up approach The range of agent types is now from broad WWW search engines etc br br br Examples of intelligent software agents br br br Buyer agents shopping bots br Buyer agents travel around a network e g the internet retrieving information about goods and services These agents also known as shopping bots work very efficiently for commodity products such as CDs books electronic components and other one size fits all products Buyer agents are typically optimized to allow for digital payment services used in e commerce and traditional businesses br br br User agents personal agents br User agents or personal agents are intelligent agents that take action on your behalf In this category belong those intelligent agents that already perform or will shortly perform the following tasks br br Check your e mail sort it according to the user s order of preference and alert you when important emails arrive br Play computer games as your opponent or patrol game areas for you br Assemble customized news reports for you There are several versions of these including CNN br Find information for you on the subject of your choice br Fill out forms on the Web automatically for you storing your information for future reference br Scan Web pages looking for and highlighting text that constitutes the important part of the information there br Discuss topics with you ranging from your deepest fears to sports br Facilitate with online job search duties by scanning known job boards and sending the resume to opportunities who meet the desired criteria br Profile synchronization across heterogeneous social networks br br br Monitoring and surveillance predictive agents br Monitoring and surveillance agents are used to observe and report on equipment usually computer systems The agents may keep track of company inventory levels observe competitors prices and relay them back to the company watch stock manipulation by insider trading and rumors etc br br For example NASA s Jet Propulsion Laboratory has an agent that monitors inventory planning schedules equipment orders to keep costs down and manages food storage facilities These agents usually monitor complex computer networks that can keep track of the configuration of each computer connected to the network br A special case of Monitoring and Surveillance agents are organizations of agents used to emulate the Human Decision Making process during tactical operations The agents monitor the status of assets ammunition weapons available platforms for transport etc and receive Goals Missions from higher level agents The Agents then pursue the Goals with the Assets at hand minimizing expenditure of the Assets while maximizing Goal Attainment See Popplewell Agents and Applicability br br br Data mining agents br This agent uses information technology to find trends and patterns in an abundance of information from many different sources The user can sort through this information in order to find whatever information they are seeking br A data mining agent operates in a data warehouse discovering information A data warehouse brings together information from many different sources Data mining is the process of looking through the data warehouse to find information that you can use to take action such as ways to increase sales or keep customers who are considering defecting br Classification is one of the most common types of data mining which finds patterns in information and categorizes them into different classes Data mining agents can also detect major shifts in trends or a key indicator and can detect the presence of new information and alert you to it For example the agent may detect a decline in the construction industry for an economy based on this relayed information construction companies will be able to make intelligent decisions regarding the hiring firing of employees or the purchase lease of equipment in order to best suit their firm br br br Networking and communicating agents br Some other examples of current intelligent agents include some spam filters game bots and server monitoring tools Search engine indexing bots also qualify as intelligent agents br br User agent for browsing the World Wide Web br Mail transfer agent For serving E mail such as Microsoft Outlook Why It communicates with the POP mail server without users having to understand POP command protocols It even has rule sets that filter mail for the user thus sparing them the trouble of having to do it themselves br SNMP agent br In Unix style networking servers httpd is an HTTP daemon that implements the Hypertext Transfer Protocol at the root of the World Wide Web br Management agents used to manage telecom devices br Crowd simulation for safety planning or D computer graphics br Wireless beaconing agent is a simple process hosted single tasking entity for implementing wireless lock or electronic leash in conjunction with more complex software agents hosted e g on wireless receivers br Use of autonomous agents deliberately equipped with noise to optimize coordination in groups online br br br Software development agents aka software bots br br Software bots are becoming important in software engineering br br br Security agents br Agents are also used in software security application to intercept examine and act on various types of content Example include br br Data Loss Prevention DLP Agents examine user operations on a computer or network compare with policies specifying allowed actions and take appropriate action e g allow alert block The more comprehensive DLP agents can also be used to perform EDR functions br Endpoint Detection and Response EDR Agents monitor all activity on an endpoint computer in order to detect and respond to malicious activities br Cloud Access Security Broker CASB Agents similar to DLP Agents however examining traffic going to cloud applications br br br Design issues br Issues to consider in the development of agent based systems include br br how tasks are scheduled and how synchronization of tasks is achieved br how tasks are prioritized by agents br how agents can collaborate or recruit resources br how agents can be re instantiated in different environments and how their internal state can be stored br how the environment will be probed and how a change of environment leads to behavioral changes of the agents br how messaging and communication can be achieved br what hierarchies of agents are useful e g task execution agents scheduling agents resource providers br For software agents to work together efficiently they must share semantics of their data elements This can be done by having computer systems publish their metadata br The definition of agent processing can be approached from two interrelated directions br br internal state processing and ontologies for representing knowledge br interaction protocols standards for specifying communication of tasks br Agent systems are used to model real world systems with concurrency or parallel processing br br Agent Machinery Engines of various kinds which support the varying degrees of intelligence br Agent Content Data employed by the machinery in Reasoning and Learning br Agent Access Methods to enable the machinery to perceive content and perform actions as outcomes of Reasoning br Agent Security Concerns related to distributed computing augmented by a few special concerns related to agents br The agent uses its access methods to go out into local and remote databases to forage for content These access methods may include setting up news stream delivery to the agent or retrieval from bulletin boards or using a spider to walk the Web The content that is retrieved in this way is probably already partially filtered by the selection of the newsfeed or the databases that are searched The agent next may use its detailed searching or language processing machinery to extract keywords or signatures from the body of the content that has been received or retrieved This abstracted content or event is then passed to the agent s Reasoning or inferencing machinery in order to decide what to do with the new content This process combines the event content with the rule based or knowledge content provided by the user If this process finds a good hit or match in the new content the agent may use another piece of its machinery to do a more detailed search on the content Finally the agent may decide to take an action based on the new content for example to notify the user that an important event has occurred This action is verified by a security function and then given the authority of the user The agent makes use of a user access method to deliver that message to the user If the user confirms that the event is important by acting quickly on the notification the agent may also employ its learning machinery to increase its weighting for this kind of event br Bots can act on behalf of their creators to do good as well as bad There are a few ways which bots can be created to demonstrate that they are designed with the best intention and are not built to do harm This is first done by having a bot identify itself in the user agent HTTP header when communicating with a site The source IP address must also be validated to establish itself as legitimate Next the bot must also always respect a site s robots txt file since it has become the standard across most of the web And like respecting the robots txt file bots should shy away from being too aggressive and respect any crawl delay instructions br br br Notions and frameworks for agents br DAML DARPA Agent Markup Language br APL Artificial Autonomous Agents Programming Language br
