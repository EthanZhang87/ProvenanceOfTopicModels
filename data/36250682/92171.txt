A webcam is a video camera which is designed to record or stream to a computer or computer network They are primarily used in video telephony live streaming and social media and security Webcams can be built in computer hardware or peripheral devices and are commonly connected to a device using USB or wireless protocols br Webcams have been used on the Internet as early as and the first widespread commercial one became available in Early webcam usage on the Internet was primarily limited to stationary shots streamed to web sites In the late s and early s instant messaging clients added support for webcams increasing their popularity in video conferencing Computer manufacturers later started integrating webcams into laptop hardware In the COVID pandemic caused a shortage of webcams due to the increased number of people working from home br br First developed in a webcam was pointed at the Trojan Room coffee pot in the Cambridge University Computer Science Department initially operating over a local network instead of the web The camera was finally switched off on August The final image captured by the camera can still be viewed at its homepage The oldest continuously operating webcam San Francisco State University s FogCam has run since and is still operating as of July It updates every seconds br The SGI Indy released in is the first commercial computer to have a standard video camera and the first SGI computer to have standard video inputs br The maximum supported input resolution is for NTSC or for PAL A fast machine is required to capture at either of these resolutions though an Indy with slower R PC CPU for example may require the input resolution to be reduced before storage or processing However the Vino hardware is capable of DMAing video fields directly into the frame buffer with minimal CPU overhead br The first widespread commercial webcam the black and white QuickCam entered the marketplace in created by the U S computer company Connectix QuickCam was available in August for the Apple Macintosh connecting via a serial port at a cost of Jon Garber the designer of the device had wanted to call it the Mac camera but was overruled by Connectix s marketing department a version with a PC compatible parallel port and software for Microsoft Windows was launched in October The original Quick Cam provided x pixel resolution with a grayscale depth of shades at frames per second or shades at frames per second These cam were tested on several Delta II launch using a variety of communication protocols including CDMA TDMA GSM and HF br Videoconferencing via computers already existed and at the time client server based videoconferencing software such as CU SeeMe had started to become popular br The first widely known laptop with integrated webcam option at a pricepoint starting at US was an IBM RS laptop and its related ThinkPad released in br br One of the most widely reported on webcam sites was JenniCam created in which allowed Internet users to observe the life of its namesake constantly in the same vein as the reality TV series Big Brother launched four years later Other cameras are mounted overlooking bridges public squares and other public places their output made available on a public web page in accordance with the original concept of a webcam Aggregator websites have also been created providing thousands of live video streams or up to date still pictures allowing users to find live video streams based on location or other criteria br In the late s Microsoft NetMeeting was the only videoconferencing software on PC in widespread use making use of webcams In the following years instant messaging clients started adding webcam support Yahoo Messenger introduced this with version in allowing video calling in frames per second using a webcam MSN Messenger gained this in version in br br Around the turn of the st century computer hardware manufacturers began building webcams directly into laptop and desktop screens thus eliminating the need to use an external USB or FireWire camera Gradually webcams came to be used more for telecommunications or videotelephony between two people or among several people than for offering a view on a Web page to an unknown public br For less than US in a three dimensional space webcam became available producing videos and photos in D anaglyph image with a resolution up to pixels Both sender and receiver of the images must use D glasses to see the effect of three dimensional image br br Webcams are considered an essential accessory for remote work mainly to compensate for lower quality video processing with the built in camera of the average laptop During the COVID pandemic there was a shortage of webcams Most laptops before and during the pandemic were made with cameras capping out at p recording quality at best compared to the industry standard of p or K seen in smartphones and televisions from the same period The backlog on new developments for built in webcams is the result of a design flaw with laptops being too thin to support the mm camera modules to fit inside instead resorting to mm Also the camera components are more expensive and not a high level of demand for this feature Smartphones started to be used as a backup option or webcam replacement with kits including lighting and tripods or downloadable apps br br Image sensors can be CMOS or CCD the former being dominant for low cost cameras but CCD cameras do not necessarily outperform CMOS based cameras in the low price range Most consumer webcams are capable of providing VGA resolution video at a frame rate of frames per second Many newer devices can produce video in multi megapixel resolutions and a few can run at high frame rates such as the PlayStation Eye which can produce video at frames per second Most image sensors are sourced from Omnivision or Sony br As webcams evolved simultaneously with display technologies USB interface speeds and broadband internet speeds the resolution went up from gradually from to and some now even offer aka p or aka p resolution Despite the low cost the resolution offered as of is impressive with now the low end webcams offering resolutions of p mid range webcams offering p resolution and high end webcams offering K resolution at fps br br Various lenses are available the most common in consumer grade webcams being a plastic lens that can be manually moved in and out to focus the camera Fixed focus lenses which have no provision for adjustment are also available As a camera system s depth of field is greater for small image formats and is greater for lenses with a large f number small aperture the systems used in webcams have a sufficiently large depth of field that the use of a fixed focus lens does not impact image sharpness to a great extent br Most models use simple focal free optics fixed focus factory set for the usual distance from the monitor to which it is fastened to the user or manual focus br Webcams can come with different presets and fields of view Individual users can make use of less than horizontal FOV for home offices and live streaming Webcams with as much as horizontal FOV can be used for small to medium sized rooms sometimes even large rooms Depending on the users purposes webcams in the market can display the whole room or just the general vicinity br br As the bayer filter is proprietary any webcam contains some built in image processing separate from compression Digital video streams are represented by huge amounts of data burdening its transmission from the image sensor where the data is continuously created and storage alike Most if not all cheap webcams come with built in ASIC to do video compression in real time br Support electronics read the image from the sensor and transmit it to the host computer Most webcams come with a controller that translates video over USB from Sonix Suyin Ricoh Realtek or others Typically each frame is transmitted uncompressed in RGB or YUV or compressed as JPEG Some cameras such as mobile phone cameras use a CMOS sensor with supporting electronics on die i e the sensor and the support electronics are built on a single silicon chip to save space and manufacturing costs Most webcams feature built in microphones to make video calling and videoconferencing more convenient br br Typical interfaces used by articles marketed as a webcam are USB Ethernet and IEEE denominated as IP camera Further interfaces such as e g Composite video S Video or FireWire were also available The USB video device class UVC specification allows inter connectivity of webcams to computers without the need for proprietary device drivers br Various proprietary as well as free and open source software is available to handle the UVC stream One could use Guvcview or GStreamer and GStreamer based software to handle the UVC stream Another could use multiple USB cameras attached to the host computer the software resides on and broadcast multiple streams at once over Wireless Ethernet such as MotionEye MotionEye can either be installed onto a Raspberry Pi as MotionEyeOs or afterwards on Raspbian as well MotionEye can also be set up on Debian Raspbian is a variant of Debian MotionEye V Aug can only run on Debian Buster oldstable and Python Newer versions such as X are not supported at this point of time according to Ccrisan foundator and author of MotionEye br Various software tools in wide use can be employed to take video and pictures such as PicMaster and Microsoft s Camera app for use with Windows operating systems Photo Booth Mac or Cheese with Unix systems For a more complete list see Comparison of webcam software br br The most popular use of webcams is the establishment of video links permitting computers to act as videophones or videoconference stations For example Apple s iSight camera which is built into Apple laptops iMacs and a majority of iPhones can be used for video chat sessions using the Messages instant messaging program Other popular uses include security surveillance computer vision video broadcasting and for recording social videos br br Webcams can be added to instant messaging text chat services such as AOL Instant Messenger and VoIP services such as Skype one to one live video communication over the Internet has now reached millions of mainstream PC users worldwide Improved video quality has helped webcams encroach on traditional video conferencing systems New features such as automatic lighting controls real time enhancements retouching wrinkle smoothing and vertical stretch automatic face tracking and autofocus assist users by providing substantial ease of use further increasing the popularity of webcams br Webcams can also encourage remote work enabling people to work remotely via the Internet This usage was crucial to the survival of many businesses during the COVID pandemic when in person office work was discouraged Businesses schools and individuals have relied on video conferencing instead of spending on business travel for meetings Moreover the number of video conferencing cameras and software have multiplied since then due to their popularity br Webcam features and performance can vary by program computer operating system and also by the computer s processor capabilities Video calling support has also been added to several popular instant messaging programs br Webcams allow for inexpensive real time video chat and webcasting in both amateur and professional pursuits They are frequently used in online dating and for online personal services offered mainly by women when camgirling However the ease of webcam use through the Internet for video chat has also caused issues For example moderation system of various video chat websites such as Omegle has been criticized as being ineffective with sexual content still rampant In a case the transmission of nude photos and videos via Omegle from a teenage girl to a schoolteacher resulted in a child pornography charge br The popularity of webcams among teenagers with Internet access has raised concern about the use of webcams for cyber bullying Webcam recordings of teenagers including underage teenagers are frequently posted on popular Web forums and imageboards such as chan br br Webcams can be used as security cameras Software is available to allow PC connected cameras to watch for movement and sound recording both when they are detected These recordings can then be saved to the computer e mailed or uploaded to the Internet In one well publicised case a computer e mailed images of the burglar during the theft of the computer enabling the owner to give police a clear picture of the burglar s face even after the computer had been stolen br In December Russia announced that Webcams would be installed in polling stations to monitor the Russian presidential election Webcams may be installed at places such as childcare centres offices shops and private areas to monitor security and general activity br br With very low light capability a few specific models of webcams are very popular to photograph the night sky by astronomers and astro photographers Mostly these are manual focus cameras and contain an old CCD array instead of comparatively newer CMOS array The lenses of the cameras are removed and then these are attached to telescopes to record images video still or both In newer techniques videos of very faint objects are taken for a couple of seconds and then all the frames of the video are stacked together to obtain a still image of respectable contrast br br A webcam s CCD response is linearly proportional to the incoming light Therefore webcams are suitable to record laser beam profiles after the lens is removed The resolution of a laser beam profiler depends on the pixel size Commercial webcams are usually designed to record color images The size of a webcam s color pixel depends on the model and may lie in the range of to m However a color pixel consists of four black and white pixels each equipped with a color filter for details see Bayer filter Although these color filters work well in the visible they may be rather transparent in the near infrared By switching a webcam into the Bayer mode it is possible to access the information of the single pixels and a resolution below m was possible br br Many users do not wish the continuous exposure for which webcams were originally intended but rather prefer privacy Such privacy is lost when malware allow malicious hackers to activate the webcam without the user s knowledge providing the hackers with a live video and audio feed This is a particular concern on many laptop computers as such cameras normally cannot be physically disabled if hijacked by such a Trojan Horse program or other similar spyware programs br Cameras such as Apple s older external iSight cameras include lens covers to thwart this Some webcams have built in hardwired LED indicators that light up whenever the camera is active sometimes only in video mode However it is possible depending on the circuit design of a webcam for malware to circumvent the indicator and activate the camera surreptitiously as researchers demonstrated in the case of a MacBook s built in camera in br Various companies sell sliding lens covers and stickers that allow users to retrofit a computer or smartphone to close access to the camera lens as needed One such company reported having sold more than such items from to However any opaque material will work just as well br The process of attempting to hack into a person s webcam and activate it without the webcam owner s permission has been called camfecting a portmanteau of cam and infecting The remotely activated webcam can be used to watch anything within the webcam s field of vision Camfecting is most often carried out by infecting the victim s computer with a computer virus br br Action camera br Camera phone br IP camera br List of video telecommunication services and product brands br Trail camera br br M hlbach Lothar B cker A
