Windows is the latest major release of Microsoft s Windows NT operating system released on October It succeeded Windows and is available for free for any Windows devices that meet the new Windows system requirements br Windows features major changes to the Windows shell influenced by the canceled Windows X including a redesigned Start menu the replacement of its live tiles with a separate Widgets panel on the taskbar the ability to create tiled sets of windows that can be minimized and restored from the taskbar as a group and new gaming technologies inherited from Xbox Series X and Series S such as Auto HDR and DirectStorage on compatible hardware Internet Explorer IE has been replaced by the Chromium based Microsoft Edge as the default web browser like its predecessor Windows and Microsoft Teams is integrated into the Windows shell Microsoft also announced plans to allow more flexibility in software that can be distributed via the Microsoft Store and to support Android apps on Windows including a partnership with Amazon to make its app store available for the function br Citing security considerations the system requirements for Windows were increased over Windows Microsoft only officially supports the operating system on devices using an eighth generation Intel Core CPU or newer with some minor exceptions a second generation AMD Ryzen CPU or newer or a Qualcomm Snapdragon ARM system on chip or newer with UEFI and Trusted Platform Module TPM supported and enabled Although there are some exceptions to these requirements see System requirements for details While the OS can be installed on devices with unsupported configurations Microsoft does not guarantee the availability of updates Furthermore Windows completely removes support for bit x and ARM CPUs br Windows has received a mostly positive reception Pre release coverage of the operating system focused on its stricter hardware requirements with discussions over whether they were legitimately intended to improve the security of Windows or as a ploy to upsell customers to newer devices and over the e waste associated with the changes Upon release it was praised for its improved visual design window management and stronger focus on security but was criticized for various modifications to aspects of its user interface that were seen as worse than its predecessor some were seen as an attempt to dissuade users from switching to competing applications br As of July Windows at worldwide is the second most popular Windows version in use with its predecessor Windows still the most used version in virtually all countries with Chile an exception where Windows is most used with it globally at over times the market share Windows has an estimated share of all PCs the rest being other Windows editions and other operating systems such as macOS and Linux and an estimated share of all devices including mobile tablet and console are running Windows br To comply with the Digital Markets Act Microsoft is allowing users in the European Economic Area to remove the Edge browser Bing search engine and advertisements to comply with users interests br br br Development br At the Ignite conference Microsoft employee Jerry Nixon stated that Windows would be the last version of Windows The operating system was considered to be a service with new builds and updates to be released over time PC World argued that the widely reported comment was however taken out of context noting that the official event transcript marks it only as a segue rather than a core part of the talk It argues that Nixon was referring to the fact that he could talk freely at the event because was the last version in current development br In October Microsoft announced Windows X a future edition of Windows designed exclusively for dual touchscreen devices such as the then upcoming Surface Neo It featured a modified user interface designed around context sensitive postures for different screen configurations and usage scenarios and changes such as a centered taskbar and updated Start menu without Windows s live tiles Legacy Windows applications would also be required to run in containers to ensure performance and power optimization Microsoft stated that it planned to release Windows X devices by the end of br In May during the COVID pandemic Panos Panay Microsoft s chief product officer for Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office stated that as we continue to put customers needs at the forefront we need to focus on meeting customers where they are now and announced that Windows X would only launch on single screen devices at first and that Microsoft would continue to look for the right moment in conjunction with our OEM partners to bring dual screen devices to market br In October reports emerged that Microsoft was working on a user interface refresh for Windows codenamed Sun Valley scheduled to be included in a late feature update codenamed Cobalt Internal documentation stated that the aim for Sun Valley was to reinvigorat e the Windows user interface and make it more fluid with a more consistent application of WinUI while reports suggested Microsoft planned to adapt UI elements seen in Windows X In January it was reported that a job listing referring to a sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows had been posted by Microsoft br By December Microsoft had begun to implement and announce some of these visual changes and other new features on Windows Insider Preview builds such as new system icons which also included the replacement of shell resources dating back as far as Windows improvements to Task View to allow changing the wallpaper on each virtual desktop x emulation on ARM and adding the Auto HDR feature from Xbox Series X br On May Head of Windows Servicing and Delivery John Cable stated that Windows X had been canceled and that Microsoft would be accelerating the integration of key foundational X technology into other parts of Windows and products at the company br br br Announcement br At the Microsoft Build developer conference CEO and chairman Satya Nadella teased about the existence of the next generation of Windows during his keynote speech According to Nadella he had been self hosting it for several months He also teased that an official announcement would come very soon Just a week after Nadella s keynote Microsoft started sending invitations for a dedicated Windows media event at a m ET on June Microsoft also posted an minute video of Windows start up sounds to YouTube on June with many people speculating both the time of the Microsoft event and the duration of the Windows start up sound video to be a reference to the name of the operating system as Windows br On June Windows was officially announced at a virtual event hosted by Chief Product Officer Panos Panay According to Nadella Windows is a re imagining of the operating system Further details for developers such as updates to the Microsoft Store the new Windows App SDK code named Project Reunion new Fluent Design guidelines and more were discussed during another developer focused event on the same day br br br Release and marketing br The Windows name was accidentally released in an official Microsoft support document in June Leaked images of a purported beta build of Windows s desktop surfaced online later on June which were followed by a leak of the aforementioned build on the same day The screenshots and leaked build show an interface resembling that of the canceled Windows X alongside a redesigned out of box experience OOBE and Windows branding Microsoft would later confirm the authenticity of the leaked beta with Panay stating that it was an early weird build br At the June media event Microsoft also announced that Windows would be released in Holiday Its release will be accompanied by a free upgrade for compatible Windows devices through Windows Update On June Microsoft announced the release of the first preview build and SDK of Windows to Windows Insiders br On August Microsoft announced that Windows was to be released on October The release would be phased with newer eligible devices to be offered the upgrade first Since its predecessor Windows was released on July more than six years earlier this is the longest time span between successive releases of Microsoft Windows operating systems beating the time between Windows XP released on October and Windows Vista released on January br The first television commercial for Windows premiered during the NFL Kickoff Game on September it was intended to showcase a feeling of immersion and fluidity with imagery of operating system features and Xbox Game Studios Halo Infinite Other promotional campaigns on release day included the Burj Khalifa in Dubai being illuminated with imagery of the Windows logo and default Bloom wallpaper and Mikey Likes It ice cream parlors in New York City distributing free cups of Bloomberry ice cream br Though a support document listed October as the initial release date Microsoft officially released Windows on October as an opt in in place upgrade through either the Windows Installation Assistant application which can perform the upgrade or generate an ISO image or USB install media or via Windows Update in a phased rollout Microsoft anticipated that Windows would be available via Windows Update to all eligible devices by mid New installations of Windows on eligible hardware may present an option to upgrade during the OOBE Retail copies of Windows consisting of a license key and USB flash drive were released on May and digital licenses became available via Microsoft Store on July On September around two years after the release date of Windows Microsoft announced that users would no longer be able to use Windows or Windows keys to activate Windows However as of there are some reports that they still work under certain conditions br br br Features br br Windows the first major Windows release since builds upon its predecessor by revamping the user interface to follow Microsoft s new Fluent Design guidelines The redesign which focuses on ease of use and flexibility comes alongside new productivity and social features and updates to security and accessibility addressing some of the deficiencies of Windows br The Microsoft Store which serves as a unified storefront for apps and other content is also redesigned in Windows Microsoft now allows developers to distribute Win progressive web applications and other packaging technologies in the Microsoft Store alongside Universal Windows Platform apps Microsoft also announced plans to allow third party application stores such as Epic Games Store to distribute their clients on Microsoft Store Windows supports x software emulation on ARM based platforms br The collaboration platform Microsoft Teams is integrated into the Windows user interface and is accessible via the taskbar Skype will no longer be bundled with the OS by default In early the Phone Link app gained limited support for iMessage br Microsoft claims performance improvements such as smaller update sizes faster web browsing in any browser faster wake time from sleep mode and faster Windows Hello authentication br Windows ships with the Chromium based Microsoft Edge web browser for compatibility with Google Chrome web browser and does not include or support Internet Explorer Its rendering engine MSHTML Trident is still included with the operating system for backwards compatibility reasons and Edge can be configured with Group Policy to render whitelisted websites in IE Mode which still uses IE s rendering engine MSHTML instead of Blink layout engine Windows is the first version of Windows since the original retail release of Windows to not ship with Internet Explorer br The updated Xbox app along with the Auto HDR and DirectStorage technologies introduced by the Xbox Series X and Series S will be integrated into Windows the latter requiring a graphics card supporting DirectX and an NVMe solid state drive br br br User interface br A redesigned user interface is present frequently throughout the operating system building upon the Fluent Design System translucency shadows a new color palette and a rounded geometry are prevalent throughout the UI A prevalent aspect of the design is an appearance known as Mica described as an opaque dynamic material that incorporates theme and desktop wallpaper to paint the background of long lived windows such as apps and settings Much of the interface and start menu takes heavy inspiration from the now canceled Windows X The Segoe UI font used since Windows Vista has been updated to a variable version improving its ability to scale between different display resolutions br br The taskbar s buttons are center aligned by default and it is permanently pinned to the bottom edge of the screen it cannot be moved to the top left or right edges of the screen as in previous versions of Windows without manual changes to the registry The notifications sidebar is now accessed by clicking the date and time with other Quick Actions toggles as well as volume brightness and media playback controls moved to a new settings pop up displayed by clicking on the system tray The Widgets button on the taskbar displays a panel with Microsoft Start a news aggregator with personalized stories and content expanding upon the news and interests panel introduced in later builds of Windows Microsoft Teams is similarly integrated with the taskbar with a pop up showing a list of recent conversations br The Start menu has been significantly redesigned replacing the live tiles used by Windows x and with a grid of pinned applications and a list of recent applications and documents File Explorer was updated to replace its ribbon toolbar with a more traditional toolbar while its context menus have been redesigned to move some tasks such as copy and paste to a toolbar along the top of the menu and hide other operations under an overflow menu br br Task View a feature introduced in Windows features a refreshed design and supports giving separate wallpapers to each virtual desktop The window snapping functionality has been enhanced with two additional features hovering over a window s maximize button displays pre determined Snap Layouts for tiling multiple windows onto a display and tiled arrangement of windows can be minimized and restored from the taskbar as a snap group When a display is disconnected in a multi monitor configuration the windows that were previously on that display will be minimized rather than automatically moved to the main display If the same display is reconnected the windows are restored to their prior location br br br Windows Subsystem for Android br br On October Windows Subsystem for Android WSA became available to Beta channel builds of Windows for users in the United States which allows users to install and run Android apps on their devices Users can install Android apps through any source using the APK file format An Amazon Appstore client for Microsoft Store is also available The Windows Subsystem for Android and Amazon Appstore became available to Release channel users in the United States on February in Windows Release build On March Microsoft announced deprecation of WSA with support ending on March br WSA is based on the Intel Bridge runtime compiler Intel stated that the technology is not dependent on its CPUs and will also be supported on x and ARM CPUs from other vendors br br br Setup br Home and Pro since version H edition installation requires internet connection and Microsoft account login only if for personal use on Pro is mandatory unless manually bypassed to create a local user However Microsoft has since blocked one of the last remaining easy bypass methods that allowed local account creation during initial setup complicating the bypass process further All other editions are excluded from this requirement br br br System security br As part of the minimum system requirements Windows only runs on devices with a Trusted Platform Module security coprocessor albeit with some exceptions see System requirements for details According to Microsoft the TPM coprocessor is a critical building block for protection against firmware and hardware attacks In addition Microsoft now requires devices with Windows to include virtualization based security VBS hypervisor protected code integrity HVCI and Secure Boot built in and enabled by default The operating system also features hardware enforced stack protection for supported Intel and AMD processors for protection against zero day exploits br Like its predecessor Windows also supports multi factor authentication and biometric authentication through Windows Hello br br br Artificial intelligence br In subsequent updates Microsoft added several features based on artificial intelligence AI like live captions background noise removal in videoconferencing webcam auto framing that follows the user s movements and AI powered Bing Chat in the taskbar s search field Following the integration of GPT in Microsoft s other products the company announced that by summer a new Windows Copilot would add GPT integration to the Windows taskbar br On May Microsoft officially announced Recall a feature that will use a hardware AI accelerator to locally store snapshots of the user s activity including content transcribed using live captions and allow users to search through them This feature will be exclusive to PCs certified under the Copilot Plus branding Following pushback from the cyber security community Microsoft delayed the feature in June A preview version will be added to the Microsoft Insider program at later date in order to test added security measures br br br Editions br Windows is available in two main editions the Home edition which is intended for consumer users and the Pro edition which contains additional networking and security features such as BitLocker as well as the ability to join a domain Windows Home may be restricted by default to verified software obtained from Microsoft Store S Mode Windows Home requires an Internet connection and a Microsoft account in order to complete first time setup This restriction is also applied to Windows Pro since version H as it was announced in February although a Microsoft account isn t required if it s not for personal use br Windows SE was announced on November as an edition exclusively for low end devices sold in the education market it is intended as a successor to Windows S and also competes primarily with ChromeOS It is designed to be managed via Microsoft Intune and has changed based on feedback from educators to simplify the user interface and reduce distractions such as Snap Layouts not containing layouts for more than two applications at once all applications opening maximized by default and Widgets being removed It is bundled with applications such as Microsoft Office for Microsoft Minecraft Education Edition and Flipgrid while OneDrive is used to save files by default Windows SE does not include Microsoft Store third party software is provisioned or installed by administrators To target organizations migrating from Google Chrome Microsoft Edge is configured by default to enable the installation of extensions from the Chrome Web Store br br br Other editions br br Other editions include Pro Education Pro for Workstations Education Enterprise Enterprise multi session IoT Enterprise Enterprise LTSC IoT Enterprise LTSC Home Single Language and Team along with regional variations These editions remain fundamentally the same as their Windows edition counterparts br Two new editions called IoT Enterprise Subscription and IoT Enterprise Subscription LTSC have been introduced in version H br br br Supported languages br Before the launch of Windows OEMs as well as mobile operators and businesses were offered two options for device imaging Component Based Servicing lp cab files for the languages to be preloaded on the first boot and Local Experience Pack appx files for the languages available for download on supported PCs The fully localized Language Pack LP languages were available as both lp cab and appx packages while the remaining partially localized Language Interface Pack LIP languages were only available as appx packages br With Windows that process has changed Five new LP languages were added Catalan Basque Galician Indonesian and Vietnamese bringing the total number of LP languages to Furthermore these languages can only be imaged using lp cab packages This is to ensure a fully supported language imaging and cumulative update experience br The remaining LIP languages that are LXP based will move to a self service model and can only be added by Windows users themselves via the Microsoft Store and Windows Settings apps not during the Windows imaging process Any user not just admins can now add both the display language and its features which can help users in business environments but these exact options for languages both LP and LIP still depend on the OEM and mobile operator br br br Updates and support br br Like Windows Windows follows Microsoft s Modern Lifecycle Policy Each annual feature update has its own support lifecycle two years for the Home and Pro editions and three years for the Education and Enterprise editions Microsoft has stated that Windows provides no lifecycle guarantee if it has been installed on a machine that does not meet its minimum hardware requirements br Windows receives annual major updates though Microsoft sometimes adds major features in mid cycle releases Starting in in the Enterprise and Education editions major features added in yearly releases will be turned off by default until the next yearly release though these features can be manually enabled as a group policy br br br Preview releases br The Windows Insider program carries over from Windows with pre release builds divided into Dev unstable builds used to test features for future feature updates Beta test builds for the next feature update relatively stable in comparison to Dev channel and Release Preview pre release builds for final testing of upcoming feature updates channels br br br Versions br br br System requirements br br br Official br The basic system requirements of Windows differ significantly from Windows Windows only supports bit systems such as those using an x or ARM processor IA and ARM processors are no longer supported Thus Windows is the first consumer version of Windows not to support bit processors although Windows Server R is the first version of Windows Server to not support them The minimum RAM and storage requirements were also increased Windows now requires at least GB of RAM and GB of storage S mode is only supported for the Home edition of Windows br As of August the officially supported list of processors includes eighth generation Intel Core CPUs Coffee Lake and later AMD Zen CPUs APUs and later which include the AF revisions of Ryzen CPUs which are underclocked Zen CPUs that supplant Ryzen parts that could no longer be manufactured due to a change in process and Qualcomm Snapdragon and later The compatibility list includes the Intel Core i HQ a seventh generation processor used by the Surface Studio although only on devices that shipped with DCH based drivers br Original equipment manufacturers OEM can still ship computers without a TPM coprocessor upon Microsoft s approval br On May Microsoft announced Copilot Plus a brand of Windows PCs that will support enhanced artificial intelligence features Copilot Plus PCs require an on board AI accelerator at least GB of storage and at least GB of RAM Copilot Plus will initially be exclusive to ARM based systems running the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite system on chip x based Copilot Plus PCs will be released in the future br br br Unofficial br Devices with unsupported bit processors are not blocked from installing or running Windows however a clean install or upgrade using ISO installation media must be performed as Windows Update will not offer an upgrade from Windows Additionally users must also accept an on screen disclaimer stating that they will not be entitled to receive updates and that damage caused by using Windows on an unsupported configuration are not covered by the manufacturer s warranty br In addition various unofficial methods to bypass other Windows requirements such as but not limited to TPM exist including an official unofficial method provided directly by Microsoft br In April Windows Insider version H builds began to have a dependency of the SSE and POPCNT CPU instructions increasing the unofficial minimum compatibility to Bulldozer microarchitecture based processors like the AMD FX processors and first generation Intel Core i processors Intel Core like the Core Duo and Core Quad AMD K CPUs such as Phenom II and Athlon II and older are no longer supported Finally version H now requires ARMv dropping unofficial support for ARMv E g the Snapdragon and older are no longer supported br br br Firmware compatibility br Legacy BIOS is no longer officially supported a UEFI system and a Trusted Platform Module TPM security coprocessor is now officially required The TPM requirement in particular has led to confusion as many motherboards do not have TPM support or require a compatible TPM to be physically installed onto the motherboard Many newer CPUs also include a TPM implemented at the CPU level with AMD referring to this as fTPM and Intel referring to it as Platform Trust Technology PTT which might be disabled by default and require changing settings in the computer s UEFI firmware or a UEFI firmware update that changes the default settings to reflect these requirements br Starting with version H IoT Enterprise editions have officially reintroduced legacy BIOS support and eliminated the requirement for a TPM br br br Third party software br Some third party software may refuse to run on configurations of Windows that do not comply with the hardware security requirement After the release of Windows Riot Games kernel level anti cheat system Vanguard used in Valorant and since May by League of Legends began to enforce the operating system security requirements and will not allow the games to be run on the OS if secure boot and a TPM compliant coprocessor are not enabled br br br IoT Enterprise editions br br While IoT Enterprise editions have always had slightly reduced official requirements compared to other Windows editions notably starting with version H minimum requirements were further reduced and now differ significantly These updated H requirements were announced on May for both LTSC and non LTSC editions br br For the first time since Windows release Microsoft has officially eliminated a TPM and UEFI minimum requirement for all systems running these editions and dropped the minimum DirectX version down to version was previously required on H Finally the IoT Enterprise LTSC edition further drops the minimum required RAM to GB and storage space to GB br br br Reception br br br Pre release br Reception of Windows upon its reveal was positive with critics praising the new design and productivity features However Microsoft was criticized for creating confusion over the minimum system requirements for Windows The increased system requirements compared to those of Windows initially published by Microsoft meant that up to percent of existing Windows PCs were unable to upgrade to Windows which has faced concerns that this will contribute to electronic waste br Microsoft has not specifically acknowledged this when discussing the cutoff it was also acknowledged that the sixth and seventh generation of Intel Core processors were prominently afflicted by CPU level security vulnerabilities such as Meltdown and Spectre and that newer CPUs manufactured since then had increased mitigations against the flaws br Speaking to IT news outlet CRN a dozen independent solution providers all felt that they believe Windows will be a meaningful step up in security and they agree with Microsoft s strategy of putting security first br Research Vice President of Gartner Stephen Kleynhans felt that Microsoft was looking at the entire stack from the hardware up through the applications and the user experience and trying to make the entire stack work better and more securely br br br Launch br Andrew Cunningham of Ars Technica praised the improvements to its visual design describing the new Mica appearance as reminiscent of the visual appearance of iOS and macOS and arguing that Microsoft had made a serious effort at making the user facing aspects of Windows more consistent visually He also praised window management performance assessed as being equivalent to if not better than Windows other beneficial tweaks and its system requirements having brought greater public attention to hardware security features present on modern PCs Criticism was raised towards Widgets lack of support for third party content thus limiting it to Microsoft services only regressions in taskbar functionality and customization Also noting the inability to easily select default applications for common tasks such as web browsing as it requires the user to select the browser application for each file type individually and Microsoft s unclear justification for its processor compatibility criteria Cunningham concluded that as I ve dug into Windows and learned its ins and outs for this review I ve warmed to it more but argued that the OS was facing similar public perception issues to Windows Vista and Windows However he noted that did not have as many performance issues or bugs as Vista had upon its release nor was as disjointed as and recommended that users who were unsure about the upgrade should stay on Windows in anticipation of future updates to br Tom Warren of The Verge described Windows as being akin to a house in the middle of renovations but that actually using Windows for the past few months hasn t felt as controversial as I had expected praising its updated user interface as being more modern and reminiscent of iOS and ChromeOS the new start menu for feeling less cluttered than the Windows iteration updates to some of its stock applications and Snap Assist Warren noted that he rarely used the Widgets panel or Microsoft Teams citing that he preferred the weather display that later versions of Windows offered and did not use Teams to communicate with his friends and family He also acknowledged the expansion of the Microsoft Store to include more traditional desktop applications However he felt that Windows still felt like a work in progress noting UI inconsistencies such as dark mode and new context menu designs not being uniform across all dialogues and applications and the UWP Settings app still falling back upon legacy Control Panel applets for certain settings regressions to the taskbar including the inability to move it drag files onto taskbar buttons to focus the corresponding application and the clock only shown on the primary display in multi monitor configurations and promised features such as dynamic refresh rate support and a universal microphone mute button not being present on the initial release Overall he concluded that I wouldn t rush out to upgrade to Windows but I also wouldn t avoid it After all Windows still feels familiar and underneath all the UI changes it s the same Windows we ve had for decades br Mark Hatchman of PC World was more critical of Windows arguing that it sacrifices productivity for personality but without cohesion commenting upon changes such as the inability to use local offline accounts on Windows Home regressions to the taskbar a functionally worse start menu Microsoft Teams integration having privacy implications and being a ploy to coerce users into switching to the service File Explorer obscuring common functions under unclear icons forcing users to scroll through many options to discourage changing the default web browser from Microsoft Edge and that the OS anecdotally feels less responsive slower and heavier than Windows He concluded that Windows feels practical and productive but less so than its predecessor in many aspects while its best features were either hidden deeper within required specific hardware DirectStorage Auto HDR or were not available on launch Android app support br br br See also br List of operating systems br Microsoft Windows br br br br br br
