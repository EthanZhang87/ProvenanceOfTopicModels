Space Invaders is a shoot em up arcade video game developed and released by Taito in Japan and licensed to Midway Manufacturing for overseas distribution Commonly considered to be one of the most influential video games of all time Space Invaders was the first fixed shooter and the first video game with endless gameplay meaning there was no final level or endscreen and set the template for the genre The goal is to defeat wave after wave of descending aliens with a horizontally moving laser cannon to earn as many points as possible br Designer Tomohiro Nishikado drew inspiration from North American target shooting games like Breakout and Gun Fight as well as science fiction narratives such as the novel The War of the Worlds the anime Space Battleship Yamato and the film Star Wars To complete development he had to design custom hardware and development tools Upon release Space Invaders was an immediate commercial success by it had grossed billion billion in adjusted terms with a net profit of million billion in terms This made it the best selling video game and highest grossing entertainment product at the time and the highest grossing video game of all time br Space Invaders is considered one of the most influential video games ever made having ushered in the golden age of arcade video games It was the inspiration for numerous video games and game designers across different genres and has been ported and re released in various forms The Atari VCS version quadrupled sales of the Atari VCS thereby becoming the first killer app for video game consoles More broadly the pixelated enemy alien has become a pop culture icon often representing video games as a whole br br br Gameplay br br Space Invaders is a fixed shooter in which the player moves a laser cannon horizontally across the bottom of the screen and fires at aliens overhead The aliens begin as five rows of eleven that move left and right as a group shifting downward advancing on the shooter each time they reach a screen edge The goal is to eliminate all of the aliens by shooting them While the player has three lives the game ends immediately if the invaders reach the bottom of the screen The aliens attempt to destroy the player s cannon by firing projectiles The laser cannon is partially protected by stationary defense bunkers which are gradually destroyed from the top by the aliens and if the player fires when beneath one the bottom gets destroyed br As aliens are defeated their movement and the music both speed up Defeating all the aliens brings another wave which starts lower a loop which can continue endlessly A special mystery ship will occasionally move across the top of the screen and award bonus points if destroyed br br br Development br Space Invaders was developed by Japanese designer Tomohiro Nishikado who spent a year designing it and developing the necessary hardware to produce it The game was a response to Atari s arcade game Breakout Nishikado wanted to adapt the same sense of achievement and tension from destroying targets one at a time combining it with elements of target shooting games The game uses a similar layout to that of Breakout but with different game mechanics rather than bounce a ball to attack static objects players are given the ability to fire projectiles at moving enemies br Nishikado added several interactive elements that he found lacking in earlier video games such as the ability for enemies to react to the player s movement and fire back and a game over triggered by the enemies killing the player either by getting hit or enemies reaching the bottom of the screen rather than simply a timer running out He replaced the timer typical of arcade games at the time with descending aliens who effectively served a similar function where the closer they came the less time the player had left br Early enemy designs included tanks combat planes and battleships Nishikado however was not satisfied with the enemy movements technical limitations made it difficult to simulate flying Humans would have been easier to simulate but the designer considered shooting them immoral After seeing the release of the anime Space Battleship Yamato in Japan and seeing a magazine feature about Star Wars he thought of using a space theme Nishikado drew inspiration for the aliens from a novel by H G Wells The War of the Worlds and created initial bitmap images after the octopus like aliens Other alien designs were modeled after squids and crabs The game was originally titled Space Monsters after a popular song in Japan at the time Monster but was changed to Space Invaders by the designer s superiors br br br Hardware br br Nishikado designed his own custom hardware and development tools for Space Invaders It uses an Intel central processing unit CPU displays raster graphics on a CRT monitor using a bitmapped framebuffer and uses monaural sound hosted by a combination of analog circuitry and a Texas Instruments SN sound chip The adoption of a microprocessor was inspired by Gun Fight Midway s microprocessor adaptation of Nishikado s earlier discrete logic game Western Gun after the designer was impressed by the improved graphics and smoother animation of Midway s version Space Invaders also adopted the multi chip barrel shifter circuit first developed by Midway for Gun Fight which had been a key part of that game s smoother animation This circuit allowed the CPU to shift pictures in the graphics framebuffer faster than it could using only its own native instructions br Despite the specially developed hardware Nishikado was unable to program the game as he wanted the Control Program board was not powerful enough to display the graphics in color or move the enemies faster and considered the development of the hardware the most difficult part of the process While programming Nishikado discovered that the processor was able to render each frame of the alien s animation graphics faster when there were fewer aliens on the screen Since the alien s positions updated after each frame this caused the aliens to move across the screen at an increasing speed as more and more were destroyed Rather than design a compensation for the speed increase he decided that it was a feature not a bug and kept it as a challenging gameplay mechanism br Taito released Space Invaders in July They released both an upright arcade cabinet and a so called cocktail table cabinet following its usual practice Taito named the cocktail version T T Space Invaders T T for table top Midway released its upright version a few months later and its cocktail version several months after that The cabinet artwork featured large humanoid monsters not present in the game Nishikado attributes this to the artist basing the designs on the original title of Space Monsters rather than referring to the actual in game graphics In the upright cabinets the graphics are generated on a hidden CRT monitor and reflected toward the player using a semi transparent mirror behind which is mounted a plastic cutout of a moon bolted against a painted starry background The backdrop is visible through the mirror and thus appears behind the graphics Both Taito s and Midway s first Space Invaders versions had black and white graphics with a transparent colored overlay using strips of orange and green cellophane over certain portions of the screen to add color to the image Later Japanese releases used a rainbow colored cellophane overlay and these were eventually followed by versions with a color monitor and an electronically generated color overlay br br br Music br br Despite its simplicity the music to Space Invaders was revolutionary for the gaming industry of the time Video game scholar Andrew Schartmann identifies three aspects of the music that had a significant impact on the development of game music br br Whereas video game music prior to Space Invaders was restricted to the extremities i e a short introductory theme with game over counterpart the alien inspired hit featured continuous music the well known four note loop consisting of the first four notes of the descending D minor natural scale throughout uninterrupted by sound effects It was thus the first time that sound effects and music were superimposed to form a rich sonic landscape Not only do players receive feedback related directly to their actions through sound effects they also receive stimulus in a more subtle non interactive fashion through music br The music interacts with on screen animation to influence the emotions of the player That seemingly pedestrian four note loop might stir us in the most primitive of ways but that it stirs us at all is worthy of note By demonstrating that game sound could be more than a simple tune to fill the silence Space Invaders moved video game music closer to the realm of art br The music for Space Invaders popularized the notion of variability the idea that music can change in accordance with the ongoing on screen narrative The variable in Space Invaders the tempo is admittedly simple but its implications are not to be underestimated Over the years analogous strategies of variation would be applied to pitch rhythm dynamics form and a host of other parameters all with the goal of accommodating the nonlinear aspect of video games br At the deepest of conceptual levels one would be hard pressed to find an arcade game as influential to the early history of video game music as Space Invaders Its role as a harbinger of the fundamental techniques that would come to shape the industry remains more or less unchallenged And its blockbuster success ensured the adoption of those innovations by the industry at large br Next Generation editor Neil West also cited the Space Invaders music as an example of great video game art commenting on how the simple melody s increasing tempo and synchronization with the enemies movement chills and excites the player br br br Reception and versions br br br Arcade version br Space Invaders initially received mixed responses from within Taito and amusement arcade owners Nishikado s colleagues praised it applauding his achievement while queuing up to play whereas his bosses predicted low sales as games often ended more quickly than other timer based arcade games at the time A number of amusement arcade owners initially rejected it but some pachinko parlors and bowling alleys adopted it it quickly caught on with many parlors and alleys clearing space for more Space Invaders cabinets In the first few months following its release in Japan Space Invaders became popular and specialty video arcades opened with nothing but Space Invaders cabinets br By the end of Taito had installed over machines and grossed million billion adjusted for inflation in Japan alone By June Taito had manufactured about Space Invaders machines in Japan with each unit earning an average of or equivalent to in in yen coins per day However this was not enough to meet the high demand leading to Taito increasing production to units per month and raising projections to manufactured in Japan by the end of In order to cope with the demand Taito licensed the overseas rights to Midway for distribution outside of Japan By the end of an estimated Space Invaders machines were installed worldwide including in Japan in the United Kingdom and within a year in the United States where prices ranged from to for each machine the game eventually sold units in the United States by By it had become the arcade game

Taito later released it for the Nintendo Famicom in but only in Japan By versions of Space Invaders were available for handheld electronic game devices tabletop dedicated consoles home computers watches and pocket calculators The Atari VCS conversion was programmed by Richard Maurer while the Atari conversion was programmed by Eric Manghise and animated by Marilyn Churchill br More than a hundred Space Invaders video game clones were released for various platforms such as the popular computer games Super Invader and TI Invaders the latter was the top selling game for the TI A through at least br br br Legacy br As one of the earliest shooting games Space Invaders set precedents and helped pave the way for future games and for the shooting genre Space Invaders popularized a more interactive style of gameplay with the enemies responding to the player controlled cannon s movement and was the first video game to popularize the concept of achieving a high score being the first to save the player s score While earlier shooting games allowed the player to shoot at targets Space Invaders was the first in which multiple enemies could fire back at the player and in contrast to earlier arcade games which often had a timer Space Invaders introduced the concept of going round after round It was also the first game where players were given multiple lives had to repel hordes of enemies could take cover from enemy fire and use destructible barriers in addition to being the first game to use a continuous background soundtrack with four simple diatonic descending bass notes repeating in a loop which was dynamic and changed pace during stages like a heartbeat sound that increases pace as enemies approached br An urban legend states that Space Invaders popularity led to a shortage of yen coins in Japan However Nishikado himself was skeptical of the story In reality yen coin production was lower in and than in previous or subsequent years Additionally arcade operators would have regularly emptied their machines and taken the coins to the bank thus keeping them in circulation Reports from those living in Japan at the time indicate nothing out of the ordinary during the height of the Space Invaders invasion br Space Invaders was inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame in Space Invaders cabinets have become collector s items with the cocktail and cabaret versions being the rarest br br br Impact br Game developers including Shigeru Miyamoto creator of the franchises Donkey Kong Mario and The Legend of Zelda Hideo Kojima Metal Gear Satoshi Tajiri Pok mon and John Romero and John Carmack both Doom have cited Space Invaders as their introduction to video games Miyamoto said Space Invaders had revolutionized the video game industry According to Alexander Smith by allowing targets to attack the player and eliminating the timer Nishikado created a new paradigm in video games It also inspired Eugene Jarvis Defender Robotron to become a video game designer stating it laid the groundwork for a whole generation of video games with the animated characters the story this amazing crescendo of action and climax and that many games still rely on the multiple life progressively difficult level paradigm of Space Invaders Deus Ex creator Warren Spector said Space Invaders and games like it represent the roots of everything we see today in gaming It represents the birth of a new art form one that literally changed the world Space Invaders is important as an historical artefact no less than the silent films of the early twentieth century or early printed books br Edge attributed the shift of games from bars and amusement arcades to more mainstream locations such as restaurants and department stores to Space Invaders Its popularity was such that it was the first game where an arcade machine s owner could earn back the cost of the machine in under one month or in some places within one week br Space Invaders helped action games become the dominant genre in arcades and on consoles Guinness World Records considered Space Invaders one of the most successful arcade shooting games by In describing it as a seminal arcade classic IGN listed it as the number eight classic shoot em up Space Invaders set the template for the shoot em up genre Its worldwide success created a demand for a wide variety of science fiction games inspiring the development of arcade games such as Atari s Asteroids Williams Electronics Defender and Namco s Galaxian and Galaga which were modeled after Space Invaders gameplay and design This influence could be said to extend to most shooting games released to the present day including first person shooters FPS such as Wolfenstein Doom Halo and Call of Duty Space Invaders also influenced other genres including maze games such as Sega Gremlin s Head On which adopted the concept of going round after round instead of a timer and early computer dungeon crawl games such as Dungeons of Daggorath which used similar heartbeat sounds to indicate player health br The technology journalist Jason Whittaker credited Space Invaders with ending the video game crash of caused by Pong clones flooding the market and beginning the golden age of video arcade games s According to The Observer home console versions of Space Invaders were popular and encouraged users to learn to program many became industry leaders UP com stated that Space Invaders showed that video games could compete against the major entertainment media at the time films music and television IGN attributed the launch of the arcade phenomenon in North America in part to Space Invaders Electronic Games said it was the impetus behind video gaming becoming a rapidly growing hobby and as the single most popular coin
