Miranda NG is an open source multiprotocol instant messaging application designed for Microsoft Windows Miranda NG is free software distributed under the GNU GPL or later br br br History br In May Miranda IM was forked to Miranda NG New Generation The reasons were a shift in the development team and the slow paced development of the original Miranda IM The main differences between the original client and the fork are a switch to Visual Studio s compiler dropping support for Windows ME and non Unicode plugins and the fact that the core and plugins development was combined and that they share a unified repository br As of August the latest version of Miranda NG is released on June br br br Architecture br Miranda IM provides a basic client framework GUI and an advanced plugin architecture

original developers left and Richard cyreve Hughes took over the project His first release version on April was improved through a major rewrite The split message dialog bundled with this release became the first messaging module to be put into a plugin The Net Messenger Service protocol plugin appeared around the time of version release becoming the second messaging protocol to be supported by Miranda This was also the first official release to support language pack translations Miranda hence had multi protocol multi language instant messenger features br After v Miranda plugin development grew rapidly With version February there were approximately plugins available At the time the new Lizard plugin enabled skinning support the only time Miranda supported skins Lizard development stopped soon after due to the instability it caused br br br Version x br After the mysterious disappearance of cyreve in June the developers Martin berg Strickz Robert Rainwater rainwater Sam K egoDust and Lyon Lim lynlimz took over the project The MSN protocol was taken over by Rako Shizuka who also developed the first version of Yahoo Messenger protocol which was the third protocol supported by Miranda The Yahoo plugin was closed source and lost reliability as the official Yahoo Messenger protocol changed over time it was later re written by new developer Gennady Feldman br The first of the non IM plugins including RSS News and Weather were released within this period These added a contact to contact list for the purpose of displaying information to the user rather than chatting br Discussion about renaming of the program and removal of ICQ from the core began about this time Due to the increase of protocol support the project was officially renamed to Miranda IM on December br The first release under the new name occurred on February about three years after the beginning of the project and a bug fix version came two weeks later br br br Version x br The major change in version released on June was the removal of ICQ from the core into a plugin From now on Miranda could run without the ICQ application being installed The project moved to a new site at www miranda im org featuring a new discussion board and file listing br Protocol plugins bundled in version included ICQ MSN AIM and XMPP The Yahoo protocol was not included in the package IRC support was added later by J rgen Persson m rix to the official release of version on August br Another major change was the removal of the Send Receive Messaging Module from the core into a plugin SRMM This reduced the size of the executable file and encouraged rapid development of messaging modules During this period many variations including SRAMM SRMM mod etc offered different new features and improvements over the standard implementation br ZDNet be reviewed release complimenting its effortless contact importing low memory usage and extensive variety of plugins and stating Miranda is a strong recommendation for people who have a system tray populated by several IM applications br br br Version x br br Version of Miranda IM was released on April This was the first version to have Yahoo protocol bundled with the official release Other major changes included the removal of contact list and database module from the core into plugins As a result there were variations of contact

engine and a release notifier One large change is a new way to uniquely identify plugins and the interfaces they implement which may break backward compatibility in the future br A CNET review gave the program out of stars noting that though the interface is plain the program supports most IM protocols in one package Features favored in the review included its centralized personal information management numerous window behavior controls and configurable hotkeys br Techzine nl reviewed this version listing its positive attributes as support for many protocols small and fast a lot of plug ins and skins many settings and writing it will not look bad on your computer Especially if you are looking for a simple client on a USB stick then Miranda IM is a good choice On the other hand if you are using WLM Windows Live Messenger and you find the settings of the program hard we can not recommend Miranda IM The typical things like WLM s smilies sounds winks and games are not standard You do get that functionality by the wide choice of skins and plug ins but for that you do some research and setting work br Authors Lui and Chan in Software Development Rhythms describe using Miranda IM s plugin architecture to copy modify and test existing plugins in order to develop NAMMIK a scriptable ICQ chatting bot used to interview people they refer to Miranda IM s architecture as simple and flexible br br br Version x br Version of Miranda IM was released on June It included a new Account Manager which supports multiple accounts per protocol doing away with DLL renaming built in SSL support various enhancements and bugfixes for the core and plugins br A PCWorld Magazine review of version noted its addon capability but stated Miranda s user interface leaves something to be desired while referring to its login status icons wishing for easier management and grouping of contacts easy blocking reporting of spammers and ultimately recommending it for those who use only surface capabilities of instant messengers br br br Version x br Version of Miranda IM was released on August It consists of many new features focused on improving Unicode support and overall protocol improvements It is also the first Miranda IM version to feature an official bit build br br br Version x br Version of Miranda IM was released on July It consists of enhancements to Miranda IM x
