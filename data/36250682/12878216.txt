title: Criticism of Facebook
id: 12878216
Facebook and parent company Meta Platforms has been the subject of criticism and legal action since it was founded in Criticisms include the outsize influence Facebook has on the lives and health of its users and employees as well as Facebook s influence on the way media specifically news is reported and distributed Notable issues include Internet privacy such as use of a widespread like button on third party websites tracking users possible indefinite records of user information automatic facial recognition software and its role in the workplace including employer employee account disclosure The use of Facebook can have negative psychological and physiological effects that include feelings of sexual jealousy stress lack of attention and social media addiction that in some cases is comparable to drug addiction br Facebook s operations have also received coverage The company s electricity usage tax avoidance real name user requirement policies censorship policies handling of user data and its involvement in the United States PRISM surveillance program and Facebook Cambridge Analytica data scandal have been highlighted by the media and by critics Facebook has come under scrutiny for ignoring or shirking its responsibility for the content posted on its platform including copyright and intellectual property infringement hate speech incitement of rape violence against minorities terrorism fake news Facebook murder crimes and violent incidents live streamed through its Facebook Live functionality br The company and its employees have also been subject to litigation cases over the years with its most prominent case concerning allegations that CEO Mark Zuckerberg broke an oral contract with Cameron Winklevoss Tyler Winklevoss and Divya Narendra to build the then named HarvardConnection social network in instead allegedly opting to steal the idea and code to launch Facebook months before HarvardConnection began The original lawsuit was eventually settled in with Facebook paying approximately million in cash and million shares A new lawsuit in was dismissed This alongside another controversy involving Zuckerberg and fellow co founder and former CFO Eduardo Saverin br was further explored in the American biographical drama film The Social Network Some critics point to problems which they say will result in the demise of Facebook Facebook has been banned by several governments for various reasons including Syria China Iran and Russia br br br Censorship br While Facebook operates transparent policies around certain types of content moderation such as the removing of hateful speech and images which contain sex or violence the company has been criticized for selectively censoring information in nontransparent ways Some examples of this include br br br Censorship of criticism of Facebook br Newspapers regularly report stories of users who claim they ve been censored on Facebook for being critical of Facebook itself with their posts removed or made less visible Examples include Elizabeth Warren in and Rotem Shtarkman in br In the context of media reports and lawsuits from people formerly working on Facebook content moderation a former Facebook moderator Chris Gray has claimed that specific rules existed to monitor and sometimes target posts about Facebook which are anti Facebook or criticize Facebook for some action for instance by matching the keywords Facebook or DeleteFacebook br Facebook s search function has been accused of preventing users from searching for certain terms Michael Arrington of TechCrunch has written about Facebook s possible censorship of Ron Paul as a search term MoveOn org s Facebook group for organizing protests against privacy violations could for a time not be found by searching The very word privacy was also restricted br br br Censorship around global politics br In it was reported that Facebook has a policy to censor anything related to Kurdish opposition against Turkey such as maps of Kurdistan flags of Kurdish armed terrorist groups such as PKK and YPG and criticism of Mustafa Kemal Atat rk the founder of Turkey br In Facebook banned and also removed content regarding the Kashmir dispute br During a podcast Mark Zuckerberg admitted that Facebook suppressed all the coverage of Joe Biden s son s email leaks during the United States elections due to a general request from the FBI The censored news claimed that the son of Joe Biden who was vice president in Obama s administration used his father s influence to fix a deal with a Ukrainian businessman br br br Censorship in line with US foreign policy br In Facebook was accused of censoring messages critical of Israel and supportive of Palestine During conflict over the Sheikh Jarrah property dispute in Facebook was accused of deleting hundreds of posts critical of Israel Senior Facebook officials apologized to the Palestinian Prime Minister for censoring pro Palestinian voices br In October a secret blacklist of dangerous individuals and organizations maintained by Facebook was discovered by The Intercept which revealed censorship in the MENA region was stricter than in USA Critics and scholars have argued the blacklist and the guideline stifles free discussion as well as enforcing an uneven enforcement of the rules br br br Privacy issues br br Facebook has faced a number of privacy concerns for instance in August it was revealed that the company had enlisted contractors to generate transcripts of users audio chats The contractors were tasked with re transcribing the conversations in order to gauge the accuracy of the automatic transcription tool In part these concerns stem from the company s revenue model that involves selling information about its users and the loss of privacy this could entail In addition employers and other organizations and individuals have been known to use Facebook data for their own purposes As a result peoples identities have sometimes been revealed without their permission In response pressure groups and governments have increasingly asserted the users right to privacy and to control their personal data br br br Psychological sociological effects br br In addition to noting with evolutionary biologist George C Williams in the development of evolutionary medicine that most chronic medical conditions are the consequence of evolutionary mismatches between a stateless environment of nomadic hunter gatherer life in bands and contemporary human life in sedentary technologically modern state societies e g WEIRD societies psychiatrist Randolph M Nesse has argued that evolutionary mismatch is an important factor in the development of certain mental disorders In percent of U S households owned at least one automobile In a majority of U S households had at least one personal computer and internet access the following year In a majority of U S survey respondents reported having a mobile phone In September a majority of U S survey respondents reported having broadband internet at home In January a majority of U S survey respondents reported owning a smartphone br br br Facebook addiction br br The World Unplugged study which was conducted in claims that for some users quitting social networking sites is comparable to quitting smoking or giving up alcohol Another study conducted in by researchers from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business in the United States found that drugs like alcohol and tobacco could not keep up with social networking sites regarding their level of addictiveness A study in the journal CyberPsychology Behavior and Social Networking found that some users decided to quit social networking sites because they felt they were addicted In the site went down for about minutes prompting several users to call emergency services br In April the Pew Research Center published a survey of U S teenagers ages to who reported that nearly three quarters of them either owned or had access to a smartphone percent went online daily with percent saying they went online almost constantly In March Frontiers in Psychology published a survey of post secondary student Facebook users following a face validity pilot of another post secondary student Facebook users at a large university in North America showing that the severity of ADHD symptoms had a statistically significant positive correlation with Facebook usage while driving a motor vehicle and that impulses to use Facebook while driving were more potent among male users than female users br In June Children and Youth Services Review published a regression analysis of adolescent Facebook users in the Piedmont and Lombardy regions of Northern Italy that replicated previous findings among adult users showing that adolescents reporting higher ADHD symptoms positively predicted Facebook addiction persistent negative attitudes about the past and that the future is predetermined and not influenced by present actions and orientation against achieving future goals with ADHD symptoms additionally increasing the manifestation of the proposed category of psychological dependence known as problematic social media use br In October court documents in the US alleged Meta of designing its platforms deliberately to develop addiction in children using them The company knowingly allowed underage users to hold accounts violating the Children s Online Privacy Protection Act According to whistleblower Frances Haugen the company intentionally targets children below the age of br br br Self harm and suicide br br Research shows that people who are feeling suicidal use the internet to search for suicide methods Websites provide graphic details and information on how to take your own life This cannot be right Where this content breaches the policies of internet and social media providers it must be removed br I do not think it is going too far to question whether even you the owners any longer have any control over the sites content If that is the case then children should not be accessing your services at all and parents should be aware that the idea of any authority overseeing algorithms and content is a mirage br In January both the Health Secretary of the United Kingdom and the Children s Commissioner for England urged Facebook and other social media companies to take responsibility for the risk to children posed by content on their platforms related to self harm and suicide br br br Envy br br Facebook has been criticized for making people envious and unhappy due to the constant exposure to positive yet unrepresentative highlights of their peers Such highlights include but are not limited to journal posts videos and photos that depict or reference such positive or otherwise outstanding activities experiences and facts This effect is caused mainly by the fact that most users of Facebook usually only display the positive aspects of their lives while excluding the negative though it is also strongly connected to inequality and the disparities between social groups as Facebook is open to users from all classes of society Sites such as AddictionInfo org state that this kind of envy has profound effects on other aspects of life and can lead to severe depression self loathing rage and hatred resentment feelings of inferiority and insecurity pessimism suicidal tendencies and desires social isolation and other issues that can prove very serious This condition has often been called Facebook Envy or Facebook Depression by the media br In Social Science Computer Review published research by economists Ralf Caers and Vanessa Castelyns who sent an online questionnaire to and LinkedIn and Facebook users respectively in Belgium and found that both sites had become tools for recruiting job applicants for professional occupations as well as additional information about applicants and that it was being used by recruiters to decide which applicants would receive interviews In sociologist Ofer Sharone conducted interviews with unemployed workers to research the effects of LinkedIn and Facebook as labor market intermediaries and found that social networking services SNS have had a filtration effect that has little to do with evaluations of merit and that the SNS filtration effect has exerted new pressures on workers to manage their careers to conform to the logic of the SNS filtration effect br A joint study conducted by two German universities demonstrated Facebook envy and found that as many as one out of three people actually feel worse and less satisfied with their lives after visiting the site Vacation photos were found to be the most common source of feelings of resentment and jealousy After that social interaction was the second biggest cause of envy as Facebook users compare the number of birthday greetings likes and comments to those of their friends Visitors who contributed the least tended to feel the worst According to our findings passive following triggers invidious emotions with users mainly envying happiness of others the way others spend their vacations and socialize the study states br A study by researchers at the University of Michigan found that the more people used Facebook the worse they felt afterwards br Narcissistic users who show excessive grandiosity give negative emotion to viewers and cause envy but as a result that may cause viewers loneliness Viewers sometimes need to terminate relationships with them to avoid this negative emotion However this avoidance such as terminate relationships would be reinforcement and it may lead to loneliness The cyclical pattern is a vicious circle of loneliness and avoidance coping the study states br br br Divorce br br Social networks like Facebook can have a detrimental effect on marriages with users becoming worried about their spouse s contacts and relations with other people online leading to marital breakdown and divorce According to a survey in the UK around percent of divorce petitions included references to Facebook Facebook has given us a new platform for interpersonal communication Researchers proposed that high levels of Facebook use could result in Facebook related conflict and breakup divorce Previous studies have shown that romantic relationships can be damaged by excessive Internet use Facebook jealousy partner surveillance ambiguous information and online portrayal of intimate relationships Excessive Internet users reported having greater conflict in their relationships Their partners feel neglected and there s lower commitment and lower feelings of passion and intimacy in the relationship According to the article researchers suspect that Facebook may contribute to an increase in divorce and infidelity rates in the near future due to the amount and ease of accessibility to connect with past partners The use of Facebook can cause feelings of sexual jealousy br br br Stress br Research performed by psychologists from Edinburgh Napier University indicated that Facebook adds stress to users lives Causes of stress included fear of missing important social information fear of offending contacts discomfort or guilt from rejecting user requests or deleting unwanted contacts or being unfriended or blocked by Facebook friends or other users the displeasure of having friend requests rejected or ignored the pressure to be entertaining criticism or intimidation from other Facebook users and having to use appropriate etiquette for different types of friends Many people who started using Facebook for positive purposes or with positive expectations have found that the website has negatively impacted their lives br Next to that the increasing number of messages and social relationships embedded in SNS also increases the amount of social information demanding a reaction from SNS users Consequently SNS users perceive they are giving too much social support to other SNS friends This dark side of SNS usage is called social overload It is caused by the extent of usage number of friends subjective social support norms and type of relationship online only vs offline friends while age has only an indirect effect The psychological and behavioral consequences of social overload include perceptions of SNS exhaustion low user satisfaction and high intentions to reduce or stop using SNS br br br Narcissism br br In July a meta analysis published in Psychology of Popular Media found that grandiose narcissism positively correlated with time spent on social media frequency of status updates number of friends or followers and frequency of posting self portrait digital photographs while a meta analysis published in the Journal of Personality in April found that the positive correlation between grandiose narcissism and social networking service usage was replicated across platforms including Facebook In March the Journal of Adult Development published a regression discontinuity analysis of Millennial Facebook users investigating differences in narcissism and Facebook usage between the age cohorts born from to and from to and found that the later born Millennials scored significantly higher on both In June Addictive Behaviors published a systematic review finding a consistent positive and significant correlation between grandiose narcissism and the proposed category of psychological dependence called problematic social media use Also in social psychologist Jonathan Haidt and FIRE President Greg Lukianoff noted in The Coddling of the American Mind that former Facebook president Sean Parker stated in a interview that the Like button was consciously designed to prime users receiving likes to feel a dopamine rush as part of a social validation feedback loop br Conspicuous compassion is the practice of publicly donating large sums of money to charity to enhance the social prestige of the donor and is sometimes described as a type of conspicuous consumption Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff argued that microaggression training on college campuses in the United States has led to a call out culture and a climate of self censorship due to fear of shaming by virtue signalling social media mobs with users who are often anonymous and tend to deindividuate as a consequence Citing February Pew Research Center survey data showing that critical Facebook postings expressing indignant disagreement were twice as likely to receive likes comments or shares along with a similar finding for Twitter posts published in PNAS USA in July Haidt and Tobias Rose Stockwell cite the phrase moral grandstanding to describe how having an audience on social media forums converts much of its interpersonal communication into a public performance br Following the murder of George Floyd in May and the subsequent protests in his name Civiqs and YouGov Economist polls showed that while net support for Black Lives Matter among White Americans increased from points to points in early June with percent in support falling to points by early August and by April further Civiqs polls showed that support for Black Lives Matter among White Americans had reverted to roughly its level of support prior to George Floyd s murder percent in favor and percent opposed In a February interview on Firing Line journalist Charles M Blow criticized a minority of young white protestors in the George Floyd protests in the United States whom he argued were using the protests for their own personal growth to substitute for social rites of passage e g prom and summertime social gatherings e g attending movie theaters or concerts that were precluded by COVID lockdowns and social distancing measures noting that as lockdowns began to be relaxed and removed support for Black Lives Matter among whites began to decline br In February Psychological Medicine published a survey reviewing publicly reported murders in English language news worldwide between and compiled in a database by psychiatrists at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the Columbia University Irving Medical Center that found that of the personal cause mass murders i e driven by personal motivations and not occurring within the context of war state sponsored or group sponsored terrorism gang activity or organized crime only percent of mass murderers and only percent of mass shooters had a serious mental illness e g schizophrenia bipolar disorder major depressive disorder that mass shootings have become more common than other forms of mass murder since with percent occurring in the United States alone and that mass shooters in the United States were more likely to have legal histories to engage in recreational drug use or alcohol abuse and to display non psychotic psychiatric or neurologic symptoms br Survey coauthor psychiatrist Paul S Appelbaum argued that the data from the survey indicated that difficulty coping with life events seem more useful foci for prevention of mass shootings and policy than an emphasis on serious mental illness while psychiatrist Ronald W Pies has suggested that psychopathology should be understood as a three gradation continuum of mental behavioral and emotional disturbance with most mass shooters falling into a middle category of persistent emotional disturbance In psychiatrists James L Knoll and George D Annas noted that the tendency of most media attention following mass shootings on mental health leads to sociocultural factors being comparatively overlooked Instead Knoll and Annas cite research by social psychologists Jean Twenge and W Keith Campbell on narcissism and social rejection in the personal histories of mass shooters as well as cognitive scientist Steven Pinker s suggestion in The Better Angels of Our Nature that further reductions in human violence may be dependent upon reducing human narcissism br br br Non informing knowledge eroding medium br br Facebook is a Big Tech company with over billion monthly active users as of the second quarter of and therefore has a meaningful impact on the masses that use it Big data algorithms are used in personalized content creation and automatization however this method can be used to manipulate users in various ways The problem of misinformation is exacerbated by the educational bubble users critical thinking ability and news culture Based on a study of the Facebook users are oblivious to any curation of their News Feed Furthermore scientists have started to investigate algorithms with unexpected outcomes that may lead to antisocial political economic geographic racial or other discrimination Facebook has remained scarce in transparency of the inner workings of the algorithms used for News Feed correlation Algorithms use the past activities as a reference point for predicting users taste to keep them engaged However this leads to the formation of a filter bubble that starts to refrain users from diverse information Users are left with a skewed worldview derived from their own preferences and biases br In researchers from Facebook published a study indicating that the Facebook algorithm perpetuates an echo chamber amongst users by occasionally hiding content from individual feeds that users potentially would disagree with for example the algorithm removed one in every diverse content from news sources for self identified liberals In general the results from the study indicated that the Facebook algorithm ranking system caused approximately less diverse material in users content feeds and a reduction in the click through rate of the diverse material In social psychologist Jonathan Haidt and FIRE President Greg Lukianoff argued in The Coddling of the American Mind that the filter bubbles created by the News Feed algorithm of Facebook and other platforms are one of the principal factors amplifying political polarization in the United States since when a majority of U S households first had at least one personal computer and then internet access the following year br In his Reflections on the Revolution in France philosopher Edmund Burke observed We are afraid to put men to live and trade each on his own private stock of reason because we suspect that this stock in each man is small and that the individuals would do better to avail themselves of the general bank and capital of nations and of ages In The Signal and the Noise statistician Nate Silver noted that IBM had estimated that the world was generating quintillion bytes of data each day more than percent of which was created in the previous two years and that the increase in data was analogous to increases in book production as a consequence of the invention of the printing press in by Johannes Gutenberg as well as the effect of the increase in book production in causing the Reformation the Counter Reformation and the European wars of religion br Citing Burke Jonathan Haidt and Tobias Rose Stockwell suggested in The Atlantic in December that because the proportion of most of the information that Generation Z receives due to regular social media usage is information created primarily within the past month e g cat videos tabloid gossip about celebrities sensationalistic hot takes on news items rather than information created in decades or centuries past members of Generation Z are less familiar with the accumulated knowledge and wisdom of humanity e g great ideas great books history than generations past and as a consequence are more prone to embrace misguided ideas that bring them greater esteem and prestige within their immediate social network noting the declining faith among Generation Z in democracy across the ideological spectrum in polling data alongside renewed interest in socialism communism and Nazism that is reflective of ignorance of the history of the th century br Facebook has at least in the political field a counter effect on being informed in two studies from the US with a total of more than participants the influence of social media on the general knowledge on political issues was examined in the context of two US presidential elections The results showed that the frequency of Facebook use was moderately negatively related to general political knowledge This was also the case when considering demographic political ideological variables and previous political knowledge According to the latter a causal relationship is indicated the higher the Facebook use the more the general political knowledge declines In Jonathan Haidt argued that there is a very good chance American democracy will fail that in the next years we will have a catastrophic failure of our democracy Following the United States Capitol attack in February Facebook announced that it would reduce the amount of political content in users News Feeds br br br Other psychological effects br It has been admitted by many students that they have experienced bullying on the site which leads to psychological harm High school students face a possibility of bullying and other adverse behaviors over Facebook every day Many studies have attempted to discover whether Facebook has a positive or negative effect on children s and teenagers social lives and many of them have come to the conclusion that there are distinct social problems that arise with Facebook usage British neuroscientist Susan Greenfield stuck up for the issues that children encounter on social media sites stating that these sites can rewire the brain which caused some hysteria regarding the safety of social media usage She did not back up her claims with research but did cause quite a few studies to be done on the subject When an individual s self image is broken down by others as a result of badmouthing criticism harassment criminalization or vilification intimidation demonization demoralization belittlement or attacking someone over the site it can cause much of the envy anger or depression users report feeling after prolonged Facebook usage br Sherry Turkle in her book Alone Together Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other argues that social media brings people closer and further apart at the same time One of the main points she makes is that there is a high risk in treating persons online with dispatch like objects Although people are networked on Facebook their expectations of each other tend to be lessened According to Turkle this could cause a feeling of loneliness in spite of being together br Between and the number of to year olds who reported being bullied over social media rose from to in the region covered by Ofcom br br br User influence experiments br Academic and Facebook researchers have collaborated to test if the messages people see on Facebook can influence their behavior For instance in A Million Person Experiment in Social Influence And Political Mobilization during the elections Facebook users were given the opportunity to tell your friends you voted by clicking on an I voted button Users were more likely to click the button if it was associated with friends who had already voted br Much more controversially a study of Emotional Contagion Through Social Networks manipulated the balance of positive and negative messages seen by Facebook users The researchers concluded that they had found some of the first experimental evidence to support the controversial claims that emotions can spread throughout a network though the effect sizes from the manipulations are small br Unlike the I voted study which had presumptively beneficial ends and raised few concerns this study was criticized for both its ethics and methods claims As controversy about the study grew Adam Kramer a lead author of both studies and member of the Facebook data team defended the work in a Facebook update A few days later Sheryl Sandburg Facebook s COO made a statement while traveling abroad While at an Indian Chambers of Commerce event in New Delhi she stated that This was part of ongoing research companies do to test different products and that was what it was It was poorly communicated and for that communication we apologize We never meant to upset you br Shortly thereafter on July USA Today reported that the privacy watchdog group Electronic Privacy Information Center EPIC had filed a formal complaint with the Federal Trade Commission claiming that Facebook had broken the law when it conducted the study on the emotions of its users without their knowledge or consent In its complaint EPIC alleged that Facebook had deceived users by secretly conducting a psychological experiment on their emotions At the time of the experiment Facebook did not state in the Data Use Policy that user data would be used for research purposes Facebook also failed to inform users that their personal information would be shared with researchers br Beyond the ethical concerns other scholars criticized the methods and reporting of the study s findings John Grohol writing for Psych Central argued that despite its title and claims of emotional contagion this study did not look at emotions at all Instead its authors used an application called Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count or LIWC that simply counted positive and negative words to infer users sentiments He wrote that a shortcoming of the LIWC tool is that it does not understand negations Hence the tweet I am not happy would be scored as positive Since the LIWC ignores these subtle realities of informal human communication so do the researchers Grohol concluded that given these subtleties the effect size of the findings are little more than a statistical blip br br Kramer et al found a that s not percent that s th of one percent decrease in negative words in people s status updates when the number of negative posts on their Facebook news feed decreased Do you know how many words you d have to read or write before you ve written one less negative word due to this effect Probably thousands br The consequences of the controversy are pending be it FTC or court proceedings but it did prompt an Editorial Expression of Concern from its publisher the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences as well as a blog posting from OkCupid titled We experiment on human beings In September law professor James Grimmelmann argued that the actions of both companies were illegal immoral and mood altering and filed notices with the Maryland Attorney General and Cornell Institutional Review Board br In the UK the study was also criticized by the British Psychological Society which said in a letter to The Guardian There has undoubtedly been some degree of harm caused with many individuals affected by increased levels of negative emotion with consequent potential economic costs increase in possible mental health problems and burden on health services The so called positive manipulation is also potentially harmful br br br Tax avoidance br br Facebook uses a complicated series of shell companies in tax havens to avoid paying billions of dollars in corporate tax br According to The Express Tribune Facebook is among the corporations that avoided billions of dollars in tax using offshore companies br For example Facebook routes billions of dollars in profits using the Double Irish and Dutch Sandwich tax avoidance schemes to bank accounts in the Cayman Islands br The Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad concluded from the Paradise Papers published in late that Facebook pays practically no taxes worldwide br For example Facebook paid br br In m tax on m profits in the UK br In and no tax in the UK br In tax on hundreds of millions of pounds in UK revenues which were transferred to tax havens br According to economist and member of the PvdA delegation inside the Progressive Alliance of Socialists Democrats in the European Parliament S D Paul Tang between and the EU lost an estimated m m to Facebook When comparing to others countries outside the EU the EU is only taxing Facebook with a rate of to of its revenue around of its EBT whereas this rate is near in countries outside the EU Even had a rate between and been applied during this period as suggested by the ECOFIN Council a fraud of this rate by Facebook would have meant a loss to the EU between m and m br br On July the U S Department of Justice filed a petition in the U S District Court in San Francisco asking for a court order to enforce an administrative summons issued to Facebook Inc under Internal Revenue Code section in connection with an Internal Revenue Service examination of Facebook s year U S Federal income tax return br In November the Irish Independent recorded that for the financial year Facebook had paid million of Irish corporation tax on billion of revenues that were routed through Ireland giving an Irish effective tax rate of under The billion of Facebook revenues routed through Ireland was almost half of Facebook s global revenues In April Reuters wrote that all of Facebook s non U S accounts were legally housed in Ireland for tax purposes but were being moved due to the May EU GDPR regulations br In November the Irish Times reported that Facebook routed over billion of revenues through Ireland almost half all global revenues on which it paid million of Irish corporation tax br br br Treatment of employees moderators and contractors br br br Moderators br br Facebook hires some employees through contractors including Accenture Arvato Cognizant CPL Resources and Genpact to serve as content moderators reviewing potentially problematic content posted to both Facebook and Instagram Many of these contractors face unrealistic expectations harsh working conditions and constant exposure to disturbing content including graphic violence animal abuse and child pornography Contractor employment is contingent on achieving and maintaining a score of on a point scale on a metric known as accuracy Falling below a score of can result in dismissal Some have reported post traumatic stress disorder PTSD stemming from lack of access to counseling coupled with unforgiving expectations and the violent content they are assigned to review br Content moderator Keith Utley who was employed by Cognizant experienced a heart attack during work in March the office lacked a defibrillator and Utley was transported to a hospital where he died Selena Scola an employee of contractor Pro Unlimited Inc sued her employer after she developed PTSD as a result of constant and unmitigated exposure to highly toxic and extremely disturbing images at the workplace In December former CPL employee Chris Gray began legal action in the High Court of Ireland claiming damages for PTSD experienced as a moderator the first of an estimated pending cases In February employees in Tampa Florida filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Cognizant alleging they developed PTSD and related mental health impairments as a result of constant and unmitigated exposure to disturbing content br In February the European Union Commissioners criticized the plans that Facebook has for dealing with the working conditions of those who are contracted to moderate content on the social media platform br Facebook agreed to settle a class action lawsuit for million on May which included a payment to each of the moderators in the class with additional compensation available for the treatment of PTSD and other conditions resulting from the jobs br br br Employees br Plans for a Facebook owned real estate development known as Willow Village have been criticized for resembling a company town which often curtails the rights of residents and encourages or forces employees to remain within an environment created and monitored by their employer outside of work hours Critics have referred to the development as Zucktown and Facebookville and the company has faced additional criticism for the effect it will have on existing communities in California br The operational manager at Facebook as of March along with three former candidates of the Facebook hiring process complained to the EEOC of racial bias being practiced at the company against Black people The current employee Oscar Veneszee Jr accused the firm of conducting subjective evaluations and pushing the idea of racial stereotypes The EEOC has labeled the practice as systemic racial bias and has initiated an investigation br br br Misleading campaigns against competitors br In May emails were sent to journalists and bloggers making critical allegations about Google s privacy policies however it was later discovered that the anti Google campaign conducted by PR giant Burson Marsteller was paid for by Facebook in what CNN referred to as a new level skullduggery and which Daily Beast called a clumsy smear While taking responsibility for the campaign Burson Marsteller said it should not have agreed to keep its client s Facebook s identity a secret Whatever the rationale this was not at all standard operating procedure and is against our policies and the assignment on those terms should have been declined it said br In December Apple Inc announced an initiative of Anti Tracking measures opt in tracking policy to be introduced to their App Store Services Facebook quickly reacted and started to criticise the initiative claiming the Apple s anti tracking privacy focused change will have harmful impact on many small businesses that are struggling to stay afloat and on the free internet that we all rely on more than ever Facebook also launched a so called Speak Up For Small Businesses page Apple in their response stated that users should know when their data is being collected and shared across other apps and websites and they should have the choice to allow that or not Apple was also backed up by Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF who stated that Facebook touts itself in this case as protecting small businesses and that couldn t be further from the truth br In March The Washington Post revealed that Facebook had partnered with Republican consulting firm Targeted Victory to orchestrate a campaign to damage the public reputation of competitor TikTok br br br Copying competitors products and features br Beyond acquiring competitors in the social and messaging space with strong potential Facebook often simply copies products or features to get to the market faster Internal emails have shown that Facebook s leadership including Mark Zuckerberg were frustrated by the time the company spends on prototyping and suggested to explore copying entire products like Pinterest Copying is faster than innovating admitted an employee on the internal email thread which continued If you gave the top down order to go ahead copy e g Pinterest or the gaming dynamics on Foursquare I am sure a very small team of engineers a product manager and a designer would get it done super quickly br Many Facebook employees seem to be questioning Facebook s approach of cloning competitors According to leaks a top quoted question in Facebook s internal all hands was What is our next big product which does not imitate already existing products on the market br br br Snapchat br In June Facebook launched Slingshot an app for sending ephemeral photos like Snapchat does In August the company released Facebook Stories which is a copy of Snapchat s most popular feature br br br TikTok br In August Facebook built Instagram Reels a feature that functioned and looked similar to TikTok br br br Pinterest br For several months Facebook was experimenting with an app called Hobbi which took many cues from Pinterest br br br Clubhouse br In the summer of Facebook started to roll out Live Audio Rooms which resembles Clubhouse br br br Content br br Facebook or Meta Platforms has been criticized for its management of various content on posts photos and entire groups and profiles This includes but is not limited to allowing violent content including content related to war crimes and not limiting the spread of fake news and COVID misinformation on their platform as well as allowing incitement of violence against multiple groups br br br Misguiding news publishers and advertisers on video engagement br Facebook heavily pushed news publishers towards making more videos and discouraging text content However this was revealed to be wrong as metrics used for time spent on videos was faulty overestimating by later unsealed court documents revealed the metric was wrong between time A group of advertisers in California sued Facebook over the allegation br br br Technical br br br Real name policy controversy and compromise br br Facebook has a real name system policy for user profiles The real name policy stems from the position that way you always know who you re connecting with This helps keep our community safe The real name system does not allow adopted names or pseudonyms and in its enforcement has suspended accounts of legitimate users until the user provides identification indicating the name Facebook representatives have described these incidents as very rare A user claimed responsibility via the anonymous Android and iOS app Secret for reporting fake names which caused user profiles to be suspended specifically targeting the stage names of drag queens On October Chris Cox Chief Product Officer at Facebook offered an apology In the two weeks since the real name policy issues surfaced we ve had the chance to hear from many of you in these communities and understand the policy more clearly as you experience it We ve also come to understand how painful this has been We owe you a better service and a better experience using Facebook and we re going to fix the way this policy gets handled so everyone affected here can go back to using Facebook as you were br On December Facebook announced in a press release that it would be providing a compromise to its real name policy after protests from groups such as the gay lesbian community and abuse victims The site is developing a protocol that will allow members to provide specifics as to their special circumstance or unique situation with a request to use pseudonyms subject to verification of their true identities At that time this was already being tested in the U S Product manager Todd Gage and vice president of global operations Justin Osofsky also promised a new method for reducing the number of members who must go through ID verification while ensuring the safety of others on Facebook The fake name reporting procedure will also be modified forcing anyone who makes such an allegation to provide specifics that would be investigated and giving the accused individual time to dispute the allegation br br br Deleting users statuses br There have been complaints of user statuses being mistakenly or intentionally deleted for alleged violations of Facebook s posting guidelines Especially for non English speaking writers Facebook does not have a proper support system to genuinely read the content and make decisions Sometimes the content of a status did not have any abusive or defaming language but it nevertheless got deleted on the basis that it had been secretly reported by a group of people as offensive For other languages than English Facebook until now is not able to identify the group approach that is used to vilify humanitarian activism In another incident Facebook had to apologize after it deleted a free speech group s post about the abuse of human rights in Syria In that case a spokesman for Facebook said the post was mistakenly removed by a member of its moderation team which receives a high volume of take down requests br br br Enabling of harassment br Facebook instituted a policy by which it is now self policed by the community of Facebook users Some users have complained that this policy allows Facebook to empower abusive users to harass them by allowing them to submit reports on even benign comments and photos as being offensive or in violation of Facebook Rights and Responsibilities and that enough of these reports result in the user who is being harassed in this way getting their account blocked for a predetermined number of days or weeks or even deactivated entirely br Facebook UK policy director Simon Milner told Wired magazine that Once the piece of content has been seen assessed and deemed OK Facebook will ignore further reports about it br br br Lack of customer support br Facebook lacks any form of live customer support beyond community support pages and FAQ s which offer only general troubleshooting advice often making it impossible to resolve issues that require the services of an administrator or are not covered in the FAQs The automated emailing system used when filling out a support form often directs users back to the help center or to pages that are outdated and cannot be accessed leaving users at a dead end with no further support available A person who lost access to Facebook or does not have an account has no easy way to contact the company directly br br br Downtime and outages br Facebook has had a number of outages and downtime large enough to draw some media attention A outage resulted in a security hole that enabled some users to read other users personal mail In the site was inaccessible for about a day from many locations in many countries In spite of these occurrences a report issued by Pingdom found that Facebook had less downtime in than most social networking websites On September Facebook started having major problems loading as people signed in This was due to a group of hackers deliberately trying to drown out a political speaker who had social networking problems from continuously speaking against the Iranian election results Just two days later on September Facebook went down again br In October an unspecified number of Facebook users were unable to access their accounts for over three weeks br On Monday October Facebook and its other apps Instagram Whatsapp Messenger Oculus as well as the lesser known Mapillary had an hours long DNS related global outage The outage also affected anyone using Log in with Facebook to access third party sites The downtime lasted approximately five hours and fifteen minutes from approximately UTC to UTC and affected roughly three billion users The outage was caused by a BGP withdrawal of all of the IP routes to their Domain Name DNS servers which were all self hosted at the time br A further global outage occurred on Tuesday March When Facebook Instagram Threads and Messenger suddenly stopped working around the World it started at UTC and ended hours later The case is the same as outage the outage appeared on Super Tuesday the outage is determined as the error occurred during maintenance and verification of configuration values automated tool The purpose of this automated tool is to check for invalid configuration values in the system cache and replace them with updated values from the persistent store Twitter CEO Elon Musk mocked the outage in X br br br Tracking cookies br Facebook has been criticized heavily for tracking users even when logged out of the site Australian technologist Nik Cubrilovic discovered that when a user logs out of Facebook the cookies from that login are still kept in the browser allowing Facebook to track users on websites that include social widgets distributed by the social network Facebook has denied the claims saying they have no interest in tracking users or their activity They also promised after the discovery of the cookies that they would remove them saying they will no longer have them on the site A group of users in the United States have sued Facebook for breaching privacy laws br As of December to comply with a court order citing violations of the European Union Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications which requires users to consent to tracking and storage of data by websites Facebook no longer allows users in Belgium to view any content on the service even public pages without being registered and logged in br br br Email address change br In June Facebook removed all existing email addresses from user profiles and added a new facebook com email address Facebook claimed this was part of adding a new setting that gives people the choice to decide which addresses they want to show on their timelines However this setting was redundant to the existing Only Me privacy setting which was already available to hide addresses from timelines Users complained the change was unnecessary they did not want an facebook com email address and they did not receive adequate notification their profiles had been changed The change in email address was synchronized to phones due to a software bug causing existing email addresses details to be deleted The facebook com email service was retired in February br br br Safety Check bug br On March following a bombing in Lahore Pakistan Facebook activated its Safety Check feature which allows people to let friends and loved ones know they are okay following a crisis or natural disaster to people who were never in danger or even close to the Pakistan explosion Some users as far as the US UK and Egypt received notifications asking if they were okay br br br End to end encryption br In February the National Crime Agency of the UK expressed its concerns that the installation of end to end encryption methods would result in the spread of child pornography going undetected Facebook representatives had previously told a UK Parliament committee that the use of these stronger encryption methods would render it easier for pedophiles to share child pornography on Facebook s networks The US based National Center for Missing and Exploited Children estimates that around of reports to law enforcement regarding the spread of child pornography on Facebook would be lost as a result of the implementation of end to end encryption br In May Facebook came under fire from Ken McCallum the Director General of MI for its plans to introduce end to end encryption into its Messenger and Instagram services McCallum stated that the introduction of such encryption methods would prevent security organizations from viewing communications related to ongoing terrorist plots and that the implementation of end to end encryption would block active counter terrorism investigations br br br Third party responses to Facebook br br br Government censorship br br Several countries have banned access to Facebook including Syria China and Iran br In the Office of the Data Protection Supervisor a branch of the government of the Isle of Man received so many complaints about Facebook that they deemed it necessary to provide a Facebook Guidance booklet available online as a PDF file which cited amongst other things Facebook policies and guidelines and included an elusive Facebook telephone number This number when called however proved to provide no telephone support for Facebook users and only played back a recorded message advising callers to review Facebook s online help information br In Facebook reportedly allowed an objectionable page deemed by the Islamic Lawyers Forum ILF to be anti Muslim The ILF filed a petition with Pakistan s Lahore High Court On May Justice Ijaz Ahmad Chaudhry ordered Pakistan s Telecommunication Authority to block access to Facebook until May The offensive page had provoked street demonstrations in Muslim countries due to visual depictions of Muhammad which are regarded as blasphemous by Muslims A spokesman said Pakistan Telecommunication Authority would move to implement the ban once the order has been issued by the Ministry of Information and Technology We will implement the order as soon as we get the instructions Khurram Mehran told AFP We have already blocked the URL link and issued instruction to Internet service providers yesterday he added Rai Bashir told AFP that We moved the petition in the wake of widespread resentment in the Muslim community against the Facebook contents The petition called on the government of Pakistan to lodge a strong protest with the owners of Facebook he added Bashir said a PTA official told the judge his organization had blocked the page but the court ordered a total ban on the site People demonstrated outside court in the eastern city of Lahore Pakistan carrying banners condemning Facebook Protests in Pakistan on a larger scale took place after the ban and widespread news of that objectionable page The ban was lifted on May after Facebook reportedly assured the Lahore High Court that it would remedy the issues in dispute br In a court in Pakistan was petitioned to place a permanent ban on Facebook for hosting a page called nd Annual Draw Muhammad Day May th br br br Organizations blocking access br Ontario government employees Federal public servants MPPs and cabinet ministers were blocked from access to Facebook on government computers in May When the employees tried to access Facebook a warning message The Internet website that you have requested has been deemed unacceptable for use for government business purposes This warning also appears when employees try to access YouTube MySpace gambling or pornographic websites However innovative employees have found ways around such protocols and many claim to use the site for political or work related purposes br A number of local governments including those in the UK and Finland imposed restrictions on the use of Facebook in the workplace due to the technical strain incurred Other government related agencies such as the US Marine Corps have imposed similar restrictions A number of hospitals in Finland have also restricted Facebook use citing privacy concerns br br br Schools blocking access br The University of New Mexico UNM in October blocked access to Facebook from UNM campus computers and networks citing unsolicited emails and a similar site called UNM Facebook After a UNM user signed into Facebook from off campus a message from Facebook said We are working with the UNM administration to lift the block and have explained that it was instituted based on erroneous information but they have not yet committed to restore your access UNM in a message to students who tried to access the site from the UNM network wrote This site is temporarily unavailable while UNM and the site owners work out procedural issues The site is in violation of UNM s Acceptable Computer Use Policy for abusing computing resources e g spamming trademark infringement etc The site forces use of UNM credentials e g NetID or email address for non UNM business However after Facebook created an encrypted login and displayed a precautionary message not to use university passwords for access UNM unblocked access the following spring semester br The Columbus Dispatch reported on June that Kent State University s athletic director had planned to ban the use of Facebook by athletes and gave them until August to delete their accounts On July the Daily Kent Stater reported that the director reversed the decision after reviewing the privacy settings of Facebook As long as they followed the university s policies of online conduct they could keep their profiles br br br Closed social networks br Several web sites concerned with social networking such as Salesforce have criticized the lack of information that users get when they share data Advanced users cannot limit the amount of information anyone can access in their profiles but Facebook promotes the sharing of personal information for marketing purposes leading to the promotion of the service using personal data from users who are not fully aware of this Facebook exposes personal data without supporting open standards for data interchange According to several communities and authors closed social networking on the other hand promotes data retrieval from other people while not exposing one s personal information br Openbook was established in early both as a parody of Facebook and a critique of its changing privacy management protocols br br br FB Purity br Fluff Busting Purity or FB Purity for short previously known as Facebook Purity is a browser extension first launched in to allow users to remove annoyances such as spam from their feed and allow more individual control over what content is displayed In response Facebook banned its developer from using the platform and blocked links to the extension br br br Unfollow Everything br Unfollow Everything is a browser extension designed to help Facebook users reduce their time spent on the platform by mass unliking to reduce the clutter in their news feed The extension together with its creator has been banned by Facebook and subject to legal warnings br br br Litigation br br Meta Platforms formerly Facebook Inc has been involved in many lawsuits since its founding in br br br Lobbying br Facebook is among the biggest spenders on lobbying among tech companies in it was the highest spender It spent more than million on lobbying in the s This funding may serve to weaken privacy protections br In March HuffPost reported that Facebook paid lawyer Ed Sussman to lobby for changes to their Wikipedia articles br In December news broke on The Wall Street Journal pointing to Meta s lobbying efforts to divide US lawmakers and muddy the waters in Congress to hinder regulation following the whistleblower leaks Facebook s lobbyist team in Washington suggested to Republican lawmakers that the whistleblower was trying to help Democrats while the narrative told to Democratic staffers was that Republicans were focused on the company s decision to ban expressions of support for Kyle Rittenhouse The Wall Street Journal reported According to the article the company s goal was to muddy the waters divide lawmakers along partisan lines and forestall a cross party alliance against Facebook now Meta in Congress br In March the Washington Post reported that Meta had hired the Republican backed consulting firm Targeted Victory to coordinate lobbying and negative PR against the video app TikTok via local media outlets including concurrent promotion of corporate initiatives conducted by Facebook br br br Terms of use controversy br While Facebook originally made changes to its terms of use or terms of service on February the changes went unnoticed until Chris Walters a blogger for the consumer oriented blog The Consumerist noticed the change on February Walters complained the change gave Facebook the right to Do anything they want with your content Forever The section under the most controversy is the User Content Posted on the Site clause Before the changes the clause read You may remove your User Content from the Site at any time If you choose to remove your User Content the license granted above will automatically expire however you acknowledge that the Company may retain archived copies of your User Content The license granted refers to the license that Facebook has to one s name likeness and image to use in promotions and external advertising The new terms of use deleted the phrase that states the license would automatically expire if a user chose to remove content By omitting this line Facebook license extends to adopt users content perpetually and irrevocably years after the content has been deleted br Many users of Facebook voiced opinions against the changes to the Facebook Terms of Use leading to an Internet wide debate over the ownership of content The Electronic Privacy Information Center EPIC prepared a formal complaint with the Federal Trade Commission Many individuals were frustrated with the removal of the controversial clause Facebook users numbering more than joined a user group against the changes and a number of blogs and news sites have written about this issue br After the change was brought to light in Walters s blog entry in his blog on February Zuckerberg addressed the issues concerning the recently made changes to Facebook s terms of use Zuckerberg wrote Our philosophy is that people own their information and control who they share it with In addition to this statement Zuckerberg explained the paradox created when people want to share their information phone number pictures email address etc with the public but at the same time desire to remain in complete control of who has access to this info br To calm criticism Facebook returned to its original terms of use However on February Zuckerberg wrote in his blog that although Facebook reverted to its original terms of use it is in the process of developing new terms to address the paradox Zuckerberg stated that these new terms will allow Facebook users to share and control their information and it will be written clearly in language everyone can understand Zuckerberg invited users to join a group entitled Facebook Bill of Rights and Responsibilities to give their input and help shape the new terms br On February Zuckerberg posted a blog updating users on the progress of the new Terms of Use He wrote We decided we needed to do things differently and so we re going to develop new policies that will govern our system from the ground up in an open and transparent way Zuckerberg introduces the two new additions to Facebook the Facebook Principles and the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities Both additions allow users to vote on changes to the terms of use before they are officially released Because Facebook is still in the business of introducing new and therefore potentially disruptive technologies Zuckerberg explains users need to adjust and familiarize themselves with the products before they can adequately show their support br This new voting system was initially applauded as Facebook s step to a more democratized social network system However the new terms were harshly criticized in a report by computer scientists from the University of Cambridge who stated that the democratic process surrounding the new terms is disingenuous and significant problems remain in the new terms The report was endorsed by the Open Rights Group br In December EPIC and a number of other U S privacy organizations filed another complaint with the Federal Trade Commission FTC regarding Facebook s Terms of Service In January EPIC filed a subsequent complaint claiming that Facebook s new policy of sharing users home address and mobile phone information with third party developers were misleading and fail ed to provide users clear and privacy protections particularly for children under age Facebook temporarily suspended implementation of its policy in February but the following month announced it was actively considering reinstating the third party policy br br br Interoperability and data portability br Facebook has been criticized for failing to offer users a feature to export their friends information such as contact information for use with other services or software The inability of users to export their social graph in an open standard format contributes to vendor lock in and contravenes the principles of data portability Automated collection of user information without Facebook s consent violates its Statement of Rights and Responsibilities and third party attempts to do so e g Web scraping have resulted in litigation Power com br Facebook Connect has been criticized for its lack of interoperability with OpenID br br br Lawsuits over privacy br Facebook s strategy of making revenue through advertising has created a lot of controversy for its users as some argue that it is a bit creepy but it is also brilliant Some Facebook users have raised privacy concerns because they do not like that Facebook sells user s information to third parties In users sued Facebook for using their pictures and information on a Facebook advertisement Facebook gathers user information by keeping track of pages users have Liked and through the interactions users have with their connections They then create value from the gathered data by selling it In users also filed a lawsuit for Facebook s privacy invasion through the Facebook Beacon system Facebook s team believed that through the Beacon system people could inspire their friends to buy similar products however users did not like the idea of sharing certain online purchases with their Facebook friends Users were against Facebook s invasion of privacy and sharing that privacy with the world Facebook users became more aware of Facebook s behavior with user information in as Facebook launched their new Terms of Service In Facebook s terms of service Facebook admits that user information may be used for some of Facebook s own purposes such as sharing a link to your posted images or for their own commercials and advertisements br As Dijck argues in his book that the more users know about what happens to their personal data the more inclined they are to raise objections This created a battle between Facebook and Facebook users described as the battle for information control Facebook users have become aware of Facebook s intentions and people now see Facebook as serving the interests of companies rather than its users In response to Facebook selling user information to third parties concerned users have resorted to the method of Obfuscation Through obfuscation users can purposely hide their real identity and provide Facebook with false information that will make their collected data less accurate By obfuscating information through sites such as FaceCloak Facebook users have regained control of their personal information br br br Better Business Bureau review br As of December the Better Business Bureau gave Facebook an A rating br As of December the month running count of complaints about Facebook logged with the Better Business Bureau is including Making a full refund as the consumer requested Agreeing to perform according to their contract Refuse sic to adjust relying on terms of agreement Unassigned Unanswered and Refusing to make an adjustment br br br Security br Facebook s software has proven vulnerable to likejacking On July the BBC reported that security consultant Ron Bowes used a piece of code to scan Facebook profiles to collect data of million profiles The data collected was not hidden by the user s privacy settings Bowes then published the list online This list which has been shared as a downloadable file contains the URL of every searchable Facebook user s profile their name and unique ID Bowes said he published the data to highlight privacy issues but Facebook claimed it was already public information br In early June The New York Times reported that an increase in malicious links related to the Trojan horse malware program Zeus were identified by Eric Feinberg founder of the advocacy group Fans Against Kounterfeit Enterprise FAKE Feinberg said that the links were present on popular NFL Facebook fan pages and following contact with Facebook was dissatisfied with the corporation s after the fact approach Feinberg called for oversight stating If you really want to hack someone the easiest place to start is a fake Facebook profile it s so simple it s stupid br br br Rewards for vulnerability reporting br On August it was reported that a Facebook user from Palestinian Autonomy Khalil Shreateh found a bug that allowed him to post material to other users Facebook Walls Users are not supposed to have the ability to post material to the Facebook Walls of other users unless they are approved friends of those users that they have posted material to To prove that he was telling the truth Shreateh posted material to Sarah Goodin s wall a friend of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Following this Shreateh contacted Facebook s security team with the proof that his bug was real explaining in detail what was going on Facebook has a bounty program in which it compensates people a fee for reporting bugs instead of using them to their advantage or selling them on the black market However it was reported that instead of fixing the bug and paying Shreateh the fee Facebook originally told him that this was not a bug and dismissed him Shreateh then tried a second time to inform Facebook but they dismissed him yet again On the third try Shreateh used the bug to post a message to Mark Zuckerberg s Wall stating Sorry for breaking your privacy but a couple of days ago I found a serious Facebook exploit and that Facebook s security team was not taking him seriously Within minutes a security engineer contacted Shreateh questioned him on how he performed the move and ultimately acknowledged that it was a bug in the system Facebook temporarily suspended Shreateh s account and fixed the bug after several days However in a move that was met with much public criticism and disapproval Facebook refused to pay out the fee to Shreateh instead Facebook responded that by posting to Zuckerberg s account Shreateh had violated one of their terms of service policies and therefore could not be paid Included with this the Facebook team strongly censured Shreateh over his manner of resolving the matter In closing they asked that Shreateh continue to help them find bugs br On August Yahoo News reported that Marc Maiffret a chief technology officer of the cybersecurity firm BeyondTrust is prompting hackers to help raise a reward for Khalil Shreateh On August Maiffret stated that he had already raised in his efforts including the he himself contributed He and other hackers alike have denounced Facebook for refusing Shreateh compensation Maiffret said He is sitting there in Palestine doing this research on a five year old laptop that looks like it is half broken It s something that might help him out in a big way Facebook representatives have since responded We will not change our practice of refusing to pay rewards to researchers who have tested vulnerabilities against real users Facebook representatives also claimed they d paid out over million to individuals who have discovered bugs in the past br br br Environmental impacts br br In Prineville Oregon was chosen as the site for Facebook s new data center However the center has been met with criticism from environmental groups such as Greenpeace because the power utility company contracted for the center PacifiCorp generates of its electricity from coal In September Facebook received a letter from Greenpeace containing half a million signatures asking the company to cut its ties to coal based electricity br On April Greenpeace released a report showing that of the top ten big brands in cloud computing Facebook relied the most on coal for electricity for its data centers At the time data centers consumed up to of all global electricity and this amount was projected to increase Phil Radford of Greenpeace said we are concerned that this new explosion in electricity use could lock us into old polluting energy sources instead of the clean energy available today br On December Greenpeace and Facebook announced together that Facebook would shift to use clean and renewable energy to power its own operations Marcy Scott Lynn of Facebook s sustainability program said it looked forward to a day when our primary energy sources are clean and renewable and that the company is working with Greenpeace and others to help bring that day closer br In April Meta Platforms Alphabet Inc Shopify McKinsey Company and Stripe Inc announced a million Advance market commitment of carbon dioxide removal CDR from companies that are developing CDR technology over the next years In January the American Clean Power Association released an annual industry report that found that corporations had contracted gigawatts of wind or solar energy by the end of and that the three corporate purchasers of the largest volumes of wind and solar energy were Meta Platforms Amazon and Alphabet Inc br br br Advertising br br br Click fraud br In July startup Limited Run claimed that of its Facebook clicks came from bots Limited Run co founder Tom Mango told TechCrunch that they spent roughly a month testing this with six web analytics services including Google Analytics and in house software Click fraud Allege reason Limited Run said it came to the conclusion that the clicks were fraudulent after running its own analysis It determined that most of the clicks for which Facebook was charging it came from computers that were not loading Javascript a programming language that allows Web pages to be interactive Almost all Web browsers load Javascript by default so the assumption is that if a click comes from one that is not it s probably not a real person but a bot br br br Like fraud br Facebook offers an advertising tool for pages to get more likes According to Business Insider this advertising tool is called Suggested Posts or Suggested Pages allowing companies to market their page to thousands of new users for as little as br Global Fortune firms are increasingly using social media marketing tools as the number of likes per Facebook page has risen by globally Biotechnology company Comprendia investigated Facebook s likes through advertising by analyzing the life science pages with the most likes They concluded that at as much as of likes from company pages are suspected to be fake According to Facebook s annual report an estimated and of active users are undesirable accounts that create fake likes br Small companies such as PubChase have publicly testified against Facebook s advertising tool claiming legitimate advertising on Facebook creates fraudulent Facebook likes In May PubChase decided to build up its Facebook following through Facebook s advertising tool which promises to connect with more of the people who matter to you After the first day the company grew suspicious of the increased likes as they ended up with likes from India According to PubChase none of the users behind the likes seemed to be scientists The statistics from Google Analytics indicate that India is not in the company s main user base PubChase continues by stating that Facebook has no interface to delete the fake likes rather the company must manually delete each follower themselves br In February Derek Muller used his YouTube account Veritasium to upload a video titled Facebook Fraud Within three days the video had gone viral with more than a million views it has reached views as of December In the video Derek illustrates how after paying US to Facebook advertising the likes to his fan page have tripled in a few days and soon reached likes compared to his original likes before the advertising Despite the significant increase in likes Derek noticed his page has actually decreased in engagement there were fewer people commenting sharing and liking his posts and updates despite the significant increase in likes Derek also noticed that the users that liked his page were users that liked hundreds of other pages including competing pages such as AT T and T Mobile He theorizes that users are purposely clicking like on any and every page to deter attention away from the pages they were paid to like Derek claims I never bought fake likes I used Facebook legitimate advertising but the results are as if I paid for fake likes from a click farm br In response to the fake likes complaints Facebook told Business Insider br br We re always focused on maintaining the integrity of our site but we ve placed an increased focus on abuse from fake accounts recently We ve made a lot of progress by building a combination of automated and manual systems to block accounts used for fraudulent purposes and Like button clicks We also take action against sellers of fake clicks and help shut them down br br br Undesired targeting br On August several British companies including First Direct Vodafone Virgin Media The Automobile Association Halifax and Prudential pulled advertising in Facebook after finding that their ads were displayed on the page of the British National Party a far right political party br br br Facilitation of housing discrimination br br Facebook has faced allegations that its advertising platforms facilitate housing discrimination by means of internal functions for targeted advertising which allowed advertisers to target or exclude specific audiences from campaigns Researchers have also found that Facebook s advertising platform may be inherently discriminatory since ad delivery is also influenced by how often specific demographics interact with specific types of advertising even if they are not explicitly determined by the advertiser br Under the United States Fair Housing Act it is illegal to show a preference for or against tenants based on specific protected classes including race ethnicity and disabilities when advertising or negotiating the rental or sale of housing In ProPublica found that advertisers could target or exclude users from advertising based on an Ethnic Affinity a demographic trait which is determined based on a user s interests and behaviors on Facebook and not explicitly provided by the user This could in turn be used to discriminate based on race In February Facebook stated that it would implement stronger measures to forbid discriminatory advertising across the entire platform Advertisers who attempt to create ads for housing employment or credit HEC opportunities would be blocked from using ethnic affinities renamed multicultural affinities and now classified as behaviors to target the ad If an advertiser uses any other audience segment to target ads for HEC they would be informed of the policies and be required to affirm their compliance with relevant laws and policies br However in November ProPublica found that automated enforcement of these new policies was inconsistent They were also able to successfully create housing ads that excluded users based on interests and other factors that effectively imply associations with protected classes including interests in wheelchair ramps the Spanish language television network Telemundo and New York City ZIP codes with majority minority populations In response to the report Facebook temporarily removed the ability to target any ad with exclusions based on multicultural affinities br In April Facebook permanently removed the ability to create exclusions based on multicultural affinities In July Facebook signed a legally binding agreement with the State of Washington to take further steps within days to prevent the use of its advertising platform for housing discrimination against protected classes The following month Facebook announced that it would remove at least categories from its exclusion system to prevent misuse including those relating to races and religions On March Facebook settled a lawsuit over the matter with the National Fair Housing Alliance agreeing to create a separate portal for HEC advertising with limited targeting options by September and to provide a public archive of all HEC advertising br On March the U S Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD filed a lawsuit against Facebook having filed a formal complaint against the company on August The HUD also took issue with Facebook s tendency to deliver ads based on users having particular characteristics that are most likely to engage with the ad br br br Fake accounts br In August Facebook revealed that more than million Facebook accounts of total users are fake accounts These fake profiles consist of duplicate profiles accounts for spamming purposes and personal profiles for business organization or non human entities such as pets As a result of this revelation the share price of Facebook dropped below Furthermore there is much effort to detect fake profiles using automated means in one such work machine learning techniques are used to detect fake users br Facebook initially refused to remove a business page devoted to a woman s anus created without her knowledge while she was underage due to other Facebook users having expressed interest in the topic After BuzzFeed published a story about it the page was finally removed The page listed her family s former home address as that of the business br br br User interface br br br Upgrades br br br September br In September Facebook permanently moved its users to what they termed the New Facebook or Facebook This version contained several different features and a complete layout redesign Between July and September users had been given the option to use the new Facebook in place of the original design or to return to the old design br Facebook s decision to migrate their users was met with some controversy in their community Several groups started opposing the decision some with over a million users br br br October br In October Facebook redesigned the news feed so that the user could view all types of things that their friends were involved with In a statement they said your applications stories generate can show up in both views The best way for your stories to appear in the News Feed filter is to create stories that are highly engaging as high quality interesting stories are most likely to garner likes and comments by the user s friends br This redesign was explained as br br News Feed will focus on popular content determined by an algorithm based on interest in that story including the number of times an item is liked or commented on Live Feed will display all recent stories from a large number of a user s friends br br The redesign was met immediately with criticism with users many who did not like the amount of information that was coming at them This was also compounded by the fact that people could not select what they saw br br br November December br In November Facebook issued a proposed new privacy policy and adopted it unaltered in December They combined this with a rollout of new privacy settings This new policy declared certain information including lists of friends to be publicly available with no privacy settings it was previously possible to keep access to this information restricted Due to this change the users who had set their list of friends as private were forced to make it public without even being informed and the option to make it private again was removed This was protested by many people and privacy organizations such as the EFF br The change was described by Ryan Tate as Facebook s Great Betrayal forcing user profile photos and friends lists to be visible in users public listing even for users who had explicitly chosen to hide this information previously and making photos and personal information public unless users were proactive about limiting access For example a user whose Family and Relationships information was set to be viewable by Friends Only would default to being viewable by Everyone publicly viewable That is information such as the gender of the partner the user is interested in relationship status and family relations became viewable to those even without a Facebook account Facebook was heavily criticized for both reducing its users privacy and pushing users to remove privacy protections Groups criticizing the changes include the Electronic Frontier Foundation and American Civil Liberties Union Mark Zuckerberg CEO had hundreds of personal photos and his events calendar exposed in the transition Facebook has since re included an option to hide friends lists from being viewable however this preference is no longer listed with other privacy settings and the former ability to hide the friends list from selected people among one s own friends is no longer possible Journalist Dan Gillmor deleted his Facebook account over the changes stating he can t entirely trust Facebook and Heidi Moore at Slate s Big Money temporarily deactivated her account as a conscientious objection Other journalists have been similarly disappointed and outraged by the changes Defending the changes founder Mark Zuckerberg said we decided that these would be the social norms now and we just went for it The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada launched another investigation into Facebook s privacy policies after complaints following the change br br br January br Following a difficult marked by accusations of relaying fake news and revelations about groups close to Russia which tried to influence the US presidential election see Russian interference in the United States elections via advertisements on his service Mark Zuckerberg announced in his traditional January post br br We re making a major change to how we build Facebook I m changing the goal I give our product teams from focusing on helping you find relevant content to helping you have more meaningful social interactions br Following surveys on Facebook users this desire for change will take the form of a reconfiguration of the News Feed algorithms to br br Prioritize content of family members and friends Mark Zuckerberg January Facebook The first changes you ll see will be in News Feed where you can expect to see more from your friends family and groups br Give priority to news articles from local sources considered more credible br The recent changes of the News Feed algorithm see content News Feed History are expected to improve the amount of meaningful content viewed To this end the new algorithm is supposed to determine the publications around which a user is most likely to interact with his friends and make them appear higher in the News Feed instead of items for example from media companies or brands These are posts that inspire back and forth discussion in the comments and posts that you might want to share and react to But as even Mark Zuckerberg admitted he expect the time people spend on Facebook and some measures of engagement will go down But I also expect the time you do spend on Facebook will be more valuable The less public content a Facebook user sees on their News Feed the fewer brands are able to reach consumers That s unarguably a major lose for advertisers and publishers br This change which seems to be just another update of the social network is widely criticized because of the heavy consequences it might lead to In countries such as the Philippines Myanmar and South Sudan and emerging democracies such Bolivia and Serbia it is not ethical to plead platform neutrality or to set up the promise of a functioning news ecosystem and then simply withdraw at a whim br Indeed in such countries Facebook was the promise of a reliable and objective platform on which they could hope for raw information Independent media companies tried to fight censorship through their articles and were promoting in a way the right for citizens to know what is going on in their countries br The company s way of handling scandals and criticism over fake news by diminishing its media company image is even defined as potentially deadly regarding the poor and fraught political environments like Myanmar or South Sudan appealed by the free basics programme of the social network br Serbian journalist Stevan Doj inovi goes further by describing Facebook as a monster and accuses the company of showing a cynical lack of concern for how its decisions affect the most vulnerable br Indeed Facebook had experimented with withdrawing media companies news on user s newsfeed in few countries such as Serbia Stevan Docjcinovic then wrote an article explaining how Facebook helped them to bypass mainstream channels and bring their stories to hundreds of thousands of readers The rule about publishers is not being applied to paid posts raising the journalist s fears about the social network becoming just another playground for the powerful by letting them for example buy Facebook ads br Critics are also visible in other media companies depicting the private company as the destroyer of worlds LittleThings CEO Joe Speiser states that the algorithm shift took out roughly of LittleThings organic traffic while hammering its profit margins compelling them to close their doors because they were relying on Facebook to share content br br br Net neutrality br br br Free Basics controversy in India br In February TRAI ruled against differential data pricing for limited services from mobile phone operators effectively ending zero rating platforms in India Zero rating provides access to a limited number of websites for no charge to the end user Net neutrality supporters from India SaveTheInternet in brought out the negative implications of the Facebook Free Basic program and spread awareness to the public Facebook s Free Basics program was a collaboration with Reliance Communications to launch Free Basics in India The TRAI ruling against differential pricing marked the end of Free Basics in India br Earlier Facebook had spent US million in advertising and it implored all of its Indian users to send an email to the Telecom Regulatory Authority to support its program TRAI later asked Facebook to provide specific responses from the supporters of Free Basics br br br Treatment of potential competitors br In December details on Facebook s behavior against competitors surfaced The UK parliament member Damian Collins released files from a court ruling between Six Three and Facebook According to those files the social media company Twitter released its app Vine in Facebook blocked Vine s Access to its data br In July Facebook along with other tech giants Apple Amazon and Google were accused of maintaining harmful power and anti
