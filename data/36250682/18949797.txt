File sharing is the practice of distributing or providing access to digital media such as computer programs multimedia audio images and video documents or electronic books Common methods of storage transmission and dispersion include removable media centralized servers on computer networks Internet based hyperlinked documents and the use of distributed peer to peer networking br File sharing technologies such as BitTorrent are integral to modern media piracy as well as the sharing of scientific data and other free content br br br History br br Files were first exchanged on removable media Computers were able to access remote files using filesystem mounting bulletin board systems Usenet and FTP servers s Internet Relay Chat and Hotline enabled users to communicate remotely through chat and to exchange files The mp encoding which was standardized in and substantially reduced the size of audio files grew to widespread use in the late s In MP com and Audiogalaxy were established the Digital Millennium Copyright Act was unanimously passed and the first mp player devices were launched br In June Napster was released as an unstructured centralized peer to peer system requiring a central server for indexing and peer discovery It is generally credited as being the first peer to peer file sharing system In December Napster was sued by several recording companies and lost in A M Records Inc v Napster Inc In the case of Napster it has been ruled that an online service provider could not use the transitory network transmission safe harbor in the DMCA if they had control of the network with a server br Gnutella eDonkey and Freenet were released in as MP com and Napster were facing litigation Gnutella released in March was the first decentralized file sharing network In the Gnutella network all connecting software was considered equal and therefore the network had no central point of failure In July Freenet was released and became the first anonymity network In September the eDonkey client and server software was released br In March Kazaa was released Its FastTrack network was distributed though unlike Gnutella it assigned more traffic to supernodes to increase routing efficiency The network was proprietary and encrypted and the Kazaa team made substantial efforts to keep other clients such as Morpheus off of the FastTrack network In October the MPAA and the RIAA filed a lawsuit against the developers of Kazaa Morpheus and Grokster that would lead to the US Supreme Court s MGM Studios Inc v Grokster Ltd decision in br Shortly after its loss in court Napster was shut down to comply with a court order This drove users to other P P applications and file sharing continued its growth The Audiogalaxy Satellite client grew in popularity and the LimeWire client and BitTorrent protocol were released Until its decline in Kazaa was the most popular file sharing program despite bundled malware and legal battles in the Netherlands Australia and the United States In a Tokyo district court ruling shut down File Rogue and the Recording Industry Association of America RIAA filed a lawsuit that effectively shut down Audiogalaxy br br From through a number of BitTorrent services were established including Suprnova org isoHunt TorrentSpy and The Pirate Bay In September the RIAA began filing lawsuits against users of P P file sharing networks such as Kazaa As a result of such lawsuits many universities added file sharing regulations in their school administrative codes though some students managed to circumvent them during after school hours Also in the MPAA started to take action against BitTorrent sites leading to the shutdown of Torrentse and Sharelive in July With the shutdown of eDonkey in eMule became the dominant client of the eDonkey network In police raids took down the Razorback eDonkey server and temporarily took down The Pirate Bay br The File Sharing Act was launched by Chairman Towns in this act prohibited the use of applications that allowed individuals to share federal information amongst one another On the other hand only specific file sharing applications were made available to federal computers the United States Congress House In the Pirate Bay trial ended in a guilty verdict for the primary founders of the tracker The decision was appealed leading to a second guilty verdict in November In October Limewire was forced to shut down following a court order in Arista Records LLC v Lime Group LLC but the Gnutella network remains active through open source clients like FrostWire and gtk gnutella Furthermore multi protocol file sharing software such as MLDonkey and Shareaza adapted to support all the major file sharing protocols so users no longer had to install and configure multiple file sharing programs br On January the United States Department of Justice shut down the popular domain of Megaupload established The file sharing site has claimed to have over people a day Kim Dotcom formerly Kim Schmitz was arrested with three associates in New Zealand on January and is awaiting extradition The case involving the downfall of the world s largest and most popular file sharing site was not well received with hacker group Anonymous bringing down several sites associated with the take down In the following days other file sharing sites began to cease services FileSonic blocked public downloads on January with Fileserve following suit on January br In a European Citizens Initiative Freedom to Share started collecting signatures in order to get the European Commission to discuss and eventually make rules on this subject which is controversial br br br Techniques used for video sharing br From the early s until the mid s online video streaming was usually based on the Adobe Flash Player After more and more vulnerabilities in Adobe s flash became known YouTube switched to HTML based video playback in January br br br Types br br br Peer to peer file sharing br Peer to peer file sharing is based on the peer to peer P P application architecture Shared files on the computers of other users are indexed on directory servers P P technology was used by popular services like Napster and LimeWire The most popular protocol for P P sharing is BitTorrent br br br File sync and sharing services br br Cloud based file syncing and sharing services implement automated file transfers by updating files from a dedicated sharing directory on each user s networked devices Files placed in this folder also are typically accessible through a website and mobile app and can be easily shared with other users for viewing or collaboration Such services have become popular via consumer oriented file hosting services such as Dropbox and Google Drive With the rising need of sharing big files online easily new open access sharing platforms have appeared adding even more services to their core business cloud storage multi device synchronization online collaboration such as ShareFile Tresorit WeTransfer or Hightail br rsync is a more traditional program released in which synchronizes files on a direct machine to machine basis br Data synchronization in general can use other approaches to share files such as distributed file systems version control or mirrors br br br Academic file sharing br In addition to file sharing for the purposes of entertainment academic file sharing has become a topic of increasing concern as it is deemed to be a violation of academic integrity at many schools Academic file sharing by companies such as Chegg and Course Hero has become a point of particular controversy in recent years This has led some institutions to provide explicit guidance to students and faculty regarding academic integrity expectations relating to academic file sharing br br br Public opinion of file sharing br In there were an estimated million people participating in online file sharing According to a CBS News poll in of Americans who follow the file sharing issue considered it acceptable if a person owns the music CD and shares it with a limited number of friends and acquaintances with to year olds this percentage reached as much as br In his survey of file sharing culture Caraway noted that of participants believed musicians should accept file sharing as a means for promotion and distribution This file sharing culture was termed as cyber socialism whose legalisation was not the expected cyber utopia br br br Economic impact br According to David Glenn writing in The Chronicle of Higher Education A majority of economic studies have concluded that file sharing hurts sales A literature review by Professor Peter Tschmuck found independent studies on the effects of music file sharing Of these studies roughly two thirds conclude that unauthorized downloads have a negative or even highly negative impact on recorded music sales Three of the studies found no significant impact while the remaining five found a positive impact br A study by economists Felix Oberholzer Gee and Koleman Strumpf in concluded that music file sharing s effect on sales was statistically indistinguishable from zero This research was disputed by other economists most notably Stan Liebowitz who said Oberholzer Gee and Strumpf had made multiple assumptions about the music industry that are just not correct In June Billboard reported that Oberholzer Gee and Strumpf had changed their minds now finding no more than of the recent decline in sales is due to sharing However citing Nielsen SoundScan as their source the co authors maintained that illegal downloading had not deterred people from being original In many creative industries monetary incentives play a reduced role in motivating authors to remain creative Data on the supply of new works are consistent with the argument that file sharing did not discourage authors and publishers Since the advent of file sharing the production of music books and movies has increased sharply Glenn Peoples of Billboard disputed the underlying data saying SoundScan s number for new releases in any given year represents new commercial titles not necessarily new creative works The RIAA likewise responded that new releases and new creative works are two separate things T his figure includes re releases new compilations of existing songs and new digital only versions of catalog albums SoundScan has also steadily increased the number of retailers especially non traditional retailers in their sample over the years better capturing the number of new releases brought to market What Oberholzer and Strumpf found was better ability to track new album releases not greater incentive to create them br A study prepared by Birgitte Andersen and Marion Frenz published by Industry Canada was unable to discover any direct relationship between P P file sharing and CD purchases in Canada The results of this survey were similarly criticized by academics and a subsequent revaluation of the same data by George R Barker of the Australian National University reached the opposite conclusion In total of P P downloaders responded that if P P were not available they would have purchased either through paid sites only CDs only or through CDs and pay sites Only of people say they would not have bought the music if it were not available on P P for free Barker thus concludes This clearly suggests P P network availability is reducing music demand of of music downloaders which is quite contrary to Andersen and Frenz s much published claim br According to the paper Estimating displacement rates of copyrighted content in the EU by the European Commission illegal usage increases game sales stating The overall conclusion is that for games illegal online transactions induce more legal transactions br br br Market dominance br A paper in the journal Management Science found that file sharing decreased the chance of survival for low ranked albums on music charts and increased exposure to albums that were ranked high on the music charts allowing popular and well known artists to remain on the music charts more often This hurt new and less known artists while promoting the work of already popular artists and celebrities br A more recent study that examined pre release file sharing of music albums using BitTorrent software also discovered positive impacts for established and popular artists but not newer and smaller artists According to Robert G Hammond of North Carolina State University an album that leaked one month early would see a modest increase in sales This increase in sales is small relative to other factors that have been found to affect album sales br br File sharing proponents commonly argue that file sharing democratizes music consumption by levelling the playing field for new small artists relative to established popular artists by allowing artists to have their work heard by a wider audience lessening the advantage held by established popular artists in terms of promotional and other support My results suggest that the opposite is happening which is consistent with evidence on file sharing behaviour br Billboard cautioned that this research looked only at the pre release period and not continuous file sharing following a release date The problem in believing piracy helps sales is deciding where to draw the line between legal and illegal Implicit in the study is the fact that both buyers and sellers are required in order for pre release file sharing to have a positive impact on album sales Without iTunes Amazon and Best Buy file sharers would be just file sharers rather than purchasers If you carry out the file sharing should be legal argument to its logical conclusion today s retailers will be tomorrow s file sharing services that integrate with their respective cloud storage services br br br Availability br Many argue that file sharing has forced the owners of entertainment content to make it more widely available legally through fees or advertising on demand on the internet In a report by Sandvine showed that Netflix traffic had come to surpass that of BitTorrent br br br Copyright issues br br File sharing raises copyright issues and has led to many lawsuits In the United States some of these lawsuits have even reached the Supreme Court For example in MGM v Grokster the Supreme Court ruled that the creators of P P networks can be held liable if their software is marketed as a tool for copyright infringement br On the other hand not all file sharing is illegal Content in the public domain can be freely shared Even works covered by copyright can be shared under certain circumstances For example some artists publishers and record labels grant the public a license for unlimited distribution of certain works sometimes with conditions and they advocate free content and file sharing as a promotional tool br br br See also br br Comparison of file sharing
