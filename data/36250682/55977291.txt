The Facebook Aquila is an experimental solar powered drone developed by Facebook for use as an atmospheric satellite intended to act as relay stations for providing internet access to remote areas br The Aquila first flew on June with a second aircraft successfully flying in Internal development of the Aquila aircraft was stopped in June br br br Development br Aquila was developed by Facebook s Connectivity Lab The prototype airframe design and construction was led by Ascenta a Somerset England based company acquired by Facebook in br Several scale models of the Aquila were built and flown to prove the concept prior to the full scale prototype being built br Following construction at Ascenta s factory in Bridgwater England the Aquila prototype was disassembled and shipped to Arizona where it was first flown on June The minute flight was considered successful However during landing the aircraft touched down short of the intended landing zone and was damaged the National Transportation Safety Board conducted an investigation into the accident as the drone suffered a structural failure just before touching down The aircraft was designed such that a production version would be able to support continuous flight in the stratosphere for days br Following the crash the prototype Aquila was modified with spoilers provision for feathering the propellers and refinement of the exterior surface of the aircraft the second flight took place on May with the one hour minute flight being considered successful br In November a partnership with Airbus was announced to further development of the Aquila and the high altitude platform station broadband connectivity system HAPS project br The same month it was announced that Aquila would be displayed at the Victoria and Albert Museum s spring The Future Starts here exhibition in br In June as aerospace manufacturers start designing and building HAPS Facebook decided to stop its program to work with partners like Airbus on HAPS connectivity and their technologies like flight control and high density batteries In it was reported that Facebook and Airbus have scheduled test flights in Australia using the latter s Zephyr drone technology Zephyr share the same blueprint with Aquila as it also uses solar power br br br Design br The drone has a wingspan roughly the same as a Boeing but weighs only pounds kg Aquila is of flying wing configuration the upper surface of the wing being covered in solar cells to power the aircraft s four electric motors batteries composing half the aircraft s weight provide power storage for night flight Aquila is claimed to use the same amount of power as three blow dryers While the prototype used a launch trolley to become airborne production Aquilas are intended to be launched using helium balloons carrying the aircraft to their operational height and releasing them landings would take place on grassy surfaces br Aquila is intended to fly at altitudes of up to feet m during the day dropping to feet m at night with an endurance of up to three months providing Internet service to a miles km radius area below its flight path if communications spectrum was assigned for the project it would allow the of Earth s surface that has poor or no internet access to be connected The technology which used high bandwidth lasers to beam the Internet to remote locations was intended to provide access to billion users particularly in sub Saharan Africa br br br Specifications br Data from Collated from sources in the text above General characteristics br Crew None br Wingspan ft m br Gross weight lb kg br Performance br br Service ceiling ft m br br br See also br Project Loon br br Aircraft of comparable role configuration and era br br NASA Pathfinder First flew in June br NASA Centurion First flight November br NASA AeroVironment Helios Prototype First flight September br QinetiQ Airbus Zephyr First flight in br SoftBank AeroVironment HAPSMobile First flight September br BAE Systems PHASA First flight February br br Related lists br br List of electric aircraft br br br br br br External links br The technology behind Aquila Facebook com
