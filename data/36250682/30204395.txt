title: Reblogging
id: 30204395
Reblogging or in Twitter parlance reposting and formerly retweeting is the mechanism in blogging which allows users to repost the content of another user s post with an indication that the source of the post is another user br It was first developed by Jonah Peretti at Eyebeam Art and Technology Center s R D program under the project Reblog from where the term originates as an open source tool for individually run blogs Tumblr then built it into their social network for re sharing posts within the network and similar features Retweet on Twitter Share on Facebook then followed br For a number of microblogging and social networking services reblogging has become a means of both social bookmarking and user commentary unlike social news services like Digg Slashdot and Reddit however reblogging typically does not involve a centralized front page to which the highest ranked post is appended br Reblogging and the increased attention paid to the indexing and encouragement of reblogging has become a major feature of many social networking sites and content hosting services and it has also become a potent means of secondary content promotion and audience measurement whereby links to external content are syndicated across multiple profiles and the reposts are indexed as a measurement of currency and relevance br br br History and comparison br A historical precedent to reblogging is the viral nature of e mail as Internet petitions and chain e mails which encouraged e mail users to resend the e mail to at least a minimum number of contacts on one s contact list were highly popular and highly controversial in the s and s With the rise of the World Wide Web it was not uncommon for webmasters including major news service websites to encourage readers of a post to share a link to the post with others on one s contact list Only in the mid s was the share via e mail solicitation accompanied or replaced by branded sharing buttons from various social news or bookmarking services at the time giving bloggers and news services a seemingly more accurate metric for readership and traffic than ever before the issue of user moderation however gave bloggers and news services pause due to both real and alleged competition in moderation ranking of shared front page posts With the rise of micro blogging in the latter s however user moderation on front pages was de emphasized as a feature in favor of reblogs on user profiles which were usually taken by bloggers and news services as automatic endorsement of an original linked post s currency if not popular favor br br br Reblog br Reblog was an open source tool made at Eyebeam Art and Technology Center s R D program a team led by Jonah Peretti along with Michael Frumin Michael Migurski Alexander R Galloway and Boris Anthony Reblog was an open source tool for individually run blogs with many early new media artists and bloggers using the tool to share content from one blog on another br br br Tumblr br In Tumblr a blogging service and network launched It is profile driven and hierarchical in its facilitation of reblogs An original post by one Tumblr user is reblogged by another user by embedding a quote of the original post link and publishing username in the repost with the option of making a comment in reply to the previous post br A feature of this method that distinguishes Tumblr from Twitter is that less emphasis is placed upon reblogging only the original post resulting in often highly stacked semi threaded conversations which are indexed and interpreted by the Tumblr server in the presented manner While Twitter s character limit allows for little to no personal response a Tumblr reblog allows for an endless amount of interpretations of the subject matter As a result posts to Tumblr are typically shown less as typical blog posts as offered by most major blog providers and more as a blend of both Internet forum and blog features Another difference between the two platforms is that Tumblr reblogs are more often visual while Twitter is more message based br br br Twitter br On Twitter another micro blogging service the retweet phenomenon began in March whereby an informal protocol slowly developed among Twitter users Initially called an echo the first instance was by Narendra Rocherolle A month later the term retweet was first referenced In this protocol a post by User A which was considered notable by another Twitter user User B was copied by User B and reposted under User B s account and prefixed with RT username with RT meaning retweet The at sign had previously been developed as a means of replying to Twitter posts while the hashtag protocol would later be developed by users within the same year to highlight important keywords which they wished to be indexed in a search engine br In the retweet phenomenon would experience a major uptick in adoption by Twitter users in order to forward SMS posts by Iranian observers and participants in the events following the Iranian presidential election In August Twitter officially began integrating the retweet mechanism by replacing the string RT username with a retweet symbol emulating Tumblr s reblog symbol in addition retweet buttons were added to all Twitter posts alongside reply and by August an official Tweet button was developed and launched by Twitter for external websites with Twitter based application developer TweetMeme agreeing with Twitter to integrate the functionality of its own then popular button into Twitter s official button In April the quote retweet also known as Quote RTs or QRT was introduced with users able to retweet a post with their own commentary added above the original content In August a Quote Tweets link was added under posts to allow users to see other users quote retweets br Tweetmeme Topsy and a few other external third party websites provide indexes of currently trending posts hashtags users and lists utilizing the Retweet protocol As such Twitter is a powerful flowing social medium that disseminates instant news through an array of social media networks The Twitter platform is a broadcasting service and a social network of open access of media through subscriptions by request or follow br br br Facebook br Facebook while not promoting itself as a social bookmarking social news or micro blogging service eventually also began allowing users to share links to and comments on external webpages to their walls and notably to re share posts from other users walls with a single click of an attached Share link reblog style In addition buttons for publishers to automatically share their posts on Facebook and index the current number of user links to the linked post are available br br br Analysis br br With the growing popularity of reblogging or re syndication in the latter s and early s a number of analyses have been offered on the functionality and value of the practice Data scientists have shown that retweeting cascades play an important role in the spread of misinformation online Chris Wetherell creator of retweets for Twitter described what he saw as negative consequences of retweets stating We might have just handed a year old a loaded weapon Andy Baio found that about two thirds of the Gamergate harassment campaign tweets during a hour period that he studied were retweets Jason Goldman from Twitter described quote retweets as the riskiest form of retweet stating Quote retweet allows for the dunk It s the dunk mechanism br Linguists and philosophers have studied the communicative value of retweets if as the popular motto goes a retweet is not an endorsement what is the meaning of a retweet The predominant view is that retweeting is like pointing at someone else s post i e directing attention to it or inviting one s audience to pay attention to it RT is a popular acronym on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter meaning Regards To and Re Tweet
