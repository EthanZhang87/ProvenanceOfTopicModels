Wire is an encrypted communication and collaboration app created by Wire Swiss It is available for iOS Android Windows macOS Linux and web browsers such as Firefox Wire offers a collaboration suite featuring messenger voice calls video calls conference calls file sharing and external collaboration all protected by a secure end to end encryption Wire offers three solutions built on its security technology Wire Pro which offers Wire s collaboration feature for businesses Wire Enterprise includes Wire Pro capabilities with added features for large scale or regulated organizations and Wire Red the on demand crisis collaboration suite They also offer Wire Personal which is a secure messaging app for personal use br br br History br Skype s co founder Janus Friis helped create Wire and many Wire employees previously worked for Skype Wire Swiss GmbH launched the Wire app on December In August the company added group calling to their app From its launch until March Wire s messages were only encrypted between the client and the company s server In March the company added end to end encryption for its messaging traffic as well as a video calling feature Wire Swiss GmbH released the source code of the Wire client applications in July In Wire launched its collaboration solution featuring end to end encrypted chat conferencing video calls and file sharing on desktop and mobile for businesses br br br Features br Wire offers end to end encrypted messaging file sharing video and voice calls and guest rooms for external communication br The app allows group calling with up to twenty five participants and video conferences support up to people A stereo feature places participants in a virtual space so that users can differentiate voice directionality The application adapts to varying network conditions br The application supports the exchange of animated GIFs up to MB through a media integration with Giphy The iOS and Android versions also include a sketch feature that allows users to draw a sketch into a conversation or over a photo br Wire is available on mobile desktop and web The web service is called Wire for Web Wire activity is synced on iOS Android and web apps The desktop version supports screen sharing br Wire s technology solution can be deployed either in the cloud private cloud or on premises br One of the latest features rolled out by Wire is a secure external collaboration capability called guest room Wire s secure guest rooms feature extends end to end encryption to conversations with external parties without requiring them to register or even download anything br Wire also includes a function for ephemeral messaging in and group conversations br br br Technical br Wire provides end to end encryption for all features Wire s instant messages are encrypted with Proteus a protocol that Wire Swiss developed based on the Signal Protocol Wire s voice calls are encrypted with DTLS and SRTP In addition to this client server communication is protected by Transport Layer Security br Wire is currently in the midst of working to develop Messaging Layer Security MLS a new protocol designed to facilitate more secure enterprise messaging platforms under The Internet Engineering Task Force IETF In during the IETF meeting in Berlin Wire proposed a standard that was protected by modern security properties and could be used by companies large and small During an interview with Dark Reading Raphael Robert Head of Security at Wire mentioned that Messaging Layer Security MLS should be ready to integrate into messaging platforms by br Wire s source code is accompanied by the GPLv but the readme file states that a number of additional restrictions specified by the Wire Terms of Use take precedence Among other things users who have compiled their own applications may not change the way it connects and interacts with the company s centralised servers br br br Security br Wire implemented a security by design approach with security and privacy as core values Wire is open source with its source code available on GitHub independently audited and ISO CCPA GDPR SOX compliant br In December Wire s whitepapers were reviewed by a security researcher at the University of Waterloo The researcher praised Wire for its open approach to security but identified serious issues that still need addressing These included a man in the middle attack on voice and video communications possible audio and video leakage depending on unspecified codec parameters the fact that all user passwords are uploaded to Wire s servers significant attack surface for code replacement in the desktop client and the fact that the server was not open sourced at the time when that article was written The researcher described the security of Wire as weak in comparison to Signal but also depicted its problems as surmountable Wire s developers announced the addition of end to end authentication to Wire s calls on March and started open sourcing Wire s server code on April In March the review was updated with the conclusion that the remaining issues with Wire are relatively minor and also affect many of its competitors However one major issue that remained was detailed as the Wire client authenticates with a central server in order to provide user presence information Wire does not attempt to hide metadata other than the central server promising not to log very much information The Wire whitepapers spend an unusual amount of space discussing the engineering details of this part of the protocol However the method of authentication is the same as it is on the web the Wire client sends the unencrypted unhashed password to the central server over TLS the server hashes the plaintext password with scrypt and the hash is compared to the hash stored by the server This process leaks the user s password to the central server the server operators or anyone who compromises the server could log all of the plaintext passwords as users authenticate br On February Kudelski Security and X D Sec published a joint review of Wire s encrypted messaging protocol implementation Non critical issues were found that had the potential of leading to a degraded security level The review found that invalid public keys could be transmitted and processed without raising an error The report also recommended that other security improvements be implemented to address thread unsafety risks and sensitive data in memory Wire s developers have said that the issues that were discovered during the review have been fixed and deployed on iOS and Android Deployment is ongoing for Wire for Web and desktop apps br In Wire published an article going over the implementation of its end to end encryption in a multi device scenario in response to anonymous accounts on social media publishing misleading information about the app and its security br In May Motherboard published an article saying that the Wire servers keep a list of all the users a customer contacted until they delete their account Wire Swiss confirmed that the statement was accurate saying that they keep the data in order to help with syncing conversations across multiple devices and that they might change their approach in the future br br br Awards br In July Wire won Capterra s Best Ease of Use award in the team communication software category for its B B solution Later that year in October Wire was recognized by Cybersecurity Breakthrough Awards as the first ever Secure Communications Solution of the Year awardee In February Wire won the Cybersecurity Excellence Awards in the following categories fastest growing cybersecurity company best start up EU open source security encryption and zero trust security Simultaneously Cyber Defense Magazine announced Wire as the Best Messaging Security in an RSA special edition for the Cyber Defense Awards br br br Privacy policy changes br In late Wire holding moved from Luxembourg to the US which according to critics made it unclear how much jurisdiction the United States will have over Wire data The Wire Group Holding moved back to Germany as of br br br Business model br Wire Swiss GmbH receives financial backing from a firm called Iconical br In July Wire Swiss announced the beta version of an end to end encrypted team messaging platform In October Wire officially released the team messaging platform as a subscription based communication solution for businesses and in announced that Ernst Young chose Wire to develop a self hosted secure
