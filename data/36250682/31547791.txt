The Open Compute Project OCP is an organization that facilitates the sharing of data center product designs and industry best practices among companies Founded in OCP has significantly influenced the design and operation of large scale computing facilities worldwide br As of July over companies across the world are members of OCP including Arm Meta IBM Wiwynn Intel Nokia Google Microsoft Seagate Technology Dell Rackspace Hewlett Packard Enterprise NVIDIA Cisco Goldman Sachs Fidelity Lenovo and Alibaba Group br br br Structure br br The Open Compute Project Foundation is a c non profit incorporated in the state of Delaware United States OCP has multiple committees including the board of directors advisory board and steering committee to govern its operations br As of July there are seven members who serve on the board of directors which is made up of one individual member and six organizational members Mark Roenigk Facebook is the Foundation s president and chairman Andy Bechtolsheim is the individual member In addition to Mark Roenigk who represents Facebook other organizations on the Open Compute board of directors include Intel Rebecca Weekly Microsoft Kushagra Vaid Google Partha Ranganathan and Rackspace Jim Hawkins br A current list of members can be found on the opencompute org website br br br History br The Open Compute Project began in Facebook as an internal project in called Project Freedom The hardware designs and engineering team were led by Amir Michael Manager Hardware Design and sponsored by Jonathan Heiliger VP Technical Operations and Frank Frankovsky Director Hardware Design and Infrastructure The three would later open source the designs of Project Freedom and co found the Open Compute Project The project was announced at a press event at Facebook s headquarters in Palo Alto on April br br br OCP projects br The Open Compute Project Foundation maintains a number of OCP projects such as br br br Server designs br Two years after the Open Compute Project had started with regards to a more modular server design it was admitted that the new design is still a long way from live data centers However some aspects published were used in Facebook s Prineville data center to improve energy efficiency as measured by the power usage effectiveness index defined by The Green Grid br Efforts to advance server compute node designs included one for Intel processors and one for AMD processors In Calxeda contributed a design with ARM architecture processors Since then several generations of OCP server designs have been deployed Wildcat Intel Spitfire AMD Windmill Intel E Watermark AMD Winterfell Intel E v and Leopard Intel E v br br br OCP Accelerator Module br OCP Accelerator Module OAM is a design specification for hardware architectures that implement artificial intelligence systems that require high module to module bandwidth br OAM is used in some of AMD s Instinct accelerator modules br br br Data storage br Open Vault storage building blocks offer high disk densities with drives in a U Open Rack chassis designed for easy disk drive replacement The inch disks are stored in two drawers five across and three deep in each drawer with connections via serial attached SCSI This storage is also called Knox and there is also a cold storage variant where idle disks power down to reduce energy consumption Another design concept was contributed by Hyve Solutions a division of Synnex in At the OCP Summit Facebook together with Taiwanese ODM Wistron s spin off Wiwynn introduced Lightning a flexible NVMe JBOF just a bunch of flash based on the existing Open Vault Knox design br br br Rack designs br The designs for a mechanical mounting system have been published so that open racks have the same outside width mm and depth as standard inch racks but are designed to mount wider chassis with a mm width inches This allows more equipment to fit in the same volume and improves air flow Compute chassis sizes are defined in multiples of an OpenU which is mm slightly taller than the typical mm rack unit br br br Energy efficient data centers br The OCP has published data center designs for energy efficiency These include power distribution at VAC which eliminates one transformer stage in typical data centers a single voltage VDC power supply designed to work with VAC input and VDC battery backup br br br Open networking switches br br On May an effort to define an open network switch was announced The plan was to allow Facebook to load its own operating system software onto the switch Press reports predicted that more expensive and higher performance switches would continue to be popular while less expensive products treated more like a commodity using the buzzword top of rack might adopt the proposal br The first attempt at an open networking switch by Facebook was designed together with Taiwanese ODM Accton using Broadcom Trident II chip and is called Wedge the Linux OS that it runs is called FBOSS Later switch contributions include pack and Wedge based on Broadcom Tomahawk chips Similar switch hardware designs have been contributed by Edgecore Networks Corporation Accton spin off Mellanox Technologies Interface Masters Technologies Agema Systems Capable of running Open Network Install Environment ONIE compatible network operating systems such as Cumulus Linux Switch Light OS by Big Switch Networks or PICOS by Pica A similar project for a custom switch for the Google platform had been rumored and evolved to use the OpenFlow protocol br br br Servers br Sub project for Mezzanine NIC OCP NIC specification v was released in late establishing form factors SFF TSFF and LFF br br br Litigation br In March BladeRoom Group Limited and Bripco UK Limited sued Facebook Emerson Electric Co and others alleging that Facebook has disclosed BladeRoom and Bripco s trade secrets for prefabricated data centers in the Open Compute Project Facebook petitioned for the lawsuit to be dismissed but this was rejected in A confidential mid trial settlement was agreed in April br br br See also br List of open source hardware projects br Telecom Infra
