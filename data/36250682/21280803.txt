title: Scribe (log server)
id: 21280803
Scribe was a server for aggregating log data streamed in real time from many servers It was designed to be scalable extensible without client side modification and robust to failure of the network or any specific machine br Scribe was developed at Facebook and released in as open source br Scribe servers are arranged in a directed graph with each server knowing only about the next server in the graph This network topology allows for adding extra layers of fan in as a system grows and batching messages before sending them between datacenters without having any code that explicitly needs to understand datacenter topology only a simple configuration br Scribe was designed to consider reliability but to not require heavyweight protocols and expansive disk usage Scribe spools data to disk on any node to handle intermittent connectivity node failure but doesn t sync a log file for every message This creates a possibility of a small amount of data loss in the event of a crash or catastrophic hardware failure However this degree of reliability is often suitable for most Facebook use cases br br br See also br br Apache Flume br Fluentd Log Everything in JSON br Enabling Facebook s Log Infrastructure with Fluentd br br br Notes and references br br br External links br Open Source Facebook Developers br The real value of Scribe for open source br Scribe project on GitHub
