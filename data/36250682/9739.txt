An emoticon MOH t kon rarely ih MOTT ih kon short for emotion icon is a pictorial representation of a facial expression using characters usually punctuation marks numbers and letters to express a person s feelings mood or reaction without needing to describe it in detail br The first ASCII emoticons are generally credited to computer scientist Scott Fahlman who proposed what came to be known as smileys and in a message on the bulletin board system BBS of Carnegie Mellon University in br In Western countries emoticons are usually written at a right angle to the direction of the text Users from Japan popularized a kind of emoticon called kaomoji utilizing the larger character sets required for Japanese that can be understood without tilting one s head to the left This style arose on ASCII NET of Japan in Regardless of the character set used they are also known as verticons from vertical icon br As SMS mobile text messaging and the Internet became widespread in the late s emoticons became increasingly popular and were commonly used in texting Internet forums and e mails Emoticons have played a significant role in communication through technology and some devices and applications have provided stylized pictures that do not use text punctuation They offer another range of tone and feeling through texting that portrays specific emotions through facial gestures while in the midst of text based cyber communication Emoticons were the precursors to modern emojis which have been in a state of continuous development for a variety of digital platforms Today over of the world s online population uses emojis or emoticons br br br History br br br Different uses of text characters pre br br Modern emoticons were not the first instances of or being used in text In poet Robert Herrick wrote Tumble me down and I will sit Upon my ruins smiling yet Herrick s work predated any other recorded use of brackets as a smiling face by around years However experts doubted the inclusion of the colon in the poem was deliberate and if it was meant to represent a smiling face English professor Alan Jacobs argued that punctuation in general was unsettled in the seventeenth century Herrick was unlikely to have consistent punctuational practices himself and even if he did he couldn t expect either his printers or his readers to share them Indeed th century typography practice often placed colons and semicolons within parentheses including instances of in Richard Baxter s Plain Scripture Proof of Infants Church membership and Baptism br Precursors to modern emoticons have existed since the th century br The National Telegraphic Review and Operators Guide in April documented the use of the number in Morse code to express love and kisses later reduced to the more formal best regards Dodge s Manual in documented the reintroduction of love and kisses as the number New Zealand academics Joan Gajadhar and John Green comment that both Morse code abbreviations are more succinct than modern abbreviations such as LOL br br The transcript of one of Abraham Lincoln s speeches in recorded the audience s reaction as applause and laughter br There has been some debate whether the glyph in Lincoln s speech was a typo a legitimate punctuation construct or the first emoticon br Linguist Philip Seargeant argues that it was a simple typesetting error br br Before March the examples of typographical art appeared in at least three newspaper articles including Kurjer warszawski published in Warsaw from March using punctuation to represent the emotions of joy melancholy indifference and astonishment br br In a essay titled For Brevity and Clarity American author Ambrose Bierce suggested facetiously that a bracket could be used to represent a smiling face proposing an improvement in punctuation with which writers could convey cachinnation loud or immoderate laughter it is written thus and presents a smiling mouth It is to be appended with the full stop to every jocular or ironical sentence br In a Harvard Lampoon article writer Alan Gregg proposed combining brackets with various other punctuation marks to represent various moods Brackets were used for the sides of the mouth or cheeks with other punctuation used between the brackets to display various emotions for a smile showing more teeth for laughter for a frown and for a wink br An instance of text characters representing a sideways smiling and frowning face could be found in the New York Herald Tribune on March promoting the film Lili starring Leslie Caron br The September issue of MAD magazine included an article titled Typewri toons The piece featuring typewriter generated artwork credited to Royal Portable was entirely made up of repurposed typography including a capital letter P having a bigger bust than a capital I a lowercase b and d discussing their pregnancies an asterisk on top of a letter to indicate the letter had just come inside from snowfall and a classroom of lowercase n s interrupted by a lowercase h raising its hand br A further example attributed to a Baltimore Sunday Sun columnist appeared in a article in Reader s Digest using a dash and right bracket to represent a tongue in one s cheek br Prefiguring the modern smiley emoticon writer Vladimir Nabokov told an interviewer from The New York Times in I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile some sort of concave mark a supine round bracket which I would now like to trace in reply to your question br In the s the PLATO IV computer system was launched It was one of the first computers used throughout educational and professional institutions but rarely used in a residential setting On the computer system a student at the University of Illinois developed pictograms that resembled different smiling faces Mary Kalantzis and Bill Cope stated this likely took place in and they claimed these to be the first emoticons The student s creations likely cover multiple timelines the creation of computer icons digital pictograms and emoticons Since the pictograms were not focused on offering a means to communicate they are not generally considered important in the history of the emoticon br br br ASCII emoticons use in digital communication mid s br Carnegie Mellon computer scientist Scott Fahlman is generally credited with the invention of the digital text based emoticon in br Carnegie Mellon s bulletin board system BBS was a forum used by students and teachers for discussing a variety of topics where jokes often created misunderstandings br As a response to the difficulty of conveying humor or sarcasm in plain text Fahlman proposed colon hyphen right bracket as a label for attempted humor br The use of ASCII symbols a standard set of codes representing typographical marks was essential to allow the symbols to be displayed on any computer br Fahlman sent the following message after an incident where a humorous warning about a mercury spill in an elevator was misunderstood as serious br br Sep Scott E Fahlman br From Scott E Fahlman Fahlman at Cmu c br br I propose that the following character sequence for joke markers br br br br Read it sideways Actually it is probably more economical to mark br things that are NOT jokes given current trends For this use br br br br Other suggestions on the forum included an asterisk and an ampersand the latter meant to represent a person doubled over in laughter as well as a percent sign and a pound sign br Within a few months the smiley had spread to the ARPANET and Usenet br Many of those that pre dated Fahlman either drew faces using alphabetic symbols or created digital pictograms Scott Fahlman took it a step further by suggesting that not only could his emoticon communication emotion but also replace language Using the emoticons as a form of communication is why Fahlman is seen as the creator of emoticons vs other earlier claims br Since the s emoticons colon hyphen and bracket have become integral to digital communications and have inspired a variety of other emoticons including the winking face using a semicolon the surprised face with a letter o in place of a bracket o and XD a visual representation of the Face with Tears of Joy emoji or the acronym LOL br In The Smiley Company was established by Nicolas Loufrani and his father Franklin as a way of commercializing the smiley trademark As part of this The Smiley Dictionary website focused on ASCII emoticons where a catalogue was made of them Hundreds of these basic designs had not been documented in one place such as Many other people did similar to Loufrani from onwards including David Sanderson creating the book Smileys in James Marshall also hosted an online collection of ASCII emoticons which he completed in Loufrani s catalogue sorted the ASCII emoticons into different categories with designs that were more widespread than just representing human emotion br A researcher at Stanford University surveyed the emoticons used in four million Twitter messages and found that the smiling emoticon without a hyphen nose was much more common than the original version with the hyphen Linguist Vyvyan Evans argues that this represents a shift in usage by younger users as a form of covert prestige rejecting a standard usage in order to demonstrate in group membership br br br Graphical emoticons and other developments s present br Loufrani went a step further than ASCII emoticons when he began to use the basic text designs and turned them into graphical representations Today they are known as graphical emoticons His designs based on a newly reinvented D Smiley logo were registered at the United States Copyright Office in and appeared online as gif files in For ASCII emoticons that did not exist to convert into graphical form Loufrani also backward engineered new ASCII emoticons from the graphical versions he created These were the first graphical representations of ASCII emoticons He published his Smiley icons as well as emoticons created by others along with their ASCII versions in an online Smiley Dictionary in This dictionary included different smiley icons and was published as a book called Dico Smileys in In British magazine The Drum referred to Loufrani as the godfather of the emoji for his work in the field br Fahlman has stated that he sees emojis as the remote descendants of this thing I did br On September it was announced that Scott Fahlman was holding an auction for the original emoticons he created in The auction was held in Dallas United States and sold the two designs as non fungible tokens NFT The online auction ended later that month with the originals selling for br In some programming languages certain operators are known informally by their emoticon like appearance This includes the Spaceship operator a comparison Diamond operator for type hinting and Elvis operator a shortened ternary operator br br br Styles br br br Western br Usually emoticons in Western style have the eyes on the left followed by the nose and the mouth The two character version which omits the nose is also very popular br The most basic emoticons are relatively consistent in form but each of them can be transformed by being rotated making them tiny ambigrams with or without a hyphen nose br There are also some possible variations to emoticons to get new definitions like changing a character to express a new feeling or slightly change the mood of the emoticon For example equals sad and equals very sad Weeping can be written as A blush can be expressed as Others include wink a grin D and smug and can be used to denote a flirting or joking tone or may be implying a second meaning in the sentence preceding it P such as when blowing a raspberry An often used combination is also for a heart and for a broken heart O is also sometimes used to depict shock is used to depict melancholy disappointment or disapproval is used to depict a neutral face br A broad grin is sometimes shown with crinkled eyes to express further amusement XD and the addition of further D letters can suggest laughter or extreme amusement e g XDDDD The same is true for X but the represents an animal s mouth There are other variations including for anger or D for an evil grin which can be again used in reverse for an unhappy angry face in the shape of br D K for vampire teeth s for grimace and P tongue out can be used to denote a flirting or joking tone or may be implying a second meaning in the sentence preceding it br As computers offer increasing built in support for non Western writing systems it has become possible to use other glyphs to build emoticons The shrug emoticon uses the glyph from the Japanese katakana writing system br An equal sign is often used for the eyes in place of the colon seen as without changing the meaning of the emoticon In these instances the hyphen is almost always either omitted or occasionally replaced with an o as in O In most circles it has become acceptable to omit the hyphen whether a colon or an equal sign is used for the eyes but in some areas of usage people still prefer the larger more traditional emoticon or One linguistic study has indicated that the use of a nose in an emoticon may be related to the user s age with younger people less likely to use a nose Similar looking characters are commonly substituted for one another for instance o O and can all be used interchangeably sometimes for subtly different effect or in some cases one type of character may look better in a certain font and therefore be preferred over another It is also common for the user to replace the rounded brackets used for the mouth with other similar brackets such as instead of br Some variants are also more common in certain countries due to keyboard layouts For example the smiley may occur in Scandinavia where the keys for and are placed right beside each other However the variant is without a doubt the dominant one in Scandinavia making the version a rarity Diacritical marks are sometimes used The letters and can be seen as an emoticon as the upright version of O meaning that one is surprised and D meaning that one is very happy respectively br Some emoticons may be read right to left instead and in fact can only be written using standard ASCII keyboard characters this way round for example D which refers to being shocked or anxious opposite to the large grin of D br In countries where the Cyrillic alphabet is used the right parenthesis is used as a smiley Multiple parentheses are used to express greater happiness amusement or laughter It is commonly placed at the end of a sentence replacing the full stop The colon is omitted due to being in a lesser known position on the keyboard layout br br br Kaomoji Japan ASCII movement br br Kaomoji are often seen as the Japanese development of emoticons that is separate to the Scott Fahlman movement which started in In a designer began to use brackets and other ASCII text characters to form faces br br Over time those designs became much more complex than western emoticons and so they are often differentiated from each other although both use ASCII characters Kaomoji also became focused around some Japanese industries such as anime br br br channel br Users of the Japanese discussion board channel in particular have developed a wide variety of unique emoticons using characters from various scripts such as Kannada as in for a look of disapproval disbelief or confusion Similarly the letter was used in emoticons to represent a monocle and to represent a tearing eye They were quickly picked up by chan and spread to other Western sites soon after Some have taken on a life of their own and become characters in their own right like Mon br br br Korean br In South Korea emoticons use Korean Hangul letters and the Western style is rarely used The structures of Korean and Japanese emoticons are somewhat similar but they have some differences Korean style contains Korean jamo letters instead of other characters There are countless number of emoticons that can be formed with such combinations of Korean jamo letters Consonant jamos or as the mouth nose component and or for the eyes For example and Faces such as and using quotation marks and apostrophes are also commonly used combinations Vowel jamos such as depict a crying face Example and same function as T in western style Sometimes not an em dash but a vowel jamo a comma or an underscore is added and the two character sets can be mixed together as in and Also semicolons and carets are commonly used in Korean emoticons semicolons mean sweating embarrassed If they are used with or they depict a bad feeling Examples and However and mean smile Others include a and br br br Chinese ideographic br br The character U E which means bright may be combined with posture emoticon Orz such as rz The character existed in Oracle bone script but was rarely used until its use as an emoticon documented as early as January br Other variants of include king queen with hat turtle and Bomberman br The character U D a variant of plum is used to represent double of dull or further magnitude of dullness In Chinese normally full characters as opposed to the stylistic use of might be duplicated to express emphasis br br br Posture emoticons br br br Orz br br Orz other forms include Or on OTZ OTL STO JTO no rz is an emoticon representing a kneeling or bowing person the Japanese version of which is called dogeza with the o being the head the r being the arms and part of the body and the z being part of the body and the legs This stick figure can represent respect or kowtowing but commonly appears along a range of responses including frustration despair sarcasm or grudging respect br It was first used in late at the forum on Techside a Japanese personal website At the Techside FAQ Forum TECHSIDE BBS BBS a poster asked about a cable cover typing to show a cable and its cover Others commented that it looked like a kneeling person and the symbol became popular These comments were soon deleted as they were considered off topic By Orz spawned a subculture blogs have been devoted to the emoticon and URL shortening services have been named after it In Taiwan Orz is associated with the phrase nice guy that is the concept of males being rejected for a date by females with a phrase like You are a nice guy br Orz should not be confused with m m which represents a standing bow directly towards the viewer as a means to say Thank you or as an apology br br br Multimedia variations br A portmanteau of emotion and sound an emotisound is a brief sound transmitted and played back during the viewing of a message typically an IM message or e mail message The sound is intended to communicate an emotional subtext Many instant messaging clients automatically trigger sound effects in response to specific emoticons br Some services such as MuzIcons combine emoticons and music player in an Adobe Flash based widget br In the Trillian chat application introduced a feature called emotiblips which allows Trillian users to stream files to their instant message recipients as the voice and video equivalent of an emoticon br In MTV and Paramount Home Entertainment promoted the emoticlip as a form of viral marketing for the second season of the show The Hills The emoticlips were twelve short snippets of dialogue from the show uploaded to YouTube which the advertisers hoped would be distributed between web users as a way of expressing feelings in a similar manner to emoticons The emoticlip concept is credited to the Bradley Montgomery advertising firm which hopes they would be widely adopted as greeting cards that just happen to be selling something br In an emotion sequence animation tool called FunIcons was created The Adobe Flash and Java based application allows users to create a short animation Users can then email or save their own animations to use them on similar social utility applications br During the first half of the s there have been different forms of small audiovisual pieces to be sent through instant messaging systems to express one s emotion These videos lack an established name and there are several ways to designate them emoticlips named above emotivideos or more recently emoticon videos These are tiny videos that can be easily transferred from one mobile phone to another Current video compression codecs such as H allow these pieces of video to be light in terms of file size and very portable The popular computer and mobile app Skype use these in a separate keyboard or by typing the code of the emoticon videos between parentheses br br br Emoticons and intellectual property rights br br In Despair Inc obtained a U S trademark registration for the frowny emoticon when used on greeting cards posters and art prints In they issued a satirical press release announcing that they would sue Internet users who typed the frowny the joke backfired and the company received a storm of protest when its mock release was posted on technology news website Slashdot br A number of patent applications have been filed on inventions that assist in communicating with emoticons A few of these have been issued as US patents US for example discloses a method developed in to send emoticons over a cell phone using a drop down menu The stated advantage over the prior art was that the user saved on the number of keystrokes though this may not address the obviousness criteria br The emoticon was also filed in and registered in as a European Community Trademark CTM In Finland the Supreme Administrative Court ruled in that the emoticon cannot be trademarked thus repealing a administrative decision trademarking the emoticons and br In a Russian court rejected a legal claim against Siemens by a man who claimed to hold a trademark on the emoticon br In Russian entrepreneur Oleg Teterin claimed to have been granted the trademark on the emoticon A license would not cost that much tens of thousands of dollars for companies but would be free of charge for individuals br br br Unicode br br A different but related use of the term emoticon is found in the Unicode Standard referring to a subset of emoji which display facial expressions The standard explains this usage with reference to existing systems which provided functionality for substituting certain textual emoticons with images or emoji of the expressions in question br Some smiley faces were present in Unicode since including a white frowning face a white smiling face and a black smiling face black refers to a glyph which is filled white refers to a glyph which is unfilled br br The Emoticons block was introduced in Unicode Standard version published in October and extended by It covers Unicode range from U F to U F F fully br br After that block had been filled Unicode and added additional emoticons in the range from U F to U F FF Currently U F C U F F U F F U F D U F F U F C U F F U F U F CF excluding U F C which contains the emoji and U F E U F FF do not contain any emoticons since Unicode br br For historic and compatibility reasons some other heads and figures which mostly represent different aspects like genders activities and professions instead of emotions are also found in Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs especially U F U F and Transport and Map Symbols Body parts mostly hands are also encoded in the
