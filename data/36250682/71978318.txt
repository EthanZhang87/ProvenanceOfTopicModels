integrated face and eye tracking and updated controllers with on board motion tracking br The Quest Pro received mixed reviews with critics praising its display and controllers but criticizing its mixed reality cameras for having a grainy appearance and limited usefulness in its software at launch and for its high price br br br Development br Prior to Facebook Connect in October during which Facebook Inc announced its rebranding as Meta to emphasize its development of metaverse related technologies CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CTO Andrew Bosworth posted photos of themselves testing prototype headsets which they stated to have Retina resolution displays alluding to the Apple Inc trademark for high resolution displays while leaked demo videos and references to an Oculus Pro headset were also discovered on the Oculus website and unreleased system software During the event Zuckerberg officially announced that the company was developing a headset codenamed Project Cambria as part of the Oculus Quest line of products which would be a high end product aimed at mixed reality applications and feature a slimmer design high resolution color passthrough cameras infrared depth sensors and eye tracking br The product was officially revealed as Meta Quest Pro during Connect in October for a release on October Zuckerberg told the media that the Quest Pro would target people who just want the highest end VR device enthusiast prosumer folks or people who are trying to get work done and would be sold in parallel with the Quest which is aimed primarily at the consumer market Bosworth stated that the Quest Pro would take existing experiences that people are having today in VR and make them better The planned depth sensor was dropped from the final hardware due to cost and weight concerns br br br Specifications br br br Hardware br The Quest Pro more closely resembles AR headsets such as Microsoft s HoloLens rather than other VR headsets with a thinner lens enclosure and a more visor like form factor that does not obscure the entirety of the user s peripheral vision peripheral blinders are included as an accessory with a full light blocker attachment sold separately The lenses can be adjusted for interpupillary distance and moved forwards and backwards It uses LCD quantum dot displays with a per eye resolution of viewed through pancake lenses that allow for its enclosure to be thinner in comparison to the Quest Meta stated that the displays supported a wider color gamut than the Quest and had improved contrast via local dimming The Quest Pro s battery is built into the back of its head strap for better weight distribution Meta rated it as lasting to hours on a single charge br For its mixed reality functions the Quest Pro uses high resolution color cameras as opposed to the lower resolution grayscale cameras on the Quest The headset also contains internal sensors that are used for eye and face tracking primarily for use with avatars The Quest Pro uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon XR system on chip with GB of RAM which Meta stated had more power than the Quest s Snapdragon XR br The Quest Pro uses Touch Pro controllers a significant update to the Oculus Touch controllers used by prior Quest and Rift products They have a more compact design with upgraded haptics and replace the infrared sensor ring which were tracked by the headset s cameras with on board motion tracking using embedded cameras and Qualcomm Snapdragon processors The controllers are also rechargeable via the headset s charging dock have a new pressure sensor for pinch gestures and have pressure sensitive stylus tip accessories that can be attached to the bottoms of their handles for drawing and writing The Quest Pro controllers are also sold separately as an accessory for Quest and newer br br br Software br The Quest Pro was demonstrated to the press with mixed reality versions of software such as Horizon Workrooms which allows users to attend meetings and control their computer remotely in VR with a virtual multi monitor environment the DJ software Tribe XR and Painting VR br Meta announced a partnership with Microsoft to integrate productivity services such as Microsoft Microsoft Teams and Windows with Meta Quest and Pro including allowing users to join Teams meetings via Horizon Workrooms use Microsoft applications as well as support for management of Quest devices via Intune br In December Valve Corporation released Steam Link for Meta Quest Quest Pro and Quest with OSC support for facial and eye tracking on Quest Pro br br br Reception br The Quest Pro received mixed reviews Ars Technica noted that its design felt less claustrophobic and much more secure and better balanced than previous Quest headsets especially during extended use but noting that its narrow field of view was more apparent when using the headset without its light blinder accessories Its display and lenses were described as being slightly sharper and having more legible text rendering than the Quest making it better suited for office tasks and using a remote desktop environment in Workrooms The MR cameras were panned for being grainy and fuzzy looking while many of the MR features in apps at launch were deemed to be novelties It was also criticized for requiring manual room setup rather than automatically mapping walls In conclusion it was felt that at its current asking price though we can only recommend the Quest Pro to mid level executives who have convinced their superiors to allocate a ridiculous money is no object budget to ill defined metaverse projects out of nothing more than a deep sense of FOMO br Adi Robertson of The Verge described the device as seemingly launched without plan or purpose highlighting VR s persistent drawbacks without making good use of its strengths and topped off with some irredeemably bad software The new controllers were praised for being more compact than the previous Oculus Touch design and offering a charging dock with rechargeable batteries albeit having less battery life than the previous controllers which used standard AA batteries The Quest Pro was criticized for having a uniquely tortuous strap system that felt worse when using the headset for extended sessions in comparison to the Quest with its Elite Strap accessory a grainy looking display and fuzzy passthrough visuals that doesn t look remotely like the real world and limited and idiosyncratic face tracking The Workrooms app was also criticized for being unreliable especially for software that was promoted as being one of the key selling points of the Quest Pro Robertson gave the Quest Pro a out of arguing that it offers technically innovative features without doing a good job of showcasing them and suggesting that mainstream users wait for an eventual Quest that may incorporate hardware improvements from the Pro at a lower price point br br br Sales br In March Meta lowered the price of Quest Pro to US amid reports of underwhelming sales br On July The Information reported that Meta was in the process of discontinuing production of the Quest Pro and had scrapped plans for a successor model br br br
