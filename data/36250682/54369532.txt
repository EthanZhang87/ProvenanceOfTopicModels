Facebook Stories are short user generated photo or video collections that can be uploaded to the user s Facebook Facebook Stories were created on March They are considered a second news feed for the social media website It is focused around Facebook s in app camera which allows users to add fun filters and Snapchat like lenses to their content as well as add visual geolocation tags to their photos and videos The content is able to be posted publicly on the Facebook app for only hours or can be sent as a direct message to a Facebook friend br As people mostly post photos and videos Stories is the way they re going to want to do it says Facebook Camera product manager Connor Hayes noting Facebook s shift away from text status updates after ten years as its primary sharing option Obviously we ve seen this doing very well in other apps Snapchat has really pioneered this explained Hayes Facebook has seen much success through other applications like Snapchat and Instagram especially since Facebook bought Instagram for billion in br br br History br After the many failed attempts of trying to incorporate Snapchat like features on Facebook date January the company decided to test run Messenger Day In Facebook created a feature called Messenger Day which allowed users to post videos and pictures with filters for hours only This project was only used in Poland because of the unpopularity of Snapchat in that region Users are able to add texts and colorful graphics However this was only a test for Facebook to be later turned into a feature on Facebook s app br Facebook s introduction of the Story function may have been in response to the wider success of Instagram Story advertising over the advertising on Facebook Wall Instagram Story ads were found to be more successful than Facebook Wall advertising in all demographics aside from non millennial men br br br Popularity and criticism br As of Facebook Stories is much less popular among social media users than Snapchat and Instagram In August Instagram stories which is a part of the Facebook owned Instagram was created and as of June had million active users Mark Zuckerberg states It is important to release products that people are familiar with but Facebook Stories is going to have the first mainstream augmented reality platform br In a campaign to get more Facebook users to use Facebook Stories Facebook is turning friends into ghosts who aren t using stories So instead of the blank space that used to be there above the news feed Facebook will show grayed out icons of some frequently contacted friends regardless of whether they ve ever posted to their Facebook story before br Plugin extensions to Chrome and Firefox have been written specifically to hide Facebook stories As of September Facebook itself has so far not created an off option for its users br br br Features br br br Access Stories br There are two ways that a user can view Facebook Stories First by scrolling to the top of the feed the users are able to view their friends Stories and create a story Second swipe right from any screen on the Facebook app Users can like Stories and reply to them br br br Saving

if it were any other picture or video And just like posting to a Timeline users can decide who sees it Public Friends and so on But posting to a Story will make it available to all friends for a hour period and will appear as a bubble at the top of their feeds Right now there s no way to select who sees or doesn t see a Story To delete a story go to the bottom right of the screen and click view
