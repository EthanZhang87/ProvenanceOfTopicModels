A sequel to the game Words with Friends came out in September br br br Gameplay br br The rules of the game are mostly the same as those of two player Scrabble with a few differences such as the arrangement of premium squares and the distribution and point values of some of the letters see Scrabble letter distributions and point values Players are given seven randomly chosen letter tiles which are replenished until all tiles have been used Players take turns forming words on the board or instead of playing a word may also choose to swap tiles with the pool of currently unused tiles or pass their turn Players can form words either vertically or horizontally on the board The player s aim is to score as many points as possible br A letter placed on a DL or TL square doubles or triples the value of that letter on all words formed using that square Similarly the DW and TW squares double and triple the value of the new word s using that square If a player uses all seven tiles on a single play known as a bingo in Scrabble bonus points are added this contrasts with the bonus points in Scrabble br The different arrangement of premium squares can lead to scoring situations that would be rare or impossible in a typical Scrabble game For example it is possible to place a new word that simultaneously covers a triple letter score TL and a triple word score TW or a new word that covers a double word score DW and a triple word score TW which would be impossible or nearly impossible in a Scrabble game br The game ends when a player plays every tile in his or her rack and there are no remaining tiles to draw The game also ends if three scoreless moves i e passes or tile exchanges are played in succession unless the score is zero zero After playing the last tile the opposing player will lose all the points equal to the amount of the remaining tiles This number of points will be awarded to the player who played the last tile At the end of the game the player with the highest score wins br There are various versions of Words With Friends All versions allow players to resign their turn with the resign feature pass their turn with the pass feature swap out one or more tiles and forfeit the current turn with the swap feature or look up what tiles remain with the tile bag feature The word strength feature can be turned on or off and enables players to see how strong their placed word is relative to all other word combinations available on the current board In Zynga temporarily removed a feature called hindsight which allowed a player to pay for the opportunity to see what the highest scoring moves on the board were after the play was made but has since brought it back In addition to the hindsight power up the game also offers other power ups known as swap word radar and word clue br Words with Friends accepts words in the game The word list used by the game is based on the Enhanced North American Benchmark Lexicon ENABLE with some additions from the developers br br br Random opponent and chat features br Since the game s launch the random opponent and chat features of the game have led to a number of romantic relationships In
