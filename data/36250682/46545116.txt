br br br Reception upon release br Upon the release of Safety Check Richard Lawler wrote in Engadget praising the tool writing I t can take some pressure off of overloaded infrastructure with everyone trying to call affected areas after disasters hit and of course save you from a post tragedy chewing out for failure to let people know you re fine On the flip side he posited that Safety Check might be a cagey way to try to take some of the creepiness out of the apps location tracking features br br br Reception of deployment for April Nepal earthquake br Commentators praised Facebook Safety Check in the wake of the April Nepal earthquake and compared it to Google Person Finder a tool by Google with a similar purpose However commentators noted that due to low penetration of mobile devices and poor network connectivity in the region which had worsened due to the earthquake many of the people in the target audience of the tool would not be able to use it This was likened to similar problems faced by Google Person Finder during the Pakistan floods br br br Reception of deployment for May Nepal earthquake br After the May Nepal earthquake BuzzFeed reported that many users outside the geographical area affected by the earthquake were marking themselves as safe using the tool and that this was angering other users who thought they were being insensitive to the toll and tragedy of the event The story was picked up by other publications including the Huffington Post and fact checking website Snopes which noted that this was due to a bug in Facebook leading it to prompt people outside the affected area to confirm whether they were safe br br br See also br br Google Person Finder br br br
