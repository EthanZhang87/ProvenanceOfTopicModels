RocksDB is a high performance embedded database for key value data It is a fork of Google s LevelDB optimized to exploit multi core processors CPUs and make efficient use of fast storage such as solid state drives SSD for input output I O bound workloads It is based on a log structured merge tree LSM tree data structure It is written in C and provides official language bindings for C C and Java Many third party language bindings exist RocksDB is free and open source software released originally under a BSD clause license However in July the project was migrated to a dual license of both Apache and GPLv license This change helped its adoption in Apache Software Foundation s projects after blacklist of the previous BSD Patents license clause br RocksDB is used in production systems at various web scale enterprises including Facebook Yahoo and LinkedIn br br br Features br RocksDB like LevelDB stores keys and values in arbitrary byte arrays and data is sorted byte wise by key or by providing a custom comparator br RocksDB provides all of the features of LevelDB plus br br Transactions br Backups and snapshots br Column families br Bloom filters br Time to live TTL support br Universal compaction br Merge operators br Statistics collection br Geospatial indexing br and others br RocksDB is not an SQL database although MyRocks combines RocksDB with MySQL Like other NoSQL and dbm stores it has no relational data model and it does not support SQL queries Also it has no direct support for secondary indexes however a user may build their own internally using Column Families or externally Applications use RocksDB as a library as it provides no server or command line interface br br br History br RocksDB was created at Facebook by Dhruba Borthakur in April as a fork of LevelDB with the initial stated goal of improving performance for server workloads br br br Integration br As an embeddable database RocksDB can be used as a storage engine within a larger database management system DBMS For example Rockset uses RocksDB mostly for analytical data processing br br br Alternative backend br The following projects have been started to replace or offer alternative storage engines for already established database systems with RocksDB br br br ArangoDB br ArangoDB has added RocksDB to its previous storage engine mmfiles Starting with ArangoDB RocksDB will be the default storage engine in ArangoDB br br br Cassandra br Cassandra on RocksDB can improve the performance of Apache Cassandra significantly times faster in general times faster in some use cases The Instagram team at Facebook developed and open sourced their code along with benchmarks of their performance results br br br MariaDB br MariaDB can use the MyRocks storage engine which is forked from RocksDB since MariaDB Alpha status and stable since MariaDB in br br br MongoDB br The MongoRocks project provides a storage module for MongoDB where the storage engine is RocksDB br A related program is Rocks Strata a tool written in Go which allows managing incremental backups of MongoDB when RocksDB is used as the storage engine br br br MySQL br The MyRocks project created a new RocksDB based storage engine for MySQL In depth details about MyRocks were presented at Percona Live br br br Oxigraph br Oxigraph is a graph database implementing the SPARQL standard based on RocksDB br br br UKV br The UKV project allows users to use RocksDB on par with LevelDB as the underlying key value store It represents a shared abstraction for create read update and delete CRUD operations common to every storage engine It augments it with structured bindings for several high level languages including Python Java and Go br br br Embedded br The following database systems and applications have chosen to use RocksDB as their embedded storage engine br br br Ceph s BlueStore br The Ceph s BlueStore storage layer uses RocksDB for metadata management in OSD devices br br br Apache Flink br Apache Flink uses RocksDB to store checkpoints br br br FusionDB br FusionDB uses RocksDB as its storage engine for XML Key Value and JSON br br br LogDevice LogsDB br LogDevice s LogsDB is built atop RocksDB br br br Kafka Streams br Kafka Streams uses RocksDB for its state stores br br br Manhattan br The Manhattan Distributed Key Value Store has used RocksDB as its primary engine to store Twitter data since br br br Rockset br The Rockset service that is used for operational data analytics uses RocksDB as its storage engine br br br SSDB br The ssdb rocks project uses RocksDB as the storage engine for the SSDB NoSQL Database br br br TiDB br The TiDB project uses RocksDB as its storage engine br br br YugabyteDB br The YugabyteDB database uses a modified version of RocksDB as part of its DocDB storage engine br br br Third party language bindings br Third party programming language bindings available for RocksDB include br br br br br br External links br Official website
