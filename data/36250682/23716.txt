A programmer computer programmer or coder is an author of computer source code someone with skill in computer programming br The professional titles software developer and software engineer are used for jobs that require a programmer br Generally a programmer writes code in a computer language and with an intent to build software that achieves some goal br br br Identification br Sometimes a programmer or job position is identified by the language used or target platform For example assembly programmer web developer br br br Job title br The job titles that include programming tasks have differing connotations across the computer industry and to different individuals The following are notable descriptions br A software developer primarily implements software based on specifications and fixes bugs Other duties may include reviewing code changes and testing br To achieve the required skills for the job they might obtain a computer science or associate degree attend a programming boot camp or be self taught br A software engineer usually is responsible for the same tasks as a developer br plus broader responsibilities of software engineering including architecting and designing new features and applications targeting new platforms managing the software development lifecycle design implementation testing and deployment leading a team of programmers communicating with customers managers and other engineers considering system stability and quality and exploring software development methodologies br Sometimes a software engineer is required to have a degree in software engineering computer engineering or computer science Some countries legally require an engineering degree to be called engineer br br br History br br British countess and mathematician Ada Lovelace is often considered to be the first computer programmer br She authored an algorithm which was published in October for calculating Bernoulli numbers on the Charles Babbage analytical engine br Because the machine was not completed in her lifetime she never experienced the algorithm in action br In German civil engineer Konrad Zuse was the first person to execute a program on a working program controlled electronic computer From to per computer scientist Wolfgang K Giloi and AI professor Ra l Rojas et al Zuse created the first high level programming language Plankalk l br Members of the ENIAC programming team of Kay McNulty Betty Jennings Betty Snyder Marlyn Wescoff Fran Bilas and Ruth Lichterman have since been credited as the first professional computer programmers br br br The software industry br br The first company founded specifically to provide software products and services was the Computer Usage Company in Before that time computers were programmed either by customers or the few commercial computer manufacturers of the time such as Sperry Rand and IBM br The software industry expanded in the early s almost immediately after computers were first sold in mass produced quantities Universities governments and businesses created a demand for software Many of these programs were written in house by full time staff programmers some were distributed between users of a particular machine for no charge while others were sold on a commercial basis Other firms such as Computer Sciences Corporation founded in also started to grow Computer manufacturers soon started bundling operating systems system software and programming environments with their machines the IBM came with the Symbolic Programming System and FORTRAN br The industry expanded greatly with the rise of the personal computer PC in the mid s which brought computing to the average office worker In the following years the PC also helped create a constantly growing market for games applications and utility software This resulted in increased demand for software developers for that period of time br br br Nature of the work br Computer programmers write test debug and maintain the detailed instructions called computer programs that computers must follow to perform their functions Programmers also conceive design and test logical structures for solving problems by computer Many technical innovations in programming advanced computing technologies and sophisticated new languages and programming tools have redefined the role of a programmer and elevated much of the programming work done today Job titles and descriptions may vary depending on the organization br Programmers work in many settings including corporate information technology IT departments big software companies small service firms and government entities of all sizes Many professional programmers also work for consulting companies at client sites as contractors Licensing is not typically required to work as a programmer although professional certifications are commonly held by programmers Programming is considered a profession br Programmers work varies widely depending on the type of business for which they are writing programs For example the instructions involved in updating financial records are very different from those required to duplicate conditions on an aircraft for pilots training in a flight simulator Simple programs can be written in a few hours More complex ones may require more than a year of work while others are never considered complete but rather are continuously improved as long as they stay in use In most cases several programmers work together as a team under a senior programmer s supervision br br br Types of software br Programming editors also known as source code editors are text editors that are specifically designed for programmers or developers to write the source code of an application or a program Most of these editors include features useful for programmers which may include color syntax highlighting auto indentation auto complete bracket matching syntax check and allows plug ins These features aid the users during coding debugging and testing br br br Globalization br br br Market changes in the UK br According to BBC News of computer science students could not find work in their field six months after graduation in which was the highest rate of the university subjects surveyed while of medical students were unemployed in the same survey br br br Market changes in the US br After the crash of the dot com bubble and the Great Recession many U S programmers were left without work or with lower wages In addition enrollment in computer related degrees and other STEM degrees STEM attrition in the US has been dropping for years especially for women which according to Beaubouef and Mason could be attributed to a lack of general interest in science and mathematics and also out of an apparent fear that programming will be subject to the same pressures as manufacturing and agriculture careers For programmers the U S Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS Occupational Outlook originally predicted a growth for programmers of percent from to and thereafter a decline of percent from to a further decline of percent from to a decline of percent from to and then a decline of percent from to Since computer programming can be done from anywhere in the world companies sometimes hire programmers in countries where wages are lower However for software developers BLS projects for to a increase in employment from to jobs with a median base salary of per year This prediction is lower than the earlier to predicted increase of for software developers Though the distinction is somewhat ambiguous software developers engage in a wider array of aspects of application development and are generally higher skilled than programmers making outsourcing less of a risk Another reason for the decline for programmers is their skills are being merged with other professions such as developers as employers increase the requirements for a position over time Then there is the additional concern that recent advances in artificial intelligence might impact the demand for future generations of Software professions br br br See also br br List of programmers br List of programming languages br Software
