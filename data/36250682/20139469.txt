formed Constitutional Court of South Africa by Nelson Mandela Aged only O Regan s appointment was surprising even to her She and Yvonne Mokgoro were the only female judges on the Court for its first years br O Regan s first majority judgment was S v Bhulwana S v Gwadiso where the Court for the first time suspended an order of constitutional invalidity In she co authored Fedsure Life Assurance Ltd v Greater Johannesburg Transitional Metropolitan Council the Court s founding judgment on the rule of law and legality review The first major judgment of which she was the sole author was Premier Mpumalanga still the leading authority on the doctrine of legitimate expectations on which O Regan also wrote in Ed U College again in the context of the government s withdrawal of school subsidies O Regan s judgment in Dawood v Minister of Home Affairs delivered in established for the first time that the right to family life is constitutionally protected and that the conferral of broad discretionary powers on government officials can be unconstitutional But by far her most cited contribution to administrative law is her judgment in Bato Star v Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism which sets out South African law s approach to reasonableness review and judicial deference br br O Regan s judgment in ACDP v Electoral Commission dealing with the African Christian Democratic Party s application to contest the local government elections introduced the doctrine of substantial compliance into South African law Her judgment in Richter v Minister of Home Affairs also on political rights extended the right to vote to South African citizens living abroad br O Regan wrote several judgments on labour law in which she had specialised as an attorney and academic She wrote two judgments one in and one in in the ongoing litigation between the South African National Defence Union and the South African National Defence Force as well as NUMSA v Bader Bop a judgment dealing with the subject of her PhD thesis the right to strike Her judgment on the relationship between administrative law and labour law Fredericks v MEC for Education and Training Eastern Cape has effectively been overturned to almost unanimous disapproval by commentators In Sidumo v Rustenburg Platinum Mines Ltd O Regan wrote separately to emphasise in agreement with the majority judgment of Navsa AJ her law clinic colleague of thirty years earlier that administrative law applies to labour law disputes br In the law of delict O Regan s contribution has been significant In she wrote Khumalo v Holomisa one of the Court s first judgments on defamation law and arguably its only judgment applying the Bill of Rights directly to private parties In she delivered the Metrorail judgment which holds that Metrorail has a duty to ensure the safety of commuters on its trains and is regarded as an exemplar by international commentators for its protection of the right to personal security And in most famously O Regan gave judgment in K v Minister of Safety and Security finding the state liable to compensate a plaintiff who was raped by a police officer The judgment s radical expansion of the test for vicarious liability following Bazley v Curry and Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd was celebrated by women s rights groups but criticised by some academics It has been approved and applied by the Court subsequently The judgment is also still cited for its approach to the development of the common law and the use of comparative law Finally in Steenkamp NO v Provincial Tender Board another case on the delictual liability of public authorities O Regan co wrote a dissent with Langa CJ that would have held the state liable for pure economic loss caused to the winner of an unlawfully awarded tender br In discrimination law O Regan co authored Prinsloo v Van der Linde which established the connection between the right to equality and dignity and penned a unanimous judgment in the follow up to Satchwell v President of the Republic of South Africa Better known are her two dissents In Minister of Home Affairs v Fourie she strongly criticised the majority for referring the regulation of same sex marriage to Parliament rather than providing immediate relief And her dissent in the earlier S v Jordan co authored with Sachs J held that the criminalisation of sex work and not its solicitation unfairly discriminates on the basis of gender and is therefore unconstitutional br O Regan s fifteen year term ended in October Her last judgment for the Court Mazibuko v City of Johannesburg on the right to water proved highly controversial For some it was a perceptively restrained summation of the Court s socio economic rights jurisprudence for others it was a disappointing and profoundly conservative failure by the Court to come to the aid of South Africa s poorest communities br Nevertheless O Regan was hailed on her retirement as a stalwart of the Court among its most industrious as well as progressive members In the view of Johann Kriegler her long standing colleague she was the most outstanding success of the Constitutional Court Edwin Cameron has said she is one of the finest minds ever appointed as a judge in South Africa After O Regan retired along with Pius Langa Yvonne Mokgoro and Albie Sachs these four founding members of the Court were replaced by President Jacob Zuma s first raft of senior judicial appointees This significant change in the Court s composition was seen by some as marking the start of its decline br br br Acting DCJ br From February to May O Regan acted as Deputy Chief Justice in the absence of Dikgang Moseneke It was during this period that John Hlophe allegedly approached judges Chris Jafta and Bess Nkabinde to influence their decision in litigation involving Jacob Zuma br br br Dalai Lama controversy br In March the South African government refused a visa to the Dalai Lama to attend a peace conference This perceived capitulation by the ruling African National Congress to pressure from China was widely condemned including by then Minister of Health Barbara Hogan O Regan also spoke out
