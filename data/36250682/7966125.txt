HTML Hypertext Markup Language is a markup language used for structuring and presenting hypertext documents on the World Wide Web It was the fifth and final major HTML version that is now a retired World Wide Web Consortium W C recommendation The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard It is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group WHATWG a consortium of the major browser vendors Apple Google Mozilla and Microsoft br HTML was first released in a public facing form on January with a major update and W C Recommendation status in October Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers parsers etc without XHTML s rigidity and to remain backward compatible with older software HTML is intended to subsume not only HTML but also XHTML and even the DOM Level HTML itself br HTML includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations it extends improves and rationalizes the markup available for documents and introduces markup and application programming interfaces APIs for complex web applications For the same reasons HTML is also a candidate for cross platform mobile applications because it includes features designed with low powered devices in mind br Many new syntactic features are included To natively include and handle multimedia and graphical content the new video audio and canvas elements were added expandable sections are natively implemented through summary summary and details details rather than depending on CSS or JavaScript and support for scalable vector graphics SVG content and MathML for mathematical formulas was also added To enrich the semantic content of documents new page structure elements such as main section article header footer aside nav and figure are added New attributes were introduced some elements and attributes were removed and others such as a cite and menu were changed redefined or standardized The APIs and Document Object Model DOM are now fundamental parts of the HTML specification and HTML also better defines the processing for any invalid documents br br br History br The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group WHATWG began work on the new standard in At that time HTML had not been updated since and the World Wide Web Consortium W C was focusing future developments on XHTML In the W C allowed the XHTML Working Group s charter to expire and decided not to renew it br The Mozilla Foundation and Opera Software presented a position paper at a World Wide Web Consortium workshop in June focusing on developing technologies that are backward compatible with existing browsers including an initial draft specification of Web Forms The workshop concluded with a vote for against for continuing work on HTML Immediately after the workshop WHATWG was formed to start work based upon that position paper and a second draft Web Applications was also announced The two specifications were later merged to form HTML The HTML specification was adopted as the starting point of the work of the new HTML working group of the W C in br WHATWG s Ian Hickson Google and David Hyatt Apple produced W C s first public working draft of the specification on January br Many web browsers released after support HTML including Google Chrome Safari Firefox Opera Internet Explorer and later br br br Thoughts on Flash br br While some features of HTML are often compared to Adobe Flash the two technologies are very different Both include features for playing audio and video within web pages and for using Scalable Vector Graphics However HTML on its own cannot be used for animation or interactivity it must be supplemented with CSS or JavaScript There are many Flash capabilities that have no direct counterpart in HTML see Comparison of HTML and Flash HTML s interactive capabilities became a topic of mainstream media attention around April after Apple Inc s then CEO Steve Jobs issued a public letter titled Thoughts on Flash in which he concluded that Flash is no longer necessary to watch video or consume any kind of web content and that new open standards created in the mobile era such as HTML will win This sparked a debate in web development circles suggesting that while HTML provides enhanced functionality developers must consider the varying browser support of the different parts of the standard as well as other functionality differences between HTML and Flash In early November Adobe announced that it would discontinue the development of Flash for mobile devices and reorient its efforts in developing tools using HTML On July Adobe announced that both the distribution and support of Flash would cease by the end of Adobe itself officially discontinued Flash on December and all Flash content was blocked from running in Flash Player as of January br br br Last call candidacy and recommendation stages br On February the W C extended the charter of its HTML Working Group with clear milestones for HTML In May the working group advanced HTML to Last Call an invitation to communities inside and outside W C to confirm the technical soundness of the specification The W C developed a comprehensive test suite to achieve broad interoperability for the full specification by which was the target date for recommendation In January the WHATWG renamed its HTML specification HTML Living Standard The W C nevertheless continued its project to release HTML br In July WHATWG and W C decided on a degree of separation W C will continue the HTML specification work focusing on a single definitive standard which is considered a snapshot by WHATWG The WHATWG organization continues its work with HTML as a living standard The concept of a living standard is that it is never complete and is always being updated and improved New features can be added but functionality will not be removed br In December W C designated HTML as a Candidate Recommendation The criterion for advancement to W C Recommendation is two complete and fully interoperable implementations br On September W C moved HTML to Proposed Recommendation On October HTML was released as a W C Recommendation bringing the specification process to completion On November HTML was released as a W C Recommendation On December HTML was released as a W C Recommendation br br br Retirement br The W C retired HTML on March Additionally the retirement included HTML HTML XHTML and XHTML HTML HTML and HTML were all retired on January in favour of the HTML living standard br br br Timeline br The combined timelines for the W C recommendations of HTML HTML HTML and HTML br br br W C and WHATWG conflict br br The W C ceded authority over the HTML and DOM standards to WHATWG on May as it considered that having two standards is harmful The HTML Living Standard is now authoritative However W C will still participate in the development process of HTML br Before the ceding of authority W C and WHATWG had been characterized as both working together on the development of HTML and yet also at cross purposes ever since the July split The W C HTML standard was snapshot based HTML HTML etc and static while the WHATWG HTML living standard is continually updated The relationship had been described as fragile even a rift and characterized by squabbling br In at least one case namely the permissible content of the cite element the two specifications directly contradicted each other as of July with the W C definition allowing a broader range of uses than the WHATWG definition br The Introduction section in the WHATWG spec edited by Ian Hixie Hickson is critical of W C e g Note Although we have asked them to stop doing so the W C also republishes some parts of this specification as separate documents In its History subsection it portrays W C as resistant to Hickson s and WHATWG s original HTML plans then jumping on the bandwagon belatedly though Hickson was in control of the W C HTML spec too Regardless it indicates a major philosophical divide between the organizations br br For a number of years both groups then worked together In however the groups came to the conclusion that they had different goals the W C wanted to publish a finished version of HTML while the WHATWG wanted to continue working on a Living Standard for HTML continuously maintaining the specification rather than freezing it in a state with known problems and adding new features as needed to evolve the platform Since then the WHATWG has been working on this specification amongst others and the W C has been copying fixes made by the WHATWG into their fork of the document which also has other changes br br The two entities signed an agreement to work together on a single version of HTML on May br br br Differences between the two standards br In addition to the contradiction in the cite element mentioned above other differences between the two standards include at least the following as of September br br The following table provides data from the Mozilla Development Network on compatibility with major browsers as of September of HTML elements unique to one of the standards br br br Features and APIs br The W C proposed a greater reliance on modularity as a key part of the plan to make faster progress meaning identifying specific features either proposed or already existing in the spec and advancing them as separate specifications Some technologies that were originally defined in HTML itself are now defined in separate specifications br br HTML Working Group HTML Canvas D Context br Immersive Web Working Group WebXR Device API WebXR Gamepads Module WebXR Augmented Reality Module and others br Web Apps Working Group Web Messaging Web workers Web storage WebSocket Server sent events Web Components this was not part of HTML though the Web Applications Working Group was closed in October and its deliverables transferred to the Web Platform Working Group WPWG br IETF HyBi Working Group WebSocket Protocol br WebRTC Working Group WebRTC br Web Media Text Tracks Community Group WebVTT br Some features that were removed from the original HTML specification have been standardized separately as modules such as Microdata and Canvas Technical specifications introduced as HTML extensions such as Polyglot markup have also been standardized as modules Some W C specifications that were originally separate specifications have been adapted as HTML extensions or features such as SVG Some features that might have slowed down the standardization of HTML were or will be standardized as upcoming specifications instead br br br Features br br br Markup br HTML introduces elements and attributes that reflect typical usage on modern websites Some of them are semantic replacements for common uses of generic block div and inline span elements for example nav website navigation block footer usually referring to bottom of web page or to last lines of HTML code or audio and video instead of object br Some deprecated elements from HTML have been dropped including purely presentational elements such as font and center whose effects have long been superseded by the more capable Cascading Style Sheets There is also a renewed emphasis on the importance of client side JavaScript used to create dynamic web pages br The HTML syntax is no longer based on SGML despite the similarity of its markup It has however been designed to be backward compatible with common parsing of older versions of HTML It comes with a new introductory line that looks like an SGML document type declaration DOCTYPE html which triggers the standards compliant rendering mode br Since January HTML also includes Web Forms a previously separate WHATWG specification br br br New APIs br br In addition to specifying markup HTML specifies scripting application programming interfaces APIs that can be used with JavaScript Existing Document Object Model DOM interfaces are extended and de facto features documented There are also new APIs such as br br Canvas br Timed Media Playback br Offline br Editable content br Drag and drop br History br MIME type and protocol handler registration br Microdata br Web Messaging br Web Storage a key value pair storage framework that provides behavior similar to cookies but with larger storage capacity and improved API br Not all of the above technologies are included in the W C HTML specification though they are in the WHATWG HTML specification Some related technologies which are not part of either the W C HTML or the WHATWG HTML specification are as follows The W C publishes specifications for these separately br br Geolocation br IndexedDB an indexed hierarchical key value store formerly WebSimpleDB br File an API intended to handle file uploads and file manipulation br Directories and System an API intended to satisfy client side storage use cases not well served by databases br File Writer an API for writing to files from web applications br Web Audio a high level JavaScript API for processing and synthesizing audio in web applications br ClassList br Web cryptography API br WebRTC br Web SQL Database a local SQL Database no longer maintained br HTML cannot provide animation within web pages Additional JavaScript or CSS is necessary for animating HTML elements Animation is also possible using JavaScript and HTML and within SVG elements through SMIL although browser support of the latter remains uneven as of br br br XHTML XML serialized HTML br br XML documents must be served with an XML Internet media type often called MIME type such as application xhtml xml or application xml and must conform to strict well formed syntax of XML XHTML is simply XML serialized HTML data that is HTML constrained to XHTML s strict requirements e g not having any unclosed tags sent with one of XML media types HTML that has been written to conform to both the HTML and XHTML specifications and therefore produces the same DOM tree whether parsed as HTML or XML is known as polyglot markup br There is no DTD for XHTML br br br Error handling br br HTML is designed so that old browsers can safely ignore new HTML constructs In contrast to HTML the HTML specification gives detailed rules for lexing and parsing with the intent that compliant browsers will produce the same results when parsing incorrect syntax Although HTML now defines a consistent behavior for tag soup documents those documents do not conform to the HTML standard br br br Popularity br According to a report released on September of the world s top Web sites were using HTML the adoption led by search engines and social networks Another report released in August has shown that of the Fortune U S companies implemented HTML on their corporate websites br Since HTML is at least partially supported by most popular layout engines br br br Differences from HTML and XHTML x br The following is a cursory list of differences and some specific examples br br New parsing rules oriented towards flexible parsing and compatibility not based on SGML br Ability to use inline SVG and MathML in text html br New elements article aside audio bdi canvas command data datalist details embed figcaption figure footer header keygen mark meter nav output progress rp rt ruby section source summary time track video wbr br New types of form controls dates and times email url search number range tel color br New attributes charset on meta async on script br Global attributes that can be applied for every element id tabindex hidden data custom data attributes br Deprecated elements will be dropped altogether acronym applet basefont big center dir font frame frameset isindex noframes strike tt br W C Working Group publishes HTML differences from HTML which provides a complete outline of additions removals and changes between HTML and HTML br br br Logo br br On January the W C introduced a logo to represent the use of or interest in HTML Unlike other badges previously issued by the W C it does not imply validity or conformance to a certain standard As of April this logo is official br When initially presenting it to the public the W C announced the HTML logo as a general purpose visual identity for a broad set of open web technologies including HTML CSS SVG WOFF and others Some web standard advocates including The Web Standards Project criticized that definition of HTML as an umbrella term pointing out the blurring of terminology and the potential for miscommunication Three days later the W C responded to community feedback and changed the logo s definition dropping the enumeration of related technologies The W C then said the logo represents HTML the cornerstone for modern Web applications br br br Digital rights management br Industry players including the BBC Google Microsoft Apple Inc have been lobbying for the inclusion of Encrypted Media Extensions EME a form of digital rights management DRM into the HTML standard As of the end of and the beginning of organizations including the Free Software Foundation have started a campaign against including digital rights management in the HTML standard However in late September the W C HTML Working Group decided that Encrypted Media Extensions a form of DRM was in scope and will potentially be included in the HTML standard WHATWG s HTML Living Standard continued to be developed without DRM enabled proposals br Manu Sporny a member of the W C said that EME would not solve the problem it was supposed to address br Opponents point out that EME itself is just an architecture for a DRM plug in mechanism br The initial enablers for DRM in HTML were Google and Microsoft Supporters also include Adobe On May Mozilla announced plans to support EME in Firefox the last major browser to avoid DRM Calling it a difficult and uncomfortable step Andreas Gal of Mozilla explained that future versions of Firefox would remain open source but ship with a sandbox designed to run a content decryption module developed by Adobe later it was replaced with Widevine module from Google which is much more widely adopted by content providers While promising to work on alternative solutions Mozilla s Executive Chair Mitchell Baker stated that a refusal to implement EME would have accomplished little more than convincing many users to switch browsers This decision was condemned by Cory Doctorow and the Free Software Foundation br As of December the W C has changed their opinion on EME stating Encrypted Media Extensions EME brings greater interoperability better privacy security accessibility and user experience in viewing movies and TV on the Web br br br See also br br Cache manifest in HTML br
