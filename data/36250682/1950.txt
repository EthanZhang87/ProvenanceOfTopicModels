id: 1950
The American Civil Liberties Union ACLU is an American nonprofit human rights organization founded in The organization s website has stated that the organization strives to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed to every person in this country by the Constitution and laws of the United States The ACLU works through litigation and lobbying and has more than members as of July with an annual budget over million ACLU affiliates are active in all states Washington D C and Puerto Rico The ACLU provides legal assistance in cases where it considers civil liberties at risk Legal support from the ACLU can take the form of direct legal representation or preparation of amicus curiae briefs expressing legal arguments when another law firm is already providing representation br In addition to representing persons and organizations in lawsuits the ACLU lobbies for policy positions established by its board of directors The ACLU s current positions include opposing the death penalty supporting same sex marriage and the right of LGBT people to adopt supporting reproductive rights such as birth control and abortion rights eliminating discrimination against women minorities and LGBT people decarceration in the United States protecting housing and employment rights of veterans reforming sex offender registries and protecting housing and employment rights of convicted first time offenders supporting the rights of prisoners and opposing torture and upholding the separation of church and state by opposing government preference for religion over non religion or for particular faiths over others br Legally the ACLU consists of two separate but closely affiliated nonprofit organizations namely the American Civil Liberties Union a c social welfare group and the ACLU Foundation a c public charity Both organizations engage in civil rights litigation advocacy and education but only donations to the c foundation are tax deductible and only the c group can engage in unlimited political lobbying The two organizations share office space and employees br br br Organization br br br Leadership br The ACLU is led by a president and an executive director Deborah N Archer and Anthony Romero respectively as of March The president acts as chair of the ACLU s board of directors leads fundraising and facilitates policy setting The executive director manages the day to day operations of the organization The board of directors consists of persons including representatives from each state affiliate and at large delegates The organization has its headquarters in Broad Street a story skyscraper located in Lower Manhattan New York City br The leadership of the ACLU does not always agree on policy decisions differences of opinion within the ACLU leadership have sometimes grown into major debates In an internal debate erupted over whether to defend Henry Ford s right to distribute anti union literature In a heated debate took place over whether to prohibit communists from serving in ACLU leadership roles During the early s and Cold War McCarthyism the board was divided on whether to defend communists In a schism formed over whether to represent Benjamin Spock s anti war activism In as the Watergate Scandal continued to unfold leadership was initially divided over whether to call for President Nixon s impeachment and removal from office In there was internal conflict about whether or not a gag rule should be imposed on ACLU employees to prevent the publication of internal disputes br br br Funding br br In the year ending March the ACLU and the ACLU Foundation had a combined income from support and revenue of million originating from grants membership donations donated legal services bequests and revenue Membership dues are treated as donations members choose the amount they pay annually averaging approximately per member In the year ending March the combined expenses of the ACLU and ACLU Foundation were million spent on programs management and fundraising After factoring in other changes in net assets of million from sources such as investment income the organization had an overall decrease in net assets of million Over the period from to the ACLU Foundation on average has accounted for roughly of the combined budget and the ACLU roughly br The ACLU solicits donations to its charitable foundation The ACLU is accredited by the Better Business Bureau and the Charity Navigator has ranked the ACLU with a four star rating The local affiliates solicit their own funding however some also receive funds from the national ACLU with the distribution and amount of such assistance varying from state to state At its discretion the national organization provides subsidies to smaller affiliates that lack sufficient resources to be self sustaining for example the Wyoming ACLU chapter received such subsidies until April when as part of a round of layoffs at the national ACLU the Wyoming office was closed br In October the ACLU rejected million from both the Ford Foundation and Rockefeller Foundation because the foundations had adopted language from the USA PATRIOT Act in their donation agreements including a clause stipulating that none of the money would go to underwriting terrorism or other unacceptable activities The ACLU views this clause both in federal law and in the donors agreements as a threat to civil liberties saying it is overly broad and ambiguous br Due to the nature of its legal work the ACLU is often involved in litigation against governmental bodies which are generally protected from adverse monetary judgments a town state or federal agency may be required to change its laws or behave differently but not to pay monetary damages except by an explicit statutory waiver In some cases the law permits plaintiffs who successfully sue government agencies to collect money damages or other monetary relief In particular the Civil Rights Attorney s Fees Award Act of leaves the government liable in some civil rights cases Fee awards under this civil rights statute are considered equitable relief rather than damages and government entities are not immune from equitable relief Under laws such as this the ACLU and its state affiliates sometimes share in monetary judgments against government agencies In the Public Expressions of Religion Protection Act sought to prevent monetary judgments in the particular case of violations of church state separation br The ACLU has received court awarded fees from opponents for example the Georgia affiliate was awarded in fees after suing a county demanding the removal of a Ten Commandments display from its courthouse a second Ten Commandments case in the state in a different county led to a judgment The State of Tennessee was required to pay the State of Alabama and the State of Kentucky in similar Ten Commandments cases br br br State affiliates br br Most of the organization s workload is performed by its local affiliates There is at least one affiliate organization in each state as well as one in Washington D C and in Puerto Rico California has three affiliates The affiliates operate autonomously from the national organization each affiliate has its own staff executive director board of directors and budget Each affiliate consists of two non profit corporations a c corporation called the ACLU Foundation that does not perform lobbying and a c corporation called ACLU which is entitled to lobby Both organizations share staff and offices br ACLU affiliates are the basic unit of the ACLU s organization and engage in litigation lobbying and public education For example in the ACLU s New Jersey chapter argued cases before the New Jersey Supreme Court about one third of the total cases heard in that court They sent over emails to officials or agencies and had full time staff br br br Positions br The ACLU s official position statements included the following policies br br Affirmative action The ACLU supports affirmative action br Birth control and abortion The ACLU supports the right to abortion as established in the Roe v Wade decision The ACLU believes everyone should have affordable access to the full range of contraceptive options The ACLU s Reproductive Freedom Project manages efforts related to reproductive rights br Campaign funding The ACLU believes the current system is badly flawed and supports a system based on public funding The ACLU supports full transparency in identifying donors However the ACLU opposes attempts to control political spending The ACLU supported the Supreme Court s decision in Citizens United v FEC which allowed corporations and unions more political speech rights br Criminal law reform The ACLU seeks an end to what it feels are excessively harsh sentences that stand in the way of a just and equal society The ACLU s Criminal Law Reform Project focuses on this issue br Death penalty The ACLU is opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances The ACLU s Capital Punishment Project focuses on this issue br Free speech The ACLU supports free speech including the right to express unpopular or controversial ideas such as flag desecration racist or sexist views etc However a leaked ACLU memo from June said that speech that can inflict serious harms and impede progress toward equality may be a lower priority for the organization br Gun rights The national ACLU s position is that the Second Amendment protects a collective right to own guns rather than an individual right despite the Supreme Court decision in District of Columbia v Heller that the Second Amendment is a personal right The national organization s position is based on the phrases a well regulated Militia and the security of a free State However the ACLU opposes any effort to create a registry of gun owners and has worked with the National Rifle Association of America to prevent a registry from being created and it has favored protecting the right to carry guns under the th Amendment br HIV AIDS The policy of the ACLU is to create a world in which discrimination based on HIV status has ended people with HIV have control over their medical information and care and where the government s HIV policy promotes public health and respect and compassion for people living with HIV and AIDS The ACLU s AIDS Project manages this effort br Human rights The ACLU s Human Rights project advocates primarily in an international context for children s rights disability rights immigrant rights gay rights and other international obligations br Immigrants rights The ACLU supports civil liberties for immigrants to the United States br Lesbian gay bisexual and transgender rights The ACLU supports equal rights for all lesbian gay bisexual transgender and queer people and works to eliminate discrimination The ACLU supports equal employment housing civil marriage and adoption rights for LGBT couples br National security The ACLU is opposed to compromising civil liberties in the name of national security In this context the ACLU has condemned government use of spying indefinite detention without charge or trial and government sponsored torture The ACLU s National Security Project leads this effort br Prisoners rights The ACLU s National Prison Project believes that incarceration should only be used as a last resort and that prisons should focus on rehabilitation The ACLU advocates that prisons treat prisoners according to the Constitution and domestic law br Privacy and technology The ACLU s Project on Speech Privacy and Technology promotes responsible uses of technology that enhance privacy protection and opposes uses that undermine our freedoms and move us closer to a surveillance society This includes expanding the right to privacy increase individuals control over personal information and ensuring civil liberties are enhanced by technology br Racial issues The ACLU s Racial Justice Program combats racial discrimination in all aspects of society including the educational system the justice system and the application of the death penalty However the ACLU opposes state censorship of the Confederate flag br Religion The ACLU supports the right of religious persons to practice their faiths without government interference The ACLU believes the government should neither prefer religion over non religion nor favor particular faiths over others The ACLU is opposed to school led prayer but protects students right to pray in school It opposes the use of religious beliefs to discriminate such as refusing to provide abortion coverage or providing services to LGBT people br Sex education The ACLU opposes abstinence only sex education curricula and supports comprehensive sex education curricula that encourage effective contraceptive usage and sexually transmitted disease prevention alongside waiting to have sex The ACLU opposes segregation in sex education classes because it can lead to increased class size and perpetuate antiquated gender stereotypes br Vaccination policy The ACLU supports vaccine mandates for people using public facilities and businesses because there is no right to harm others by spreading infectious diseases Hence the ACLU states mandates are permissible in many settings where the unvaccinated pose a risk to others including schools and universities hospitals restaurants and bars workplaces and businesses open to the public The organization supports a public health based approach to pandemic management and is opposed to criminalizing or jailing people with infectious diseases The ACLU is opposed to Vaccine passports br Voting rights The ACLU believes that impediments to voting should be eliminated particularly if they disproportionately impact minority or poor citizens The ACLU believes that misdemeanor convictions should not lead to a loss of voting rights The ACLU s Voting Rights Project leads this effort br Women s rights The ACLU works to eliminate discrimination against women in all realms The ACLU encourages the government to be proactive in stopping violence against women These efforts are led by the ACLU s Women s Rights Project br br br Support and opposition br A variety of persons and organizations support the ACLU There were over members in and the ACLU receives thousands of grants from hundreds of charitable foundations annually Allies of the ACLU in legal actions have included the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People the American Jewish Congress People for the American Way the National Rifle Association of America the Electronic Frontier Foundation Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the National Organization for Women br The ACLU has been criticized by liberals such as when it excluded communists from its leadership ranks when it defended Neo Nazis when it declined to defend Paul Robeson or when it opposed the passage of the National Labor Relations Act In an ACLU affiliate supported anti Islam protesters and in the ACLU was criticized when it supported the NRA br Conversely it has been criticized by conservatives such as when it argued against official prayer in public schools or when it opposed the Patriot Act br The ACLU has supported conservative figures such as Rush Limbaugh George Wallace Henry Ford and Oliver North as well as liberal figures such as Dick Gregory Rockwell Kent and Benjamin Spock br Major sources of criticism are legal cases in which the ACLU represents an individual or organization that promotes offensive or unpopular viewpoints such as the Ku Klux Klan neo Nazis the Nation of Islam the North American Man Boy Love Association the Westboro Baptist Church or the Unite the Right rally The ACLU s official policy is we have represented or defended individuals engaged in some truly offensive speech We have defended the speech rights of communists Nazis Ku Klux Klan members accused terrorists pornographers anti LGBT activists and flag burners That s because the defense of freedom of speech is most necessary when the message is one most people find repulsive Constitutional rights must apply to even the most unpopular groups if they re going to be preserved for everyone br br br History br br br Early years br br The ACLU developed from the National Civil Liberties Bureau CLB co founded in during World War I by Crystal Eastman an attorney activist and Roger Nash Baldwin The focus of the CLB was on freedom of speech primarily anti war speech and on supporting conscientious objectors who did not want to serve in World War I In Crystal Eastman resigned from the organization due to health issues After assuming sole leadership of the CLB Baldwin insisted that the organization be reorganized He wanted to change its focus from litigation to direct action and public education br The CLB directors concurred and on January they formed an organization under a new name the American Civil Liberties Union Although a handful of other organizations in the United States at that time focused on civil rights such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People NAACP and Anti Defamation League ADL the ACLU was the first that did not represent a particular group of persons or a single theme Like the CLB the NAACP pursued litigation to work on civil rights including efforts to overturn the disfranchisement of African Americans in the South that had taken place since the turn of the century br During the first decades of the ACLU Baldwin continued as its leader His charisma and energy attracted many supporters to the ACLU board and leadership ranks The ACLU was directed by an executive committee and was not particularly democratic or egalitarian New Yorkers dominated the ACLU s headquarters Most ACLU funding came from philanthropies such as the Garland Fund br br br Free speech era br br During the s the ACLU s primary focus was on freedom of speech in general and speech within the labor movement particularly Because most of the ACLU s efforts were associated with the labor movement the ACLU itself came under heavy attack from conservative groups such as the American Legion the National Civic Federation and Industrial Defense Association and the Allied Patriotic Societies ACLU leadership was divided on how to challenge civil rights violations One faction including Baldwin Arthur Garfield Hays and Norman Thomas believed that direct militant action was the best path Another group including Walter Nelles and Walter Pollak felt that lawsuits taken to the Supreme Court were the best way to achieve change br In addition to labor the ACLU also led efforts in non labor arenas for example promoting free speech in public schools The ACLU was banned from speaking in New York public schools in The ACLU working with the NAACP also supported racial discrimination cases The ACLU defended free speech regardless of espoused opinions For example the reactionary anti Catholic anti black Ku Klux Klan KKK was a frequent target of ACLU efforts but the ACLU defended the KKK s right to hold meetings in There were some civil rights that the ACLU did not make an effort to defend in the s including censorship of the arts government search and seizure issues right to privacy or wiretapping br Government officials routinely hounded the Communist Party USA leading it to be the primary client of the ACLU At the same time the Communists were very aggressive in their tactics often engaging in illegal conduct such as denying their party membership under oath This led to frequent conflicts between the Communists and ACLU Communist leaders sometimes attacked the ACLU particularly when the ACLU defended the free speech rights of conservatives whereas Communists tried to disrupt speeches by critics of the USSR This uneasy relationship between the two groups continued for decades br br br Public schools br Five years after the ACLU was formed the organization had virtually no success to show for its efforts That changed in when the ACLU persuaded John T Scopes to defy Tennessee s anti evolution law in The State of Tennessee v John Thomas Scopes Clarence Darrow a member of the ACLU National Committee headed Scopes legal team The prosecution led by William Jennings Bryan contended that the Bible should be interpreted literally in teaching creationism in school The ACLU lost the case and Scopes was fined The Tennessee Supreme Court later upheld the law Still it overturned the conviction on a technicality br The Scopes trial was a phenomenal public relations success for the ACLU The ACLU became well known across America and the case led to the first endorsement of the ACLU by a major US newspaper The ACLU continued to fight for the separation of church and state in schoolrooms decade after decade including the case McLean v Arkansas and the case Kitzmiller v Dover Area School District br Baldwin was involved in a significant free speech victory of the s after he was arrested for attempting to speak at a rally of striking mill workers in New Jersey Although the decision was limited to the state of New Jersey the appeals court s judgment in declared that constitutional guarantees of free speech must be given liberal and comprehensive construction and it marked a major turning point in the civil rights movement signaling the shift of judicial opinion in favor of civil rights br The most important ACLU case of the s was Gitlow v New York in which Benjamin Gitlow was arrested for violating a state law against inciting anarchy and violence when he distributed literature promoting communism Although the Supreme Court did not overturn Gitlow s conviction it adopted the ACLU s stance later termed the incorporation doctrine that the First Amendment freedom of speech applied to state laws as well as federal laws br The Oregon Compulsory Education Act required almost all children in Oregon between eight and sixteen years of age to attend public school by Associate Director Roger Nash Baldwin a personal friend of Luke E Hart the then Supreme Advocate and future Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus offered to join forces with the Knights to challenge the law The Knights of Columbus pledged an immediate to fight the law and any additional funds necessary to defeat it The case became known as Pierce v Society of Sisters a United States Supreme Court decision that significantly expanded coverage of the Due Process Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment In a unanimous decision the court held that the act was unconstitutional and that parents not the state had the authority to educate children as they thought best It upheld the religious freedom of parents to educate their children in religious schools br br br Free speech expansion br Leaders of the ACLU were divided on the best tactics to use to promote civil liberties Felix Frankfurter felt that legislation was the best long term solution because the Supreme Court could not mandate liberal interpretations of the Bill of Rights But Walter Pollak Morris Ernst and other leaders felt that Supreme Court decisions were the best path to guarantee civil liberties A series of Supreme Court decisions in the s foretold a changing national atmosphere anti radical emotions were diminishing and there was a growing willingness to protect freedom of speech and assembly via court decisions br br Starting in the ACLU expanded its free speech activities to encompass censorship of art and literature In that year H L Mencken deliberately broke Boston law by distributing copies of his banned American Mercury magazine the ACLU defended him and won an acquittal The ACLU went on to win additional victories including the landmark case United States v One Book Called Ulysses in which reversed a ban by the Customs Department against the book Ulysses by James Joyce The ACLU only achieved mixed results in the early years and it was not until that the Supreme Court finally clarified the obscenity laws in the Roth v United States and Memoirs v Massachusetts cases br The Comstock laws banned the distribution of sex education information based on the premise that it was obscene and led to promiscuous behavior Mary Ware Dennett was fined in for distributing a pamphlet containing sex education material The ACLU led by Morris Ernst appealed her conviction and won a reversal in which judge Learned Hand ruled that the pamphlet s primary purpose was to promote understanding The success prompted the ACLU to broaden their freedom of speech efforts beyond labor and political speech to encompass movies press radio and literature The ACLU formed the National Committee on Freedom from Censorship in to coordinate this effort By the early s censorship in the United States was diminishing br Two major victories in the s cemented the ACLU s campaign to promote free speech In Stromberg v California decided in the Supreme Court sided with the ACLU and affirmed the right of a communist party member to salute a communist flag The result was the first time the Supreme Court used the Due Process Clause of the th amendment to subject states to the requirements of the First Amendment In Near v Minnesota also decided in the Supreme Court ruled that states may not exercise prior restraint and prevent a newspaper from publishing simply because the newspaper had a reputation for being scandalous br br br s br The late s saw the emergence of a new era of tolerance in the United States National leaders hailed the Bill of Rights particularly as it protected minorities as the essence of democracy The Supreme Court decision in Hague v Committee for Industrial Organization affirmed the right of communists to promote their cause Even conservative elements such as the American Bar Association began to campaign for civil liberties which were long considered to be the domain of left leaning organizations By the ACLU had achieved many of the goals it set in the s and many of its policies were the law of the land br In after the Scopes and Dennett victories Baldwin perceived that there was vast untapped support for civil liberties in the United States Baldwin proposed an expansion program for the ACLU focusing on police brutality Native American rights African American rights censorship in the arts and international civil liberties The board of directors approved Baldwin s expansion plan except for the international efforts br The ACLU played a significant role in passing the Norris La Guardia Act a federal law that prohibited employers from preventing employees from joining unions and stopped the practice of outlawing strikes marriages and labor organizing activities with the use of injunctions The ACLU also played a key role in initiating a nationwide effort to reduce misconduct such as extracting false confessions within police departments by publishing the report Lawlessness in Law Enforcement in under the auspices of Herbert Hoover s Wickersham Commission In the ACLU lobbied for the passage of the Indian Reorganization Act which restored some autonomy to Native American tribes and established penalties for kidnapping Native American children br Although the ACLU deferred to the NAACP for litigation promoting civil liberties for African Americans the ACLU engaged in educational efforts and published Black Justice in a report which documented institutional racism throughout the South including lack of voting rights segregation and discrimination in the justice system Funded by the Garland Fund the ACLU also participated in producing the influential Margold Report which outlined a strategy to fight for civil rights for blacks The ACLU planned to demonstrate that the separate but equal policies governing the Southern discrimination were illegal because blacks were never in fact treated equally br In twelve years after the ACLU was founded it had achieved significant success the Supreme Court had embraced the free speech principles espoused by the ACLU and the general public was becoming more supportive of civil rights in general But the Great Depression brought new assaults on civil liberties the year saw a large increase in the number of free speech prosecutions a doubling of the number of lynchings and all meetings of unemployed persons were banned in Philadelphia The Franklin D Roosevelt administration proposed the New Deal to combat the depression ACLU leaders were of mixed opinions about the New Deal since many felt that it represented an increase in government intervention into personal affairs and because the National Recovery Administration suspended antitrust legislation br The economic policies of the New Deal leaders were often aligned with ACLU goals but social goals were not In particular movies were subject to a barrage of local ordinances that banned screenings deemed immoral or obscene Even public health films portraying pregnancy and birth were banned as was Life magazine s April issue which included photos of the birth process The ACLU fought these bans but did not prevail The Catholic Church attained increasing political influence in the s it used its influence to promote the censorship of movies and to discourage the publication of birth control information This conflict between the ACLU and the Catholic Church led to the resignation of the last Catholic priest from ACLU leadership in a Catholic priest would not be represented again until the s br The first decision that marked the Supreme Court s major shift in policy no longer applying strict constitutional limits to government programs and taking a more active role in protecting civil liberties was De Jonge v Oregon in which a communist labor organizer was arrested for calling a meeting to discuss unionization The ACLU attorney Osmond Fraenkel working with International Labor Defense defended De Jonge in and won a major victory when the Supreme Court ruled that peaceable assembly for lawful discussion cannot be made a crime The De Jonge case marked the start of an era lasting for a dozen years during which Roosevelt appointees led by Hugo Black William O Douglas and Frank Murphy established a body of civil liberties law In Justice Harlan F Stone wrote the famous footnote four in United States v Carolene Products Co in which he suggested that state laws which impede civil liberties would henceforth require compelling justification br Senator Robert F Wagner proposed the National Labor Relations Act in which empowered workers to unionize Ironically after years of fighting for workers rights the ACLU initially opposed the act it later took no stand on the legislation because some ACLU leaders feared the increased power the bill gave to the government The newly formed National Labor Relations Board NLRB posed a dilemma for the ACLU because in it issued an order to Henry Ford prohibiting Ford from disseminating anti union literature Part of the ACLU leadership habitually took the side of labor and that faction supported the NLRB s action But part of the ACLU supported Ford s right to free speech ACLU leader Arthur Garfield Hays proposed a compromise supporting the auto workers union yet also endorsing Ford s right to express personal opinions but the schism highlighted a deeper divide that would become more prominent in the years to come br The ACLU s support of the NLRB was a significant development for the ACLU because it marked the first time it accepted that a government agency could be responsible for upholding civil liberties Until the ACLU felt that citizens and private organizations best upheld civil rights br Some factions in the ACLU proposed new directions for the organization In the late s some local affiliates proposed shifting their emphasis from civil liberties appellate actions to becoming a legal aid society centered on store front offices in low income neighborhoods The ACLU directors rejected that proposal Other ACLU members wanted the ACLU to shift focus into the political arena and be more willing to compromise their ideals to strike deals with politicians The ACLU leadership also rejected this initiative br The ACLU s support of defendants with unpopular sometimes extreme viewpoints has produced many landmark court cases and established new civil liberties One such defendant was the Jehovah s Witnesses who were involved in a large number of Supreme Court cases The most important cases involved statutes requiring flag salutes The Jehovah s Witnesses felt that saluting a flag was contrary to their religious beliefs Two children were convicted in of not saluting the flag The ACLU supported their appeal to the Supreme Court but the court affirmed the conviction in But three years later in West Virginia State Board of Education v Barnette the Supreme court reversed itself br br br Communism and totalitarianism br br The rise of totalitarian regimes in Germany Russia and other countries that rejected freedom of speech and association greatly impacted the civil liberties movement in the US anti Communist sentiment rose and civil liberties were curtailed br The ACLU leadership was divided over whether or not to defend pro Nazi speech in the United States pro labor elements within the ACLU were hostile towards Nazism and fascism and objected when the ACLU defended Nazis The ACLU defended numerous pro Nazi groups defending their rights to free speech and free association In the late s the ACLU allied itself with the Popular Front a coalition of liberal organizations coordinated by the United States Communist Party The ACLU benefited because affiliates from the Popular Front could often fight local civil rights battles much more effectively than the New York based ACLU The association with the Communist Party led to accusations that the ACLU was a Communist front particularly because Harry F Ward was both chairman of the ACLU and chairman of the American League Against War and Fascism a Communist organization br The House Un American Activities Committee HUAC was created in to uncover sedition and treason within the United States When witnesses testified at its hearings the ACLU was mentioned several times leading the HUAC to mention the ACLU prominently in its report This damaged the ACLU s reputation severely even though the report said that it could not definitely state whether or not the ACLU was a Communist organization While the ACLU rushed to defend its image against allegations of being a Communist front it also protected witnesses harassed by the HUAC The ACLU was one of the few organizations to protest unsuccessfully against the passage of the Smith Act in which would later be used to imprison many persons who supported Communism The ACLU defended many persons who were prosecuted under the Smith Act including labor leader Harry Bridges br ACLU leadership was split on whether to purge its leadership of Communists Norman Thomas John Haynes Holmes and Morris Ernst were anti Communists who wanted to distance the ACLU from Communism opposing them were Harry F Ward Corliss Lamont and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn who rejected any political test for ACLU leadership A bitter struggle ensued throughout and the anti Communists prevailed in February when the board voted to prohibit anyone who supported totalitarianism from ACLU leadership roles Ward immediately resigned and following a contentious six hour debate Flynn was voted off the ACLU s board The resolution was considered by many to be a betrayal of its fundamental principles The resolution was rescinded in and Flynn was posthumously reinstated to the ACLU in br br br World War II br The ACLU had a decidedly mixed civil liberties record during World War II While there were far fewer sedition prosecutions than in World War I this did not mean that President Roosevelt was more tolerant of dissent than Wilson had been The primary explanation was that prosecutors working under similar laws had fewer plausible targets because almost everyone rallied to the war effort after the attack on Pearl Harbor br Roosevelt put constant pressure on Attorney General Francis Biddle to take legal action against his prominent pre war critics Partly to appease the president Biddle finally charged thirty lesser known individuals for violating the Smith Act Although many of the defendants did not know each other and most lived in scattered locations in the U S they were all tried at once in Washington D C in the Sedition Trial of Despite efforts by Roger N Baldwin Norman Thomas Thurgood Marshall and others in the leadership to get the ACLU to go on record condemning the trial Baldwin called it monstrous the board of directors overruled them br The ACLU also had a mixed record on fighting wartime restrictions on the press It was silent when the U S Post Office revoked the second class mailing privileges of Social Justice the magazine of Father Charles E Coughlin On the other hand it extended legal aid to the publishers of the Militant of the Socialist Workers Party and the Boise Valley Herald when their mailing rights were revoked The ACLU was unable to prevent extensive extralegal harassment of the black press by the FBI and other agencies The ACLU s shortcomings in defending civil liberties inspired the contemporary saying born in World War I and died in World War II br br Two months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor Roosevelt authorized the creation of military exclusion zones with Executive Order paving the way for the detention of all West Coast Japanese Americans in inland camps In addition to the non citizen Issei prohibited from naturalization as members of an unassimilable race over two thirds of those swept up were American born citizens Opinions within the organization became increasingly divided as the Army began the evacuation of the West Coast The board decided not to challenge the eviction of Japanese American citizens on June instructions were sent to West Coast branches not to support cases that argued the government had no constitutional right to do so The ACLU offices on the West Coast had been more directly involved in addressing the tide of anti Japanese prejudice from the start as they were geographically closer to the issue and were already working on cases challenging the exclusion by this time The Seattle office assisting in Gordon Hirabayashi s lawsuit created an unaffiliated committee to continue the work the ACLU had started while in Los Angeles attorney A L Wirin continued to represent Ernest Kinzo Wakayama but without addressing the case s constitutional questions Wirin would lose private clients because of his defense of Wakayama and other Japanese Americans however the San Francisco branch led by Ernest Besig refused to discontinue its support for Fred Korematsu whose case had been taken on before the June directive and attorney Wayne Collins with Besig s full support centered his defense on the illegality of Korematsu s exclusion br The West Coast offices had wanted a test case to take to court However they had a difficult time finding a Japanese American who was both willing to violate the internment orders and able to meet the ACLU s desired criteria of a sympathetic Americanized plaintiff Of the Japanese Americans affected by the order only disobeyed and Korematsu Hirabayashi and two others were the only resisters whose cases eventually made it to the Supreme Court Hirabayashi v United States came before the Court in May and the justices upheld the government s right to exclude Japanese Americans from the West Coast although it had earlier forced its local office in L A to stop aiding Hirabayashi the ACLU donated to the case over a third of the legal team s total budget and submitted an amicus brief Besig dissatisfied with Osmond Fraenkel s tamer defense filed an additional amicus brief that directly addressed Hirabayashi s constitutional rights In the meantime A L Wirin served as one of the attorneys in Yasui v United States decided the same day as the Hirabayashi case and with the same results Still he kept his arguments within the national office s parameters The only case to receive a favorable ruling ex parte Endo was also aided by two amicus briefs from the ACLU one from the more conservative Fraenkel and another from the more putative Wayne Collins br Korematsu v United States proved to be the most controversial of these cases as Besig and Collins refused to bow to the national ACLU office s pressure to pursue the case without challenging the government s right to remove citizens from their homes The ACLU board threatened to revoke the San Francisco branch s national affiliation At the same time Baldwin tried unsuccessfully to convince Collins to step down so he could replace him as lead attorney in the case Eventually Collins agreed to present the case alongside Charles Horsky however their arguments before the Supreme Court remained based on the unconstitutionality of the exclusion order Korematsu had disobeyed The case was decided in December when the Court once again upheld the government s right to relocate Japanese Americans although Korematsu s Hirabayashi s and Yasui s convictions were later overturned in coram nobis proceedings in the s Legal scholar Peter Irons later asserted that the national office of the ACLU s decision not to challenge the constitutionality of Executive Order directly had crippled the effective presentation of these appeals to the Supreme Court br The national office of the ACLU was even more reluctant to defend anti war protesters A majority of the board passed a resolution in that declared the ACLU unwilling to defend anyone who interfered with the United States war effort Included in this group were the thousands of Nisei who renounced their US citizenship during the war but later regretted the decision and tried to revoke their applications for repatriation A significant number of those slated to go back to Japan had never actually been to the country and were being deported rather than repatriated Ernest Besig had in visited the Tule Lake Segregation Center where the majority of these renunciants were concentrated and subsequently enlisted Wayne Collins help to file a lawsuit on their behalf arguing the renunciations had been given under duress The national organization prohibited local branches from representing the renunciants forcing Collins to pursue the case independently although Besig and the Northern California office provided some support br br br Cold War era br Anti Communist sentiment gripped the United States during the Cold War beginning in Federal investigations caused many persons with Communist or left leaning affiliations to lose jobs become blocklisted or be jailed The ACLU was internally divided when it purged Communists from its leadership in and that ambivalence continued as it decided whether to defend alleged Communists during the late s Some ACLU leaders were anti Communist and felt that the ACLU should not defend any victims Some ACLU leaders felt that Communists were entitled to free speech protections and that the ACLU should defend them Other ACLU leaders were uncertain about the threat posed by Communists and tried to establish a compromise between the two extremes This ambivalent state of affairs would last until when the civil liberties faction prevailed leading to most anti Communist leaders resignations br In President Truman issued Executive Order which created the Federal Loyalty Program This program authorized the Attorney General to create a list of organizations that were deemed to be subversive Listed organizations were not notified that they were being considered for the list nor did they have an opportunity to present counterarguments nor did the government divulge any factual basis for inclusion in the list Although ACLU leadership was divided on whether to challenge the Federal Loyalty Program some challenges were successfully made br Also in the House Un American Activities Committee HUAC subpoenaed ten Hollywood directors and writers the Hollywood Ten intending to ask them to identify Communists but the witnesses refused to testify All were imprisoned for contempt of Congress The ACLU supported several artists appeals but lost on appeal The Hollywood establishment panicked after the HUAC hearings and created a blacklist that prohibited anyone with leftist associations from working The ACLU supported legal challenges to the blocklist but those challenges failed The ACLU was more successful with an education effort the report The Judges and the Judged prepared at the ACLU s direction in response to the blocklisting of actress Jean Muir described the unfair and unethical actions behind the blocklisting process and it helped gradually turn public opinion against McCarthyism br br The federal government took direct aim at the US Communist Party in when it indicted its top twelve leaders in the Foley Square trial The case hinged on whether or not mere membership in a totalitarian political party was sufficient to conclude that members advocated the overthrow of the United States government The ACLU chose not to represent any of the defendants and they were all found guilty In a change of heart the ACLU supported the party leaders during their appeal process The Supreme Court upheld the convictions in the Dennis v United States decision by softening the free speech requirements from a clear and present danger test to a grave and probable test The ACLU issued a public condemnation of the Dennis decision and resolved to fight it One reason for the Supreme Court s support of Cold War legislation was the deaths of Supreme Court justices Frank Murphy and Wiley Rutledge leaving Hugo Black and William O Douglas as the only remaining civil libertarians on the Court br The Dennis decision paved the way for the prosecution of hundreds of other Communist party members The ACLU supported many Communists during their appeals although most of the initiative originated with local ACLU affiliates not the national headquarters but most convictions were upheld The two California affiliates in particular felt the national ACLU headquarters was not supporting civil liberties strongly enough and they initiated more cold war cases than the national headquarters did br The ACLU challenged many loyalty oath requirements across the country but the courts upheld most loyalty oath laws The Supreme Court until upheld nearly every law which restricted the liberties of Communists The ACLU even though it scaled back its defense of Communists during the Cold War still came under heavy criticism as a front for Communism Critics included the American Legion Senator Joseph McCarthy the HUAC and the FBI Several ACLU leaders were sympathetic to the FBI and as a consequence the ACLU rarely investigated any of the many complaints alleging abuse of power by the FBI during the Cold War br In the ACLU board of directors asked executive director Baldwin to resign feeling he lacked the organizational skills to lead the and growing member organization Baldwin objected but a majority of the board elected to remove him from the position and he was replaced by Patrick Murphy Malin Under Malin s guidance membership tripled to by the start of years of continual growth leading to members in Malin also presided over an expansion of local ACLU affiliates br The ACLU controlled by an elite of a few dozen New Yorkers became more democratic in the s In the ACLU amended its bylaws to permit the local affiliates to participate directly in voting on ACLU policy decisions A bi annual conference open to the entire membership was instituted in the same year in later decades it became a pulpit for activist members who suggested new directions for the ACLU including abortion rights death penalty and rights of the poor br br br McCarthy era br br During the early s the ACLU continued to steer a moderate course through the Cold War When singer Paul Robeson was denied a passport in even though he was not accused of any illegal acts the ACLU chose not to defend him The ACLU later reversed their stance and supported William Worthy and Rockwell Kent in their passport confiscation cases which resulted in legal victories in the late s br In response to communist witch hunts many witnesses and employees chose to use the fifth amendment protection against self incrimination to avoid divulging information about their political beliefs Government agencies and private organizations in response established policies which inferred communist party membership for anyone who invoked the fifth amendment The national ACLU was divided on whether to defend employees who had been fired merely for pleading the fifth amendment but the New York affiliate successfully assisted teacher Harry Slochower in his Supreme Court case which reversed his termination br The fifth amendment issue became the catalyst for a watershed event in which finally resolved the ACLU s ambivalence by ousting the anti communists from ACLU leadership In the anti communists led by Norman Thomas and James Fly proposed a set of resolutions that inferred guilt of persons that invoked the fifth amendment These resolutions were the first that fell under the ACLU s new organizational rules permitting local affiliates to participate in the vote the affiliates outvoted the national headquarters and rejected the anti communist resolutions Anti communist leaders refused to accept the results of the vote and brought the issue up for discussion again at the bi annual convention ACLU member Frank Graham president of the University of North Carolina attacked the anti communists with a counter proposal which stated that the ACLU stand s against guilt by association judgment by accusation the invasion of privacy of personal opinions and beliefs and the confusion of dissent with disloyalty The anti communists continued to battle Graham s proposal but were outnumbered by the affiliates The anti communists finally gave up and departed the board of directors in late and ending an eight year ambivalence within the ACLU leadership ranks After that the ACLU proceeded with firmer resolve against Cold War anti communist legislation The period from the resolution and the purge of Elizabeth Flynn to the resignation of the anti communist leaders is considered by many to be an era in which the ACLU abandoned its core principles br McCarthyism declined in late after television journalist Edward R Murrow and others publicly chastised McCarthy The controversies over the Bill of Rights that the Cold War generated ushered in a new era in American Civil liberties In in Brown v Board of Education the Supreme Court unanimously overturned state sanctioned school segregation and after that a flood of civil rights victories dominated the legal landscape br The Supreme Court handed the ACLU two key victories in in Watkins v United States and Yates v United States both of which undermined the Smith Act and marked the beginning of the end of communist party membership inquiries In the Supreme Court produced some decisions including Lamont v Postmaster General in which the plaintiff was Corliss Lamont a former ACLU board member which upheld fifth amendment protections and brought an end to restrictions on political activity br br br s br The decade from to was the most successful period in the ACLU s history Membership rose from to and by it had affiliates in seventeen states During the ACLU s bi annual conference in Colorado in the Supreme Court issued rulings on eight cases involving the ACLU the ACLU prevailed on seven of the eight The ACLU played a role in Supreme Court decisions reducing censorship of literature and arts protecting freedom of association prohibiting racial segregation excluding religion from public schools and providing due process protection to criminal suspects The ACLU s success arose from changing public attitudes the American populace was more educated tolerant and willing to accept unorthodox behavior br br Legal battles concerning the separation of church and state originated in laws dating to which required religious instruction in school or provided state funding for religious schools The Catholic church was a leading proponent of such laws and the primary opponents the separationists were the ACLU Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the American Jewish Congress The ACLU led the challenge in the Everson v Board of Education case in which Justice Hugo Black wrote t he First Amendment has erected a wall between church and state That wall must be kept high and impregnable It was not clear that the Bill of Rights forbid state governments from supporting religious education and strong legal arguments were made by religious proponents arguing that the Supreme Court should not act as a national school board and that the Constitution did not govern social issues However the ACLU and other advocates of church state separation persuaded the Court to declare such activities unconstitutional Historian Samuel Walker writes that the ACLU s greatest impact on American life was its role in persuading the Supreme Court to constitutionalize so many public controversies br In the ACLU prevailed in the McCollum v Board of Education case which challenged public school religious classes taught by clergy paid for by private funds The ACLU also won cases challenging schools in New Mexico that were taught by clergy and had crucifixes hanging in the classrooms In the s the ACLU in response to member insistence turned its attention to the in class promotion of religion In percent of American schools included Bible reading In the ACLU published a policy statement condemning in school prayers observation of religious holidays and Bible reading The Supreme Court concurred with the ACLU s position when it prohibited New York s in school prayers in the Engel v Vitale decision Religious factions across the country rebelled against the anti prayer decisions leading them to propose the School Prayer Constitutional Amendment which declared in school prayer legal The ACLU participated in a lobbying effort against the amendment and the congressional vote failed to obtain the required two thirds majority br However not all cases were victories ACLU lost cases in and which challenged state laws requiring commercial businesses to close on Sunday the Christian Sabbath The Supreme Court has never overturned such laws although some states subsequently revoked many of the laws under pressure from commercial interests br Cities across America routinely banned movies because they were deemed to be harmful offensive or immoral censorship which was validated by the Mutual v Ohio Supreme Court decision which held movies to be mere commerce undeserving of first amendment protection The film The Miracle was banned in New York in at the behest of the Catholic Church but the ACLU supported the film s distributor in an appeal of the ban and won a major victory in the decision Joseph Burstyn Inc v Wilson Further legal actions by the ACLU successfully defended films such as M and la Ronde leading the eventual dismantling of movie censorship Hollywood continued employing self censorship with its own Production Code but in the ACLU called on Hollywood to abolish the Code br The ACLU lost an important press censorship case when in the Supreme Court upheld the obscenity conviction of publisher Samuel Roth for distributing adult magazines As late as books such as Tropic of Cancer and From Here to Eternity were still banned But public standards rapidly became more liberal through the s and obscenity was notoriously difficult to define so by obscenity prosecutions had halted br br br Racial discrimination br Several civil liberties organizations worked together for progress on the civil rights movement including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People NAACP the ACLU and the American Jewish Congress The NAACP took primary responsibility for Supreme Court cases often led by lead NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall with the ACLU focusing on police misconduct and supporting the NAACP with amicus briefs In the ACLU filed an amicus brief in the case of Brown v Board of Education which led to the ban on racial segregation in US public schools Southern states instituted a McCarthyism style witch hunt against the NAACP attempting to force it to disclose membership lists The ACLU s fight against racism was not limited to segregation in the ACLU provided key support to plaintiffs primarily lower income urban residents in Reynolds v Sims which required states to establish the voting districts following the one person one vote principle br br br Police misconduct br The ACLU regularly tackled police misconduct issues starting with the case Powell v Alabama right to an attorney and including s Betts v Brady right to an attorney and s Rochin v California involuntary stomach pumping In the late s several ACLU local affiliates established permanent committees to address policing issues During the s and s the ACLU was responsible for substantially advancing the legal protections against police misconduct In the Philadelphia affiliate was responsible for causing the City of Philadelphia to create the nation s first civilian police review board In the Illinois affiliate published the first report in the nation Secret Detention by the Chicago Police which documented unlawful detention by police br Some of the most notable ACLU successes came in the s when the ACLU prevailed in a string of cases limiting the power of police to gather evidence in s Mapp v Ohio the Supreme court required states to obtain a warrant before searching a person s home The Gideon v Wainwright decision in provided legal representation to indigents In the ACLU persuaded the Court in Escobedo v Illinois to permit suspects to have an attorney present during questioning And in Miranda v Arizona federal decision required police to notify suspects of their constitutional rights which was later extended to juveniles in the following year s in re Gault federal ruling Although many law enforcement officials criticized the ACLU for expanding the rights of suspects police officers also used the services of the ACLU For example when the ACLU represented New York City policemen in their lawsuit which objected to searches of their workplace lockers In the late s civilian review boards in New York City and Philadelphia were abolished over the ACLU s objection br br br Civil liberties revolution br The s was a tumultuous era in the United States and public interest in civil liberties underwent explosive growth Civil liberties actions in the s were often led by young people and often employed tactics such as sit ins and marches Protests were often peaceful but sometimes employed militant tactics The ACLU played a central role in all major civil liberties debates of the s including new fields such as gay rights prisoner s rights abortion rights of the poor and the death penalty Membership in the ACLU increased from at the beginning of the decade to in In there were affiliates in seven states and by there were affiliates in states During the s the ACLU underwent a major transformation in tactics it shifted emphasis from legal appeals generally involving amicus briefs submitted to the Supreme Court to direct representation of defendants when they were initially arrested At the same time the ACLU transformed its style from disengaged and elitist to emotionally engaged The ACLU published a breakthrough document in titled How Americans Protest which was borne of frustration with the slow progress in battling racism and which endorsed aggressive even militant protest techniques br After four African American college students staged a sit in in a segregated North Carolina department store the sit in movement gained momentum across the United States During the ACLU defended black students arrested for demonstrating in North Carolina Florida and Louisiana The ACLU also provided legal help for the Freedom Rides in the integration of the University of Mississippi the Birmingham campaign in and the Freedom Summer The NAACP was responsible for managing most sit in related cases that made it to the Supreme Court winning nearly every decision But it fell to the ACLU and other legal volunteer efforts to provide legal representation to hundreds of protestors white and black who were arrested while protesting in the South The ACLU joined with other civil liberties groups to form the Lawyers Constitutional Defense Committee LCDC which provided legal representation to many protesters The ACLU provided the majority of the funding for the LCDC br In the ACLU opened up a major office in Atlanta Georgia dedicated to serving Southern issues Much of the ACLU s progress in the South was due to Charles Morgan Jr the charismatic leader of the Atlanta office Morgan was responsible for desegregating juries Whitus v Georgia desegregating prisons Lee v Washington and reforming election laws In the southern office successfully represented African American congressman Julian Bond in Bond v Floyd after the Georgia House of Representatives refused to admit Bond into the legislature on the basis that he was an admitted pacifist opposed to the ongoing Vietnam War Another widely publicized case defended by Morgan was that of Army doctor Howard Levy who was convicted of refusing to train Green Berets Despite raising the defense that the Green Berets were committing war crimes in Vietnam Levy lost on appeal in Parker v Levy US br In the ACLU won a significant victory for free speech when it defended Dick Gregory after he was arrested for peacefully protesting against the mayor of Chicago The court ruled in Gregory v Chicago that a speaker cannot be arrested for disturbing the peace when hostility is initiated by someone in the audience as that would amount to a heckler s veto br br br Vietnam War br The ACLU was at the center of several legal aspects of the Vietnam war defending draft resisters challenging the constitutionality of the war the potential impeachment of Richard Nixon and the use of national security concerns to preemptively censor newspapers br David J Miller was the first person prosecuted for burning his draft card The New York affiliate of the ACLU appealed his conviction F d United States of America v David J Miller but the Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal Two years later the Massachusetts affiliate took the card burning case of David O Brien to the Supreme Court arguing that the act of burning was a form of symbolic speech but the Supreme Court upheld the conviction in United States v O Brien US Thirteen year old Junior High student Mary Tinker wore a black armband to school in to object to the war and was suspended from school The ACLU appealed her case to the Supreme Court and won a victory in Tinker v Des Moines Independent Community School District This critical case established that the government may not establish enclaves such as schools or prisons where all rights are forfeited br br The ACLU defended Sydney Street who was arrested for burning an American flag to protest the reported assassination of civil rights leader James Meredith In the Street v New York decision the court agreed with the ACLU that encouraging the country to abandon one of its national symbols was a constitutionally protected form of expression The ACLU successfully defended Paul Cohen who was arrested for wearing a jacket with the words fuck the draft on its back while he walked through the Los Angeles courthouse The Supreme Court in Cohen v California held that the vulgarity of the wording was essential to convey the intensity of the message br Non war related free speech rights were also advanced during the Vietnam war era in the ACLU defended a Ku Klux Klan member who advocated long term violence against the government and the Supreme Court concurred with the ACLU s argument in the landmark decision Brandenburg v Ohio which held that only speech which advocated imminent violence could be outlawed br A major crisis gripped the ACLU in when a debate erupted over whether to defend Benjamin Spock and the Boston Five against federal charges that they encouraged draftees to avoid the draft The ACLU board was deeply split over whether to defend the activists half the board harbored anti war sentiments and felt that the ACLU should lend its resources to the cause of the Boston Five The other half of the board believed that civil liberties were not at stake and the ACLU would be taking a political stance Behind the debate was the longstanding ACLU tradition that it was politically impartial and provided legal advice without regard to the defendants political views The board finally agreed to a compromise solution that permitted the ACLU to defend the anti war activists without endorsing the activist s political views Some critics of the ACLU suggest that the ACLU became a partisan political organization following the Spock case After the Kent State shootings in ACLU leaders took another step toward politics by passing a resolution condemning the Vietnam War The resolution was based on various legal arguments including civil liberties violations and claiming that the war was illegal br Also in the ACLU held an internal symposium to discuss its dual roles providing direct legal support defense for accused in their initial trial benefiting only the individual defendant and appellate support providing amicus briefs during the appeal process to establish widespread legal precedent Historically the ACLU was known for its appellate work which led to landmark Supreme Court decisions but by of the ACLU s legal activities involved direct representation The symposium concluded that both roles were valid for the ACLU br br br Watergate era br br The ACLU supported The New York Times in its suit against the government requesting permission to publish the Pentagon Papers The court upheld the Times and ACLU in the New York Times Co v United States ruling which held that the government could not preemptively prohibit the publication of classified information and had to wait until after it was published to take action br On September the ACLU became first national organization to publicly call for the impeachment and removal from office of President Richard Nixon Six civil liberties violations were cited as grounds specific proved violations of the rights of political dissent usurpation of Congressional war making powers establishment of a personal secret police which committed crimes attempted interference in the trial of Daniel Ellsberg distortion of the system of justice and perversion of other Federal agencies One month later after the House of Representatives began an impeachment inquiry against him the organization released a page handbook detailing things citizens could do to bring about the impeachment of President Nixon This resolution when placed beside the earlier resolution opposing the Vietnam war convinced many ACLU critics particularly conservatives that the organization had transformed into a liberal political organization br br br Enclaves and new civil liberties br The decade from to saw an expansion of civil liberties Administratively the ACLU responded by appointing Aryeh Neier to take over from Pemberton as executive director in Neier embarked on an ambitious program to expand the ACLU he created the ACLU Foundation to raise funds and created several new programs to focus the ACLU s legal efforts By ACLU membership had reached br During those years the ACLU worked to expand legal rights in three directions new rights for persons within government run enclaves new rights for members of what it called victim groups and privacy rights for citizens in general At the same time the organization grew substantially The ACLU helped develop the field of constitutional law that governs enclaves which are groups of persons that live in conditions under government control Enclaves include mental hospital patients military members prisoners and students while at school The term enclave originated with Supreme Court justice Abe Fortas s use of the phrase schools may not be enclaves of totalitarianism in the Tinker v Des Moines decision br The ACLU initiated the legal field of student s rights with the Tinker v Des Moines case and expanded it with cases such as Goss v Lopez which required schools to provide students an opportunity to appeal suspensions br As early as the ACLU had taken a stand to protect the rights of the mentally ill when it drafted a model statute governing mental commitments In the s the ACLU opposed involuntary commitments unless it could be demonstrated that the person was a danger to himself or the community In the landmark O Connor v Donaldson decision the ACLU represented a non violent mental health patient who had been confined against his will for years and persuaded the Supreme Court to rule such involuntary confinements illegal The ACLU has also defended the rights of mentally ill individuals who are not dangerous but create disturbances The New York chapter of the ACLU defended Billie Boggs a woman with mental illness who exposed herself and defecated and urinated in public br Before prisoners had virtually no recourse to the court system because courts considered prisoners to have no civil rights That changed in the late s when the ACLU began representing prisoners subject to police brutality or deprived of religious reading material In the ACLU successfully sued to desegregate the Alabama prison system in the New York affiliate adopted a project to represent prisoners in New York prisons Private attorney Phil Hirschkop discovered degrading conditions in Virginia prisons following the Virginia State Penitentiary strike and won an important victory in s Landman v Royster which prohibited Virginia from treating prisoners in inhumane ways In the ACLU consolidated several prison rights efforts across the nation and created the National Prison Project The ACLU s efforts led to landmark cases such as Ruiz v Estelle requiring reform of the Texas prison system and in US Congress enacted the Prison Litigation Reform Act PLRA which codified prisoners rights br br br Victim groups br br During the s and s the ACLU expanded its scope to include what it referred to as victim groups namely women the poor and homosexuals Heeding the call of female members the ACLU endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment in and created the Women s Rights Project in The Women s Rights Project dominated the legal field handling more than twice as many cases as the National Organization for Women including breakthrough cases such as Reed v Reed Frontiero v Richardson and Taylor v Louisiana br ACLU leader Harriet Pilpel raised the issue of the rights of homosexuals in and two years later the ACLU formally endorsed gay rights In ACLU cooperating attorneys in Oregon filed the first federal civil rights case involving a claim of unconstitutional discrimination against a gay or lesbian public school teacher The US District Court held that a state statute that authorized school districts to fire teachers for immorality was unconstitutionally vague and awarded monetary damages to the teacher The court refused to reinstate the teacher and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that refusal by a to vote In the ACLU created the Sexual Privacy Project later the Gay and Lesbian Rights Project which combated discrimination against homosexuals This support continued into the s For example after then Senator Larry Craig was arrested for soliciting sex in a public restroom in the ACLU wrote an amicus brief for Craig saying that sex between consenting adults in public places was protected under privacy rights br The rights of the poor were another area that the ACLU expanded In and again in activists within the ACLU encouraged the organization to adopt a policy overhauling the welfare system and guaranteeing low income families a baseline income but the ACLU board did not approve the proposals However the ACLU played a key role in the King v Smith decision where the Supreme Court ruled that welfare benefits for children could not be denied by a state simply because the mother cohabited with a boyfriend br br br Reproductive Freedom Project br The ACLU founded the Reproductive Freedom Project in to defend individuals the government obstructs in cases involving access to abortions birth control or sexual education According to its mission statement the project works to provide access to reproductive health care for individuals The project also opposes abstinence only sex education arguing that it promotes an unwillingness to use contraceptives br In the Project filed Poe v Lynchburg Training School Hospital which attempted to overturn Buck v Bell the US Supreme Court decision which had allowed the Commonwealth of Virginia to legally sterilize persons it deemed to be mentally defective without their permission Though the Court did not overturn Buck v Bell in the state agreed to provide counseling and medical treatment to the survivors among the to people sterilized between and In the ACLU took part in and litigated Walker v Pierce the federal circuit court case that led to federal regulations to prevent Medicaid patients from being sterilized without their knowledge or consent In the Project litigated Hodgson v Minnesota which resulted in the Supreme Court overturning a state law requiring both parents to be notified before a minor could legally have an abortion In the s the Project provided legal assistance and resource kits to those who were being challenged for educating about sexuality and AIDS In the Project filed an amicus brief in Curtis v School Committee of Falmouth which allowed for the distribution of condoms in a public school br The Reproductive Freedom Project focuses on three ideas to reverse the shortage of trained abortion providers throughout the country to block state and federal welfare reform proposals that cut off benefits for children who are born to women already receiving welfare unmarried women or teenagers and to stop the elimination of vital reproductive health services as a result of hospital mergers and health care networks The Project proposes to achieve these goals through legal action and litigation br br br Privacy br The right to privacy is not explicitly identified in the US Constitution but the ACLU led the charge to establish such rights in the indecisive Poe v Ullman case which addressed a state statute outlawing contraception The issue arose again in Griswold v Connecticut and this time the Supreme Court adopted the ACLU s position and formally declared a right to privacy The New York affiliate of the ACLU pushed to eliminate anti abortion laws starting in a year before Griswold was decided in the ACLU itself formally adopted the right to abortion as a policy The ACLU led the defense in United States v Vuitch which expanded the right of physicians to determine when abortions were necessary These efforts culminated in one of the most controversial Supreme Court decisions Roe v Wade which legalized abortion throughout the United States The ACLU successfully argued against state bans on interracial marriage in the case of Loving v Virginia br Related to privacy the ACLU engaged in several battles to ensure that government records about individuals were kept private and to give individuals the right to review their records The ACLU supported several measures including the Fair Credit Reporting Act which required credit agencies to divulge credit information to individuals the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act which provided students the right to access their records and the Privacy Act which prevented the federal government from disclosing personal information without good cause br br br Allegations of bias br In the early s conservatives and libertarians began to criticize the ACLU for being too political and too liberal Legal scholar Joseph W Bishop wrote that the ACLU s trend to partisanship started with its defense of Spock s anti war protests Critics also blamed the ACLU for encouraging the Supreme Court to embrace judicial activism Critics claimed that the ACLU s support of controversial decisions like Roe v Wade and Griswold v Connecticut violated the intention of the authors of the Bill of Rights The ACLU became an issue in the presidential campaign when Republican candidate George H W Bush accused Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis a member of the ACLU of being a card carrying member of the ACLU br br br Skokie case br br In the National Socialist Party of America led by Frank Collin applied to the town of Skokie Illinois for a permit to hold a demonstration in the town park Skokie at the time had a majority population of Jews totaling of citizens some of whom were survivors of Nazi concentration camps Skokie refused to grant the NSPA a permit and passed ordinances against hate speech and military wear in addition to requiring an insurance bond Skokie s Village Council ordered village attorney Harvey Schwartz to seek an injunction to stop the demonstration The ACLU assisted Collin and appealed to federal court eventually prevailing in NSPA v Village of Skokie br The Skokie case was heavily publicized across America partially because Jewish groups such as the Jewish Defense League and Anti Defamation League strenuously objected to the demonstration leading many members of the ACLU to cancel their memberships The Illinois affiliate of the ACLU lost about of its membership and nearly one third of its budget The financial strain from the controversy led to layoffs at local chapters After the membership crisis died down the ACLU sent out a fund raising appeal which explained their rationale for the Skokie case and raised over in dollars br br br Reagan era br br The inauguration of Ronald Reagan as president in ushered in an eight year period of conservative leadership in the US government Under Reagan s leadership the government pushed a conservative social agenda br The Arkansas creationism statute which required schools to teach the biblical account of creation as a scientific alternative to evolution The ACLU won the case in the McLean v Arkansas decision br In the ACLU became involved in a case involving the distribution of child pornography New York v Ferber In an amicus brief the ACLU argued that child pornography that violates the three prong obscenity test should be outlawed However the law was overly restrictive because it banned artistic displays and non obscene material The court did not adopt the ACLU s position br During the presidential election Vice President George H W Bush noted that his opponent Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis had described himself as a card carrying member of the ACLU and used that as evidence that Dukakis was a strong passionate liberal and out of the mainstream The phrase subsequently was used by the organization in an advertising campaign br br br Free speech br In ruling unanimously in the case of Reno v American Civil Liberties Union the Supreme Court voided the anti indecency provisions of the Communications Decency Act the CDA finding they violated the freedom of speech provisions of the First Amendment In their decision the Supreme Court held that the CDA s use of the undefined terms indecent and patently offensive will provoke uncertainty among speakers about how the two standards relate to each other and just what they mean br In Marvin Johnson a legislative counsel for the ACLU stated that proposed anti spam legislation infringed on free speech by denying anonymity and by forcing spam to be labeled as such Standardized labeling is compelled speech He also stated It s relatively simple to click and delete The debate found the ACLU joining with the Direct Marketing Association and the Center for Democracy and Technology in in criticizing a bipartisan bill in the House of Representatives As early as the ACLU had taken a strong position that nearly all spam legislation was improper although it has supported opt out requirements in some cases The ACLU opposed the CAN SPAM act suggesting that it could have a chilling effect on speech in cyberspace It has been criticized for this position br In the ACLU of Washington State joined with a pro gun rights organization the Second Amendment Foundation and prevailed in a lawsuit against the North Central Regional Library District NCRL in Washington for its policy of refusing to disable restrictions upon an adult patron s request Library patrons attempting to access pro gun web sites were blocked and the library refused to remove the blocks In the ACLU sued the same library system for refusing to disable temporarily at the request of an adult patron Internet filters which blocked access to Google Images br In the ACLU challenged a Missouri law prohibiting picketing outside veterans funerals The ACLU filed the suit in support of the Westboro Baptist Church and Shirley Phelps Roper who were threatened with arrest The Westboro Baptist Church is well known for its picket signs that contain messages such as God Hates Fags Thank God for Dead Soldiers and Thank God for The ACLU issued a statement calling the legislation a law that infringes on Shirley Phelps Roper s rights to religious liberty and free speech The ACLU prevailed in the lawsuit br The ACLU argued in an amicus brief to the Supreme Court that a decision on the constitutionality of a Massachusetts law required the consideration of additional evidence because lower courts have undervalued the right to engage in sidewalk counseling The law prohibited sidewalk counselors from approaching women outside abortion facilities and offering them alternatives to abortion but allowed escorts to speak with them and accompany them into the building In overturning the law in McCullen v Coakley the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that it violated the counselors freedom of speech and constituted viewpoint discrimination br In the ACLU filed an amicus brief in Citizens United v FEC arguing that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of violated the First Amendment right to free speech by curtailing political speech This stance on the landmark Citizens United case caused considerable disagreement within the organization resulting in a discussion about its future stance during a quarterly board meeting in On March the ACLU reaffirmed its stance in support of the Supreme Court s Citizens United ruling at the same time voicing support for expanded public financing of election campaigns and stating the organization would firmly oppose any future constitutional amendment limiting free speech br In the ACLU filed suit on behalf of the Ku Klux Klan of Georgia claiming that the KKK was unfairly rejected from the state s Adopt a Highway program The ACLU prevailed in the lawsuit br br br Move towards identity politics br Some have claimed the ACLU is reducing its support of unpopular free speech specifically by declining to defend speech made by conservatives in favor of identity politics political correctness and progressivism Instead critics contend that the organization has instead become a progressive advocacy organization intensely focused on identity politics br One basis of these allegations was a statement the ACLU president made to a reporter after the death of a counter protester during the Unite the Right rally in Virginia where Romero told a reporter that the ACLU would no longer support legal cases of activists that wish to carry guns at their protests Another basis for these claims was an internal ACLU memo dated June discussing factors to evaluate when deciding whether to take a case The memo listed several factors to consider including the extent to which the speech may assist in advancing the goals of white supremacists or others whose views are contrary to our values br Some analysts viewed this as a retreat from the ACLU s historically strong support of First Amendment rights regardless of whether minorities were negatively impacted by the speech citing the ACLU s past support for certain KKK and Nazi legal cases The memo s authors stated that the memo did not define a change in official ACLU policy but was intended as a guideline to assist ACLU affiliates in deciding which cases to take br In the ACLU responded to the criticisms by denying that they are reducing their support for unpopular First Amendment causes and listing cases from to where the ACLU supported a party holding an unpopular or repugnant viewpoint The cases included one which challenged college restrictions on hate speech a case defending a Catholic school s right to discriminate in hiring and a case that defended antisemitic protesters who marched outside a synagogue br In the National Labor Relations Board sued the ACLU in an unfair labor practice case after the ACLU fired an Asian attorney for criticizing her Black bosses The ACLU contended that the employee s use of phrases like the beatings will continue until morale improves was racially coded and that it caused serious harm to Black members of the A C L U community According to Jeremy W Peters of The New York Times critics of the ACLU saw the firing as a sign of how far the group has strayed from its core mission defending free speech and has instead aligned itself with a progressive politics that is intensely focused on identity br br br LGBTQ issues br In the ACLU lost the Boy Scouts of America v Dale case which had asked the Supreme Court to require the Boy Scouts of America to drop their policy of prohibiting homosexuals from becoming Boy Scout leaders br In March the ACLU along with Lambda Legal and the National Center for Lesbian Rights sued the state of California on behalf of six same sex couples who were denied marriage licenses That case Woo v Lockyer was

public schools in the United States br On January the ACLU settled with the federal government in Collins v United States that provided for the payment of full separation pay to servicemembers discharged under don t ask don t tell since November who had previously been granted only half that br In the ACLU filed a brief siding with a school district that had a policy of using preferred pronouns for transgender students Some analysts felt this was a retreat from the ACLU s historical defense of the First Amendment because the ACLU was opposing the teachers who were disciplined for refusing to use the preferred pronouns br br br Anti terrorism issues br br After the September attacks the federal government instituted a broad range of new measures to combat terrorism including the passage of the Patriot Act The ACLU challenged many of the measures claiming that they violated rights regarding due process privacy illegal searches and cruel and unusual punishment An ACLU policy statement states br br Our way forward lies in decisively turning our backs on the policies and practices that violate our greatest strength our Constitution and the commitment it embodies to the rule of law Liberty and security do not compete in a zero sum game our freedoms are the very foundation of our strength and security The ACLU s National Security Project advocates for national security policies that are consistent with the Constitution the rule of law and fundamental human rights The Project litigates cases relating to detention torture discrimination surveillance censorship and secrecy br During the ensuing debate regarding the proper balance of civil liberties and security the membership of the ACLU increased by bringing the group s total enrollment to The growth continued and by August ACLU membership was greater than It remained at that level through br The ACLU has been a vocal opponent of the Patriot Act of the PATRIOT Act of and associated legislation made in response to the threat of domestic terrorism In response to a requirement of the USA PATRIOT Act the ACLU withdrew from the Combined Federal Campaign charity drive The campaign required ACLU employees to be checked against a federal anti terrorism watch list The ACLU has stated that it would reject in contributions from private individuals rather than submit to a government
