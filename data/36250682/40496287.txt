Touch ID is an electronic fingerprint recognition feature designed and released by Apple Inc that allows users to unlock devices make purchases in the various Apple digital media stores iTunes Store App Store and Apple Books Store and authenticate Apple Pay online or in apps It can also be used to lock and unlock password protected notes on iPhone and iPad Touch ID was first introduced in iPhones with the iPhone s in In Apple introduced a faster second generation Touch ID in the iPhone s a year later in it made its laptop debut in the MacBook Pro integrated on the right side of the Touch Bar Touch ID has been used on all iPads since the iPad Air was introduced in In MacBooks each user account can have up to three fingerprints and a total of five fingerprints across the system Fingerprint information is stored locally in a secure enclave on the Apple A and later chips not in the cloud a design choice intended to secure fingerprint information from users or malicious attackers br Touch ID was retained on iPhone nd generation iPhone SE rd generation iPhone SE and the base model iPads while all other iPhones since the iPhone X in and the higher end iPad Pro have adopted Face ID recognition Several iPads that do not have FaceID such as the th th and th generation iPad Air th generation iPad Mini and the th generation iPad feature a new sleep wake button with an integrated TouchID sensor br In and Apple unveiled a new Magic Keyboard with optional Touch ID for its line of iMacs Mac Studios and Mac minis and also the MacBook Pro br br br History br br In Apple acquired AuthenTec a company focused on fingerprint reading and identification management software for million The acquisition led commentators to expect a fingerprint reading feature Following leaks and speculation in early September the next year the iPhone s was unveiled on September and was the first phone on a major US carrier to feature the technology Apple s Vice President of Marketing Phil Schiller announced the feature at Apple s iPhone media event and spent several minutes the major portion of the conference discussing the feature br Wells Fargo analyst Maynard Um predicted on September that a fingerprint sensor in the iPhone s would help mobile commerce and boost adoption in the corporate environment As consumers increasingly rely on mobile devices to transact and store personal data a reliable device side authentication solution may become a necessity Um said br With the unveiling of the iPhone and Plus at a keynote event on September Touch ID was expanded from being used to unlock the device and authenticating App Store purchases to also authenticating Apple Pay The iPhone s incorporates a second generation Touch ID sensor that is up to twice as fast as the first generation sensor found in the s and SE st generation phones As of August the iPhone s s Plus Plus Plus SE nd generation SE rd generation and later MacBook Pro and later MacBook Air iPad Pro nd generation and later iPad Air rd generation and later and iPad mini th generation or later are the Apple devices which use the second generation sensor The new Touch ID unlocks almost instantly and posed an issue as it unlocks too fast to read notifications on the lock screen This is remedied with the iOS update in which a user must press the home button to have the home screen appear This however can be changed in iOS settings so that users can go directly to the home screen after resting their finger on the sensor similar to previous versions of iOS Solely placing a finger on the sensor will only unlock the iPhone unless said setting is enabled and no notifications are currently being displayed on the lock screen br br br Generations br br br First generation br br br Second generation br br br Third generation br br br Hardware br br Touch ID is built into the home top button which is built of laser cut sapphire crystal and does not scratch easily scratching would prevent Touch ID from working It features a stainless steel detection ring to detect the user s finger without pressing it There is no longer a rounded square icon in the home button nor is it concave br The sensor uses capacitive touch to detect the user s fingerprint The sensor has a thickness of m with pixels per inch resolution The user s finger can be oriented in any direction and it will still be read Apple says it can read sub epidermal skin layers and it will be easy to set up and will improve with every use The sensor passes a small current through one s finger to create a fingerprint map of the user s dermis Up to fingerprint maps can be stored in the Secure Enclave br br br Security and privacy br br Touch ID can be bypassed using passcodes set up by the user br br Fingerprint data are stored on the secure enclave inside the Apple A A A X A A X A A X A A A X A A A processors of an iOS device or the T T on Intel Macs and M M M in the case of Macs with Apple Silicon and iPad Pro released in and later iPad Air released in and later and not on Apple servers nor on iCloud From the Efficient Texture Comparison patent covering Apple s Touch ID technology In order to overcome potential security drawbacks Apple s invention includes a process of collapsing the full maps into a sort of checksum hash function or histogram For example each encrypted ridge map template can have some lower resolution pattern computed and associated with the ridge map One exemplary pattern could be a histogram of e g the most common angles e g a dimensional D array of common angles The exemplary pattern could include in each slot an average value over a respective vector of the map The exemplary pattern could include in each slot a sum of the values over a respective vector of the map The exemplary pattern could include the smallest or largest value within a respective vector of the map or could be a difference between a largest and a smallest value within the respective vector of the map Numerous other exemplary embodiments are also possible and any other exemplary pattern calculation can be used where the exemplary pattern includes enough associated information to narrow the candidate list while omitting enough associated information that the unsecured pattern cannot or cannot easily be reverse engineered into a matching texture If the user s phone has been rebooted has not been unlocked for hours has its SIM card removed or has Emergency SOS activated only the passcode a user has created not their fingerprint can be used to unlock the device or during other specific use cases br In September the German Chaos Computer Club announced that it had bypassed Apple s Touch ID security A spokesman for the group stated We hope that this finally puts to rest the illusions people have about fingerprint biometrics It is plain pity to use something that you can t change and that you leave everywhere every day as a security token Similar results have been achieved by using PVA Glue to take a cast of the finger Others have also used Chaos Computer Club s method but concluded that it is not an easy process in either time or effort given that the user has to use a high resolution photocopy of a complete fingerprint special chemicals and expensive equipment and because the spoofing process takes some time to achieve br br br Impact br In a New York magazine opinion piece technology columnist Kevin Roose argued that consumers are generally not interested in fingerprint recognition preferring to use passcodes instead Traditionally he wrote only businesspeople used biometric recognition although they believe Touch ID may help bring fingerprint recognition to the masses Roose stated the feature will also allow application developers to experiment should Apple open up access to Touch ID later on which they have done but that those wary of surveillance agencies such as the US National Security Agency may still choose not to use Touch ID br Roose also noted that fingerprint technology still has some issues such as the potential to be hacked or of the device s not recognizing the fingerprint for example when the finger has been injured br Adrian Kingsley Hughes writing for ZDNet said Touch ID could be useful in bring your own device situations He said the biometric protection adds another layer of security removing the ability of people to look over others shoulders and read their passcode password He added that Touch ID would prevent children from racking up thousands of dollars in unwanted purchases when using iPhones owned by adults He observed that Touch ID was Apple s response to the large number of iPhone crimes and that the new feature would deter would be iPhone thieves Moreover he notes that the feature is one of the few that distinguish the iPhone S from the C br Roose also stated the feature is intended to deter theft However Brent Kennedy a vulnerability analyst at the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team expressed concern that Touch ID could be hacked and suggested that people not rely on it right away Forbes noted a history of fingerprints being spoofed in the past and cautioned that the fingerprints on a stolen iPhone might be used to gain unauthorized access However the article did say that biometrics technology had improved since tests on spoofing fingerprint readers had been conducted br Kingsley Hughes suggested the Touch ID as a form of two factor authentication combining something one knows the password with something you are the fingerprint Forbes said that if two factor authentication is available it will be an overall improvement for security br Forbes columnist Andy Greenberg said the fact that fingerprint data was stored on the local device and not in a centralized database was a win for security br br br See also br Face ID br br br br br br External links br About Touch ID advanced security technology official site br Use Touch ID on
