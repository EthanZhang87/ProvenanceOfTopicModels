Plot br On October year old Harvard University sophomore Mark Zuckerberg is dumped by his girlfriend Erica Albright Returning to his dorm Zuckerberg writes an insulting post about Albright on his LiveJournal blog He creates a campus website called Facemash by downloading photos of female students from house face books then allowing site visitors to rate their attractiveness After traffic to the site crashes parts of Harvard s computer network Zuckerberg is given six months of academic probation However Facemash s popularity attracts the attention of twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and their business partner Divya Narendra The trio invites Zuckerberg to work on Harvard Connection a social network exclusive to Harvard students and aimed at dating Zuckerberg approaches his friend Eduardo Saverin with an idea for Thefacebook a social networking website that would be exclusive to Ivy League students Saverin provides in seed funding allowing Zuckerberg to build the website which quickly becomes popular When they learn of Thefacebook the Winklevoss twins and Narendra are incensed believing that Zuckerberg stole their idea while misleading them by stalling development on the Harvard Connection website They raise their complaint with Harvard President Larry Summers who is dismissive and sees no value in disciplinary action on Thefacebook or Zuckerberg br Saverin and Zuckerberg meet fellow student Christy Lee who asks them to Facebook me which impresses them As Thefacebook grows in popularity Zuckerberg expands the network to Yale Columbia and Stanford Lee arranges for Saverin and Zuckerberg to meet Napster co founder Sean Parker who presents a billion dollar vision for the company Zuckerberg is impressed but Saverin dismisses him as paranoid and delusional Parker also suggests dropping the in Thefacebook and simply renaming the site to Facebook Later Zuckerberg relocates the company to Palo Alto on Parker s advice Saverin remains in New York to work on business development Parker later moves into the house that Zuckerberg is using as a base of operations and becomes more involved with the company much to Saverin s annoyance br While competing in the Henley Royal Regatta for Harvard against the Hollandia Roeiclub the Winklevoss twins discover that Facebook has expanded to Europe with Oxford Cambridge and LSE and decide to sue the company for intellectual property theft Meanwhile Saverin objects to Parker making business decisions for Facebook and freezes the company s bank account in the resulting dispute He relents when Zuckerberg reveals that they have secured from angel investor Peter Thiel After traveling to the company s new headquarters on the pretense of attending a business meeting and millionth user party Saverin becomes enraged when he discovers that the new investment deal allows his share of Facebook to be diluted from to without diluting the ownership percentage of any other owner He confronts

has security eject him from the building Later Parker is apprehended for cocaine possession with a minor at a party celebrating one million users He attempts to blame Saverin so Zuckerberg cuts ties with him telling him to go home br In separate depositions the Winklevoss twins claim that Zuckerberg stole their idea while Saverin claims his shares of Facebook were unfairly diluted when the company was incorporated Marylin Delpy a junior lawyer for the defense informs Zuckerberg that they will settle with Saverin since the sordid details of Facebook s founding and Zuckerberg s callous attitude will make him unsympathetic to a jury Alone Zuckerberg sends a Facebook friend request to Albright and repeatedly refreshes the page br br br Cast br br Josh Pence is the body double for Hammer whose likeness was digitally imposed onto Pence s body He is listed in the end credits as playing Tyler Winklevoss alongside Hammer though he also shot scenes as Cameron He also appears in a cameo role as the man being detoured from the bathroom by Zuckerberg and Saverin br br br Production br br br Screenplay br Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin said What attracted me to the film project had nothing to do with Facebook The invention itself is as modern as it gets but the story is as old as storytelling the themes of friendship loyalty jealousy class and power He said he read an unfinished draft of The Accidental Billionaires when the publisher began shopping it around for a film adaptation Sorkin added I was reading it and somewhere on page three I said yes It was the fastest I said yes to anything They wanted me to start right away Ben and I were kind of doing our research at the same time sort of along parallel lines br According to Sorkin Mezrich did not send him material from his book as he wrote it Two or three times we d get together I d go to Boston or we d meet in New York and kind of compare notes and share information but I didn t see the book until he was done with it By the time I saw the book I was probably percent done with the screenplay Sorkin elaborated br br There s a lot of available research and I also did a lot of first person research with a number of the people that were involved in the story I can t go too deeply into that because most of the people did it on the condition of anonymity but what I found was that two lawsuits were brought against Facebook at roughly the same time that the defendant plaintiffs witnesses all came into a deposition room and swore under oath and three different versions of the story were told Instead of choosing one and deciding that s the truest one or choosing one and deciding that s the juiciest one I decided to dramatize the idea that there were three different versions of the story being told That s how I came up with the structure of the deposition room br br br Casting br Casting began in mid with Jesse Eisenberg Justin Timberlake and Andrew Garfield announced to star Jonah Hill was in contention for Timberlake s role but director David Fincher passed on him In October Brenda Song Rooney Mara Armie Hammer Shelby Young and Josh Pence were cast Max Minghella and Dakota Johnson were also confirmed In a interview with The Baltimore Sun Eisenberg said Even though I ve gotten to be in some wonderful movies this character seems so much more overtly insensitive in so many ways that seem more real to me in the best way I don t often get cast as insensitive people so it feels very comfortable fresh and exciting as if you never have to worry about the audience Not that I worry about the audience anyway it should be just the furthest thing from your mind The Social Network is the biggest relief I ve ever had in a movie In it was mentioned that Rashida Jones would appear as Marylin Delpy br br br Filming br Principal photography began in October in Cambridge Massachusetts Scenes were filmed around the campuses of two Massachusetts prep schools Phillips Academy and Milton Academy Additional scenes were filmed on the campus of Wheelock College which was set up to be Harvard s campus Harvard has turned down most requests for on location filming ever since the filming of Love Story which caused significant physical damage to trees on campus Filming took place on the Keyser and Wyman quadrangles in the Homewood campus of Johns Hopkins University from November which also doubled for Harvard in the film The first scene in the film where Zuckerberg is with his girlfriend took takes to finish The film was shot on the Red One digital cinema camera The rowing scenes with the Winklevoss brothers were filmed at Community Rowing Inc in Newton Massachusetts and at the Henley Royal Regatta miniature faking process was used in a sequence showing a rowing event at the latter Although a significant portion of the latter half of the film is set in Silicon Valley the filmmakers opted to shoot those scenes in Los Angeles and Pasadena br Armie Hammer who portrayed the Winklevoss twins acted alongside body double Josh Pence while his scenes were filmed His face was later digitally grafted onto Pence s face during post production while other scenes used split screen photography Pence was concerned about having no face time during the role but after considerable musing thought of the role as a no brainer He also appears in a cameo role elsewhere in the film Hammer states that director David Fincher likes to push himself and likes to push technology and is one of the most technologically minded guys I ve ever seen This included sending the actors to twin boot camp for months to learn everything about the Winklevosses br br br Rowing production br br Community Rowing Inc held a casting call and a tryout for rowing extras some were graduates from Harvard Northeastern University Boston University George Washington University and Trinity College as well as local club rowers from Union Boat Club and Riverside Boat Club None of the cast rowing extras for the Henley Royal Regatta racing scene appeared in the film filming for the race was originally planned to take place in Los Angeles but Fincher decided to film in England during production br David Fincher hired Loyola Marymount coach Dawn Reagan to help train Josh Pence and Armie Hammer While Hammer was new to the sport Pence rowed previously at Dartmouth College br The indoor rowing scene was

films of Steven Soderbergh director David Fincher s friend he was contacted by Ce n Chaffin in late to work on the key art for The Social Network which had to make sole use of one approved photograph that of Eisenberg s head As he wanted to highlight the tremendous drama that went with Mark Zuckerberg s success Kellerhouse thought of the tagline You don t get to million friends without making a few enemies he would later adjust the line to million friends in anticipation of Facebook reaching million users by the film s release date Kellerhouse s poster has been praised for its unique and striking design and alongside his work for the film I m Still Here has since become influential in film marketing posters for The King s Speech and The Armstrong Lie strongly evoked the poster s

s directing as the right intensity and claustrophobia for a story that takes place largely in a stupefyingly male environment at Harvard University in In her review for The Verge Kaitlyn Tiffany wrote positive comments on Aaron Sorkin s screenplay writing that his reflex for writing witty whiny men with outsized intellect and poorly disguised narcissism serves as an advantage instead of a handicap

with some reviewers stating that it was a persistent source of simmering tension in the movie and a masterpiece br Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times giving it four stars and naming it the best film

Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film his first full four star rating of the year and said The Social Network is the movie of the year But Fincher and Sorkin triumph by taking it further Lacing their scathing wit with an aching sadness they define the dark irony of the past decade The Harvard Crimson review called it flawless and gave it five stars br Joe Morgenstern in The Wall Street Journal praised the film as exhilarating but noted The biographical part takes liberties with its subject Aaron Sorkin based his screenplay on The Accidental Billionaires so everything that s seen isn t necessarily to be believed br Nathan Heller of Slate wrote a negative review of the film describing it as rote and deeply mediocre as well as maddeningly generic and said that Sorkin and Fincher s Harvard is a citadel of old money regatta blazers and if I am not misreading the implication here a Jewish underclass striving beneath the heel of a WASP centric socially draconian culture to get the university this wrong in this movie is no small matter br The Social Network appeared on film critics top ten lists of the best films of based on Metacritic s aggregation Out of the critics ranked the

nearly perfectly on the film thanks in large part to Aaron Sorkin s Oscar winning screenplay Its finds the loquacious scribe at his best with all the verbal takedowns and rapid fire back and forths we

going to be a lot funnier than people might expect it to be The Cardinal Courier stated that the film was about greed obsession unpredictability and sex and asked Although there are over million Facebook users does this mean Facebook can become a profitable blockbuster movie br At the D conference hosted by D All Things Digital on June host Kara Swisher told Zuckerberg she knew he was not happy with The Social Network being based on him to which he replied I just wished that nobody made a movie of me while I was still alive Zuckerberg stated to Oprah Winfrey that the drama and partying of the film is mostly fiction and that he had spent most of the past six years focusing working hard and coding Facebook Speaking to an audience at Stanford University Zuckerberg said that instead of making Facebook to get girls he made it because he enjoyed building things He added that the film accurately depicted his wardrobe saying It s interesting the stuff that they focused on getting right like every single shirt and fleece they had in that movie is actually a shirt or fleece that I own br Facebook co founder Dustin Moskovitz called the film a dramatization of history it is interesting to see my past rewritten in a way that emphasizes things that didn t matter like the Winklevosses who I ve still never even met and had no part in the work we did to create the site over the past years and leaves out things that really did like the many other people in our lives at the time who supported us in innumerable ways According to Moskovitz br br A lot of exciting things happened in but mostly we just worked a lot and stressed out about things the version in the trailer seems a lot more exciting so I m just going to choose to remember that we drank ourselves silly and had a lot of sex with coeds The plot of the book script unabashedly attacked Zuckerberg but I actually felt like a lot of his positive qualities come out truthfully in the trailer soundtrack aside At the end of the day they cannot help but portray him as the driven forward thinking genius that he is br Co founder Eduardo Saverin said the movie was clearly intended to be entertainment and not a fact based documentary Sean Parker described the film as a complete work of fiction and the depiction of him as a morally reprehensible human being and said that he remained friends with Saverin Sorkin said I don t want my fidelity to be to the truth I want it to be to storytelling What is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracy s sake and can we not have the true be the enemy of the good br Journalist Jeff Jarvis acknowledged the film was well crafted but called it the anti social movie objecting to Sorkin s decision to change various events and characters for dramatic effect and dismissing it as the story that those who resist the change society is undergoing want to see Technology broadcaster Leo Laporte concurred calling the film anti geek and misogynistic Sorkin responded to these allegations by saying I was writing about a very angry and deeply misogynistic group of people br Andrew Clark of The Guardian wrote that there s something insidious about this genre of docudrama scriptwriting wondering if a year old businessman really deserves to have his name dragged through the mud in a murky mixture of fact and imagination for the general entertainment of the movie viewing public Clark added I m not sure whether Mark Zuckerberg is a punk a genius or both But I won t be seeing The Social Network to find out br Mashable founder and CEO Pete Cashmore blogging for CNN said If the Facebook founder Zuckerberg is concerned about being represented as anything but a genius with an industrious work ethic he can breathe a sigh of relief Jessi Hempel a technology writer for Fortune who says she has known Zuckerberg for a long time wrote of the film br br The real life Zuckerberg was maniacally focused on building a web site that could potentially connect everyone on the planet By contrast in the film he seems more obsessed with achieving the largesse that bad boy Sean Parker an original Napster founder portrays when he arrives to meet Zuckerberg at a New York restaurant br Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig wrote in The New Republic that Sorkin s screenplay does not acknowledge the real villain of the story br br The total and absolute absurdity of the world where the engines of a federal lawsuit get cranked up to adjudicate the hurt feelings because our idea was stolen of entitled Harvard undergraduates is completely missed by Sorkin We can t know enough from the film to know whether there was actually any substantial legal claim here Sorkin has been upfront about the fact that there are fabrications aplenty lacing the story But from the story as told we certainly know enough to know that any legal system that would allow these kids to extort million from the most successful business this century should be ashamed of itself Did Zuckerberg breach his contract Maybe for which the damages are more like not million Did he steal a trade secret Absolutely not Did he steal any other property Absolutely not the code for Facebook was his and the idea of a social network is not a patent It wasn t justice that gave the twins million it was the fear of a random and inefficient system of law That system is a tax on innovation and creativity That tax is the real villain here not the innovator it burdened br In an onstage discussion with the Huffington Post co founder Arianna Huffington in Facebook s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg said the film was very Hollywood and mainly fiction She said that in real life Zuckerberg was just sitting around with his friends in front of his computer ordering pizza Who wants to go see that for two hours HarvardConnection co founder Divya Narendra said that he was surprised to see himself portrayed by the non Indian actor Max Minghella but said he did a good job in pushing the dialogue forward and creating a sense of urgency in what was a very frustrating period br br br Legacy br br br Preliminary impact br Since its release The Social Network has inspired involvement in start ups and social media Bob Lefsetz has stated that watching this movie makes you want to run from the theatre grab your laptop and build your own empire noting that The Social Network has helped fuel an emerging perception that techies have become the new rock stars This has led Dave Knox to comment that fifteen years from now we might just look back and realize this movie inspired our next great generation of entrepreneurs After seeing the movie Zuckerberg was quoted as saying he is interested to see what effect The Social Network has on entrepreneurship noting that he gets lots of messages from people who claim that they have been very much inspired to start their own company Saverin echoed these sentiments stating that the film may inspire countless others to create and take that leap to start a new business In one such instance the co founders of Wall Street Magnate confirmed that they were inspired to create the fantasy trading community after watching The Social Network br Following his success with the film Sorkin became attached to another project about a technology company writing the script for the biopic Steve Jobs which used a similar format Another Facebook film may be produced as Sheryl Sandberg has signed a deal with Sony Pictures Entertainment to develop her book Lean In Women Work and the Will to Lead into a movie br br br Post s assessment br Following the close of the decade The Social Network was recognized as one of the best films of the s Metacritic reported that it was listed on over film critics top ten lists for the s including eight first place rankings and four second place rankings Metacritic ranked The Social Network third overall following Mad Max Fury Road and Moonlight Esquire named The Social Network the best of the s calling it Citizen Kane for the Internet age and dubbing it the movie of our new millennium With Facebook going from a utopian world shrinking force of good to a potential threat to democracy Esquire wrote Fincher seemed to sense all of this and more long before anyone else And his brilliant troubling film bristles with that queasy sense of prophecy and prescience Polygon calling The Social Network the best film of the decade wrote The Social Network by chance or by design has become one of the most immensely relevant movies of this decade But after nearly a decade of watching Facebook move fast and break things including news websites social video politics etc the movie s tangible sense of tension can easily be reinterpreted as foreboding for what comes after you make a billion friends Director Quentin Tarantino called the film the best of the s singling out the script by Aaron Sorkin whom he described as the greatest active dialogist br Rolling Stone ranked The Social Network second after Moonlight on its end of decade list describing it as one deliciously re watchable preview of the apocalypse as entertaining and cheeky as it is troubling and startlingly prescient Time Out named it the fourth best of the decade Powered by a relentless clinical Aaron Sorkin script directed with sinuous grace by David Fincher and loaded with smirking smart ass central performances The Social Network is arguably the most important and prophetic film of our era itself a depressing thought ScreenCrush ranked The Social Network eighth referring to it as Fincher s spiritual sequel to Fight Club another story of a embittered lonely man who discovers unleashing his rage at society has unexpected consequences Mashable listing The Social Network among the top films of the s said of the story It was everything young people could be and everything older generations feared in us before a decade of blaming us for problems we didn t create and can t solve IndieWire ranked The Social Network sixteenth among the decade s films writing The Social Network is both a thrilling queasy exploration of how Facebook came to be and a searing indictment of what it would inevitably become Inverse listed the film among those defining class rage in the s As a gently prodding diagnosis of class conflict The Social Network is a logical place to start br br br Possible sequel br In January Sorkin revealed that Rudin has suggested the development of a screenplay for a sequel noting A lot of very interesting dramatic stuff has happened since the movie ends Sorkin also mentioned that there was indeed enough material to create a sequel On July Eisenberg expressed his interests in starring in the proposed sequel stating that Sorkin is a genius and if he chooses to write about something I ll obviously be interested In October a decade after the film s release Sorkin announced that he would only write the sequel s script if David Fincher returned as director In Fincher told The Guardian that he and Sorkin have discussed a sequel but said that s a can of worms On April Sorkin said he had been working on the script for a new
