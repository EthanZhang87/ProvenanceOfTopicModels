Foursquare LinkedIn and Twitter and email services such as POP and IMAP br Trillian no longer supports Windows Live Messenger or Skype as these services have combined and Microsoft chose to discontinue Skypekit that was used for connection They also no longer support connecting to MySpace or a distinct connection for Gmail Hotmail or Yahoo Mail although these can still be connected to via POP or IMAP Currently Trillian supports Facebook Google Jabber XMPP and Olark br Initially released July as a freeware IRC client the first commercial version Trillian Pro was published on September The program was named after Trillian a fictional character in The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams A previous version of the official web site even had a tribute to Douglas Adams on its front page On August Trillian Astra for Windows was released along with its own Astra network Trillian for Windows was released in May and Trillian was initially released in February br br br Features br br br Connection to multiple IM services br Trillian connects to multiple instant messaging services without the need of running multiple clients Users can create multiple connections to the same service and can also group connections under separate identities to prevent confusion All contacts are gathered under the same contact list Contacts are not bound to their own IM service groups and can be dragged and dropped freely Trillian represents each service with a different colored sphere Prior versions used the corporate logos for each service but these were removed to avoid copyright issues although some skins still use the original icons The Trillian designers chose a color coding scheme based on the underground maps used by the London Underground that uses different colors to differentiate between different lines br br br IM services br Green And Blue for Trillian Astra Network br Grey for IRC br Amber and Dark Gray for Bonjour Rendezvous br Purple for Jabber XMPP partially broken as of br Teal and Amber for Google Talk discontinued as of br Blue And Teal for Facebook discontinued as of br br br Mail services br A White Envelope for POP emails br a Manila Envelope for IMAP emails br a Teal Envelope for Twitter br Prior versions of Trillian supported br br Microsoft Exchange br Lotus Sametime br Novell GroupWise Messenger br br br Metacontact br To eliminate duplicates and simplify the structure of the contact list users can bundle multiple contact entries for the same person into one entry in the contact list using the Metacontact feature similarly to Ayttm s fallback messaging feature Subcontacts will appear under the metacontact as small icons aligned in a manner of a tree br br br Activity history br Trillian Pro comes with Activity History and both log the history as both plain text files and as XML files Pro has a History Manager that shows the chat history and allows the user to add bookmarks for revision later on XML based history makes the log easy to manipulate searchable and extendable for future functions br br br Stream manipulation br Trillian Pro also has a stream manipulation feature labelled time travel which allows the user to record and subsequently review pause rewind and fast forward live video and audio sessions br br br SecureIM br SecureIM is an encryption system built into the Trillian Instant Messenger Client br It encrypts messages from user to user so no passively observing node between the two is supposedly able to read the encrypted messages SecureIM does not authenticate its messages and therefore it is susceptible to active attacks including simple forms of man in the middle attacks br According to Cerulean Studios the makers of Trillian SecureIM enciphers messages with bit Blowfish encryption It only works with the OSCAR protocol and if both chat partners use Trillian br However the key used for encryption is established using a Diffie Hellman key exchange which only uses a bit prime number as modulus which is extremely insecure and can be broken within minutes on a standard PC br br br Instant lookup br Starting with version in both the Basic and Pro suites Trillian makes use of the English language version of the Wikipedia free online encyclopedia for real time referencing using its database of free knowledge The feature is employed directly within a conversation window of a user When one or more words are entered by either user Trillian checks all words against a database file and if a match is found the word appears with a dotted green underline When users point their mouse over the word the lead paragraph of the corresponding article is downloaded from Wikipedia and displayed on screen as a tooltip When users click on the underlined word they are given the choice to visit the article online br br br Emotiblips br Emotiblips are the video equivalent of an emoticon During video sessions the user may stream a song or video to the other user in real time One can send MP s WAVs WMVs and MPGs with this feature QuickTime MOV files as Emotiblips are not currently supported br br br Hidden smileys br In version to the current the default emoticon set contains emoticons that don t appear in the menu but can be used in conversations Some of these are animations that can only be viewed in Trillian Pro but all of them can be used regardless br br br Skins and interfaces Discontinued br Trillian has its own unique skinning engine known as SkinXML Many skins have been developed for Trillian and they can be downloaded from the official skins gallery or deviantArt br Trillian also came with an easier skinning language Stixe which is essentially a set of XML Entities that simplifies repetitive codes and allows skinners to share XML and graphics in the form of emoticon packs sound packs and interfaces br The default skins of Trillian are designed by Madelena Mak Trillian Cordillera was used in Trillian x while Trillian Whistler has been the default skin for Trillian since Pro Small cosmetic changes were noticeable in each major release br The Trillian Astra features a brand new design for the front end UI named Trillian Cordonata br br br Plugins Discontinued br Trillian is a closed source application but the Pro version can be extended by plugins Plugins by Cerulean Studios itself include spell check weather monitor a mini browser for viewing AIM profiles Winamp song title scroller stock exchange monitor RSS feedreader and conversation abilities for the Logitech G keyboard as well as a plug in for the XMPP and Bonjour networks Others have developed various plug ins such as a games plug in which can be used to play chess and checkers a protocol plugin to send NetBIOS messages through Trillian a plug in to interact with Lotus Sametime clients a plug in to interact with Microsoft Exchange a POP and IMAP email checker or an automatic translator for many European languages to and from English br Trillian for Windows and later included a plug in that allows you to chat and make calls on Skype without Skype being installed As of July Skype is no longer accessible from the Trillian client as the Skype plug in no longer works some had been able to use older versions of the Trillian client but now these also no longer work with Skype br Plugins are available for free and are hosted on the official web site but most need Trillian Pro to run br br br In Game Chat br Starting at version Trillian users can toggle an overlay when playing a video game on the computer that allows the user to use Trillian s chat features in a similar vein to Steam s overlay chat When toggled the overlay will show the time according to the system s clock and the chat window itself is a variation Trillian s base chat window with tabs used for different sets of queries and channels Also when the overlay is not activated users can view a toggle able sticker that tells the user how many messages are unread br br br History br br br Early beginnings br After several internal builds the first ever public release of Trillian version was available on July and was designed to be an IRC client The release was deemed too buggy and was immediately pulled off the shelf and replaced by a new version on the same day It featured a simple Connection Manager and skinned windows br A month later two minor builds were released with additional IRC features and bug fixes Despite these efforts Trillian was not popular as reflected in the number of downloads from CNET s Download com br Trillian was a donateware at that time They used PayPal for receiving donations through their web site br br br Introduction of interoperability br Version released November represented a major change in the direction of development when the client became able to connect to AOL Instant Messenger ICQ and MSN Messenger simultaneously in one window br Although similar products such as Odigo and Imici already existed Trillian was novel in the way that it distinguished contacts from different IM services clearly on the contact list and it did not require registration of a proprietary account It also did not lose connection easily like the other clients br A month later Yahoo Messenger support was introduced in Trillian and it also featured a holiday skin for Christmas Meanwhile the Trillian community forums were opened to the public br During this period new versions were released frequently attracting many enthusiasts to the community Skinning activity boomed and fan sites were created A skinning contest was held on deviantArt in Summer and the winner was selected to design the default skin for the next version of Trillian Trillian hit downloads on August br br br Entry into mainstream and the IM Wars br Contrary to the anticipation for version in the community the next version of Trillian was numbered It was released December Development took five months considerably longer than development of prior builds br The new version implemented file transfer in all IM services a feature most requested by the community at the time It also represented a number of skin language changes It used the contact list as the main window as opposed to a status window container in prior versions and featured a brand new default skin Trillian Cordillera and an emoticon set boasting over emoticons setting a record apart from other messengers available at that time br Version was released on December It supported AIM group chats and was the first major IM client which included the ability to encrypt messages with SecureIM br In the following months the number of downloads of Trillian surged reaching million on January and million within months Trillian received coverage and favorable reviews from mainstream media worldwide particularly by CNET Wired and BetaNews The lead developer and co founder Scott Werndorfer was also interviewed on TechTV br AOL became aware that Trillian users were able to chat with their AIM buddies without having to download the AIM client and on January AOL blocked SecureIM access from Trillian clients Cerulean appeared to have circumvented the block with version of its client software released one day later This AOL War continued for the next couple of weeks with Cerulean releasing subsequent patches and br Trillian appeared in the Jupiter Media Metrix Internet audience ratings in February with unique users and grew to by April While those numbers are very small compared to the major IM networks Jupiter said Trillian consistently ranks highest according to the number of average minutes spent per month br Trillian also created a special version for Iomega ActiveDisk br br br Commercialisation with Trillian Pro br On September a commercial version Trillian Pro was released concurrently with Trillian Basic The commercial version was sold for US for a year of subscription but all those who donated to the development of Trillian before were eligible to a year of subscription at no cost br The new version had added SMS and mobile messaging abilities Yahoo Messenger webcam support pop up e mail alerts and new plug ins to shuttle news weather and stock quotes directly to buddy lists br It appeared Trillian Pro would be marketed to corporate clients looking to keep in touch with suppliers or customers via a secured interoperable IM network and a relatively stern user interface The company had no venture capital backing and had depended entirely on donations from users to stay alive br Trillian Pro was nominated and picked among three other nominees as the Best Internet Communication shareware in its debut year of being a try before you buy shareware br On April total downloads of Trillian reached ten million br br br Blocking from Yahoo and cooperation with Gaim br A few weeks after Trillian Pro was released Yahoo attempted to block Trillian from connecting to its service in their efforts to implement preventative measures to protect our users from potential spammers A few patches were released by the Trillian developers which resolved the issue br The Trillian developers assisted its open source cross platform rival Gaim in solving the Yahoo connection issues Sean Egan the developer of Gaim posted in its site Our friends over at Cerulean Studios managed to break my speed record at cracking Yahoo authentication schemes with an impressive feat of hackery They sent it over and here it is in Gaim It was later revealed that the developers were friends and had helped each other on past occasions br Meanwhile as Microsoft forced its users to upgrade to MSN Messenger for upgrades in their servers for security issues October also would mark the deadline for Trillian support for MSN Messenger However it appeared that Cerulean Studios worked with Microsoft to resolve the issue on August long before the deadline br On March and June Yahoo changed its instant messaging language again to prevent third party services such as Trillian from accessing its service Like prior statements the company said the block is meant as a pre emptive measure against spammers Cerulean Studios released a few patches to fix the issues within a day or two br br br Trillian Series br In August a new official blog was created in attempt to rebuild connections between the Studios and its customers Trillian was announced in the blog and a sneak preview was made available to a small group of testers br After months of beta testing the final build of Trillian was released on December with features such as new video and audio chat abilities throughout AIM MSN Messenger and Yahoo Messenger an enhanced logging manager and integration with the Wikipedia online encyclopedia It also featured a clean and re organized user interface and a brand new official web site br The release also updated the long abandoned Trillian Basic to match the new user interface and functionalities as Trillian Basic The number of accumulated downloads of Trillian Basic in Download com hit million within a matter of weeks br Trillian was released February It included new features such as Universal Plug and Play UPnP and multiple identities support br On June all instances of Trillian Basic got an automatic upgrade to Trillian Pro free of charge br br br U and Google Pack br A version of Trillian that could run on U USB flash drives was released on October Trillian could previously be run from generic flash drives or other storage devices with some minor unofficial modifications known as Trillian Anywhere A U version of Trillian Astra is also posted on the official Cerulean Studios forum br On January Larry Page President of Products at Google announced Google Pack a bundle of various applications including Trillian Basic as a free collection of safe useful software from Google and other companies that improves the user experience online and on the desktop br According to the Cerulean Studios blog Trillian was discontinued from Google Pack on May br The inclusion of Trillian in Google Pack was perplexing to some media analysts as Google had at the time its own Google Talk service which touted the benefits of an open IM system The free Trillian Basic client could not be used with Google Talk however the paid Trillian Pro was listed as one of the client choices in the Google Talk client choices list until Google Talk was replaced by Google Hangouts in May br br br Trillian Astra Trillian br More than a year after the release of Trillian the Cerulean Studios blog began spreading news again and announced the next version of Trillian to be named Trillian Astra The name for version Astra is the nickname used by the same fictional character that is the namesake of the software which is a reference to The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy The new release claimed to be faster and include a new login screen A new domain www trillianastra com
