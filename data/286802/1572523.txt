title: On-board diagnostics
id: 1572523
On board diagnostics OBD is a term referring to a vehicle s self diagnostic and reporting capability In the United States this self diagnostic is a requirement to comply with federal emissions standards to detect failures that may increase the vehicle tailpipe emissions to more than of the standard to which it was originally certified br A primary benefit of this is that OBD systems give the vehicle owner or repair technician access to the status of the various vehicle sub systems The amount of diagnostic information available via OBD has varied widely since its introduction in the early s versions of onboard vehicle computers Early versions of OBD would simply illuminate a malfunction indicator light MIL or idiot light if a problem was detected but would not provide any information as to the nature of the problem Modern OBD implementations use a standardized digital communications port to provide real time data in addition to a standardized series of diagnostic trouble codes or DTCs which allow a person to rapidly identify and remedy malfunctions within the vehicle br br br History br br Volkswagen introduces the first on board computer system in their fuel injected Type models This system is entirely analog with no diagnostic capabilities br Bosch and Bendix EFI systems are adopted by major automotive manufacturers to improve tailpipe exhaust emissions These systems are also analog though some provide rudimentary diagnostic capability through factory tools such as the Kent Moore J compatible with the Datsun Z and the Cadillac Seville br General Motors introduces the first data link on their Cadillac Eldorado and Seville models Diagnostic Trouble Codes DTCs are displayed through the electronic climate control system s digital readout when in diagnostic mode br General Motors introduced its Computer Command Control system on all US passenger vehicles for model year Included in this system is a proprietary pin ALDL that interfaces with the Engine Control Module ECM to initiate a diagnostic request and provide a serial data stream The protocol communicates at baud with Pulse width modulation PWM signaling and monitors all engine management functions It reports real time sensor data component overrides and Diagnostic Trouble Codes The specification for this link is as defined by GM s Emissions Control System Project Center document XDE B br RCA defines an analog STE ICE simplified test equipment for internal combustion engines vehicle diagnostic standard used in the CUCV M tank and other military vehicles of the era for the US Army br General Motors introduces an upgraded version of the ALDL protocol which communicates at baud with half duplex UART signaling on some models br The California Air Resources Board CARB requires that all new vehicles sold in California from onward have some basic OBD capability such as detecting problems with fuel metering and Exhaust gas recirculation These requirements are generally referred to as OBD I though this name is a retronym applied after the introduction of OBD II The data link connector and its position are not standardized nor is the data protocol The Society of Automotive Engineers SAE recommends a standardized diagnostic connector and set of diagnostic test signals br Motivated by a desire for a state wide emissions testing program the CARB issues the OBD II specification and mandates that it be adopted for all cars sold in California starting in model year see CCR Title Section and CFR Part Section The DTCs and connectors suggested by the SAE are incorporated into this specification br The OBD II specification is made mandatory for all passenger cars and petrol powered light trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating less than lb kg in the United States The OBD II specification is also made mandatory for all petrol powered vehicles with California emissions with a gross vehicle weight rating up to lb kg br The OBD II specification is made mandatory for California emissions diesel engined vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating up to lb kg br The European Union makes EOBD mandatory for all petrol vehicles sold in the European Union starting in MY see European emission standards Directive EC br The European Union makes EOBD mandatory for all diesel vehicles sold in the European Union All petrol powered vehicles in the United States with a gross vehicle weight rating of up to lb kg are required to have OBD II br All vehicles manufactured in Australia and New Zealand are required to be OBD II compliant after January All vehicles in the United States of lb kg gross vehicle weight rating and under are required to have OBD II br All California emissions vehicles over lb kg gross vehicle weight rating are required to support EMD EMD or OBD II br All cars sold in the United States are required to use the ISO signaling standard a variant of the Controller Area Network CAN bus br Certain light vehicles in China are required by the Environmental Protection Administration Office to implement OBD standard GB by July Some regional exemptions may apply br Start of required phase in of the OBD II specification to all vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of lb kg and above this was completed by the model year Vehicles that did not have OBD II during this time period were required to have EMD EMD br br br Standard interfaces br br br ALDL br br GM s ALDL Assembly Line Diagnostic Link is sometimes referred to as a predecessor to or a manufacturer s proprietary version of an OBD I diagnostic starting in This interface was made in different varieties and changed with power train control modules aka PCM ECM ECU Different versions had slight differences in pin outs and baud rates Earlier versions used a baud rate while later versions went up to baud and used bi directional communications to the PCM br br br OBD I br The regulatory intent of OBD I was to encourage auto manufacturers to design reliable emission control systems that remain effective for the vehicle s useful life The hope was that by forcing annual emissions testing for California starting in and denying registration to vehicles that did not pass drivers would tend to purchase vehicles that would more reliably pass the test OBD I was largely unsuccessful as the means of reporting emissions specific diagnostic information was not standardized Technical difficulties with obtaining standardized and reliable emissions information from all vehicles led to an inability to implement the annual testing program effectively br The Diagnostic Trouble Codes DTC s of OBD I vehicles can usually be found without an expensive scan tool Each manufacturer used their own Diagnostic Link Connector DLC DLC location DTC definitions and procedure to read the DTC s from the vehicle DTC s from OBD I cars are often read through the blinking patterns of the Check Engine Light CEL or Service Engine Soon SES light By connecting certain pins of the diagnostic connector the Check Engine light will blink out a two digit number that corresponds to a specific error condition The DTC s of some OBD I cars are interpreted in different ways however Cadillac petrol fuel injected vehicles are equipped with actual onboard diagnostics providing trouble codes actuator tests and sensor data through the new digital Electronic Climate Control display br Holding down Off and Warmer for several seconds activates the diagnostic mode without the need for an external scan tool Some Honda engine computers are equipped with LEDs that light up in a specific pattern to indicate the DTC General Motors some Ford vehicles DCL and some Toyota Lexus vehicles have a live sensor data stream available however many other OBD I equipped vehicles do not OBD I vehicles have fewer DTC s available than OBD II equipped vehicles br br br OBD br OBD refers to a partial implementation of OBD II which General Motors used on some vehicles in GM did not use the term OBD in the documentation for these vehicles they simply have an OBD and an OBD II section in the service manual br For example the model year Corvettes have one post catalyst oxygen sensor although they have two catalytic converters and have a subset of the OBD II codes implemented br This hybrid system was present on GM B body cars the Chevrolet Caprice Impala and Buick Roadmaster for model years H body cars for W body cars Buick Regal Chevrolet Lumina for only Chevrolet Monte Carlo only Pontiac Grand Prix Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme for L body Chevrolet Beretta Corsica for Y body Chevrolet Corvette for on the F body Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird for and on the J Body Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire and N Body Buick Skylark Oldsmobile Achieva Pontiac Grand Am for and and also for North American delivered Saab vehicles with the naturally aspirated br The pinout for the ALDL connection on these cars is as follows br br For ALDL connections pin is the data stream pins and are ground and pin is the battery voltage br An OBD compatible scan tool is required to read codes generated by OBD br Additional vehicle specific diagnostic and control circuits are also available on this connector For instance on the Corvette there are interfaces for the Class serial data stream from the PCM the CCM diagnostic terminal the radio data stream the airbag system the selective ride control system the low tire pressure warning system and the passive keyless entry system br An OBD has also been used in the Ford Scorpio since br br br OBD II br OBD II is an improvement over OBD I in both capability and standardization The OBD II standard specifies the type of diagnostic connector and its pinout the electrical signalling protocols available and the messaging format It also provides a candidate list of vehicle parameters to monitor along with how to encode the data for each There is a pin in the connector that provides power for the scan tool from the vehicle battery which eliminates the need to connect a scan tool to a power source separately However some technicians might still connect the scan tool to an auxiliary power source to protect data in the unusual event that a vehicle experiences a loss of electrical power due to a malfunction Finally the OBD II standard provides an extensible list of DTCs As a result of this standardization a single device can query the on board computer s in any vehicle This OBD II came in two models OBD IIA and OBD IIB OBD II standardization was prompted by emissions requirements and though only emission related codes and data are required to be transmitted through it most manufacturers have made the OBD II Data Link Connector the only one in the vehicle through which all systems are diagnosed and programmed OBD II Diagnostic Trouble Codes are digit preceded by a letter P for powertrain engine and transmission B for body C for chassis and U for network br br br OBD II diagnostic connector br br The OBD II specification provides for a standardized hardware interface the female pin x J connector where type A is used for volt vehicles and type B for volt vehicles Unlike the OBD I connector which was sometimes found under the bonnet of the vehicle the OBD II connector is required to be within feet m of the steering wheel unless an exemption is applied for by the manufacturer in which case it is still somewhere within reach of the driver br SAE J defines the pinout of the connector as br br The assignment of unspecified pins is left to the vehicle manufacturer s discretion br br br EOBD br The European on board diagnostics EOBD regulations are the European equivalent of OBD II and apply to all passenger cars of category M with no more than passenger seats and a Gross Vehicle Weight rating of kg lb or less first registered within EU member states since January for petrol engined cars and since January for diesel engined cars br For newly introduced models the regulation dates applied a year earlier January for petrol and January for diesel br For passenger cars with a Gross Vehicle Weight rating of greater than kg and for light commercial vehicles the regulation dates applied from January for petrol models and January for diesel models br The technical implementation of EOBD is essentially the same as OBD II with the same SAE J diagnostic link connector and signal protocols being used br With Euro V and Euro VI emission standards EOBD emission thresholds are lower than previous Euro III and IV br br br EOBD fault codes br Each of the EOBD fault codes consists of five characters a letter followed by four numbers The letter refers to the system being interrogated e g Pxxxx would refer to the powertrain system The next character would be a if complies to the EOBD standard So it should look like P xxx br The next character would refer to the sub system br br P xx Fuel and Air Metering and Auxiliary Emission Controls br P xx Fuel and Air Metering br P xx Fuel and Air Metering Injector Circuit br P xx Ignition System or Misfire br P xx Auxiliary Emissions Controls br P xx Vehicle Speed Controls and Idle Control System br P xx Computer Output Circuit br P xx Transmission br P xx Transmission br The following two characters would refer to the individual fault within each subsystem br br br EOBD br The term EOBD is marketing speak used by some vehicle manufacturers to refer to manufacturer specific features that are not actually part of the OBD or EOBD standard In this case E stands for Enhanced br br br JOBD br JOBD is a version of OBD II for vehicles sold in Japan br br br ADR Australian OBD standard br The ADR Vehicle Standard Australian Design Rule Emission Control for Light Vehicles standard is the Australian equivalent of OBD II It applies to all vehicles of category M and N with a Gross Vehicle Weight rating of kg lb or less registered from new within Australia and produced since January for petrol engined cars and since January for diesel engined cars br For newly introduced models the regulation dates applied a year earlier January for petrol and January for diesel The ADR standard was supplemented by the ADR standard which imposed tighter emissions restrictions applicable to all vehicles of class M and N with a Gross Vehicle Weight rating of kg or less from July for new models July for all models br The technical implementation of this standard is essentially the same as OBD II with the same SAE J diagnostic link connector and signal protocols being used br br br EMD EMD br In North America EMD and EMD are on board diagnostic systems that were used on vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of lb kg or more between the and model years if those vehicles did not already implement OBD II EMD was used on California emissions vehicles between model years and that did not already have OBD II EMD was required to monitor fuel delivery exhaust gas recirculation the diesel particulate filter on diesel engines and emissions related powertrain control module inputs and outputs for circuit continuity data rationality and output functionality EMD was used on model year California and Federal petrol engined vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of over lb kg it added the ability to monitor nitrogen oxide catalyst performance EMD and EMD are similar to OBD I in logic but use the same SAE J data connector and CAN bus as OBD II systems br br br OBD II signal protocols br Five signaling protocols are permitted with the OBD II interface Most vehicles implement only one of the protocols It is often possible to deduce the protocol used based on which pins are present on the J connector br br SAE J PWM pulse width modulation kB sec standard of the Ford Motor Company br pin Bus br pin Bus br High voltage is V br Message length is restricted to bytes including CRC br Employs a multi master arbitration scheme called Carrier Sense Multiple Access

S vehicles prior to as of all vehicles sold in the US are required to implement CAN as one of their signaling protocols br pin CAN High br pin CAN Low br All OBD II pinouts use the same connector but different pins are used with the exception of pin battery ground and pin battery positive br br br OBD II diagnostic data available br OBD II provides access to data from the engine control unit ECU and offers a valuable source of information when troubleshooting problems inside a vehicle The SAE J standard defines a method for requesting various diagnostic data and a list of standard parameters that might be available from the ECU The various available parameters are addressed by parameter identification numbers or PIDs which are defined in J For a list of basic PIDs their definitions and the formula to convert raw OBD II output to meaningful diagnostic units see OBD II PIDs Manufacturers are not required to implement all PIDs listed in J and they are allowed to include proprietary PIDs that are not listed The PID request and data retrieval system gives access to real time performance data as well as flagged DTCs For a list of generic OBD II DTCs suggested by the SAE see Table of OBD II Codes Individual manufacturers often enhance the OBD II code set with additional proprietary DTCs br br br Mode of operation OBD services br Here is a basic introduction to the OBD communication protocol according to ISO In SAE J these modes were renamed to services starting in br br Service Mode shows current sensor live data from PIDs Parameter IDs See OBD II PIDs Service for an extensive list br Service Mode makes Freeze Frame data accessible via the same PIDs See OBD II PIDs Service for a list br Service Mode lists the emission related confirmed diagnostic trouble codes stored It either displays numeric digit codes identifying the faults or maps them to a letter P B U C plus digits See OBD II diagnostic trouble codes br Service Mode is used to clear emission related diagnostic information This includes clearing the stored pending confirmed DTCs and Freeze Frame data br Service Mode displays the oxygen sensor monitor screen and the test results gathered about the oxygen sensor There are ten numbers available for diagnostics br Rich to Lean O sensor threshold voltage br Lean to Rich O sensor threshold voltage br Low sensor voltage threshold for switch time measurement br High sensor voltage threshold for switch time measurement br Rich to Lean switch time in ms br Lean to Rich switch time in ms br Minimum voltage for test br Maximum voltage for test br Time between voltage transitions in ms br See OBD II PIDs Service for a list br Service Mode is a Request for On Board Monitoring Test Results for Continuously and Non Continuously Monitored System There are typically a minimum value a maximum value and a current value for each non continuous monitor br Service Mode is a Request for emission related diagnostic trouble codes detected during current or last completed driving cycle It enables the external test equipment to obtain pending diagnostic trouble codes detected during current or last completed driving cycle for emission related components systems This is used by service technicians after a vehicle repair and after clearing diagnostic information to see test results after a single driving cycle to determine if the repair has fixed the problem See OBD II diagnostic trouble codes br Service Mode could enable the off board test device to control the operation of an on board system test or component br Service Mode is used to retrieve vehicle information Among others the following information is available br VIN Vehicle Identification Number Vehicle ID br CALID Calibration Identification ID for the software installed on the ECU br CVN Calibration Verification Number Number used to verify the integrity of the vehicle software The manufacturer is responsible for determining the method of calculating CVN s e g using checksum br In use performance counters br Petrol engine Catalyst Primary oxygen sensor Evaporating system EGR system VVT system Secondary air system and Secondary oxygen sensor br Diesel engine NMHC catalyst NOx reduction catalyst NOx absorber Particulate matter filter Exhaust gas sensor EGR system VVT system Boost pressure control Fuel system br See OBD II PIDs Service for an extensive list br Service Mode A lists emission related permanent diagnostic trouble codes stored As per CARB any diagnostic trouble codes that is commanding MIL on and stored into non volatile memory shall be logged as a permanent fault code See OBD II diagnostic trouble codes br br br Applications br Various tools are available that plug into the OBD connector to access OBD functions These range from simple generic consumer level tools to highly sophisticated OEM dealership tools to vehicle telematic devices br br br Hand held scan tools br br A range of rugged hand held scan tools is available br br Simple fault code readers reset tools are mostly aimed at the consumer level br Professional hand held scan tools may possess more advanced functions br Access more advanced diagnostics br Set manufacturer or vehicle specific ECU parameters br Access and control other control units such as air bag or ABS br Real time monitoring or graphing of engine parameters to facilitate diagnosis or tuning br br br Mobile device based tools and analysis br Mobile device applications allow mobile devices such as cell phones and tablets to display and manipulate the OBD II data accessed via USB adaptor cables or Bluetooth adapters plugged into the car s OBD II connector Newer devices on the market are equipped with GPS sensors and the ability to transmit vehicle location and diagnostics data over a cellular network Modern OBD II devices can therefore nowadays be used to for example locate vehicles monitor driving behavior in addition to reading Diagnostics Trouble Codes DTC Even more advanced devices allow users to reset engine DTC codes effectively turning off engine lights in the dashboard however resetting the codes does not address the underlying issues and can in worst case scenarios even lead to engine breakage where the source issue is serious and left unattended for long periods br br br OBD II Software br An OBD II software package when installed in a computer Windows Mac or Linux can help diagnose the onboard system read and erase DTCs turn off MIL show real time data and measure vehicle fuel economy br To use OBD II software one needs to have an OBD II adapter commonly using Bluetooth Wi Fi or USB plugged in the OBD II port to enable the vehicle to connect with the computer where the software is installed br br br PC based scan tools and analysis platforms br br A PC based OBD analysis tool that converts the OBD II signals to serial data USB or serial port standard to PCs or Macs The software then decodes the received data to a visual display Many popular interfaces are based on the ELM or STN OBD Interpreter ICs both of which read all five generic OBD II protocols Some adapters now use the J API allowing them to access OBD II Protocols for both cars and trucks br In addition to the functions of a hand held scan tool the PC based tools generally offer br br Large storage capacity for data logging and other functions br Higher resolution screen than handheld tools br The ability to use multiple software programs adding flexibility br The identification and clearance of fault code br Data shown by intuitive graphs and charts br The extent that a PC tool may access manufacturer or vehicle specific ECU diagnostics varies between software products as it does between hand held scanners br br br Data loggers br br Data loggers are designed to capture vehicle data while the vehicle is in normal operation for later analysis br Data logging uses include br br Engine and vehicle monitoring under normal operation for diagnosis or tuning br Some US auto insurance companies offer reduced premiums if OBD II vehicle data loggers or cameras are installed and if the driver s behaviour meets requirements This is a form of auto insurance risk selection br Monitoring of driver behaviour by fleet vehicle operators br Analysis of vehicle black box data may be performed periodically automatically transmitted wirelessly to a third party or retrieved for forensic analysis after an event such as an accident traffic infringement or mechanical fault br br br Emission testing br In the United States many states now use OBD II testing instead of tailpipe testing in OBD II compliant vehicles and newer Since OBD II stores trouble codes for emissions equipment the testing computer can query the vehicle s onboard computer and verify there are no emission related trouble codes and that the vehicle is in compliance with emission standards for the model year it was manufactured br In the Netherlands and later vehicles get a yearly EOBD emission check br br br Driver s supplementary vehicle instrumentation br Driver s supplementary vehicle instrumentation is instrumentation installed in a vehicle in addition to that provided by the vehicle manufacturer and intended for display to the driver during normal operation This is opposed to scanners used primarily for active fault diagnosis tuning or hidden data logging br Auto enthusiasts have traditionally installed additional gauges such as manifold vacuum battery current etc The OBD standard interface has enabled a new generation of enthusiast instrumentation accessing the full range of vehicle data used for diagnostics and derived data such as instantaneous fuel economy br Instrumentation may take the form of dedicated trip computers carputer or interfaces to PDAs smartphones or a Garmin navigation unit br As a carputer is essentially a PC the same software could be loaded as for PC based scan tools and vice versa so the distinction is only in the reason for use of the software br These enthusiast systems may also include some functionality similar to the other scan tools br br br Vehicle telematics br OBD II information is commonly used by vehicle telematics devices that perform fleet tracking monitor fuel efficiency prevent unsafe driving as well as for remote diagnostics and by Pay As You Drive insurance br Although originally not intended for the above purposes commonly supported OBD II data such as vehicle speed RPM and fuel level allow GPS based fleet tracking devices to monitor vehicle idling times speeding and over revving By monitoring OBD II DTCs a company can know immediately if one of its vehicles has an engine problem and by interpreting the code the nature of the problem It can be used to detect reckless driving in real time based on the sensor data provided through the OBD port This detection is done by adding a complex events processor CEP to the backend and on the client s interface OBD II is also monitored to block mobile phones when driving and to record trip data for insurance purposes br br br OBD II diagnostic trouble codes br OBD II diagnostic trouble codes DTCs are five characters long with the first letter indicating a category and the remaining four being a hexadecimal number br The first character representing category can only be one of the following four letters given here with their associated meanings This restriction in number is due to how only two bits of memory are used to indicate the category when DTCs are stored and transmitted br br P Powertrain engine transmission and ignition br C Chassis includes ABS and brake fluid br B Body includes air conditioning and airbag br U Network wiring bus br br The second character is a number in the range of This restriction is again due to memory storage limitations br br Indicates a generic SAE defined code br Indicates a manufacturer specific OEM code br Category dependent br For the P category this indicates a generic SAE defined code br For other categories indicates a manufacturer specific OEM code br Category dependent br For the P category this is indicates a code that has been jointly defined br For other categories this has been reserved for future use br The third character may denote a particular vehicle system that the fault relates to br br Fuel and air metering and auxiliary emission controls br

were able to gain control over many vehicle components via the interface Furthermore they were able to upload new firmware into the engine control units Their conclusion is that vehicle embedded systems are not designed with security in mind br There have been reports of thieves using specialist OBD reprogramming devices to enable them to steal cars without the use of a key The primary causes of this vulnerability lie in the tendency for vehicle manufacturers to extend the bus for purposes other than those for which it was designed and the lack of authentication and authorization in the OBD specifications which instead rely largely on security through obscurity br br br See also br br OBD II PIDs Parameter IDs br Unified Diagnostic Services br Engine control unit br Immobiliser br br
