id: 1607621
Methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl MMT or MCMT is an organomanganese compound with the formula C H CH Mn CO Initially marketed as a supplement for use in leaded gasoline MMT was later used in unleaded gasoline to increase the octane rating Following the implementation of the Clean Air Act United States CAA in MMT continued to be used alongside tetraethyl lead TEL in the US as leaded gasoline was phased out prior to TEL finally being banned from US gasoline in and was also used in unleaded gasoline until Ethyl Corporation obtained a waiver from the U S EPA Environmental Protection Agency in which allows the use of MMT in US unleaded gasoline not including reformulated gasoline at a treat rate equivalent to mg Mn L manganese per liter br MMT has been used in Canadian gasoline since and in numerous other countries for many years at a concentration up to mg Mn L though the importation and interprovincial trade of gasoline containing MMT was restricted briefly during the period and was introduced into Australia in It has been sold under the tradenames HiTEC Cestoburn and Ecotane MMT is also used in China br br br History of usage in the United States br Although initially marketed in as a smoke suppressant for gas turbines MMT was further developed as an octane enhancer in When the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA ordered the phase out of TEL in gasoline in new fuel additives were sought TEL has been used in certain countries as an additive to increase the octane rating of automotive gasoline but has been phased out in all countries since July br In the US Congress amended the CAA to require advance approval by the EPA for the continued use of fuel additives such as MMT ethanol ethyl tert butyl ether ETBE etc The new CAA amendment required a waiver to allow use of fuel additives made of any elements other than carbon hydrogen oxygen within certain limits and nitrogen To obtain a waiver the applicant was required to demonstrate that the fuel additive would not lead to a failure of vehicle emission control systems br Ethyl Corporation applied to the US EPA for a waiver for MMT in both and in both cases the applications were denied because of stated concerns that MMT might damage catalytic converters and increase hydrocarbon emissions In Ethyl began a new series of discussions with the EPA to determine a program for developing the necessary data to support a waiver application In Ethyl filed its third waiver application prompting an extensive four year review process In the U S EPA determined that use of MMT at mg Mn L would not cause or contribute to vehicle emission control system failures br Despite that finding the EPA ultimately denied the waiver request in due to uncertainty related to health concerns regarding manganese emissions from the use of MMT br As a result of this ruling Ethyl initiated a legal action claiming that the EPA had exceeded its authority by denying the waiver on these grounds This was upheld by the US Court of Appeals and EPA subsequently granted a waiver which allows the use of MMT in US unleaded gasoline not including reformulated gasoline at a treat rate equivalent to mg Mn L br Implementation of this alternative to TEL has been controversial Manganese compounds have in general very low toxicity but their combustion products still irreversibly foul catalytic converters Opposition from automobile manufacturers and some areas of the scientific community has reportedly prompted oil companies to stop voluntarily the usage of MMT in some of their countries of operation br MMT is currently manufactured in the U S by the Afton Chemical Corporation a subsidiary of New Market Corporation It is also produced and marketed as Cestoburn by Cestoil Chemical Inc in Canada br br br Structure and synthesis br MMT is manufactured by reduction of bis methylcyclopentadienyl manganese using triethylaluminium The reduction is conducted under an atmosphere of carbon monoxide The reaction is exothermic and without proper cooling can lead to catastrophic thermal runaway br MMT is a so called half sandwich complex or more specifically a piano stool complex since the three CO ligands are like the legs of a stool The manganese atom in MMT is coordinated with three carbonyl groups as well as to all five main carbon atoms of the methylcyclopentadienyl ring These hydrophobic organic ligands make MMT highly lipophilic br A variety of related complexes are known including ferrocene which has also been used as an additive to gasoline Many derivatives of MMT are known br br br Safety br The human and environmental health impacts that may result from the use of MMT will be a function of exposure to either MMT in its original unchanged chemical form and or manganese combustion products emitted from vehicles operating on gasoline containing MMT as an octane improver br br br Pre combustion storage and handling br The general public has minimal direct exposure to MMT As stated by the US EPA in their risk assessment on MMT except for accidental or occupational contacts exposure to MMT itself was not thought likely to pose a significant risk to the general population Similarly the Australian National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme NICNAS stated that m inimal public exposure to MMT is likely as a result of spills and splashes of LRP lead replacement petrol and aftermarket additives br The MMT dossier registered in the European Chemical Agency s webpage indicates that before combustion in gasoline MMT is classified as an acute toxicant by the oral dermal and inhalation routes of exposure under the European Union s Classification Labeling and Packaging Regulation EC implementing the Global Harmonized System GHS of Classification and Labeling The US ATSDR Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry notes that MMT is very unstable in light and degrades to a mixture of less harmful substances and inorganic manganese in less than minutes Therefore human exposure to MMT prior to combustion in gasoline would not likely occur at significant levels br The US OSHA Occupational Health and Safety Administration has not established a permissible exposure limit specifically for MMT However OSHA has set a permissible exposure limit at a ceiling of mg m for manganese and its compounds while the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends workers not be exposed to more than mg m over an eight hour time weighted average In Europe the MMT DNELs Derived No Effect Level for workers by the inhalation and dermal routes of exposure are mg m and mg kg day respectively The MMT DNELs for the general population by the inhalation and dermal routes of exposure are mg m and mg kg day respectively br br br Combustion products br In reaffirmed in and Health Canada concluded that airborne manganese resulting from the combustion of MMT in gasoline powered vehicles is not entering the Canadian environment in quantities or under conditions that may constitute a health risk and confirmed they were taking no action with respect to MMT Similarly the NICNAS report states that the airborne concentrations of manganese as a result of car emissions from vehicles using fuel containing MMT poses no health hazard br The assessment conducted by NICNAS asserts that m anganese the principle degradation by product from combustion of MMT is naturally occurring and ubiquitous in the environment It is an essential nutrient of plants and animals Environmental exposure to Mn compounds will mostly arise through the gaseous phase Eventually these will deposit to land and waters The emission of Mn into the environment from use of fuels containing MMT is unlikely to develop to levels of concern and therefore poses a low risk for terrestrial or aquatic environments br Additional health studies overseen by the US EPA were conducted to explain the transport of manganese in the body In studies published from through no significant health effects are anticipated from the use of MMT in gasoline br br br Overall combined risk assessment br Based on the low potential for the release of concentrated MMT before its combustion in gasoline under normal storage and use as well as its rapid photo degradation properties it has been concluded in multiple technical and global regulatory assessments that significant impacts to human health or the environment from MMT use are not anticipated NICNAS concluded that there is low occupational risk associated with MMT both for workers involved in formulating and distributing LRP or aftermarket fuel additives and those involved in automotive maintenance Further they also concluded that there is a low risk to the public from the use of MMT br Significant human or environmental exposures associated with manganese compounds manganese phosphate manganese sulfate and manganese dioxide from the combustion of MMT are not expected In Health Canada s risk assessment on the health implications of the manganese combustion products of MMT it was concluded that manganese exposures from MMT use are unlikely to pose a risk to health for any sub group of the population NICNAS similarly concluded that chronic Mn exposures from all sources combined are unlikely to be significantly changed by the use of MMT as a fuel additive br In a risk assessment on MMT was developed by ARCADIS Consulting and verified by an independent panel according to the methodology provided by the European Commission in compliance with the requirements of the European Fuel Quality Directive EC The conclusions of a risk assessment are that for MMT and its transformation products when MMT is used as a fuel additive in petrol no significant human health or environmental concerns related to exposure to either MMT or its transformation combustion products manganese phosphate manganese sulfate and manganese tetroxide were identified at use at levels up to mg Mn L Depending on the regional needs and the vehicle emission control technology available an MMT treat rate in the range of mg Mn L to mg Mn L is scientifically justified and may deliver both environmental and economic benefits without significant adverse effects br br br T Laboratories explosion and fire br br On December an explosion and fire occurred in the production of MMT in Florida which killed four people and injured fourteen br br br See also br List of gasoline additives br br br
