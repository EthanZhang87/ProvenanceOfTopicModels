An automotive battery or car battery is a rechargeable battery that is used to start a motor vehicle Its main purpose is to provide an electric current to the electric powered starting motor which in turn starts the chemically powered internal combustion engine that actually propels the vehicle Once the engine is running power for the car s electrical systems is still supplied by the battery with the alternator charging the battery as demands increase or decrease br br br Battery in modern cars br br br Gasoline and diesel engine br Typically starting uses less than three percent of the battery capacity For this reason automotive batteries are designed to deliver maximum current for a short period of time They are sometimes referred to as SLI batteries for this reason for starting lighting and ignition SLI batteries are not designed for deep discharging and a full discharge can reduce the battery s lifespan br As well as starting the engine an SLI battery supplies the extra power necessary when the vehicle s electrical requirements exceed the supply from the charging system It is also a stabilizer evening out potentially damaging voltage spikes While the engine is running most of the power is provided by the alternator which includes a voltage regulator to keep the output between and V Modern SLI batteries are lead acid type using six series connected cells to provide a nominal volt system in most passenger vehicles and light trucks or twelve cells for a volt system in heavy trucks or earth moving equipment for example br Gas explosions can occur at the negative electrode where hydrogen gas can build up due to blocked battery vents or a poorly ventilated setting combined with an ignition source Explosions during engine start up are typically associated with corroded or dirty battery posts A study by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that of vehicle battery explosion injuries occurred while charging the battery The next most common scenarios were while working on cable connections while jump starting typically by failing to connect to the dead battery before the charging source and failing to connect to the vehicle chassis rather than directly to the grounded battery post and while checking fluid levels Close to two thirds of those injured suffered chemical burns and nearly three fourths suffered eye injuries among other possible injuries br br br Electric and hybrid cars br Electric vehicles EVs are powered by a high voltage electric vehicle battery but they usually have an automotive battery as well so that they can use standard automotive accessories which are designed to run on V They are often referred to as auxiliary batteries br Unlike conventional internal combustion engined vehicles EVs don t charge the auxiliary battery with an alternator instead they use a DC to DC converter to step down the high voltage to the required float charge voltage typically around V br Further an electric vehicle does not have a starter motor thus needs only a limited amount of power and energy from its auxiliary battery As such Tesla introduced in a lithium ion auxiliary battery storing only Wh of energy br br br History br Early cars did not have batteries as their electrical systems were limited Electric power for the ignition was provided by a magneto the engine was started with a crank headlights were gas powered and a bell or bulb horn was used instead of an electric horn Car batteries became widely used around as cars became equipped with electric starter motors br The first starting and charging systems were designed to be volt and positive ground systems with the vehicle s chassis directly connected to the positive battery terminal Today almost all road vehicles have a negative ground system The negative battery terminal is connected to the car s chassis br The Hudson Motor Car Company was the first to use a standardized battery in when they started using Battery Council International batteries BCI is the organization that sets the dimensional standards for batteries br Cars used V electrical systems and batteries until the mid s The changeover from to V happened when bigger engines with higher compression ratios required more electrical power to start Smaller cars which required less power to start stayed with V longer for example the Volkswagen Beetle in the mid s and the Citro n CV in The sealed battery which did not require refilling was invented in br In the s a V electrical system standard was proposed It was intended to allow more powerful electrically driven accessories and lighter automobile wiring harnesses The availability of higher efficiency motors new wiring techniques and digital controls and a focus on hybrid vehicle systems that use high voltage starter generators have largely eliminated the push for switching the main automotive voltages br In Tesla started deliveries of their Cybertruck that uses a volt electrical system reducing of the wiring in the vehicle br br br Design br An automobile battery is an example of a wet cell battery with six cells Each cell of a lead storage battery consists of alternate plates made of a lead alloy grid filled with sponge lead plates cathode or coated with lead dioxide anode Each cell is filled with a sulfuric acid solution which is the electrolyte Initially cells each had a filler cap through which the electrolyte level could be viewed and which allowed water to be added to the cell The filler cap had a small vent hole which allowed hydrogen gas generated during charging to escape from the cell br The cells are connected by short heavy straps from the positive plates of one cell to the negative plates of the adjacent cell A pair of heavy terminals plated with lead to resist corrosion are mounted at the top sometimes the side of the battery Early auto batteries used hard rubber cases and wooden plate separators Modern units use plastic cases and woven sheets to prevent the plates of a cell from touching and short circuiting br In the past auto batteries required regular inspection and maintenance to replace water that was decomposed during the operation of the battery Low maintenance sometimes called zero maintenance batteries use a different alloy for the plate elements reducing the amount of water decomposed on charging A modern battery may not require additional water over its useful life some types eliminate the individual filler caps for each cell A weakness of these batteries is that they are very intolerant of deep discharge such as when the car battery is completely drained by leaving the lights on This coats the lead plate electrodes with lead sulfate deposits and can reduce the battery s lifespan by a third or more br VRLA batteries also known as absorbed glass mat AGM batteries are more tolerant of deep discharge but are more expensive VRLA batteries do not permit addition of water to the cell The cells each have an automatic pressure release valve to protect the case from rupture on severe overcharge or internal failure A VRLA battery cannot spill its electrolyte which makes it particularly useful in vehicles such as motorcycles br Batteries are typically made of six galvanic cells in a series circuits Each cell provides volts for a total of volts at full charge During discharge at the negative lead terminal a chemical reaction releases electrons to the external circuit and at the positive lead oxide terminal another chemical reaction absorbs electrons from the external circuit This drives the electrons through the external circuit wire an electrical conductor to produce an electric current electricity As the battery discharges the acid of the electrolyte reacts with the materials of the plates changing their surface to lead sulfate When the battery is recharged the chemical reaction is reversed the lead sulfate reforms into lead dioxide With the plates restored to their original condition the process may be repeated br Some vehicles use other starter batteries For weight savings the Porsche GT RS has a lithium ion battery as an option from onward all Kia Niro conventional hybrids feature one as well Heavy vehicles may have two batteries in series for a V system or may have series parallel groups of batteries supplying V br br br Specifications br br br Physical format br Batteries are grouped by physical size type and placement of the terminals and mounting style br br br Amp hours Ah br Ampere hours Ah or A h is a unit related to the energy storage capacity of the battery This rating is required by law in Europe br The ampere hour rating is generally defined as the product of the current a battery can provide for hours at a constant rate at degrees F C while the voltage drops to a cut off of volts times hours In theory at degrees F a Ah battery should be able to continuously provide amps for hours while maintaining a voltage of at least volts It is important to realize that the relationship between the Ah capacity and the discharge rate is not linear as the discharge rate is increased the capacity decreases A battery with a Ah rating generally will not be able to maintain a voltage above volts for hours while being discharged at constant rate of amps Capacity also decreases with temperature br br br Cranking amperages CCA CA MCA HCA br Cold cranking amperes CCA the amount of current a battery can provide at F C for seconds while maintaining a voltage of at least volts Modern cars with computer controlled fuel injected engines take no more than a few seconds to start and CCA figures are less important than they used to be It is important not to confuse CCA with CA MCA or HCA numbers as the latter will always be higher due to warmer temperatures For example a CCA battery will have more starting power than a CA or MCA one and likewise a CA will have more than a HCA one br Cranking amperes CA the amount of current a battery can provide at F C again for seconds at a voltage equal to or greater than volts br Marine cranking amperes MCA like CA the amount of current a battery can provide at F C and often found on batteries for boats hence marine and lawn garden tractors which are less likely to be operated in conditions where ice can form br Hot cranking amperes HCA is the amount of current a battery can provide at F C The rating is defined as the current a lead acid battery at that temperature can deliver for seconds and maintain at least volts per cell volts for a volt battery br br br Group size br Battery Council International BCI group size specifies a battery s physical dimensions such as length width and height These groups are determined by the organization br br br Date codes br In the United States there are codes on batteries to help consumers buy a recently produced one When batteries are stored they start losing their charge this is due to non current producing chemical reactions of the electrodes with the battery acid A battery made in October will have a numeric code of or an alphanumeric code of K A is for January B is for February and so on the letter I is skipped br In South Africa the code on a battery to indicate production date is part of the casing and cast into the bottom left of the cover The code is year and week number YYWW e g is for week in the year br br br Use and maintenance br Excess heat is a main cause of battery failures as when the electrolyte evaporates due to high temperatures decreasing the effective surface area of the plates exposed to the electrolyte and leading to sulfation Grid corrosion rates increase with temperature Also low temperatures can lead to battery failure br If the battery is discharged to the point where it can t start the engine the engine can be jump started via an external source of power Once running the engine can recharge the battery if the alternator and charging system are undamaged br Corrosion at the battery terminals can prevent a car from starting due to electrical resistance which can be prevented by the proper application of dielectric grease br Sulfation is when the electrodes become coated with a hard layer of lead sulfate which weakens the battery Sulfation can happen when battery is not fully charged and remains discharged Sulfated batteries should be charged slowly to prevent damage br SLI batteries starting lighting and ignition are not designed for deep discharge and their life is reduced when subjected to this br Starting batteries have plates designed for increased surface area and thus high instant current capability whereas marine hybrid and deep cycle types will have thicker plates and more room at the bottom of the plates for spent plate material to gather before shorting the cell br Car batteries using lead antimony plates require regular topping up with pure water to replace water lost due to electrolysis and evaporation By changing the alloying element to calcium more recent designs have reduced the rate of water loss Modern car batteries have reduced maintenance requirements and may not provide caps for addition of water to the cells Such batteries include extra electrolyte above the plates to allow for losses during the battery life br Some battery manufacturers include a built in hydrometer to show the state of charge of the battery br br The primary wear out mechanism is the shedding of active material from the battery plates which accumulates at the bottom of the cells and which may eventually short circuit the plates This can be substantially reduced by enclosing one set of plates in plastic separator bags made from a permeable material This allows the electrolyte and ions to pass through but keeps the sludge build up from bridging the plates The sludge largely consists of lead sulfate which is produced at both electrodes br br br Environmental impact br Battery recycling of automotive batteries reduces the need for resources required for the manufacture of new batteries diverts toxic lead from landfills and prevents the risk of improper disposal Once a lead acid battery ceases to hold a charge it is deemed a used lead acid battery ULAB which is classified as hazardous waste under the Basel Convention The volt car battery is the most recycled product in the world according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency In the U S alone about million auto batteries a year are replaced and percent of them are turned in for recycling However the recycling may be done incorrectly in unregulated environments As part of global waste trade ULABs are shipped from industrialized countries to developing countries for disassembly and recuperation of the contents About percent of the lead can be recovered Pure Earth estimates that over million people in developing countries are affected by lead contamination from ULAB processing br br br See also br Anderson
