id: 3155665
AW additives or antiwear additives are additives for lubricants to prevent metal to metal contact between parts of gears br EP additives are used in applications such as gearboxes while AW additives are used with lighter loads such as bushings br br br Details br Some popular AW additives are br br zinc dithiophosphate ZDP br zinc dialkyl dithio phosphate ZDDP probably the most widely used in formulated engine oils also acts as a corrosion inhibitor and antioxidant br Tricresyl phosphate TCP used for high temperature operation often used as an AW and EP additive in turbine engine lubricants and also in some crankcase oils and hydraulic fluids br Halocarbons chlorinated paraffins for extreme pressure operations br Glycerol mono oleate br Stearic acid adhering to surfaces via reversible adsorption process under C which limits its use to mild contact conditions br Some formulations use colloidal PTFE Teflon but its efficiency is controversial br Many AW additives function as EP additives for example organophosphates or sulfur compounds The mechanism of function of TCP and ZDDP is explained in EP additives br Under extreme pressure conditions the performance of AW additives becomes insufficient and designated EP additives are required br br br See also br Extreme pressure additive lubricant additivePages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback br Oil additive Chemical compounds that improve the lubricant performance of base oil br br br
