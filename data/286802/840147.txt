title: Exhaust gas
id: 840147
Exhaust gas or flue gas is emitted as a result of the combustion of fuels such as natural gas gasoline petrol diesel fuel fuel oil biodiesel blends or coal According to the type of engine it is discharged into the atmosphere through an exhaust pipe flue gas stack or propelling nozzle It often disperses downwind in a pattern called an exhaust plume br It is a major component of motor vehicle emissions and from stationary internal combustion engines which can also include crankcase blow by and evaporation of unused gasoline br Motor vehicle emissions are a common source of air pollution and are a major ingredient in the creation of smog in some large cities A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT indicates that early deaths occur per year in the United States alone because of vehicle emissions According to another study from the same university traffic fumes alone cause the death of people every year just in the United Kingdom br br br Composition br The largest part of most combustion gas is nitrogen N water vapor H O except with pure carbon fuels and carbon dioxide CO except for fuels without carbon these are not toxic or noxious although water vapor and carbon dioxide are greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change A relatively small part of combustion gas is undesirable noxious or toxic substances such as carbon monoxide CO from incomplete combustion hydrocarbons properly indicated as CxHy but typically shown simply as HC on emissions test slips from unburnt fuel nitrogen oxides NOx from excessive combustion temperatures and particulate matter mostly soot br br br Exhaust gas temperature br Exhaust gas temperature EGT is important to the functioning of the catalytic converter of an internal combustion engine It may be measured by an exhaust gas temperature gauge EGT is also a measure of engine health in gas turbine engines see below br br br Cold engines br br During the first two minutes after starting the engine of a car that has not been operated for several hours the amount of emissions can be very high This occurs for two main reasons br br Rich air fuel ratio requirement in cold engines When a cold engine is started the fuel does not vaporize completely creating higher emissions of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide which diminishes only as the engine reaches operating temperature The duration of this start up phase has been reduced by advances in materials and technology including computer controlled fuel injection shorter intake lengths and pre heating of fuel and or inducted air br Inefficient catalytic converter under cold conditions Catalytic converters are very inefficient until warmed up to their operating temperature This time has been much reduced by moving the converter closer to the exhaust manifold and even more so placing a small yet quick to heat up converter directly at the exhaust manifold The small converter handles the start up emissions which allows enough time for the larger main converter to heat up Further improvements can be realised in many ways including electric heating thermal battery chemical reaction preheating flame heating and superinsulation br br br Passenger car emissions summary br br Comparable with the European emission standards EURO III as it was applied in October br In the United States Environmental Protection Agency began to implement more stringent emissions standards for light duty vehicles The requirements were phased in beginning with vehicles and all new cars and light trucks were required to meet the updated standards by the end of br br br Types br br br Internal combustion engines br br br Spark ignition and Diesel engines br br In spark ignition engines the gases resulting from combustion of the fuel and air mix are called exhaust gases The composition varies from petrol to diesel engines but is around these levels br br The oxygen for diesel is likely if the engine was idling e g in a test rig It is much less if the engine is running under load although diesel engines always operate with an excess of air over fuel br The CO content for petrol engines varies from ppm for well tuned engine with fuel injection and a catalytic converter up to ppm for a richly tuned carburetor engine such as typically found on small generators and garden equipment br br br Nitromethane additive br Exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine whose fuel includes nitromethane will contain nitric acid vapour which is corrosive and when inhaled causes a muscular reaction making it impossible to breathe People who are likely to be exposed to it should wear a gas mask br br br Diesel engines br br br Gas turbine engines br In aircraft gas turbine engines exhaust gas temperature EGT is a primary measure of engine health Typically the EGT is compared with a primary engine power indication called engine pressure ratio EPR For example at full power EPR there will be a maximum permitted EGT limit Once an engine reaches a stage in its life where it reaches this EGT limit the engine will require specific maintenance in order to rectify the problem The amount the EGT is below the EGT limit is called EGT margin The EGT margin of an engine will be greatest when the engine is new or has been overhauled For most airlines this information is also monitored remotely by the airline maintenance department by means of ACARS br br br Jet engines and rocket engines br br In jet engines and rocket engines exhaust from propelling nozzles which in some applications shows shock diamonds br br br Other types br br br From burning coal br Flue gas br br br Steam engines br In steam engine terminology the exhaust is steam that is now so low in pressure that it can no longer do useful work br br br Main motor vehicle emissions br br br NOx br br Mono nitrogen oxides NO and NO NOx whether produced this way or naturally by lightning react with ammonia moisture and other compounds to form nitric acid vapor and related particles Small particles can penetrate deeply into sensitive lung tissue and damage it causing premature death in extreme cases Inhalation of NO species increases the risk of lung cancer and colorectal cancer and inhalation of such particles may cause or worsen respiratory diseases such as emphysema and bronchitis and heart disease br In a U S EPA study the largest emissions of NOx came from on road motor vehicles with the second largest contributor being non road equipment which is mostly gasoline and diesel stations br The resulting nitric acid may be washed into soil where it becomes nitrate which is useful to growing plants br br br Volatile organic compounds br br When oxides of nitrogen NOx and volatile organic compounds VOCs react in the presence of sunlight ground level ozone is formed a primary ingredient in smog A U S EPA report gives road vehicles as the second largest source of VOCs in the U S at and are from non road equipment which is mostly gasoline and diesel stations of VOC emissions are from solvents which are used in the manufacturer of paints and paint thinners and other uses br br br Ozone br Ozone is beneficial in the upper atmosphere but at ground level ozone irritates the respiratory system causing coughing choking and reduced lung capacity It also has many negative effects throughout the ecosystem br br br Carbon monoxide CO br br Carbon monoxide poisoning is the most common type of fatal air poisoning in many countries Carbon monoxide is colorless odorless and tasteless but highly toxic It combines with hemoglobin to produce carboxyhemoglobin which blocks the transport of oxygen At concentrations above ppm it is considered immediately dangerous and is the most immediate health hazard from running engines in a poorly ventilated space In of carbon monoxide emissions were created by mobile vehicles in the U S br br br Hazardous air pollutants toxics br Chronic long term exposure to benzene C H damages bone marrow It can also cause excessive bleeding and depress the immune system increasing the chance of infection Benzene causes leukemia and is associated with other blood cancers and pre cancers of the blood br br br Particulate matter PM and PM br The health effects of inhaling airborne particulate matter have been widely studied in humans and animals and include asthma lung cancer cardiovascular issues premature death Because of the size of the particles they can penetrate the deepest part of the lungs A UK study estimates deaths per year due to passenger vehicle PM In a publication the U S Federal Highway Administration FHWA state that in about per cent of all PM and per cent of all PM emissions came from the exhaust of on road motor vehicles mostly from diesel engines In Chinese European and Indian markets both diesel and gasoline vehicles are required to have a tailpipe filter installed while the United States has mandated it for diesel only In British testing specialist Emissions Analytics estimated that the million or so gasoline vehicles in the US over the subsequent decade would emit around septillion harmful particles br br br Carbon dioxide CO br Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas Motor vehicle CO emissions are part of the anthropogenic contribution to the growth of CO concentrations in the atmosphere which according to the vast majority of the scientific community is causing climate change Motor vehicles are calculated to generate about of the European Union s man made CO emissions with passenger cars contributing about European emission standards limit the CO emissions of new passenger cars and light vehicles The European Union average new car CO emissions figure dropped by in the year to the first quarter of down to g km br br br Water vapour br Vehicle exhaust contains much water vapour br br br Water recovery br There has been research into ways that troops in deserts can recover drinkable water from their vehicles exhaust gases br br br Pollution reduction br br Emission standards focus on reducing pollutants contained in the exhaust gases from vehicles as well as from industrial flue gas stacks and other air pollution exhaust sources in various large scale industrial facilities such as petroleum refineries natural gas processing plants petrochemical plants and chemical production plants However these are often referred to as flue gases Catalytic converters in cars intend to break down the pollution of exhaust gases using a catalyst Scrubbers in ships intend to remove the sulfur dioxide SO of marine exhaust gases The regulations on marine sulfur dioxide emissions are tightening however only a small number of special areas worldwide have been designated for low sulfur diesel fuel use only br One of the advantages claimed for advanced steam technology engines is that they produce smaller quantities of toxic pollutants e g oxides of nitrogen than petrol and diesel engines of the same power They produce larger quantities of carbon dioxide but less carbon monoxide due to more efficient combustion br br br Health studies br Researchers from the University of California Los Angeles School of Public Health say preliminary results of their statistical study of children listed in the California Cancer Registry born between and found that traffic pollution may be associated with a to increase in the likelihood of some cancers A World Health Organization study found that diesel fumes cause an increase in lung cancer br br br Localised effects br The California Air Resources Board found in studies that or more of the air pollution smog in Southern California is due to car emissions Concentrations of pollutants emitted from combustion engines may be particularly high around signalized intersections because of idling and accelerations Computer models often miss this kind of detail br br br See also br br br br br br External links br Health and Air Pollution Publication of the California Air
