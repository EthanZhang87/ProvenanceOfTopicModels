title: Ignition system
id: 362070
Ignition systems are used by heat engines to initiate combustion by igniting the fuel air mixture In a spark ignition versions of the internal combustion engine such as petrol engines the ignition system creates a spark to ignite the fuel air mixture just before each combustion stroke Gas turbine engines and rocket engines normally use an ignition system only during start up br Diesel engines use compression ignition to ignite the fuel air mixture using the heat of compression and therefore do not use an ignition system They usually have glowplugs that preheat the combustion chamber to aid starting in cold weather br Early cars used ignition magneto and trembler coil systems which were superseded by Distributor based systems first used in Electronic ignition systems first used in became common towards the end of the th century with coil on plug versions of these systems becoming widespread since the s br br br Magneto and mechanical systems br br br Ignition magneto systems br br An ignition magneto also called a high tension magneto is an older type of ignition system used in spark ignition engines such as petrol engines It uses a magneto and a transformer to make pulses of high voltage for the spark plugs The older term high tension means high voltage br Used on many cars in the early th century ignition magnetos were largely replaced by induction coil ignition systems The use of ignition magnetos is now confined mainly to engines without a battery for example in lawnmowers and chainsaws It is also used in modern piston engined aircraft even though a battery is present to avoid the engine relying on an electrical system br br br Induction coil systems br br As batteries became more common in cars due to the increased usage of electric starter motors magneto systems were replaced by systems using an induction coil The Benz Patent Motorwagen and the Ford Model T used a trembler coil ignition system whereby the trembler interrupted the current through the coil and caused a rapid series of sparks during each firing The trembler coil would be energized at an appropriate point in the engine cycle In the Model T the four cylinder engine had a trembler coil for each cylinder br br br Distributor based systems br br An improved ignition system was invented by Charles Kettering at Delco in the United States and introduced in Cadillac s cars The Kettering ignition system consisted of a single ignition coil breaker points a capacitor to prevent the points from arcing at break and a distributor to direct the electricity from the ignition coil to the correct cylinder The Kettering system became the primary ignition system for many years in the automotive industry due to its lower cost and relative simplicity br br br Electronic systems br br The first electronic ignition a cold cathode type was tested in by Delco Remy while Lucas introduced a transistorized ignition in which was used on BRM and Coventry Climax Formula One engines in The aftermarket began offering EI that year with both the AutoLite Electric Transistor and Tung Sol EI thyratron capacitive discharge being available Pontiac became the first automaker to offer an optional EI the breakerless magnetic pulse triggered Delcotronic on some models it was also available on some Corvettes The first commercially available all solid state SCR capacitive discharge ignition was manufactured by Hyland Electronics in Canada also in Ford fitted a FORD designed breakerless system on the Lotus s entered at Indianapolis the next year ran a fleet test in and began offering optional EI on some models in This electronic system was utilized on the GT s campaigned by Shelby American and Holman and Moody Robert C Hogle Ford Motor Company presented the Mark II GT Ignition and Electrical System Publication at the SAE Congress Detroit Michigan January Beginning in Earl W Meyer at Chrysler worked on EI continuing until and resulting in use of EI on the company s NASCAR hemis in and br Prest O Lite s CD which relied on capacitance discharge CD appeared in and had an unprecedented mile warranty This differs from the non CD Prest O Lite system introduced on AMC products in and made standard equipment for the model year A similar CD unit was available from Delco in which was optional on Oldsmobile Pontiac and GMC vehicles in the model year Also in Motorola debuted their breakerless CD system The most famous aftermarket electronic ignition which debuted in was the Delta Mark capacitive discharge ignition which was sold assembled or as a kit br The Fiat Dino was the first production car to come standard with EI in followed by the Jaguar XJ Series in Chrysler after a trial in and by Ford and GM in br In Prest O Lite made a Black Box ignition amplifier intended to take the load off the distributor s breaker points during high rpm runs which was used by Dodge and Plymouth on their factory Super Stock Coronet and Belvedere drag racers This amplifier was installed on the interior side of the cars firewall and had a duct which provided outside air to cool the unit The rest of the system distributor and spark plugs remains as for the mechanical system The lack of moving parts compared with the mechanical system leads to greater reliability and longer service intervals br A variation coil on plug ignition has each coil handle two plugs on cylinders which are degrees out of phase and therefore reach top dead center TDC at the same time in the four cycle engine this means that one plug will be sparking during the end of the exhaust stroke while the other fires at the usual time a so called wasted spark arrangement which has no drawbacks apart from faster spark plug erosion the paired cylinders are and on four cylinder arrangements on six cylinder engines and and on V engines Other systems do away with the distributor as a timing apparatus and use a magnetic crank angle sensor mounted on the crankshaft to trigger the ignition at the proper time br br br Engine Control Units br Modern automotive engines use an engine control unit ECU which is a single device that controls various engine functions including the ignition system and the fuel injection This contrasts earlier engines where the fuel injection and ignition were operated as separate systems br br br Gas turbine and rocket engines br Gas turbine engines including jet engines use capacitor discharge ignition however the ignition system is only used at startup or when the combustor s flame goes out br The ignition system in a rocket engine is critical to avoiding a hard start or explosion Rockets often employ pyrotechnic devices that place flames across the face of the injector plate or alternatively hypergolic propellants that ignite spontaneously on contact with each other br br br See also br br Electromagnetism br Faraday s law of induction br History of the internal combustion engine br br br
