Rhodium is a chemical element it has symbol Rh and atomic number It is a very rare silvery white hard corrosion resistant transition metal It is a noble metal and a member of the platinum group It has only one naturally occurring isotope which is Rh Naturally occurring rhodium is usually found as a free metal or as an alloy with similar metals and rarely as a chemical compound in minerals such as bowieite and rhodplumsite It is one of the rarest and most valuable precious metals br Rhodium is found in platinum or nickel ores with the other members of the platinum group metals It was discovered in by William Hyde Wollaston in one such ore and named for the rose color of one of its chlorine compounds br The element s major use consuming about of world rhodium production is as one of the catalysts in the three way catalytic converters in automobiles Because rhodium metal is inert against corrosion and most aggressive chemicals and because of its rarity rhodium is usually alloyed with platinum or palladium and applied in high temperature and corrosion resistive coatings White gold is often plated with a thin rhodium layer to improve its appearance while sterling silver is often rhodium plated to resist tarnishing Rhodium is sometimes used to cure silicones a two part silicone in which one part containing a silicon hydride and the other containing a vinyl terminated silicone are mixed one of these liquids contains a rhodium complex br Rhodium detectors are used in nuclear reactors to measure the neutron flux level Other uses of rhodium include asymmetric hydrogenation used to form drug precursors and the processes for the production of acetic acid br br br History br br Rhodium Greek rhodon meaning rose was discovered in by William Hyde Wollaston soon after he discovered palladium He used crude platinum ore presumably obtained from South America His procedure dissolved the ore in aqua regia and neutralized the acid with sodium hydroxide NaOH He then precipitated the platinum as ammonium chloroplatinate by adding ammonium chloride NH Cl Most other metals like copper lead palladium and rhodium were precipitated with zinc Diluted nitric acid dissolved all but palladium and rhodium Of these palladium dissolved in aqua regia but rhodium did not and the rhodium was precipitated by the addition of sodium chloride as Na RhCl nH O After being washed with ethanol the rose red precipitate was reacted with zinc which displaced the rhodium in the ionic compound and thereby released the rhodium as free metal br For decades the rare element had only minor applications for example by the turn of the century rhodium containing thermocouples were used to measure temperatures up to C They have exceptionally good stability in the temperature range of to C br The first major application was electroplating for decorative uses and as corrosion resistant coating The introduction of the three way catalytic converter by Volvo in increased the demand for rhodium The previous catalytic converters used platinum or palladium while the three way catalytic converter used rhodium to reduce the amount of NOx in the exhaust br br br Characteristics br br Rhodium is a hard silvery durable metal that has a high reflectance Rhodium metal does not normally form an oxide even when heated Oxygen is absorbed from the atmosphere only at the melting point of rhodium but is released on solidification Rhodium has both a higher melting point and lower density than platinum It is not attacked by most acids it is completely insoluble in nitric acid and dissolves slightly in aqua regia br br br Chemical properties br br Rhodium belongs to group of the periodic table but exhibits an atypical ground state valence electron configuration for that group Like neighboring elements niobium ruthenium and palladium it only has one electron in its outermost s orbital br br The common oxidation state of rhodium is but oxidation states from to are also observed br br Unlike ruthenium and osmium rhodium forms no volatile oxygen compounds The known stable oxides include Rh O RhO RhO xH O Na RhO Sr LiRhO and Sr NaRhO Halogen compounds are known in nearly the full range of possible oxidation states Rhodium III chloride rhodium trifluoride rhodium pentafluoride and rhodium hexafluoride are examples The lower oxidation states are stable only in the presence of ligands br The best known rhodium halogen compound is the Wilkinson s catalyst chlorotris triphenylphosphine rhodium I This catalyst is used in the hydroformylation or hydrogenation of alkenes br br br Isotopes br br Naturally occurring rhodium is composed of only one isotope Rh The most stable radioisotopes are Rh with a half life of years Rh with a half life of days mRh with a half life of years and Rh with a half life of days Twenty other radioisotopes have been characterized with atomic weights ranging from u Rh to u Rh Most of these have half lives shorter than an hour except Rh hours and Rh hours Rhodium has numerous meta states the most stable being mRh MeV with a half life of about years and mRh MeV with a half life of days see isotopes of rhodium br In isotopes weighing less than the stable isotope the primary decay mode is electron capture and the primary decay product is ruthenium In isotopes greater than the primary decay mode is beta emission and the primary product is palladium br br br Occurrence br Rhodium is one of the rarest elements in the Earth s crust comprising an estimated parts per million Its rarity affects its price and its use in commercial applications The concentration of rhodium in nickel meteorites is typically part per billion Rhodium has been measured in some potatoes with concentrations between and ppt br br br Mining and price br br The industrial extraction of rhodium is complex because the ores are mixed with other metals such as palladium silver platinum and gold and there are very few rhodium bearing minerals It is found in platinum ores and extracted as a white inert metal that is difficult to fuse Principal sources are located in South Africa in river sands of the Ural Mountains in Russia and in North America including the copper nickel sulfide mining area of the Sudbury Ontario region Although the rhodium abundance at Sudbury is very small the large amount of processed nickel ore makes rhodium recovery cost effective br The main exporter of rhodium is South Africa approximately in followed by Russia The annual world production is tonnes The price of rhodium is highly variable br br br Used nuclear fuels br br Rhodium is a fission product of uranium each kilogram of fission product contains a significant amount of the lighter platinum group metals Used nuclear fuel is therefore a potential source of rhodium but the extraction is complex and expensive and the presence of rhodium radioisotopes requires a period of cooling storage for multiple half lives of the longest lived isotope Rh with a half life of years and mRh with a half life of years or about years These factors make the source unattractive and no large scale extraction has been attempted br br br Applications br The primary use of this element is in automobiles as a catalytic converter changing harmful unburned hydrocarbons carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide exhaust emissions into less noxious gases Of kg of rhodium consumed worldwide in kg went into this application and kg was recovered from old converters About kg of rhodium was used in the glass industry mostly for production of fiberglass and flat panel glass and kg was used in the chemical industry br br br Catalyst br Rhodium is preferable to the other platinum metals in the reduction of nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and oxygen br br In net demand with the recycling accounted for of rhodium for automotive converters made up of the world usage with the number fluctuating around in br Rhodium catalysts are used in a number of industrial processes notably in catalytic carbonylation of methanol to produce acetic acid by the Monsanto process It is also used to catalyze addition of hydrosilanes to molecular double bonds a process important in manufacture of certain silicone rubbers Rhodium catalysts are also used to reduce benzene to cyclohexane br The complex of a rhodium ion with BINAP is a widely used chiral catalyst for chiral synthesis as in the synthesis of menthol br br br Ornamental uses br Rhodium finds use in jewelry and for decorations It is electroplated on white gold and platinum to give it a reflective white surface at time of sale after which the thin layer wears away with use This is known as rhodium flashing in the jewelry business It may also be used in coating sterling silver to protect against tarnish silver sulfide Ag S produced from atmospheric hydrogen sulfide H S Solid pure rhodium jewelry is very rare more because of the difficulty of fabrication high melting point and poor malleability than because of the high price The high cost ensures that rhodium is applied only as an electroplate br Rhodium has also been used for honors or to signify elite status when more commonly used metals such as silver gold or platinum were deemed insufficient In the Guinness Book of World Records gave Paul McCartney a rhodium plated disc for being history s all time best selling songwriter and recording artist br br br Other uses br Rhodium is used as an alloying agent for hardening and improving the corrosion resistance of platinum and palladium These alloys are used in furnace windings bushings for glass fiber production thermocouple elements electrodes for aircraft spark plugs and laboratory crucibles Other uses include br br Electrical contacts where it is valued for small electrical resistance small and stable contact resistance and great corrosion resistance br Rhodium plated by either electroplating or evaporation is extremely hard and useful for optical instruments br Filters in mammography systems for the characteristic X rays it produces br Rhodium neutron detectors are used in nuclear reactors to measure neutron flux levels this method requires a digital filter to determine the current neutron flux level generating three separate signals immediate a few seconds delay and a minute delay each with its own signal level all three are combined in the rhodium detector signal The three Palo Verde nuclear reactors each have rhodium neutron detectors detectors on each of five vertical levels providing an accurate D picture of reactivity and allowing fine tuning to consume the nuclear fuel most economically br In automobile manufacturing rhodium is also used in the construction of headlight reflectors br br br br br br br br br br br br

lethal dose LD for rats is mg RhCl per kilogram of body weight Like the other noble metals rhodium has not been found to serve any biological function br People can be exposed to rhodium in the workplace by inhalation The Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA has specified the legal limit Permissible exposure limit for rhodium exposure in the workplace at mg m over an hour workday and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH has set the recommended exposure limit REL at the same level At levels of mg m rhodium is immediately dangerous to life or
