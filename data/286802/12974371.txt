Irwin M Lachman born August is an American engineer and is a co inventor of the catalytic converter br br br Biography br Lachman was born August in Brooklyn New York in moved to and grew up in Jersey Homesteads New Jersey and attended the public Upper Freehold Township High School later renamed Allentown High School He received a B S in ceramic engineering from Rutgers University in and then a M S and a Ph D in ceramic engineering while at Ohio State University in and After serving in the United States Air Force he worked for Thermo Materials Inc and Sandia National Laboratories before joining Corning s ceramic research department in Lachman retired in and pursued his artistic interests by creating monoprints that he exhibits at galleries and shows br br br Work br br At Corning Glass Works Lachman was a member of the team that invented the first inexpensive mass producible catalytic converter for automobiles operating internal combustion engines In addition to Irwin Lachman the team consisted of engineer Rodney Bagley and geologist Ronald Lewis While working at Corning Irwin Lachman co invented the ceramic substrate found in almost all catalytic converters which greatly reduce the amount of harmful pollutants in automotive emissions br Lachman and his colleagues were critical in developing an efficient and feasible catalytic converter Lachman realized ceramics could be ideally suited to meet the demands placed on a catalytic converter The composition he worked on offered better resistance to sudden and extreme temperature fluctuations Lachman s fundamental ceramics technology ultimately decreases pollution released into the environment Their work was a response to the Clean Air Act and reduced polluting emissions from the combustion process by Additionally because the catalyst they used in their invention platinum required removing lead from gasoline as an additive their device offered a secondary benefit to the environment by reducing lead pollution br Working together in the early s at Corning Inc in Corning N Y Lachman Bagley and Lewis all used cellular ceramic technology to create the ceramic honeycomb that became the essential core component of catalytic converters Lachman and Lewis worked on the project for two years to develop a new ceramic material that had all the key characteristics they needed high temperature durability low thermal expansion low thermal conductivity at high temperatures light weight and controlled porosity br Lachman along with Bagley and Lewis were inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in and received the National Medal of Technology at a White House ceremony The team also won the International Ceramics Prize of the Academy for the Advanced Ceramics industry in Lachman holds U S patents and has authored numerous technical papers br br br
