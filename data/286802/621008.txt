title: Air cooling
id: 621008
Air cooling is a method of dissipating heat It works by expanding the surface area or increasing the flow of air over the object to be cooled or both An example of the former is to add cooling fins to the surface of the object either by making them integral or by attaching them tightly to the object s surface to ensure efficient heat transfer In the case of the latter it is done by using a fan blowing air into or onto the object one wants to cool The addition of fins to a heat sink increases its total surface area resulting in greater cooling effectiveness There are two types of cooling pads that can be used for air cooling one is the honeycomb design and another one is excelsior br In all cases the air has to be cooler than the object or surface from which it is expected to remove heat This is due to the second law of thermodynamics which states that heat will only move spontaneously from a hot reservoir the heat sink to a cold reservoir the air br br br Derating at high altitude br When operating in an environment with lower air pressure like high altitude or airplane cabins the cooling capacity has to be derated compared to that of sea level br A rule of thumb formula to note h derating factor Where h is the height over sea level in meters And the result is the factor that should be multiplied with the cooling capacity in W to get the cooling capacity at the specified height over sea level br br br See also br Computer cooling br Computer fan br Deep water air cooling br Evaporative cooling br Water cooling br Oil cooling br Heat pipe cooling br Peltier cooling br Heater core br br br br br br Further reading br Biermann A E The design of fins for air cooled cylinders PDF Report N NACA br P V Lamarque The design of cooling fins for Motorcycle Engines Report of the Automobile Research Committee Institution of Automobile Engineers Magazine March issue and also in The Institution of Automobile Engineers Proceedings Session pp and br Julius Mackerle Air Cooled Motor Engines Charles Griffin Company Ltd London br Anish Gokhale et al Optimization of Engine Cooling through Conjugate Heat Transfer Simulation and Analysis of Fins SAE Paper
