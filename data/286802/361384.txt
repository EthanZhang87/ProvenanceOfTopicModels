Liquefied petroleum gas also referred to as liquid petroleum gas LPG or LP gas is a fuel gas which contains a flammable mixture of hydrocarbon gases specifically propane n butane and isobutane It can sometimes contain some propylene butylene and isobutene br LPG is used as a fuel gas in heating appliances cooking equipment and vehicles It is increasingly used as an aerosol propellant and a refrigerant replacing chlorofluorocarbons in an effort to reduce damage to the ozone layer When specifically used as a vehicle fuel it is often referred to as autogas or even just as gas br Varieties of LPG that are bought and sold include mixes that are mostly propane C H mostly butane C H and most commonly mixes including both propane and butane In the northern hemisphere winter the mixes contain more propane while in summer they contain more butane In the United States mainly two grades of LPG are sold commercial propane and HD These specifications are published by the Gas Processors Association GPA and the American Society of Testing and Materials Propane butane blends are also listed in these specifications br Propylene butylenes and various other hydrocarbons are usually also present in small concentrations such as C H CH and C H HD limits the amount of propylene that can be placed in LPG to and is utilized as an autogas specification A powerful odorant ethanethiol is added so that leaks can be detected easily The internationally recognized European Standard is EN In the United States tetrahydrothiophene thiophane or amyl mercaptan are also approved odorants although neither is currently being utilized br LPG is prepared by refining petroleum or wet natural gas and is almost entirely derived from fossil fuel sources being manufactured during the refining of petroleum crude oil or extracted from petroleum or natural gas streams as they emerge from the ground It was first produced in by Walter O Snelling and the first commercial products appeared in It currently provides about of all energy consumed and burns relatively cleanly with no soot and very little sulfur emission As it is a gas it does not pose ground or water pollution hazards but it can cause air pollution LPG has a typical specific calorific value of MJ kg compared with MJ kg for fuel oil and MJ kg for premium grade petrol gasoline However its energy density per volume unit of MJ L is lower than either that of petrol or fuel oil as its relative density is lower about kg L compared to kg L for gasoline As the density and vapor pressure of LPG or its components change significantly with temperature this fact must be considered every time when the application is connected with safety or custody transfer operations e g typical cuttoff level option for LPG reservoir is br Besides its use as an energy carrier LPG is also a promising feedstock in the chemical industry for the synthesis of olefins such as ethylene propylene br As its boiling point is below room temperature LPG will evaporate quickly at normal temperatures and pressures and is usually supplied in pressurized steel vessels They are typically filled to of their capacity to allow for thermal expansion of the contained liquid The ratio of the densities of the liquid and vapor varies depending on composition pressure and temperature but is typically around The pressure at which LPG becomes liquid called its vapour pressure likewise varies depending on composition and temperature for example it is approximately kilopascals psi for pure butane at C F and approximately kilopascals psi for pure propane at C F LPG in its gaseous phase is still heavier than air unlike natural gas and thus will flow along floors and tend to settle in low spots such as basements There are two main dangers to this The first is a possible explosion if the mixture of LPG and air is within the explosive limits and there is an ignition source The second is suffocation due to LPG displacing air causing a decrease in oxygen concentration br A full LPG gas cylinder contains liquid the ullage volume will contain vapour at a pressure that varies with temperature br br br LPG prices around the world br br br Uses br LPG has a wide variety of uses in many different markets as an efficient fuel container in the agricultural recreation hospitality industrial construction sailing and fishing sectors It can serve as fuel for cooking central heating and water heating and is a particularly cost effective and efficient way to heat off grid homes br br br Cooking br LPG is used for cooking in many countries for economic reasons for convenience or because it is the preferred fuel source br In India nearly million tons of LPG were consumed in the six months between April and September in the domestic sector mainly for cooking The number of domestic connections are million i e one connection for every six people with a circulation of more than million LPG cylinders Most of the LPG requirement is imported Piped city gas supply in India is not yet developed on a major scale LPG is subsidised by the Indian government for domestic users An increase in LPG prices has been a politically sensitive matter in India as it potentially affects the middle class voting pattern br LPG was once a standard cooking fuel in Hong Kong however the continued expansion of town gas to newer buildings has reduced LPG usage to less than of residential units However other than electric induction or infrared stoves LPG fueled stoves are the only type available in most suburban villages and many public housing estates br LPG is the most common cooking fuel in Brazilian urban areas being used in virtually all households with the exception of the cities of Rio de Janeiro and S o Paulo which have a natural gas pipeline infrastructure Since poor families receive a government grant Vale G s used exclusively for the acquisition of LPG Since this grant is part of the government s main social welfare program Bolsa Fam lia Also since the national oil company Petrobras differentiates between LPG destined for cooking and LPG destined for other uses establishing a lower price for the former This is a result of a directive from the Brazilian federal government but its discontinuation is currently being debated br LPG is commonly used in North America for domestic cooking and outdoor grilling br br br Rural heating br br Predominantly in Europe and rural parts of many countries LPG can provide an alternative to electric heating heating oil or kerosene LPG is most often used in areas that do not have direct access to piped natural gas In the UK about households use LPG for heating br LPG can be used as a power source for combined heat and power technologies CHP CHP is the process of generating both electrical power and useful heat from a single fuel source This technology has allowed LPG to be used not just as fuel for heating and cooking but also for decentralized generation of electricity br br LPG can be stored in a variety of manners LPG as with other fossil fuels can be combined with renewable power sources to provide greater reliability while still achieving some reduction in CO emissions However as opposed to wind and solar renewable energy sources LPG can be used as a standalone energy source without the prohibitive expense of electrical energy storage In many climates renewable sources such as solar and wind power would still require the construction installation and maintenance of reliable baseload power sources such as LPG fueled generation to provide electrical power during the entire year wind solar is possible the caveat being that the expense of the additional generation capacity necessary to charge batteries plus the cost of battery electrical storage makes this option economically feasible in only a minority of situations br br br Motor fuel br br When LPG is used to fuel internal combustion engines it is often referred to as autogas or auto propane In some countries it has been used since the s as a petrol alternative for spark ignition engines In some countries there are additives in the liquid that extend engine life and the ratio of butane to propane is kept quite precise in fuel LPG Two recent studies have examined LPG fuel oil fuel mixes and found that smoke emissions and fuel consumption are reduced but hydrocarbon emissions are increased The studies were split on CO emissions with one finding significant increases and the other finding slight increases at low engine load but a considerable decrease at high engine load Its advantage is that it is non toxic non corrosive and free of tetraethyllead or any additives and has a high octane rating RON depending on local specifications It burns more cleanly than petrol or fuel oil and is especially free of the particulates present in the latter br LPG has a lower energy density per liter than either petrol or fuel oil so the equivalent fuel consumption is higher Many governments impose less tax on LPG than on petrol or fuel oil which helps offset the greater consumption of LPG than of petrol or fuel oil However in many European countries this tax break is often compensated by a much higher annual tax on cars using LPG than on cars using petrol or fuel oil Propane is the third most widely used motor fuel in the world estimates are that over million vehicles are fueled by propane gas worldwide Over million tonnes over billion US gallons are used annually as a vehicle fuel br Not all automobile engines are suitable for use with LPG as a fuel LPG provides less upper cylinder lubrication than petrol or diesel so LPG fueled engines are more prone to valve wear if they are not suitably modified Many modern common rail diesel engines respond well to LPG use as a supplementary fuel This is where LPG is used as fuel as well as diesel Systems are now available that integrate with OEM engine management systems br Conversion kits can switch a vehicle dedicated to gasoline to using a dual system in which both gasoline and LPG are used in the same vehicle br In BW LPG successfully retrofitted a Very Large Gas Carrier VLGC with LPG propulsion technology pioneering LPG s application in large scale maritime operations LPG s lowers emissions of carbon dioxide sulfur oxides nitrogen oxides and particulate matter align with stricter standards set by the International Maritime Organization IMO making LPG a viable transition option as the maritime industry transitions towards net zero carbon emissions br br br Conversion to gasoline br LPG can be converted into alkylate which is a premium gasoline blending stock because it has exceptional anti knock properties and gives clean burning br br br Refrigeration br LPG is instrumental in providing off the grid refrigeration usually by means of a gas absorption refrigerator br Blended from pure dry propane refrigerant designator R and isobutane R a the blend R a has negligible ozone depletion potential very low global warming potential and can serve as a functional replacement for R R R a and other chlorofluorocarbon or hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants in conventional stationary refrigeration and air conditioning systems br Such substitution is widely prohibited or discouraged in motor vehicle air conditioning systems on the grounds that using flammable hydrocarbons in systems originally designed to carry non flammable refrigerant presents a significant risk of fire or explosion br Vendors and advocates of hydrocarbon refrigerants argue against such bans on the grounds that there have been very few such incidents relative to the number of vehicle air conditioning systems filled with hydrocarbons One particular test conducted by a professor at the University of New South Wales unintentionally tested the worst case scenario of a sudden and complete refrigerant expulsion into the passenger compartment followed by subsequent ignition He and several others in the car sustained minor burns to their face ears and hands and several observers received lacerations from the burst glass of the front passenger window No one was seriously injured br br br Propellant br br br Global production br Global LPG production reached over million metric tons per year Mt a in while global LPG consumption to over Mt a of LPG is extracted from natural gas while the rest is produced by petroleum refineries from crude oil of global consumption is in the domestic sector The U S is the leading producer and exporter of LPG br br br Security of supply br Because of the natural gas and the oil refining industry Europe is almost self sufficient in LPG Europe s security of supply is further safeguarded by br br a wide range of sources both inside and outside Europe br a flexible supply chain via water rail and road with numerous routes and entry points into Europe br According to estimates proven world reserves of natural gas from which most LPG is derived stand at trillion cubic meters trillion cubic feet Production continues to grow at an average annual rate of br br br Comparison with natural gas br br LPG is composed mainly of propane and butane while natural gas is composed of the lighter methane and ethane LPG vaporised and at atmospheric pressure has a higher calorific value MJ m equivalent to kWh m than natural gas methane MJ m equivalent to kWh m which means that LPG cannot simply be substituted for natural gas In order to allow the use of the same burner controls and to provide for similar combustion characteristics LPG can be mixed with air to produce a synthetic natural gas SNG that can be easily substituted LPG air mixing ratios average though this is widely variable based on the gases making up the LPG The method for determining the mixing ratios is by calculating the Wobbe index of the mix Gases having the same Wobbe index are held to be interchangeable br LPG based SNG is used in emergency backup systems for many public industrial and military installations and many utilities use LPG peak shaving plants in times of high demand to make up shortages in natural gas supplied to their distributions systems LPG SNG installations are also used during initial gas system introductions when the distribution infrastructure is in place before gas supplies can be connected Developing markets in India and China among others use LPG SNG systems to build up customer bases prior to expanding existing natural gas systems br LPG based SNG or natural gas with localized storage and piping distribution network to the households for catering to each cluster of domestic consumers can be planned under the initial phase of the city gas network system This would eliminate the last mile LPG cylinders road transport which is a cause of traffic and safety hurdles in Indian cities These localized natural gas networks are successfully operating in Japan with feasibility to get connected to wider networks in both villages and cities br br br Environmental effects br Commercially available LPG is currently derived mainly from fossil fuels Burning LPG releases carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas The reaction also produces some carbon monoxide LPG does however release less CO per unit of energy than does coal or oil but more than natural gas It emits of the CO per kWh produced by oil of that of coal and less than of that emitted by coal generated electricity distributed via the grid Being a mix of propane and butane LPG emits less carbon per joule than butane but more carbon per joule than propane br LPG burns more cleanly than higher molecular weight hydrocarbons because it releases less particulate matter br As it is much less polluting than most traditional solid fuel stoves replacing cookstoves used in developing countries with LPG is one of the key strategies adopted to reduce household air pollution in the developing world br br br Fire explosion risk and mitigation br br In a refinery or gas plant LPG must be stored in pressure vessels These containers are either cylindrical and horizontal sometimes referred to as bullet tanks or spherical of the Horton sphere type Typically these vessels are designed and manufactured according to some code In the United States this code is governed by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers ASME br LPG containers have pressure relief valves such that when subjected to exterior heating sources they will vent LPGs to the atmosphere or a flare stack br If a tank is subjected to a fire of sufficient duration and intensity it can undergo a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion BLEVE This is typically a concern for large refineries and petrochemical plants that maintain very large containers In general tanks are designed so that the product will vent faster than pressure can build to dangerous levels br One remedy that is utilized in industrial settings is to equip such containers with a measure to provide a fire resistance rating Large spherical LPG containers may have up to a cm steel wall thickness They are equipped with an approved pressure relief valve A large fire in the vicinity of the vessel will increase its temperature and pressure The relief valve on the top is designed to vent off excess pressure in order to prevent the rupture of the container itself Given a fire of sufficient duration and intensity the pressure being generated by the boiling and expanding gas can exceed the ability of the valve to vent the excess Alternatively br if due to continued venting the liquid level drops below the area being heated the tank structure can be overheated and subsequently weakened in that area If either occurs the container may rupture violently launching pieces of the vessel at high velocity while the released products can ignite as well potentially causing catastrophic damage to anything nearby including other containers br People can be exposed to LPG in the workplace by breathing it in skin contact and eye contact The Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA has set the legal limit Permissible exposure limit for LPG exposure in the workplace as ppm mg m over an hour workday The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH has set a recommended exposure limit REL of ppm mg m over an hour workday At levels of ppm of the lower explosive limit LPG is considered immediately dangerous to life and health due solely to safety considerations pertaining to risk of explosion br br br See also br br
