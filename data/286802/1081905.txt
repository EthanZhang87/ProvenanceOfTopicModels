title: Overhead valve engine
id: 1081905
An overhead valve OHV engine sometimes called a pushrod engine is a piston engine whose valves are located in the cylinder head above the combustion chamber This contrasts with flathead engines where the valves were located below the combustion chamber in the engine block br Although an overhead camshaft OHC engine also has overhead valves the common usage of the term overhead valve engine is limited to engines where the camshaft is located in the engine block In these traditional OHV engines the motion of the camshaft is transferred using pushrods hence the term pushrod engine and rocker arms to operate the valves at the top of the engine However some designs have the camshaft in the cylinder head but still sit below or alongside the valves the Ford CVH and Opel CIH are good examples so they can essentially be considered overhead valve designs br Some early intake over exhaust engines used a hybrid design combining elements of both side valves and overhead valves br br br History br br br Predecessors br The first internal combustion engines were based on steam engines and therefore used slide valves This was the case for the first Otto engine which was first successfully run in As internal combustion engines began to develop separately to steam engines poppet valves became increasingly common br Beginning with the Daimler Reitwagen several cars and motorcycles used inlet valve s located in the cylinder head however these valves were vacuum actuated atmospheric rather than driven by a camshaft as with typical OHV engines The exhaust valve s were driven by a camshaft but were located in the engine block as with side valve engines br The Diesel prototype engine used overhead poppet valves actuated by a camshaft pushrods and rocker arms therefore becoming the first OHV engines In U S patent was taken out by William F Davis for an OHV engine with liquid coolant used to cool the cylinder head but no working model was built br br br Production OHV engines br In bicycle manufacturer Walter Lorenzo Marr in the United States built a motorised tricycle powered by a single cylinder OHV engine Marr was hired by Buick then named Buick Auto Vim and Power Company from where the overhead valve engine design was further refined This engine employed pushrod actuated rocker arms which in turn opened poppet valves parallel to the pistons Marr returned to Buick in having built a small quantity of the Marr Auto Car with one of the first known engines to use an overhead camshaft design the same year that Buick received a patent for an overhead valve engine design In the world s first production OHV engine was released in the Buick Model B The engine was a flat twin design with two valves per cylinder The engine was very successful for Buick with the company selling such cars in and the OHV engine has powered almost all Buick automobiles since then br Several other manufacturers began to produce OHV engines such as the Wright Brothers Vertical Cylinder Engine In Chevrolet joined Buick in almost exclusive use of OHV engines However side valve engines remained commonplace until the mid to late s when they began to be phased out for OHV engines br br br Overhead camshaft engines br br The first overhead camshaft OHC engine dates back to in the Marr however use of this design was mostly limited to high performance cars for many decades OHC engines slowly became more common from the s to the s and by the start of the st century the majority of automotive engines except for some North American V engines used an OHC design br At the Indianapolis motor race Team Penske entered a car powered by the custom built Mercedes Benz I pushrod engine Due to a loophole in the rules the pushrod engine was allowed to use a larger displacement and higher boost pressure significantly increasing its power output compared to the OHC engines used by other teams Team Penske qualified in pole position and won the race by a large margin br In the early st century several pushrod V engines from General Motors and Chrysler used variable displacement to reduce fuel consumption and exhaust emissions In the first production pushrod engine to use variable valve timing was introduced in the Dodge Viper fourth generation br br br Design br br OHV engines have several advantages compared with OHC engines br br Smaller overall packaging The cam in block design of an OHV engine results in a smaller overall size compared with an equivalent OHC engine which can have significant advantages in center of gravity and hood height br Using the same cylinder head casting for both cylinder banks A V type engine design allows both cylinder heads to be mirror images of each other at the front of each cylinder bank In a V type OHV engine design it is possible to use the same cylinder head casting for both banks by simply flipping it around for the second bank The General Motors LS based small block engine family is a popular example of these kinds of OHV V type engines br Simpler camshaft drive system OHV engines have a less complex drive system for the camshaft when compared with OHC engines Most OHC engines drive the camshaft or camshafts using a timing belt a chain or multiple chains These systems require the use of tensioners which add complexity In contrast an OHV engine has the camshaft positioned close to the crankshaft which may be driven by a much shorter chain or even direct gear connection However this is somewhat negated by a more complex valvetrain requiring pushrods br Simpler lubrication system The lubrication requirements for OHV cylinder heads are much lower as they lack a camshaft and related bearings to lubricate rather they typically have a single camshaft within the block where an OHC engine can have two per bank of cylinders requiring oil passages into the cylinder head OHV heads only need lubrication for the rocker arms at the pushrod end trunnion and rocker tip This lubrication is typically provided through the hollow pushrods themselves rather than a dedicated lubrication system in the head The reduced lubrication requirements can also mean that a smaller lower capacity oil pump is used br Compared with OHC engines OHV engines have the following disadvantages br br Limited engine speeds Although OHV engines have simpler drive systems for the camshaft there are a greater number of moving parts in the valvetrain i e the lifters pushrods and rockers Inertia from these valvetrain parts makes OHV engines more susceptible to valve float at high engine speeds RPM br Constraints on valve quantity and location OHC engines often have four valves per cylinder whereas it is rare for an OHV engine to have more than two valves per cylinder In OHV engines the size and shape of the intake ports as well as the position of the valves are limited by the pushrods and the need to accommodate them in the head casting br br br
