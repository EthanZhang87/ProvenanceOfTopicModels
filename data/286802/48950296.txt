Ceria zirconia is a solid solution of cerium IV oxide CeO also known as ceria and zirconium oxide ZrO also known as zirconia br br br Crystal Structure and Stability br The crystal structure adopted by ceria zirconia depends on the Zr Ce ratio and temperature At very low Zr concentrations ceria zirconia exhibits the cubic fluorite structure which is common to both pure ceria and cubic zirconia pure zirconia normally only adopts a cubic structure at high temperatures However at higher Zr contents other crystal structures are formed including two different tetragonal phases at intermediate Zr concentrations and a monoclinic phase at very high Zr concentrations br There is both experimental and theoretical evidence showing that the decomposition of ceria zirconia into Ce rich and Zr rich oxides is thermodynamically favorable in a wide range of solid solution compositions indicating that ceria zirconia is metastable with respect to phase separation br br br Technological Importance br Ceria zirconia is widely used as a component in current three way catalytic converters The ceria based component of the converter has several functions including promoting the dispersion of the noble metals in the catalyst but also storing and releasing oxygen The incorporation of zirconium in modern converters forming ceria zirconia improves the performance of the catalyst by enhancing the resistance of the material to sintering and simultaneously increasing the ability of the oxide to accommodate oxygen vacancies in its structure br br br
