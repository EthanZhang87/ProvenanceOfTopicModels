title: Diesel exhaust fluid
id: 2368411
Diesel exhaust fluid DEF also known as AUS and marketed as AdBlue is a liquid used to reduce the amount of air pollution created by a diesel engine Specifically DEF is an aqueous urea solution made with urea and deionized water DEF is consumed in a selective catalytic reduction SCR that lowers the concentration of nitrogen oxides NOx in the diesel exhaust emissions from a diesel engine br br br Other names br In the international standard defining DEF ISO it is referred to as AUS aqueous urea solution DEF is also sold as AdBlue a registered trademark of the German Association of the Automotive Industry br Several brands of SCR systems use DEF BlueHDI is used by PSA Group vehicles including Peugeot Citro n and DS Automobiles brands BlueTec by Daimler AG and FLENDS Final Low Emission New Diesel System by UD Trucks Blue Sky DEF is made and distributed for retail sale by Prime Lubes Inc br br br Background br Diesel engines are typically operated with a lean burn air to fuel ratio over stoichiometric ratio to ensure the full combustion of soot and to prevent them from exhausting unburnt fuel The excess air leads to the generation of NOx which are harmful pollutants from nitrogen in the atmosphere SCR is used to reduce the amount of NOx released into the atmosphere DEF from a separate tank is injected into the exhaust pipeline and the exhaust heat decomposes it to ammonia Within the SCR catalyst the NOx are reduced by the ammonia into water and nitrogen which are both nonpolluting The water and nitrogen are then released into the atmosphere through the exhaust br SCR was applied to automobiles by Nissan Diesel Corporation and the first practical product Nissan Diesel Quon was introduced in With the cooperation of the oil and chemical industry a station infrastructure to supply DEF was prepared by September in Japan br In the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA enacted requirements to significantly reduce harmful exhaust emissions To achieve this standard Cummins and other diesel engine manufacturers developed an aftertreatment system that includes the use of a diesel particulate filter DPF br As the DPF does not function with low sulfur diesel fuel diesel engines that conform to EPA emissions standards require ultra low sulfur diesel ULSD fuel to prevent damage to the DPF After a brief transition period ULSD fuel became common at fuel pumps in the United States and Canada br The EPA regulations were meant to be an interim solution to allow manufacturers time to prepare for the more stringent EPA regulations which reduced NOx levels even further In the concerns about compliance shifted to the infrastructure for DEF distribution br The injection rate of DEF into the exhaust depends on the specific after treatment system but is typically of diesel consumption volume This low dosing rate ensures long fluid refill intervals and minimizes the tank s size and intrusion into vehicle packaging space An electronic control unit adjusts the addition of fluid in accordance with parameters such as NOx level in the exhaust gas before catalytic converter after catalytic converter and possibly between catalytic converters if there is more than one current ammonia filling level engine operating temperature and speed br br br Chemistry br DEF is a solution of urea NH CO When it is injected into the hot exhaust gas stream the water evaporates and the urea thermally decomposes to form ammonia NH and isocyanic acid HNCO br br NH CO NH HNCO br The isocyanic acid reacts with the water vapor and hydrolyses to carbon dioxide and ammonia br br HNCO H O CO NH br Overall thus far br br NH CO H O NH CO br Ammonia in the presence of oxygen and a catalyst reduces two different nitrogen oxides br br NO NH O N H O standard SCR and br NO NH N H O NO SCR selective catalytic reduction br NO NO NH N H O fast SCR br The overall reduction of NOx by urea is then br br NH CO NO O N H O CO and br NH CO NO N H O CO and br NH CO NO NO N H O CO br The ratio between NO and NO determines which reactions take place and how fast The highest conversion rates are achieved if equal amounts of NO and NO are present especially at temperatures between C and C If there is more NO than NO fast SCR and standard SCR take place sequentially If there is more NO than NO fast SCR and NO SCR take place sequentially however NO SCR is slower than standard SCR and ammonium nitrate can form and temporarily deactivate the catalytic converter br br br Operation in winter time br DEF freezes at C F For the SCR exhaust cleaning system to function at low temperatures a sufficient amount of the frozen DEF must be melted in as short time as possible preferably on the order of minutes For example EPA emissions requirements require full DEF coolant flow within minutes br In Europe Regulation EC No specified in Annex XVI point that DEF from a frozen tank at a core temperature of C F must become available within minutes when starting the engine at C F br Typically the frozen DEF is melted by heat from the engine e g engine coolant passing through the DEF tank governed by a thermostatic coolant control valve This method may take significant time before the SCR exhaust cleaning system is fully operational often up to an hour br Another method to thaw DEF and thus allow for full SCR operation is to integrate an electric heater into the DEF tank This heater must be sized positioned and powered adequately to rapidly melt sufficient frozen DEF It should preferably be self regulating not to overheat if part of the heater is outside of the liquid It should also preferably be self regulating to eliminate any complicated sensor and temperature regulating systems Furthermore the heater should not exceed C F as DEF begins to decompose at around C F PTC heaters are often used to achieve this br br br Safety and storage br The urea solution is clear non toxic and safe to handle Since urea has corrosive impact on metals like aluminium DEF is stored and transported in special containers These containers are typically made of stainless steel Vehicles selective catalytic reduction SCR systems and DEF dispensers are designed in a manner that there is no corrosive impact of urea on them It is recommended that DEF be stored in a cool dry and well ventilated area that is out of direct sunlight Bulk volumes of DEF are compatible for storage within polyethylene containers HDPE XLPE fiberglass reinforced plastic FRP and steel tanks DEF is also often handled in intermediate bulk containers for storage and shipping br DEF is offered to consumers in a variety of quantities ranging from containers for single or repeated small usage up to bulk carriers for consumers requiring a large amount of DEF As of many truck stops have added DEF pumps These are usually adjacent to fuel pumps so the driver can fill both tanks without moving the truck br In Europe increasing numbers of fuel stations offer AdBlue pumps not only for large commercial vehicles but also for passenger cars br At airports where DEF can sometimes be required for diesel ground service vehicles its labelling and storage must be carefully managed to avoid accidentally servicing jet aircraft with DEF instead of fuel system icing inhibitor a mistake that has been blamed for multiple in flight engine failure and grounding incidents br br br Supply shortage br br br South Korea br As of December a shortage of DEF in South Korea was continuing and brought havoc to its economy br As most of the urea used is supplied by China imports have slowed since China introduced mandatory inspections of urea exports in September br br Nearly of South Korea s urea imports came from China between January and September In South Korea had made it mandatory for diesel cars to use urea solutions to control emissions a move that now impacts of registered vehicles Diesel vehicles made since were required to be fitted with SCR systems The South Korean government started rationing urea solution and banned its resale as panic buying by drivers exacerbated an acute shortage that could cause transport and industry to grind to a halt A KC Cygnus was sent to import Diesel exhaust fluid from Australia to ease a supply shortage of the key material used in diesel vehicles br br br Australia br In early December the Australian National Road Transport Association also raised concerns about a shortage of DEF in the country due to the shortage of urea in China China capped exports to protect its domestic supplies and rising DEF prices By mid December there was approximately weeks supply of AdBlue left in Australia br On December an Australian company stated that it would build a new plant
