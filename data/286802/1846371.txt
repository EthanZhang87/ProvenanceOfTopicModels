id: 1846371
Air fuel ratio AFR is the mass ratio of air to a solid liquid or gaseous fuel present in a combustion process The combustion may take place in a controlled manner such as in an internal combustion engine or industrial furnace or may result in an explosion e g a dust explosion The air fuel ratio determines whether a mixture is combustible at all how much energy is being released and how much unwanted pollutants are produced in the reaction Typically a range of fuel to air ratios exists outside of which ignition will not occur These are known as the lower and upper explosive limits br In an internal combustion engine or industrial furnace the air fuel ratio is an important measure for anti pollution and performance tuning reasons If exactly enough air is provided to completely burn all of the fuel the ratio is known as the stoichiometric mixture often abbreviated to stoich Ratios lower than stoichiometric where the fuel is in excess are considered rich Rich mixtures are less efficient but may produce more power and burn cooler Ratios higher than stoichiometric where the air is in excess are considered lean Lean mixtures are more efficient but may cause higher temperatures which can lead to the formation of nitrogen oxides Some engines are designed with features to allow lean burn For precise air fuel ratio calculations the oxygen content of combustion air should be specified because of different air density due to different altitude or intake air temperature possible dilution by ambient water vapor or enrichment by oxygen additions br br br Air fuel ratio meters br An air fuel ratio meter monitors the air fuel ratio of an internal combustion engine Also called air fuel ratio gauge air fuel meter or air fuel gauge it reads the voltage output of an oxygen sensor sometimes also called AFR sensor or lambda sensor br The original narrow band oxygen sensors became factory installed standard in the late s and early s In recent years a newer and much more accurate wide band sensor though more expensive has become available br Most stand alone narrow band meters have LEDs and some have more Also common narrow band meters in round housings with the standard mounting and mm and in diameters as other types of car gauges These usually have or LEDs Analogue needle style gauges are also available br br br Internal combustion engines br In theory a stoichiometric mixture has just enough air to completely burn the available fuel In practice this is never quite achieved due primarily to the very short time available in an internal combustion engine for each combustion cycle br Most of the combustion process is completed in approximately milliseconds at an engine speed of revolutions per minute revolutions per second milliseconds per revolution of the crankshaft For a four stroke engine would mean milliseconds for each piston stroke and milliseconds to complete one four stroke degree cycle the Otto cycle This is the time that elapses from the spark plug firing until of the fuel air mix is combusted typically some degrees of crankshaft rotation later Catalytic converters are designed to work best when the exhaust gases passing through them are the result of nearly perfect combustion br A perfectly stoichiometric mixture burns very hot and can damage engine components if the engine is placed under high load at this fuel air mixture Due to the high temperatures at this mixture the detonation of the fuel air mix while approaching or shortly after maximum cylinder pressure is possible under high load referred to as knocking or pinging specifically a pre detonation event in the context of a spark ignition engine model Such detonation can cause serious engine damage as the uncontrolled burning of the fuel air mix can create very high pressures in the cylinder As a consequence stoichiometric mixtures are only used under light to low moderate load conditions For acceleration and high load conditions a richer mixture lower air fuel ratio is used to produce cooler combustion products thereby utilizing evaporative cooling and so avoid overheating of the cylinder head and thus prevent detonation br br br Engine management systems br The stoichiometric mixture for a gasoline engine is the ideal ratio of air to fuel that burns all fuel with no excess air For gasoline fuel the stoichiometric air fuel mixture is about i e for every one gram of fuel grams of air are required For pure octane fuel the oxidation reaction is br br O C H CO H O energy br Any mixture greater than is considered a lean mixture any less than is a rich mixture given perfect ideal test fuel gasoline consisting of solely n heptane and iso octane In reality most fuels consist of a combination of heptane octane a handful of other alkanes plus additives including detergents and possibly oxygenators such as MTBE methyl tert butyl ether or ethanol methanol These compounds all alter the stoichiometric ratio with most of the additives pushing the ratio downward oxygenators bring extra oxygen to the combustion event in liquid form that is released at the time of combustions for MTBE laden fuel a stoichiometric ratio can be as low as Vehicles that use an oxygen sensor or other feedback loops to control fuel to air ratio lambda control compensate automatically for this change in the fuel s stoichiometric rate by measuring the exhaust gas composition and controlling fuel volume Vehicles without such controls such as most motorcycles until recently and cars predating the mid s may have difficulties running certain fuel blends especially winter fuels used in some areas and may require different carburetor jets or otherwise have the fueling ratios altered to compensate Vehicles that use oxygen sensors can monitor the air fuel ratio with an air fuel ratio meter br br br Other types of engines br In the typical air to natural gas combustion burner a double cross limit strategy is employed to ensure ratio control This method was used in World War II The strategy involves adding the opposite flow feedback into the limiting control of the respective gas air or fuel This assures ratio control within an acceptable margin br br br Other terms used br There are other terms commonly used when discussing the mixture of air and fuel in internal combustion engines br br br Mixture br Mixture is the predominant word that appears in training texts operation manuals and maintenance manuals in the aviation world br Air fuel ratio is the ratio between the mass of air and the mass of fuel in the fuel air mix at any given moment The mass is the mass of all constituents that compose the fuel and air whether combustible or not For example a calculation of the mass of natural gas which often contains carbon dioxide CO nitrogen N and various alkanes includes the mass of the carbon dioxide nitrogen and all alkanes in determining the value of mfuel br For pure octane the stoichiometric mixture is approximately or of exactly br In naturally aspirated engines powered by octane maximum power is frequently reached at AFRs ranging from to or of to br The air fuel ratio of is considered as the maximum output ratio whereas the air fuel ratio of is considered as the maximum fuel economy ratio br br br Fuel air ratio FAR br Fuel air ratio is commonly used in the gas turbine industry as well as

makes more sense to talk about values rather than AFR br Most practical AFR devices actually measure the amount of residual oxygen for lean mixes or unburnt hydrocarbons for rich mixtures in the

ratios greater than one always mean there is more fuel in the fuel oxidizer mixture than required for complete combustion stoichiometric reaction irrespective of the fuel and oxidizer being used while ratios less than one represent a deficiency of fuel or equivalently excess oxidizer in the mixture This is not the case if one uses fuel oxidizer ratio which takes different values for different

Percent excess combustion air br In industrial fired heaters power plant steam generators and large gas fired turbines the more common terms are percent excess combustion air and percent stoichiometric air For example excess combustion air of percent means that percent more than the required stoichiometric air or percent of stoichiometric air is being used br A combustion control point can be defined by specifying the percent excess air or oxygen in the oxidant or by specifying the percent oxygen in the combustion product An air fuel ratio meter may be used to measure the percent oxygen in the combustion gas from which the percent excess oxygen can be calculated from stoichiometry and a mass balance for fuel combustion For example for propane C H combustion between
