Nitric oxide nitrogen oxide or nitrogen monoxide is a colorless gas with the formula NO It is one of the principal oxides of nitrogen Nitric oxide is a free radical it has an unpaired electron which is sometimes denoted by a dot in its chemical formula N O or NO Nitric oxide is also a heteronuclear diatomic molecule a class of molecules whose study spawned early modern theories of chemical bonding br An important intermediate in industrial chemistry nitric oxide forms in combustion systems and can be generated by lightning in thunderstorms In mammals including humans nitric oxide is a signaling molecule in many physiological and pathological processes It was proclaimed the Molecule of the Year in The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded for discovering nitric oxide s role as a cardiovascular signalling molecule br Nitric oxide should not be confused with nitrogen dioxide NO a brown gas and major air pollutant or with nitrous oxide N O an anesthetic gas br br br

Orbitals noted with an asterisk are antibonding The ordering of and according to their binding energies is subject to discussion Removal of a electron leads to states whose energies span over a range starting at a lower level than a electron an extending to a higher level This is due to the different orbital momentum couplings between a and a electron br The lone electron in the orbital makes NO a doublet X in its ground state whose degeneracy is split in the fine structure from spin orbit coupling with a total momentum J or J br br br Dipole br The dipole of NO has been measured experimentally to D and is oriented from O to N NO due to the transfer of negative electronic charge from oxygen to nitrogen br br br Reactions br br br With di and triatomic molecules br Upon condensing to a liquid nitric oxide dimerizes to dinitrogen dioxide but the association is weak and reversible The N N distance in crystalline NO is pm nearly twice the N O distance br Since the heat of formation of NO is endothermic NO can be decomposed to the elements Catalytic converters in cars exploit this reaction br br NO O N br When exposed to oxygen nitric oxide converts into nitrogen dioxide br br NO O NO br This reaction is thought to occur via the intermediates ONOO and the red compound ONOONO br In water nitric oxide reacts with oxygen to form nitrous acid HNO The reaction is thought to proceed via the following stoichiometry br br NO O H O HNO br Nitric oxide reacts with fluorine chlorine and bromine to form the nitrosyl halides such as nitrosyl chloride br br NO Cl NOCl br With NO also a radical NO combines to form the intensely blue dinitrogen trioxide br br NO NO ON NO br br br Organic chemistry br The addition of a nitric oxide moiety to another molecule is often referred to as nitrosylation The Traube reaction is the addition of a two equivalents of nitric oxide onto an enolate giving a diazeniumdiolate also called a nitrosohydroxylamine The product can undergo a subsequent retro aldol reaction giving an overall process similar to the haloform reaction For example nitric oxide reacts with acetone and an alkoxide to form a diazeniumdiolate on each position with subsequent loss of methyl acetate as a by product br br This reaction which was discovered around remains of interest in nitric oxide prodrug research Nitric oxide can also react directly with sodium methoxide ultimately forming sodium formate and nitrous oxide by way of an N methoxydiazeniumdiolate br br br Coordination complexes br br Nitric oxide reacts with transition metals to give complexes called metal nitrosyls The most common bonding mode of nitric oxide is the terminal linear type M NO Alternatively nitric oxide can serve as a one electron pseudohalide In such complexes the M N O group is characterized by an angle between and The NO group can also bridge between metal centers through the nitrogen atom in a variety of geometries br br br Production and preparation br In commercial settings nitric oxide is produced by the oxidation of ammonia at C normally at C with platinum as catalyst in the Ostwald process br br NH O NO H O br The uncatalyzed endothermic reaction of oxygen O and nitrogen N which is effected at high temperature C by lightning has not been developed into a practical commercial synthesis see Birkeland Eyde process br br N O NO br br br Laboratory methods br In the laboratory nitric oxide is conveniently generated by reduction of dilute nitric acid with copper br br HNO Cu Cu NO H O NO br An alternative route involves the reduction of nitrous acid in the form of sodium nitrite or potassium nitrite br br NaNO NaI H SO I Na SO H O NO br NaNO FeSO H SO Fe SO NaHSO H O NO br KNO KNO Cr O K CrO NO br The iron II sulfate route is simple and has been used in undergraduate laboratory experiments So called NONOate compounds are also used for nitric oxide generation br br br Detection and assay br br Nitric oxide concentration can be determined using a chemiluminescent reaction involving ozone A sample containing nitric oxide is mixed with a large quantity of ozone The nitric oxide reacts with the ozone to produce oxygen and nitrogen dioxide accompanied with emission of light chemiluminescence br br NO O NO O h br which can be measured with a photodetector The amount of light produced is proportional to the amount of nitric oxide in the sample br Other methods of testing include electroanalysis amperometric approach where NO reacts with an electrode to induce a current or voltage change The detection of NO radicals in biological tissues is particularly difficult due to the short lifetime and concentration of these radicals in tissues One of the few practical methods is spin trapping of nitric oxide with iron dithiocarbamate complexes and subsequent detection of the mono nitrosyl iron complex with electron paramagnetic resonance EPR br A group of fluorescent dye indicators that are also available in acetylated form for intracellular measurements exist The most common compound is diaminofluorescein DAF br br br Environmental effects br br br Acid rain deposition br Nitric oxide reacts with the hydroperoxyl radical HO to form nitrogen dioxide NO which then can react with a hydroxyl radical HO to produce nitric acid HNO br br NO HO NO HO br NO HO HNO br Nitric acid along with sulfuric acid contributes to acid rain deposition br br br Ozone depletion br NO participates in ozone layer depletion Nitric oxide reacts with stratospheric ozone to form O and nitrogen dioxide br br NO O NO O br This reaction is also utilized to measure concentrations of NO in control volumes br br br Precursor to NO br As seen in the acid deposition section nitric oxide can transform into nitrogen dioxide this can happen with the hydroperoxy radical HO or diatomic oxygen O Symptoms of short term nitrogen dioxide exposure include nausea dyspnea and headache Long term effects could include impaired immune and respiratory function br br br Biological functions br br NO is a gaseous signaling molecule It is a key vertebrate biological messenger playing a role in a variety of biological processes It is a bioproduct in almost all types of organisms including bacteria plants fungi and animal cells br Nitric oxide an endothelium derived relaxing factor EDRF is biosynthesized endogenously from L arginine oxygen and NADPH by various nitric oxide synthase NOS enzymes Reduction of inorganic nitrate may also make nitric oxide One of the main enzymatic targets of nitric oxide is guanylyl cyclase The binding of nitric oxide to the heme region of the enzyme leads to activation in the presence of iron Nitric oxide is highly reactive having a lifetime of a few seconds yet diffuses freely across membranes These attributes make nitric oxide ideal for a transient paracrine between adjacent cells and autocrine within a single cell signaling molecule Once nitric oxide is converted to nitrates and nitrites by oxygen and water cell signaling is deactivated br The endothelium inner lining of blood vessels uses nitric oxide to signal the surrounding smooth muscle to relax resulting in vasodilation and increasing blood flow Sildenafil Viagra is a drug that uses the nitric oxide pathway Sildenafil does not produce nitric oxide but enhances the signals that are downstream of the nitric oxide pathway by protecting cyclic guanosine monophosphate cGMP from degradation by cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type PDE in the corpus cavernosum allowing for the signal to be enhanced and thus vasodilation Another endogenous gaseous transmitter hydrogen sulfide H S works with NO to induce vasodilation and angiogenesis in a cooperative manner br Nasal breathing produces nitric oxide within the body while oral breathing does not br br br Occupational safety and health br In the U S the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA has set the legal limit permissible exposure limit for nitric oxide exposure in the workplace as ppm mg m over an hour workday The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH has set a recommended exposure limit REL of ppm mg m over an hour workday At levels of ppm nitric oxide is immediately dangerous to life and health br br br Explosion hazard br Liquid nitrogen oxide is very sensitive to detonation even in the absence of fuel and can be initiated as readily as nitroglycerin Detonation of the endothermic liquid oxide close to its b p C generated a kbar pulse and fragmented the test equipment It is the simplest molecule that is capable of detonation in all three phases The liquid oxide is sensitive and may explode during distillation and this has been the cause of industrial accidents Gaseous nitric oxide detonates at about m s but as a solid it can reach a detonation velocity of m s br br br br Notes br br Further reading br br Butler A and Nicholson R Life death and NO Cambridge ISBN br van Faassen E E Vanin A F eds Radicals
